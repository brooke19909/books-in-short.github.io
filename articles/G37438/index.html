    <p>  On the thirty-kilometer coast of Odessa along the entire coast of the Black Sea are the famous beaches of the resort city. </p><p>  From the point of view of vacationers, ‚ÄúLangeron‚Äù, which is located near the Shevchenko park, is considered one of the cleanest and most comfortable.  Near the descent to the sea there is a modest bazaar where you can buy all the necessary beach accessories or souvenirs, buy ice cream, some water or drink beer.  For children there is a mini-playground with a trampoline and a slide. </p><p>  No less popular is the beach "Joy".  It is also distinguished by cleanliness, order and the availability of a first-aid post and a rescue post.  Playground and a full range of services are paid.  It is convenient to go down to the beach by cable car, which carries its passengers absolutely free until 11.00 in the morning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Between ‚ÄúLangeron‚Äù and ‚ÄúJoy‚Äù there is a cozy, clean and uninhabited place - the beach ‚ÄúYellow Stone‚Äù.  Services there are a bit cheaper, and above the recreation area there are several tents with food and water. </p><p>  Not everyone knows that on the summer route No. 259 (this flight is canceled during the rest of the year) it is very convenient to get to Chaika beach.  There you can always rent a trestle bed or a bungalow.  On this territory there is a smoking area, a specially landscaped beach for the disabled and a free toilet. </p><p>  However, the most eventful in terms of the number of entertainments is considered to be Arcadia.  About it will be described in more detail. </p><h2>  Section 2. General description of the best recreation area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city </h2>

    <p>  Yes, indeed, there are a lot of recreation areas in South Palmyra.  How not to get confused in this variety and choose exactly what you need?  Experienced tourists say that if you are visiting a city for the first time, try to stay in an area like Arcadia.  Odessa, whose beach is quite diverse, is best opened to guests in this particular part of it. </p><p>  The above territory is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe western part of South Palmyra.  However, to argue that Arcadia (Odessa) is a beach would not be entirely correct.  In general, this is a small microdistrict, which includes both the attributes inherent in a prosperous Black Sea resort and the characteristic features of the sleeping quarter of a large city.  That is why here you can find not only expensive restaurants, bars, nightclubs and souvenir shops, but also ordinary cafes, canteens, grocery stores and even spontaneous markets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For lovers of the warm sun and the gentle sea, I would like to note that the entire coastal area here is perfectly landscaped.  Clean sifted sand, spacious dressing rooms, comfortable trestle beds and sun loungers, modern pools and attentive staff.  Also practically everywhere there is a shower and a left-luggage office. </p><h2>  Section 3. How to get to the beach </h2><p>  The beach "Arcadia", a photo of which can be found in all the tourist avenues of the city, takes several hundred meters, and there is no shortage of tourists until late autumn.  That is why I would like to draw the attention of travelers to the fact that you should come here as soon as possible.  This is especially true for those who want to settle in comfort and directly by the water. </p><p>  The traffic intersection here is very convenient.  Trolleybus number 13 runs to the coast. You can also get there by tram of the fifth route or city buses No. 195, 168 and 198. </p><p>  An electric car runs along a special health path from the Langeron beach to the Arcadia.  However, many prefer to walk along the sea. </p><p>  You can get here by taxi at any time of the day.  True, it is not cheap. </p>

    <h2>  Section 4. History of education </h2><p>  At the end of the XIX century on the site of the future Arcadia was a rocky beach, absolutely unsuitable for recreation.  The founders of the city chose this place for the resort because cliffs and steep slopes lead to the majority of Odessa beaches, and here you could get to the coastal zone by a natural gentle slope. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Belgian Emil Cambier is considered the discoverer of Arcadia, who built the first restaurant in that place.  Then the name itself appeared - "Arcadia".  Odessans named this area after one locality in Greece, where, according to the Greeks, peace reigned, idyll, happiness, peace and simplicity of manners. </p><p>  Gradually, baths began to open there, small beer halls, large new restaurants and all kinds of entertainment facilities were built. </p><p>  In 1910, the first electric tram went to Arcadia through the reconstructed French Boulevard. </p><p>  Gradually, the beach "Arcadia", the prices of which "bite" to this day, began to be built up by night clubs and new summer venues.  From year to year, the recreation area grows, thrives and continues to be popular with both the residents of the city and its guests. </p><h2>  Section 5. Arcadia today </h2>

    <p>  In 2014, the beach "Arcadia" in Odessa (the photo serves as indisputable evidence) received a new look.  A complete reconstruction of the central alley was made here.  On May 21, its grand opening took place.  Now this place has actually turned into a paradise with beautiful geometric flower beds decorated with flowers and palm trees. </p><p>  On the sides, along the alley, various shops and cafes will now be located.  Before reaching Ibiza, it is planned to open two new restaurants. </p><p>  Also along the wall on the "Arcadia" rides for kids and a <span>roller coaster</span> for extreme sports enthusiasts have already been mounted. </p><p>  It should be noted that the ‚ÄúFestival of Fountains‚Äù started on the reconstructed alley in honor of the opening of the first light and music show in Odessa and the second in Ukraine. </p><p>  By next year, it is planned to open a modern shopping center, and in 2016 the construction of a five-star hotel will be completed. </p><h2>  Section 6.

    <p>  Having visited Arcadia and walking along the central alley decorated with flower beds with palm trees and outlandish flowers, you should first of all pay attention to the amazing fountain located on the right. </p><p>  In your free time, it is recommended to visit the 4D cinema. </p><p>  Having gone to the end of the central alley, turning left and climbing the stairs, you can enjoy an overview of the entire territory.  Wonderful pictures are taken from this place, and vacationers get the so-called <span>material evidence</span> that Arcadia (Odessa) - the beach, the sea and recreation areas - this is exactly what you need for a comfortable pastime in South Palmyra. </p><p>  Such complexes as Yo-Moscow, Ibiza, Ithaka, Aura, Portofino are paid, but they are well-maintained and meet all the requirements of modern vacationers. </p><p>  Beaches "Pebble" or "On the slabs" - without additional services.  They are designed for a more modest vacation (located to the right of the alley). </p><p>  On the territory of "Arcadia" there are several nightclubs.  The most popular of them are Ibiza, Assol, Ithaka, Portofino, Aura, Western. </p><p>  You can enjoy the healing sea air while walking along the Health Path, which runs along the sea and leads from this resort area to Langeron.  At the beginning of the trail, to the left of the alley, is the entrance to the catacombs, which will also be very interesting to visit. </p><h2>  Section 7. Positive feedback from vacationers </h2>

    <p>  One big drawback in Arcadia is the highest prices in the city.  There are not so many free recreation areas, and the cost of visiting at least an elementarily ennobled place is 25-30 hryvnias (approximately 88-105 Russian rubles).  But this is far from the limit: for a tent or a tent on the shore, you can sometimes pay 500 hryvnias (or 1750 rubles) per day.  The price depends on the size and quality of the design, and on the season. </p><p>  Another inconvenience is the unfinished reconstruction of the alley leading to the sea.  Most of the pavilions have not yet been equipped, and now it is hidden by awnings.  Benches have not yet been set up along the alley, and tiles have not yet been properly laid near the central pool, which causes a few negative impressions of those who are breathing. </p><p>  Also, many are outraged that the route of the 5th tram can no longer get to Arcadia, as it was before.  But these are temporary inconveniences associated with the reconstruction of the territory. </p><p>  Gradually, the area will become more modern, neater and more comfortable. </p>
