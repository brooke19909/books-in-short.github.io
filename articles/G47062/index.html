    <h2>  Mountains in Nepal </h2><p>  Almost 90% of the state is mountains.  Here are the Himalayas, considered the highest ridges on Earth.  In Nepali, the name of this mountain system is translated as "abode of snow", and not in vain.  Snow here is a frequent occurrence and often lies year-round. </p><p>  The mountains of Nepal are one of the most beautiful.  Some are more like rocks, have sharp shapes.  They are rich in gorges in which picturesque rivers and slopes flow.  However, this divine originality is quite dangerous enough.  The weather can change at a tremendous speed, because of which more than 60 climbers once died.  There is a huge risk of a sudden earthquake that could cause an avalanche. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  People often ask which mountains in Nepal are the most beautiful.  Since there are 8 ridges, whose height reaches 8 thousand meters.  The answer to this question is quite simple, they are all peculiarly beautiful and original.  A large number of climbers dream of "conquering" these peaks. </p><p>  The highest mountain in the world is Everest.  It is located between Nepal and China, namely on their border.  Height is about 8848 meters.  Climbing it is possible only from the side of Nepal, which is why there are often many tourists here. </p><p>  The mountains of Nepal have small parks, two of them are protected by law: Annapurna Park and Sagarmatha.  In the first is Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, in the second - Everest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mountains in nepal" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/870396.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Lhotse </h2><p>  It is located in the Tibet Autonomous Region, that is, on the border of Nepal with China.  The mountain has three peaks of different heights.  They range from 8300 to 8500 meters. </p><p>  It connects to Everest thanks to the South Saddle, a pass that extends over 7,500 meters.  Some part of the mountain enters the Samarmatha park. </p><p>  Those who are most interested in the beautiful views of the mountains of Nepal should look at them from the Chukhung-ri, especially this peak allows you to enjoy plenty of great scenic spots. </p><h2>  Annapurna </h2><p>  The first mountain that man conquered.  Its height is slightly more than 8 thousand meters.  Due to acute forms it is very dangerous.  Mortality is 19%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1950, the French, deciding to conquer some of the mountains of Nepal, went to Dhaulagiri, but after some experiments, they realized that this would be impossible.  A little later, after reconnaissance, scientists decided to go to Annapurna. </p><p>  In 2015, the massif of Mount Nepal increased slightly, becoming 25 centimeters higher.  This happened due to a large earthquake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what mountains in Nepal" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/870390.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Dhaulagiri </h2><p>  The peak of Dhaulagiri was formed from limestone, which worsens the conditions for climbers. </p><p>  From the <span>Nepali language, the</span> name of the mountain is translated as "white mountain".  And that perfectly describes her.  An interesting fact: every year it increases several times, which is likely to allow it to become the highest mountain in the world in a few hundred years. </p><p>  The height of Dhaulagiri is small, only 4 thousand meters, but so far, no one has been able to conquer it. </p><p>  What mountains in Nepal will allow you to see all the beauty of the "white mountain"?  Yes, almost everything.  The state has a sufficient number of places from where Dhaulagiri is visible, clearly. </p><p>  The peculiarity of the mountain is that until the XIX century it was considered the highest point in the world, but after the advent of precision instruments and the development of the technical side, this fact was refuted. </p><p>  Although it occupies only 7th place in height, not one mountain can go around it in beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nepal's highest mountain" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/870389.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Makalu </h2><p>  The mountains in Nepal are popular, and Makalu is no exception.  It is located in the ridge Mahalangur-Himal (Himalayas) in the Tibet Autonomous Region.  It is 22 km from Everest.  Most of the expeditions, which are decided to conquer this peak, are defeated.  Unfortunately, it is so dangerous that only 30% of all comers succeed. </p><p>  The mountain itself was discovered long ago, in the middle of the XIX century.  However, attempts to develop it began closer to the 50s of the XX century.  This is due to the fact that scientists were more concerned about the highest mountains, and those that did not fit their standards remained for a long time ‚Äúin the shadows‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nepal Mount Everest" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/870386.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Everest </h2><p>  It is located in the Himalayas, in Khumbu-Himal.  It is also part of the Tibet Autonomous Region, which is located in China.  The northern peak of the mountain belongs to the DPRK.  Its height is 8848 meters. </p><p>  The shape of Everest resembles a pyramid.  The steepest slope can be called the south.  It is he who is constantly exposed, since the snow does not linger here.  The peak is formed due to sedimentation. </p><p>  In the south, Jomolungma (the second name of the mountain) is connected by the South Saddle to Lhonze.  In the north - from Changze, thanks to the North Saddle.  In the east is Kangashug.  Its massif is constantly in glaciers, the height of which reaches several kilometers. </p><p>  The climate here is very severe, like many other peaks of the state of Nepal.  <span>Mount Everest is</span> dangerous not only for its forms, but also for the strongest wind (55 m / s), as well as low temperature (-60 degrees). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount Everest" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/870385.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to Everest, Annapurna is a popular mountain.  Its height is slightly more than 8 thousand meters.  Despite the fact that it is not so high than the previous one, it is several times more dangerous.  Almost 40% of all those who wish to climb it die. </p><p>  No less famous is Kanchenjaga.  Its height is 8586 meters.  It is located on the border of two countries.  She can often be seen in the <span>paintings of Nicholas Roerich.</span> </p>
