And often the word ‚Äúfeat‚Äù is used to denote a situation that is very unusual and the behavior of an individual person in its conditions.  But what is it? </p><h2>  <span>What is a</span> feat? </h2><p>  In the dictionary, this word denotes a heroic act, which can be accomplished only by showing dedication, courage, overcoming your fear and stepping over yourself.  Sometimes the reason for the feat is love - for children, a representative of the opposite article, for the homeland, for people in general. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a feat" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/343651.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  In different eras, under the deed meant different actions.  For example, the ancient hero Hercules destroyed various monsters, performed the most incredible actions.  But can now be called a feat the cleansing of the stable, the theft of a belt from the Queen of the Amazons or <span>golden apples</span> in the Garden of Eden?  Moreover, he committed these acts only on the orders of his king.  But, of course, he <span>overcame obstacles,</span> was in danger, saved the lives of people.  Without superhuman abilities, enormous power, he could not do this.  Therefore, the question of what is a feat, we can safely say that <span>this is an act of</span> not quite an ordinary person. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Heroes are different </h2><p>  If in the <span>ancient world</span> heroes became exclusively by birthright (as a rule, these were people with a divine origin), then in modern society every person can become one.  The extraordinary behavior caused by following a higher goal is common to all.  But just what can be considered such a goal for the sake of which it is not a pity to give one's life?  In any culture, throughout all centuries, the salvation of human life was considered such.  Especially if danger hung over the weaker - a child, a cripple, an elderly person. </p><p>  But also exploits vary depending on external circumstances.  Indeed, if a person steps over himself to save a large number of other people, then this is undoubtedly a feat.  If during a war a fighter tries to take the lives of as many enemies as possible with his death, then this is also a feat, but of a different nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="feat of the people" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/343652.jpg" width="408"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Feat of the people: what is it? </h2><p>  If everything is clear with the feat of an individual, then what is meant by the heroism of an entire nation?  If in a few words, then this is a mass phenomenon in an extraordinary situation, most often during hostilities.  For example, take the Great Patriotic War, when representatives of different nations thought not only about themselves and their relatives, but also about civilians who defended the rear.  Undoubtedly, during the years of the battle for their freedom, the independence of the nation, the heroes were not only on the battlefield.  Ordinary people (women, old people, children) supplied the army with food, treated and sheltered the wounded, hid the persecuted from the enemy army, took care of their households, and morally supported the soldiers.  And thanks to this they managed to win a great victory in a difficult war.  Therefore, the question of what is a feat, it is difficult to give a definite answer.  Cases are different. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2></h2><h2>  Feats of Modernity </h2><p>  What can be considered heroism today when peace reigns on Earth to a greater extent, and bloody wars, fortunately, have remained in history?  Even in our time, great feats take place.  Every day, EMERCOM employees, fulfilling their professional duties, save lives.  How many stories can be heard about how a neighbor, friend, or just a passerby brought a child in his arms from a flaming house?  Isn‚Äôt the hero a KamAZ driver who deliberately turned off the bridge to avoid a collision with a school bus? </p><p>  So what is a feat, <span>who is a hero?</span>  We can definitely answer that they are not born, but become.  But the psychology of heroism is not yet fully understood today.  After all, no one will be able to recreate in laboratory conditions a situation where there is a real threat to human life.  But nevertheless, heroism can be physical (when a person‚Äôs life or health is at risk), moral (when a person runs counter to generally accepted norms and rules) and vital (when a person overcomes his own phobias, shortcomings, dependencies). </p>
