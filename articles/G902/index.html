    <p>  In the evenings, the hotel offers an animation program and live music.  However, you should not expect that the hotel has an animation team that will entertain guests throughout the day, as is customary in Turkey or Tunisia.  If you have chosen Protaras, Windmills Hotel Apts 4 * as your vacation destination, then you should understand that there is a minimal set of entertainment here, as in any normal hotel.  But in your free time you can independently find interesting activities for yourself.  Although this can help you at the hotel reception.  Local guides are always present here, organizing all kinds of excursions around the island. </p><p>  However, having studied in detail the list of ‚Äúmast si‚Äù local attractions, you will be able to travel around them yourself. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  The sea and the beach - this is why tourists annually massively go on vacation to Cyprus in Protaras.  Windmills Hotel Apts 4 * (reviews about the complex will help you make the choice) has a good location relative to the coast.  And as you know, this is one of the main issues of interest to tourists.  According to different versions, the distance from the hotel to the beach is from 300 to 500 meters.  The complex is located on the first line, but it takes about five minutes to go to the coast.  Near the hotel there are a sufficient number of beaches, which one to choose is difficult to say.  All of them are equally good, have excellent sand cover, shallow gentle approach.  It is incredibly convenient to relax with children.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are paid on the entire coast, but in general you can not use them, however, the sun is very active, the skin quickly burns. </p><p>  Protaras is good because its entire coast is sandy.  The resort itself is surrounded by beautiful cliffs and is located in the bay.  Therefore, it is always warm and calm here.  Even in winter (January), the temperature does not fall below +17 degrees, and in the summer, the thermometer can rise to +30 degrees, and the water warms up to +23.  The season lasts from April to October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="windmills hotel apts 4 protaras" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1565406.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In spring, shrubs bloom along the entire coast, which is why the entire embankment simply transforms and becomes like a fairytale alley, which is nice to walk along, enjoying the beauty. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  Cyprus abounds with beautiful resorts, but Protaras is an amazing, paradise place.  The town became popular due to its beautiful sandy beaches and rocky bays.  The resort has built an incredible number of different hotels that are focused on family vacations.  The advantages of Protaras can also be attributed to its proximity to Ayia Napa, famous for its entertainment industry.  But at the same time Protaras itself is a very calm and quiet place for a good holiday. </p><p>  The town stretches along <span>Fig</span> Bay <span>.</span>  The resort began to develop actively only in the last thirty years of the twentieth century.  Since then, much has changed in Protaras, and at present it is one of the main tourist regions not only in the southeast of the island, but throughout Cyprus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="windmills hotel 4 protaras" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1565408.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous bay has the best beaches on the coast.  Here you can spend days without leaving warm and clear water, basking in the smallest sand, enjoying the beauty of the Mediterranean.  In Protaras, along the sea you can walk endlessly while admiring the water.  Numerous restaurants, cafes and shops were gradually built along the promenade.  Protaras is not an ordinary resort.  It is distinguished from other cities of the island by a certain leisurely and calm atmosphere.  Although the tourist infrastructure has been developing rapidly lately, the natural idyll is still preserved.  It is because of this that the Cypriots themselves value Protaras. </p><p>  Nevertheless, in the evenings, the city dresses in bright lights and comes to life: fashionable melodies are heard everywhere, clubs and discos, restaurants with live music work. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel? </h2><p>  The most convenient way to get to Protaras is from Ayia Napa, since the town is located only ten kilometers away.  You can use a taxi, it will cost inexpensively.  Suburban minibuses and municipal buses also run along the route. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  In Protaras, life is slow and steady.  This is the charm of the resort.  It sets vacationers to complete relaxation and relaxation away from city problems.  There are not as many historical sights as in other cities in Cyprus, but still several interesting places can be found.  Tourists, for example, can visit the "castles" on Cape Greco, carved in the rocks by the surf.  Any person who sees them live simply refuses to believe that this is not the creation of human hands, but simply miracles of nature. </p><p>  White <span>windmills are</span> noteworthy.  Once they served to irrigate the lands of nearby villages.  Now they have more aesthetic value. </p><p>  Tourists will also be interested in visiting the church of St. Elias, built on a rock.  In the evening after <span>sunset, the</span> building is transformed by lights of illumination.  In addition, a spectacular view of the whole city opens from the cliff; everyone is interested in taking very beautiful photographs in memory of the rest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="windmills hotel apts 4 cyprus protaras reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1565411.jpg" width="600"></div>
