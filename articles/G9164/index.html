  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern self-service devices: what is the difference between a terminal and an ATM?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In our modern age, it is difficult to find a person who would never use such self-service devices as an ATM or payment terminal in his life.  We all withdraw cash from cards, replenish them, pay for any services, make transfers, and so on.  For certain purposes, different means of self-service are needed, because their functionality varies.  You should understand how the ATM differs from the terminal. </p><h2>  What is an ATM? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pio.cl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM service" class="if uuid-2562862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562862.jpg"></div><p>  To begin with, we will determine what an ATM is and what functionality it has.  Of course, time does not stand still, like technology, and modern self-service devices differ from those that were released two or three years ago, as well as among themselves, depending on their belonging to a particular bank. </p><p>  So, an ATM (ATM) is a special automated equipment equipped with software designed to perform operations related to cash and plastic cards. </p><p>  In order to understand the difference between an ATM and a terminal, consider its main functions: </p><ol><li>  Cash withdrawal from a bank card. </li><li>  Obtaining information on the amount of funds in the account by requesting a balance or generating an extract </li><li>  Top-up by cash. </li><li>  Transfer funds from card to card. </li><li>  Acceptance of any payments, for example, payment for mobile communications, utility bills, etc. </li><li>  Obtaining the identification data required for registration in online banking. </li><li>  Application for any banking products, viewing personalized offers from the bank. </li></ol><p>  In short, the main functions of an ATM are the receipt / issue of cash from a card, by the mandatory introduction of a PIN code. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is a payment terminal? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sfour.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Terminals" class="if uuid-2562915" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562915.jpg"></div><p>  This type of self-service device is divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  billing </li><li>  information and payment. </li></ul><p>  To understand how an ATM differs from a terminal, we will determine what the latter is.  And also what functions it possesses. </p><p>  A terminal is a specialized self-service device equipped with software, through which payments are made in favor of legal entities by cash deposits. </p><p>  Main functions: </p><ul><li>  accepting cash to replenish a bank card; </li><li>  repayment of loans; </li><li>  acceptance of funds for payment transactions; </li><li>  payment for services (cellular communications, utility bills, taxes, fines), etc. </li><li>  cash replenishment of electronic wallets. </li></ul><p>  In short, the main function of payment terminals is to receive funds to replenish the card or to make payments in favor of legal entities.  In addition to this, the self-service information and payment device provides reference services (for example, requesting a card balance, connecting SMS-informing). </p><h2>  Comparative analysis </h2><div class="photo" data-original="doodleart.top" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Variety of ATMs" class="if uuid-2562868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562868.jpg"></div><p>  So all the same, what is the difference between an ATM and a payment terminal? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having considered their definitions and functions, we come to the following conclusions. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>  <strong>ATM</strong> </p></td><td>  <strong>Payment terminal</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Cash withdrawal </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Very rarely </td></tr><tr><td>  Cash Acceptance </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Owner </td><td>  Only bank </td><td>  Bank, legal entity / individual entrepreneur </td></tr><tr><td>  The presence of a touch keyboard </td><td>  More often than not </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Payments in favor of legal  of persons </td><td style="vertical-align: middle;"><p>  There is, but not at all, a relatively small base of legal entities.  of persons </p></td><td>  There is a very expanded base of legal entities.  of persons </td></tr><tr><td>  The need to use a bank card </td><td style="vertical-align: middle;"><p>  Yes, with mandatory authorization, by entering a secret PIN code </p></td><td>  Only in bank terminals for certain card transactions </td></tr><tr><td>  Appearance, dimensions </td><td style="vertical-align: middle;"><p>  Impressive size, because boxes are needed to store large amounts of cash (for receiving / issuing);  Mandatory tabs on the sides of the keyboard, for the safety of entering a PIN code </p></td><td><p>  Small, on-screen keyboard </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  It should be noted that the bulk of the payment (information and payment) terminals belonging to the banking sector is accounted for by Sberbank.  This bank has been issuing them for a long time and today it boasts a variety of features and an extensive menu of self-service devices. </p><p>  But what is the difference between an ATM and a Sberbank terminal? </p><p>  The question arises precisely because this particular bank has the largest number of self-service devices (in comparison with other similar institutions). </p><p>  Basically, the differences are the same as those discussed above.  That is: not all ATMs accept money, but absolutely all of them give out, and the terminals, on the contrary, are always ready to save you cash, but they will not give it back to you.  That is why self-service devices are so different in appearance.  Below in the photo the difference between an ATM and a Sberbank terminal is clearly visible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.russia-ic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATMs and terminals" class="if uuid-2562880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88954/2562880.jpg"></div><p>  On the left are two ATMs, they are more impressive in size than the terminals shown in the photo on the right.  It is also easy to guess that ATMs are protected and much more meet security requirements than terminals. </p><h2>  About POS-terminals </h2><p>  Speaking about the differences between self-service devices, one cannot but touch upon this ‚Äúmanual‚Äù device. </p><p>  A POS terminal is a special device that fits in your pocket and is used at retail outlets at the cashier‚Äôs counter for cashless payments for purchases.  After spending, inserting or simply attaching a bank card to this terminal, and then (if necessary) entering a PIN code, the buyer agrees to write off funds from his account in favor of the store and purchases a product or service. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that modern self-service devices are very convenient, fast and simple, because you do not need to stand in lines, come to the bank office strictly during the hours of its operation, as a result of which the most precious thing that a person has is time.  And now it is known how the terminal differs from an ATM.  However, we repeat the main symptom: the first does not give out cash. </p>
