  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Photographer Svetlana Loginova: your soul through its lens</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For many, a photo shoot is a special ritual.  When we come to the photographer, we entrust ourselves to him completely.  We share our emotions with him, suppress embarrassment and complexes.  And how important it is that this trust be justified, that the result will please us.  That is why you need to carefully choose a photographer. </p><h2>  A snapshot of the inner world through body language and emotions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.denverlibrary.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera for shooting" class="if uuid-3025586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110914/3025586.jpg"></div><p>  The bend of our body, each wrinkle on our face, the gleam in our eyes is what reveals the inner world.  It is very important that it is this genuine beauty that the photographer captures in his works. </p><p>  Svetlana Loginova is exactly the professional who knows how not only to see, but also to transmit.  Her forte is portraiture.  It can be a family, individual or photo session of the expectant mother.  Photos with pregnant women are especially touching and gentle. </p><p>  Svetlana Loginova is able to liberate and create such an atmosphere during the process that no model will feel constrained.  This is a real flight of creativity and beauty.  Even the most insecure women in the lens of Svetlana Loginova turn into beautiful and sophisticated ladies or, conversely, into bright and daring beauties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Loginova‚Äôs talent lies in the ability to consider those wonderful aspects of a person that he himself can not see.  A photo session with Svetlana is a therapy for the soul, a panacea for complexes and stupid fears. </p><p>  Photographer, he is like a doctor.  Only heals souls.  And photography is like a unique tablet.  If you need a real, lively and talking portrait, then make the right choice. </p><h2>  Lively and vivid emotions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="loginovasvetlana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The work of Svetlana Loginova" class="if uuid-3025583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110914/3025583.jpg"></div><p>  Many photographers say they love lively, genuine emotions.  Weddings, birthdays and other celebrations need to be captured not according to a pre-conceived scenario.  Therefore - no posing. </p><p>  However, very often such big words end with ridiculous photos with crooked smiles and faces that you don‚Äôt want to look at. </p><p>  Surprisingly, in the photo of Svetlana, emotions are always beautiful.  Touching smiles, tears of happiness, sweet hugs.  Such photos will want to be reviewed again and again.  None of the guests will be ashamed or uncomfortable.  This memory will want to be stored. </p><p>  Every spark of eyes, every sincere smile, graceful movement, every lock of hair will be caught by Svetlana Loginova in the camera lens and will stay with you forever. </p><p>  Tenderness, bright sadness, joy and fun.  All this can be stylish and beautiful.  This is exactly how these emotions will be conveyed by Svetlana Loginova. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to understand that this is exactly the person who should photograph you, you can visit her official website or find a girl on social networks.  There are examples of Svetlana Loginova‚Äôs works, reviews and contacts. </p><h2>  Photos always up to date </h2><div class="photo" data-original="vk.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://vk.com/fotograf_svetlana"><img itemprop="image" alt="Shooting Svetlana Loginova" class="if uuid-3025589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110914/3025589.jpg"></div><p>  Another feature of Svetlana's work is that she does not change the color of photographs to those that are now in fashion.  Her many years of experience allows us to do only the necessary high-quality processing, without changing everything beyond recognition.  She does not need to change all tones from green to orange or vice versa to show the atmosphere. </p><p>  Svetlana also knows how to work with natural lighting, which makes her pictures more natural.  The style in which a model turns into a stone statue without emotion is not hers. </p><p>  If you show the pictures to your children or grandchildren, they will still understand them.  They will see your true beauty, thoughts, emotions.  The color, light, and surroundings will be as clear as they were 30 years later, unlike over-processed photographs, in which everything changes. </p><h2>  To make sure - you have to try </h2><p>  In the works of Svetlana, it is easy to notice skill and talent.  In order to be convinced of this, you just need to attend a photo shoot and look at yourself with different eyes.  She will show your beauty in the language of photography, because the camera does not deceive.  You only need to be able to handle it. </p>
