    <h2>  Traces of ancient civilization </h2><p>  Tourists coming here are inspired by the amazing technological power that created the city of <span>ancient civilization.</span>  Teotihuacan consisted of thousands of residential complexes, as well as several pyramid temples that can be compared with the largest Egyptian pyramids.  The ancient city was built and subsequently abandoned.  This happened long before the Aztecs arrived in central Mexico.  The Aztecs, struck by what they saw, called this city Teotihuacan, which means "divine place."  They believed that here the gods created the universe.  This archaeological site is today the most visited in Mexico.  Numerous tourists flock here to see the UNESCO World Heritage Monument with their own eyes. </p><h2>  Where can I see the pyramids? </h2><p>  The word "pyramid" for most people is associated with Egyptian ancient monuments.  In fact, ancient cultures on almost all continents built triangular monuments in a certain historical period.  Important relics of a mysterious extinct culture are the pyramids located in the city of Teotihuacan.  The largest of them is the pyramid of the Sun.  In Mexico, you will not find anywhere else the buildings of this era of such magnitude and grandeur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A few facts from the history of Teotihuacan </h2><p>  Around the 1st century.  BC.  The development of Teotihuacan began.  The most active phase of construction and expansion took place until 450 AD.  This important economic and religious center of pre-Columbian America was inhabited by approximately 125 thousand inhabitants (200 thousand, according to some estimates).  At its peak, it covered an area of ‚Äã‚Äã23 square meters.  km and was the largest city in that period in the world. </p><p>  Teotihuacan gained political and economic weight thanks in large part to the obsidian trade.  In the history of mankind, this stone played a prominent role.  During this period, the Indians inhabiting pre-Columbian America did not know how to melt iron.  They made weapons, tools, jewelry from obsidian. </p><p>  Teotihuacan, oddly enough, in the presence of large pyramids did not have any <span>defensive structures</span> at all <span>.</span>  Scientists, however, argue that its cultural and military influence has spread to many regions of Central America. </p><h2>  Riddles of Teotihuacan </h2>

    <p>  The origin of this ancient city remains a mystery.  It raises many questions: where did the locals come from, what language did they speak, why did they leave this place around 700?  Various hypotheses have been put forward by archaeologists about the causes of the death of this civilization, from its enslavement by warlike neighbors to the depletion of various resources that this civilization needs to survive.  From the once huge huge city today, 3 large and several small pyramids, some houses of the nobility, sacrificial altars have been preserved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The monumental painting of Teotihuacan </h2><p>  Ancient builders decorated their monuments with painting and covered with plaster.  The test of time passed the pyramids of Teotihuacan themselves, but not their plaster and painting.  It is believed that the murals performed on the sides of the monuments included images of snakes, stars, and jaguars.  It should be noted the highest level of skill that reached the monumental painting of Teotihuacan in Central America. </p><h2>  Mystical energy of the city </h2><p>  Teotihuacan after the decline turned into a place where noble Aztecs came for pilgrimage.  Today it continues to be an important pilgrimage center: thousands of believers come here every year to celebrate the <span>vernal equinox here,</span> as well as plunge into the mystical energy emanating from the ruins of Teotihuacan.  On the pyramids you can spend the whole day wandering among these works of architecture.  Pyramids - a window into the world of ancient Mexico.

    <p>  In Central America and Mexico, new temples are usually built on the remains of the previous ones.  Therefore, the pyramid of the Sun was erected on the remains of ancient buildings until it reached its present size.  Most likely, the construction was completed in the 1st century.  AD, and 300 years later they built a temple on the top.  It completely collapsed by the time the Spaniards discovered Teotihuacan, and the pyramid, covered with trees and shrubs, turned into a mass of rubble. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Pyramid of the Sun is the third largest ancient structure in the world after the Cholula pyramid in Mexico and the Giza pyramids in Egypt.  The perimeter of its base is 893 meters.  This is almost as much as the <span>pyramid of Cheops.</span>  But its height (71 m), this structure is half as low as its counterpart in Egypt.  The pyramid was erected from 3 million tons of stone.  No wheels, <span>pack animals,</span> or metal tools were used.  Despite the fact that it was not built as a tomb for the ruler, tunnels dug artificially were found at a depth of 6 m from its surface.  Their archaeologists consider the builders of Teotihuacan spiritually significant.  In religious and political life, this pyramid played an important role. </p><p>  Huge crowds of tourists during the <span>vernal equinox</span> visit Teotihuacan.  They climb the steps of this pyramid and with open arms turn to face the Sun.  There are many interpretations of this tradition, however, most participants believe that at this moment the divine energy within it is released.  Many visitors say that they feel at this moment a sense of peace and harmony with the world. </p><h2>  Pyramid of the moon </h2>

    <p>  In the northern part of Teotihuacan is the second largest ancient pyramid.  It is built on a small hill.  In height, it looks almost the same as the pyramid of the Sun, but in fact it is 29 m lower.  The same beautiful panorama opens from its top, as well as from the top of its neighbor.  Excavations made at the foot of the structure revealed the remains of sacrificed animals, as well as tombs with stone artifacts.  Visitors can climb the moon pyramid and from here enjoy the view of the city along the "Walk of the Dead." </p><h2>  Citadel, Temple of the Feathered Serpent </h2><p>  The square, which the Spaniards called the Citadel, is located in the center of Teotihuacan.  Here, it is believed, were the homes of the elite and the residence of the supreme ruler of this city.  The huge square was not really a fortress, although the appearance of the defensive structure was created by impressive walls, each of which was 390 m long. The Temple of the Feathered Serpent is the central element of the Citadel.  It was built in the form of a pyramid, which was once decorated with complex carved ornaments in the form of the heads of feathered snakes, partially preserved on the western side.  This temple is also known for the numerous burials of animals sacrificed, which were discovered within its walls. </p><h2>  Useful tips for tourists </h2>

    <p>  The Pyramid of the Sun (it is located, as we found out, in Teotihuacan) is the third largest such structure in the world.  However, this is the highest pyramid in the world, to the top of which you can climb.  In order to do this, 248 steps must be overcome.  And now you are already standing on the spot where the main priests of the ancient Aztec civilization climbed, and under your feet is the ancient pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan.  A beautiful panoramic view of the city opens from its top.  And the pyramid of the moon is a place from which you can admire the "Alley of the Dead."  This alley divides the ancient city into two parts.  It got its name from the Aztecs, who took the small temples on both sides of the avenue for the tombs of the kings.  Scientists have now established that these were ceremonial platforms crowned with temples. </p>

    <p>  The archaeological complex occupies a vast place, here you will have to walk a lot, climb the ancient pyramids.  Therefore, you should take care of water, sandwiches, a hat, sunscreen and good athletic sneakers. </p><p>  First climb the pyramids, and then go through the entire complex.  If you decide to visit it in the early morning, take beautiful photos from its top;  and crowds of other visitors going down and going up will not bother you. </p><p>  Teotihuacan, unfortunately, is very commercialized today.  Try to come here on <span>weekdays</span> and early to avoid a large flow of tourists and enjoy the ancient pyramids to the fullest.  Visitor groups with local salespeople appear here later. </p>

    <p>  Local businessmen in the complex are constantly approaching tourists, trying to sell them various trinkets, which is sometimes annoying.  It will be unusual for you if you have never been to Mexico before.  Sometimes these people can be very persistent and aggressive.  You just do not need to look into their eyes, or tell them: "No, gracias" - and they will lag behind you.  Vendors mainly sell silver products that are cheap in Mexico, as well as Aztec flutes. </p><p>  Local merchants offer snacks and drinks at Teotihuacan.  However, many tourists take sandwiches with them.  Almost any restaurant or hotel in Mexico City can prepare a dry breakfast for you. </p><p>  Every day from 7 to 17 open to visit the ruins of Teotihuacan (Mexico).  There are other local attractions on the map that you can buy in the Mexico City area.  Entrance to the complex is paid.  An additional fee is also charged for using the camcorder. </p><p>  If you have a car, you can drive freely around the perimeter, provided that you are heading to one of the local restaurants or staying at a local hotel.  Otherwise, the police may prohibit this. </p>
