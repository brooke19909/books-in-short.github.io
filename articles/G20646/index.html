    <p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe complex is 103,500 square meters, which is very modest for the capital.

These are Topshop and H&amp;M, Uniqlo and Zara. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Atrium shopping center, as a rule, lease agreements are signed immediately for five years.
