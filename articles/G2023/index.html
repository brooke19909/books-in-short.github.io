So I want a lot of beautiful and comfortable outfits to feel comfortable on hot days.  But a large number of new clothes will hit the wallet hard.  What to do?  The solution is very simple.  You need to know <span>how to sew a transformer dress.</span> </p><p>  Having made only one model, you will receive up to 10 options for wearing it.  Transformer dresses have won the great love of women in all corners of the world and are very popular.  Easy to manufacture, made of soft flowing fabrics, they will decorate your figure not only on a summer day, but also perfect for a celebration or publication. </p><p>  We will consider several options for how to sew a transformer dress.  Let's start with the simplest.  We need a piece of light, well- <span>draped fabric.</span>  The size of the cut will depend on your measurements and the desired length of the product.  With a hip circumference of 100 centimeters and a length of the finished dress from the armpits of 75 centimeters, we need a piece with dimensions 130x90 centimeters. </p><p>  We cut off a strip of five centimeters from the fabric along the entire length.  We sew a cord from it.  We process all the edges of our cut on the overlock.  We bend the top by five centimeters and stab with pins.  We wrap the fabric around us, placing it under the armpits, and measure the distance from the top of the dress to the point of the solar plexus.  Fold the cut face inward and sew the seam to the mark.  We iron it in different directions and lay a decorative line on an un sewn section, retreating from the edge by 0.5-0.7 centimeters. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the bent edge of the top, we lay two lines, at a distance of 1.5 centimeters from the top edge and each other.  We get a drawstring into which we insert a pre-prepared cord.  We hem the hem and get a transformer dress.  Sewing it is very simple and quick, and there are many options for the finished dress.  We put on the finished dress with the seam forward, we collect it on the cord to the desired size and place the cord on the back crosswise, tying it under the chest.  Using various options for tying the cord, you can get different patterns. </p><p>  Before sewing a transformer dress according to the second option, you need to choose a fabric that will not only drape well, but also stretch perfectly.  For this, any knitwear is suitable.  We will need two pieces of fabric.  One will go to the skirt, the second to the bodice of the dress.  To start, we sew a <span>skirt on an elastic band.</span>  A piece of fabric should be wide enough to make beautiful creases.  Sew the side seam.  We process the hem with an overlock or hem it.  We bend the top of the skirt and sew one centimeter from the fold.  We insert the gum and sew its edges.  The bottom of our dress is ready. </p><p>  For the top you will need two strips of knitwear, a width of 20 centimeters and a length of at least 2.5 meters.  We process the edges of the strips using an overlock.  We lay out the skirt on the table and sew our stripes to its upper edge so that their inner edges are butt.  We put on a skirt, placing the elastic at the waist, and stripes on the chest.  We tie the ends around the neck, then twist from them a cord of such a length that it reaches the waist.  After that, we disconnect the ends and tie them around the waist.  We get a dress with an open back and a long skirt. </p><p>  Putting on a skirt so that the elastic is located under the chest and wrapping the stripes in any way, we get a short dress.  Dressing her like a sundress and wrapping stripes several times around her chest, you will get a tunic.  And putting a skirt on your waist and using stripes instead of a belt - you will get a long skirt.  From this model, you can make a large number of different options for clothing that will decorate your figure, will be convenient and diversify your wardrobe.  Such clothing will especially help tourists.  Indeed, for one item does not need a lot of space in a suitcase.  Therefore, before the holidays, be sure to find out how to sew a transformer dress and make for yourself a pair of multi-colored models. </p>
