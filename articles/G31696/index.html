For the absence or expired date of insurance, large fines are prescribed in the legislation of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  For those who do not have the ability or desire to visit the office to arrange insurance, there is the opportunity to do this via the Internet.  Currently, almost all insurance companies offer their clients this opportunity.  It is very convenient, fast and costs much cheaper than a regular paper policy issued in the office. </p><p>  Now e-MTPL reviews collects numerous.  So far, many car owners are confused by this method of insurance.  They prefer to draw out CTP in the old fashioned way.  At the same time, they overpay quite significantly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic osago reviews" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675362.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Annually, according to statistics, about 42 million citizens acquire an insurance policy.  As practice shows, the position of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance today does not allow to fully cover the insurance of its clients.  Because of this, applications are increasingly being filed with the courts, and some people simply compensate for their damage from their own funds, believing that it makes absolutely no sense to sue.  Naturally, such people leave comments on the Internet about the insolvency of companies.  The situation in the insurance market remains controversial. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is an insurance policy? </h2><p>  What are the collected <span>insurance policies? CTP reviews?</span>  This question interests many. </p><p>  <span>Compulsory motor third party liability insurance</span> begins its history from the 20s of the last century. </p><p>  Initially, such a policy was introduced in the United States, but after a few years (by the 40s) it became widespread throughout Europe.  It was intended for financial guarantees of damages in case of accidents on the roads. </p><p>  In Russia, CTP finally took shape much later.  The Soviet authorities considered introducing insurance compensation for accidents on the roads, but considered it necessary to postpone it.  Only on July 1, 2003, Federal Law No. 40- On Compulsory Third Party Liability Insurance of Vehicle Owners entered into force.  Now, the car owners of our country have certain guarantees in case of traffic accidents that have caused damage to the insured property. </p><h2>  What is the difference? </h2><p>  What is electronic CTP?  The reviews are mostly positive.  More on this below. </p><p>  Compulsory insurance is considered one of the guarantors of safe road traffic, as drivers are more attentive to the rules.  However, there are also drivers who, on the contrary, behave more irresponsibly, relying entirely on insurance.  Previously, you could insure your motor civil liability only by contacting the office.  In this case, I would have to wait a long time in line. </p><p>  Recently, it became possible to issue electronic CTP, reviews confirm this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electronic osago rosgosstrakh reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675363.jpg" width="600"></div>

E-insurance means that the car owner is included in a single database.  If necessary, he will be provided with the same services in an accident as a driver with a paper copy.  All coefficients remain in the database, as a result, the driver will be able to receive a discount for new insurance for driving without accidents.  And vice versa, if the driver often gets into traffic accidents, this will necessarily be reflected in the database. </p><h2>  Insurance rates for electronic CTP </h2><p>  Insurance compensations provide for their tariffs, which are officially set from the moment of introduction of compulsory insurance in our country.  In the future, this law has changed slightly by making some amendments, but the main base remains unchanged to this day. </p><p>  The basic rate of a tariff depends primarily on the type of vehicle (motorcycle, passenger car, tram, bus, etc.).  It forms the basis of each of the tariffs, and is further multiplied by coefficients that depend on many points. </p><p>  These points are provided by e-insurance.  Reviews about this are available. </p><p>  Factors affecting the cost of insurance: </p><p>  - car engine volume; </p><p>  - region of residence (or registration) of the car owner; </p><p>  - the number of owners of the insured vehicle; </p><p>  - the length of service of the driver for whom the CTP policy is issued; </p><p>  - The region in which the office of the insurance company is located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="osago electronic policies reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675365.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Thus, the higher your experience and the smaller the volume of the engine of the vehicle that is owned, the lower the cost of insurance. </p><p>  Experienced analysts foresee the increase in the base rate of tariffs soon, which will significantly raise the direct price of insurance.  A distinctive feature of an electronic policy is its lower cost in comparison with a paper policy. </p><h2>  The procedure for obtaining electronic insurance </h2><p>  Electronic CTP (reviews confirm this) is simple to issue: </p><p>  - on the official website of the insurance company you need to fill out an application; </p><p>  - an individual can sign the form through SNILS; </p><p>  - pay the insurance premium in any convenient way. </p><p>  It is important to understand that this type of insurance is entitled to issue only officially registered companies.  A broker, agent, any intermediary will not be able to do this. </p><p>  If everything is done correctly, after a while, an email with an attached policy will come to your email.  It must be printed and carried with you.  This is how the CTP insurance policy is drawn up.  Reviews can be found on the web. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="osago vos electronic policy reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675366.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fraud in this area is not uncommon.  In order to verify the authenticity of the policy, you can verify its number in the SAR.  The name of the insurance company is also verified. </p><p>  An electronic policy looks the same as conventional insurance.  Even the color scheme is preserved. </p><h2>  Major insurance changes in 2017 </h2><p>  New amendments in the field of OSAGO were officially published at the end of August 2016.  Presumably, by July 2017, they will come into force.  Car owners should pay attention to the following changes: </p><ul><li>  The usual payment of compensation will now be difficult.  First of all, the insurance company will give directions to the service station for free car repair. </li></ul><ul><li>  The limit on the Euro protocol in case of an accident has been increased to 100,000 rubles (in the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg to 400,000 rubles).  This already provides for an electronic insurance policy of VSK (reviews are available). </li></ul><ul><li>  There will be a ban on collecting additional payments from pedestrians guilty of an accident, who were injured in an accident. </li></ul><ul><li>  It will be possible to receive personal data from the <span>RSA</span> database <span>(Russian Union of Auto Insurers)</span> without requesting an insurance company.  In this regard, electronic insurance is becoming more popular.  After all, you can issue a policy without leaving your home. </li></ul><p>  Another change that will be necessary for car owners will be the new principle of calculating the KBM.  It will be assigned individually. </p><h2>  Positive innovations of OSAGO </h2><p>  So, here is a list of positive innovations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="osago e-insurance reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <ul><li>  Registration of CTP in electronic form (reviews are mostly good). </li></ul><ul><li>  The ability to increase the MSC without reference to the vehicle. </li></ul><ul><li>  Making group insurance will be easier. </li><li>  Recalculation of MSC upon the introduction of amendments to the fundamental law will become annual.  Previously, it was made only after the expiration of the contract. </li></ul><h2>  Electronic insurance policy of UralSib </h2><p>  The reviews confirm that you can buy an electronic insurance policy from this insurance company.  Uralsib has established itself as a stable organization.  Therefore, CTP policies issued here are popular.  The company‚Äôs payouts for various insurance are huge.  Satisfied customers as a result have no reason to go to court. </p><p>  MTPL insurance can be issued when visiting the office or via the Internet.  The second option is becoming preferable.  This is due to the fact that there is no need to wait in lines, get through traffic jams. </p><p>  In order to get an electronic version of OSAGO insurance, you need to go to the official website of Uralsib.  There is a special section "Online Insurance".  You will need to first use an electronic calculator to calculate the amount of insurance premium. </p><p>  You need to get a password to the email account to enter your personal account. </p><p>  The policyholder shall enter information about himself and the car in special columns. </p><p>  What kind of information can this be? </p><p>  - Passport of the car owner. </p><p>  - The passport of the insured, because it can be different persons. </p><p>  - Certificate of registration of a car or Title. </p><p>  - All driving licenses of those persons who will be allowed to drive the vehicle. </p><p>  - Diagnostic card confirming the fact that the car is in good condition.  Accordingly, the card should be relevant. </p><p>  These are all required documents.  You also need to decide whether the client wants to purchase limited or unlimited insurance for how long. </p><p>  After all the information is entered, you can proceed to payment.  It is most convenient to make it with a bank card.  After only a few minutes, the policy will be sent to the e-mail specified at registration. </p><h2>  Electronic insurance CTP ‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù </h2><p>  The reviews confirm that Rosgosstrakh is the undisputed leader in the insurance market.  This is due to the fact that it has existed for a long time and inspires confidence in many people.  This organization also has the opportunity to purchase an electronic policy. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="osago electronically reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675371.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In order to issue an electronic CTP ‚ÄúRosgosstrakh‚Äù (reviews confirm this) it is necessary: </p><p>  - go to the official website of rgs.ru; </p><p>  - find a <span>calculator for calculating the</span> cost of an electronic policy; </p><p>  - fill in the necessary columns; </p><p>  - wait.  The system will check the data with the PCA and give the final price of insurance.  After which it will be possible to enter your personal account, where you can pay for electronic CTP.  Rosgosstrakh (reviews available) is credible. </p><p>  When filling out the data you need to be extremely careful.  All information will be checked against a common database.  Also, this information fully affects the calculation of the KBM and, accordingly, the cost of insurance. </p><p>  After the payment is made, you can wait for the email. </p><p>  The question often arises: is it necessary to print out the policy.  This is still necessary, since the traffic police have no opportunity to obtain information from the RSA. </p><h2>  VSK </h2><p>  VSK (Military Insurance Company) is a well-known and reliable company.  To issue an insurance policy in electronic form is not difficult.  As in other organizations, you will need to make a calculation from the official website.  In your personal account fill out information about the owner and car.  This must be done carefully, since the policy with errors will be invalid. </p><p>  The company reports that insurance issued through the Internet is extremely convenient in processing, because the whole process does not take much time.  Also, this method of obtaining CTP is reliable, safe and beneficial.  The cost of the electronic version is much cheaper than the paper version. </p><p>  The break-even discount is maintained, which is convenient for regular customers. </p><p>  All filled in information is immediately checked through the SAR, so this insurance method is very fast.  Data on the insured and his car is checked, it remains only to pay the policy.  It is possible to do this with a bank card.  After some time, insurance will come to your inbox. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="osago uralsib electronic policy reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46379/1675377.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  How common are CTP policies in electronic form?  There are reviews that so far not everyone trusts such insurance. </p><p>  On many official sites, the bulk of the reviews carries negative characteristics of both the companies themselves and any insurance products.  All this happens because car owners, with compensations that are beneficial to them, rarely go to the site to specifically leave gratitude to their insurance company there.  As a rule, they seek help here or leave complaints. </p><p>  One of the main topics of negative reviews is the ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù purchase of additional services.  It reaches the point of absurdity when the life of one person is insured in the same company several times.  Such complaints are considered up to several months, so car owners buy such a package of services due to hopelessness. </p><p>  However, it is worth remembering that each situation on the road is individual, because of which reviews in this case need not be trusted. </p><p>  But in general, <span>e-insurance MTPL</span> reviews collects good ones.  After all, this helps car owners save money.  In addition, electronic insurance eliminated the need to sit in lines.  It became very convenient to insure your civil liability without leaving your home. </p>
