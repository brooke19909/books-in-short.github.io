A) 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  As you know, a significant role in the impressions remaining from a vacation abroad is played by the hotel, where travelers stay.  Even unpretentious tourists agree with this statement.  After all, everyone wants to be able to return after a busy day to a comfortable, tidy room, sleep in a comfortable bed with clean linens and count on the attentive and respectful attitude of the staff.  Therefore, people planning a trip abroad, as a rule, long before the expected date of departure, begin to select a hotel for accommodation. </p><p>  A serious help in this difficult matter can be provided by studying the comments of travelers who have already visited the place of interest to you.  After all, the former guests of this or that hotel are trying to share information about what pros and cons they had to face.  Therefore, it will be easier for those who are just planning their vacation to make an idea close to reality of whether this or that hotel is suitable for them or not.  Today we offer to find out together what impressions were left for travelers who decided to stay at the Polycarpia Hotel <span>(Cyprus, Protaras).</span> </p><p>  Reviews of tourists regarding this hotel, we immediately note, are of a different nature.  But still, most of the comments are positive.  This allows us to say that many of our compatriots who stayed at Polycarpia were not disappointed in their choice.  This is also confirmed by the hotel rating based on guest ratings.  It makes 4 points out of 5 possible.  Well, now we offer to find out in more detail what is waiting for tourists here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polycarpia hotel and apts cat a 4 protaras" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1268489.jpg" width="600"></div>

According to them, it is well worth the money.  True, many agreed that, nevertheless, the Polycarpia Hotel is not drawn to the level of a four-star hotel.  As for the territory of the hotel, it can not be called large.  There are not too many greens here.  However, guests were satisfied with the presence of several pools of different depths.  There are also sun terraces with comfortable sun loungers and parasols. </p><h2>  Polycarpia Hotel And Apts (Cat. A) 4 *: rooms </h2><p>  As for the housing stock of the hotel in question, here, according to tourists, has its own peculiarity.  So, the majority of our compatriots who have visited Polycarpia advises, if possible, to book not standard rooms, but apartments.  The fact is that the rooms of the first type are not so spacious, and here you also have to pay extra for the opportunity to use a refrigerator and a safe. </p><p>  In addition to standard furniture and appliances, the apartments also have a kitchenette with a set of dishes.  Therefore, you can always cook your own dinner right in your room by buying products at the nearest supermarket.  Especially this option will be appreciated by families with children, which can be difficult to feed at the hotel.  In addition, as noted by travelers, the apartment has recently been renovated.  Therefore, their condition is much better than standard rooms. </p><p>  Also in some reviews you can find information about the presence of ants in the rooms.  However, the former guests of Polycarpia claim that insects will appear in your room only if you regularly leave food here.  As for the Internet, it can be used at the hotel only for an additional fee.  Most tourists did not like this option, and they connected to Wi-Fi in the surrounding cafes and bars.  You can also purchase a SIM card of a local mobile operator with an Internet package.  It will cost much cheaper than paying for this service at the hotel.  In addition, you can always be in touch with family and friends staying at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polycarpia hotel cyprus protaras reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1268488.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the settlement of newly arrived tourists at the Polycarpia Hotel And Apts (Cat. A) 4 * (Protaras) is carried out strictly after two in the afternoon.  Therefore, if you arrive at the hotel earlier than this time, then you will have to wait for the checkout time.  It is not necessary to be in the lobby awaiting check-in.  You can leave things in the luggage room and go to the pool or straight to the sea. </p><p>  Please also note that a deposit of EUR 5 is required for using the remote control and hairdryer, as well as for <span>beach towels</span> .  Upon departure, it will be returned to you.  Some former guests of Polycarpia also mention that there are frequent cases in this hotel when, upon arrival, those with apartments booked are accommodated for a couple of days in standard rooms.  However, as compensation in this case, the administration offers lunch coupons (if you paid for the half-board option).  As for the day of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before 12 noon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polycarpia hotel and apts cat a 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1268487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Food drinks </h2><p>  When booking accommodation at the Polycarpia Hotel 4 * (Cyprus, Protaras) you can choose the option of catering that suits you - only breakfasts, breakfasts and dinners (half board) and all inclusive.  In general, according to our compatriots, they were quite satisfied with the quality and variety of food in the hotel. </p><p>  So, breakfasts are standard and are held in buffet style.  In the morning you can eat eggs in different variations, sausages, bacon, vegetables and fruits, cereals, pastries, juice, tea and coffee.  For lunch and dinner, visitors to the restaurant are offered a choice of 4 dishes of meat, poultry and fish, several options for side dishes, salads, desserts.  Please note that free drinks are only available for breakfast.  During lunch and dinner, you can order the waiter for an additional fee.  As guests note, drinks are not cheap here, so many did without them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="polycarpia hotel and apts cat a 4 rooms" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1268486.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  According to tourists, the beach closest to Polycarpathia can be reached in 10-15 minutes at a leisurely pace.  It is municipal, therefore, for the rental of sun loungers and sunbeds, you will need to pay extra.  The beach closest to the hotel, as vacationers note, is very crowded.  However, there is always a clean, gentle entry into the water.  Many travelers preferred visiting the other <span>beaches of Protaras.</span>  But they will have to go longer or get by public transport, taxi or a rental car. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  As for the animation at Polycarpia, its level, as tourists note, of course, falls short of Turkish and Egyptian hotels.  So, only one person is engaged in entertainment for both adults and children.  True, in the evenings a couple of times a week, artists come with a show program (fire show, dance, etc.). </p>
