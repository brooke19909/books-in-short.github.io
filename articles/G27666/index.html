Goals and objectives of <span>environmental monitoring</span> : </p><ul><li>  obtaining primary information, its processing, systematization, analysis, creating a database; </li><li>  processing and providing information in the form of maps, charts, tables; </li><li>  modernization and improvement of methods for obtaining primary information; </li><li>  assessment of the real state of the environment, as well as a forecast for the near future; </li><li>  identification of the causes of the probable and observed phenomena of such a state; </li><li>  Efficiency of providing the required information to interested parties. </li></ul><p>  The goals and objectives of environmental monitoring, noted above, contribute to the adoption of operational decisions in the field of environmental management.

    <h2>  Environmental Policy </h2><p>  For a long time, environmental goals and environmental objectives were based on the following provisions: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ the effect of technogenic hazards on the human body is associated with exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations of radioactive and toxic substances in the environment (MPC); </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a person is maximally sensitive to the negative effects of factors from the biosphere, and therefore he must be protected by the state. </p><p>  Such an approach to environmental research involves the development of control measures, because for such a policy, technical control bodies over the activities of health services and the organization of treatment systems in enterprises are sufficient.  Experience has shown the fallacy of this approach; when it is used, environmental goals and environmental objectives are not solved.  There are such dangerous chemicals that even in small quantities can cause a negative effect on the human body, disrupt metabolic processes.  The hygiene standards of MPCs often turn out to be overestimated in reality; they are harmful to many living organisms: trees, conifers, lichens. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="goals and objectives of environmental excretization" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41272/1409313.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Comprehensive monitoring </h2><p>  What are the main goals and objectives of environmental impact assessment?  There are special programs that require comprehensive monitoring to comprehensively assess the various problems associated with environmental pollution.  What does integrated monitoring include? </p><ol><li>  Studying global impacts on the earth‚Äôs surface, for example, analyzing the problems associated with the release of carbon dioxide and halocarbon compounds into the atmosphere. </li><li>  A regional environmental problem that can negatively affect neighboring groups of countries.  For example, due to the transboundary transport of aggressive chemicals by air and water, the seas are polluted, tropical forests degenerate. </li><li>  Local problems regarding a fairly small area.  In this case, the main environmental goals and environmental objectives are associated with determining the quality of drinking water, identifying the quantitative content of heavy metals in the soil, and analyzing the state of the soil layer. </li></ol><h2>  The scale of the environmental monitoring system </h2><p>  Monitoring is carried out both on a small territory and on a global scale (throughout the globe).  Based on the data obtained, the general state of the biosphere is analyzed. </p>

    <h2>  Environmental education in educational institutions </h2><p>  Due to the relevance of the problems associated with the pollution of natural territories with chemicals, the modern education system also pays special attention to the formation of the foundations of an ecological culture among the younger generation.  The guys, under the guidance of their mentor, are engaged in their own monitoring studies, solve certain problems related to the deterioration of the quality of drinking water.  The goals and objectives of the environmental project depend on what problem the student wants to study, consider, analyze.  For example, you can evaluate the quality of drinking water in different places of the same locality, find out the existing difficulties, offer your own ways to eliminate them.  The goals and objectives of <span>environmental education are</span> regulated by federal educational standards of the second generation, aimed at fostering a tolerant attitude towards nature in the younger generation.  Many preschool institutions choose ecology as the main direction of their activity.  What are the main goals, objectives and environmental education in the DOE?  Kids get acquainted with the rules of behavior in the forest, study rare plants, learn to distinguish between useful and poisonous flowers, mushrooms. </p>

    <h2>  Environmental law </h2><p>  Due to the fact that unauthorized emissions of harmful chemicals by large industrial enterprises into the atmosphere have recently become more frequent, issues of legal protection of nature from harmful human effects have become urgent.  The goals and objectives of environmental law are regulated by Russian law.  It provides for liability for violations of environmental management rules, indicates all measures that may be taken against violators.  Large chemical industries pay special attention to the creation of high-quality treatment facilities that prevent the penetration of toxic substances into the air and water resources.  What are the environmental goals and objectives of the enterprise that oversees the activities of chemical plants?  Samples of water, soil, air are taken at certain times, according to the results of quantitative and qualitative analysis, the compliance of the samples with acceptable standards is determined.  If serious violations are detected, an <span>environmental audit is</span> carried out <span>.</span>  Its goals and objectives depend on the specifics of the organization, but they mainly concern verification of compliance with all security requirements.  If the obtained results indicate the presence of serious problems, the issue of initiating a criminal case on the violation of environmental legislation is being resolved. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Environmental monitoring is an integral part of ensuring the safety of people living on our planet.  That is why every state is trying to find material resources for organizing research aimed at solving environmental problems.  In order for the goals and objectives of environmental management to be consistent with the country's policy, there is such a direction as environmental policy.  This branch of law involves certain regulatory acts that stipulate all requirements for the activities of large companies and enterprises, as well as those liability measures that will be taken against them in case of violation of regulatory acts.  In order for the younger generation to have formed an ecological culture, special training courses in ecology are already being introduced at the pre-school and school level.  In the classroom, children learn to respect the environment, rationally use natural resources.  The new federal educational standards of the second generation suggest the formation in students of the desire for independent study of the basics of environmental management, <span>environmental research</span> and monitoring. </p>
