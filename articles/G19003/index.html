    <h2>  Creature </h2><p>  Suvorovskaya Square has an ancient history.  In the 15th century there was still a channel along which the Nadprudnaya river flowed, which is also called Sinichka and Samoteka.  Its waters connected with Neglinna precisely in the area where residents of the capital are now peacefully walking.  In the 16th century, they began to develop this territory and in 1630 began to build a church dedicated to John the Warrior. </p><p>  The 18th century was distinguished by the fact that Moscow continued to develop rapidly.  In the future, Suvorovskaya Square will appear on the ground near <span>the Saltykov estate</span> on the background of a beautiful park, which was also laid out to ennoble the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1807 was remembered for the fact that then the Catherine Institute was created on the basis of the estate.  Since then, young girls have been trained in its walls.  The same name is given to a park full of beautiful plants nearby.  Suvorov Square as part of this complex was also dedicated to the name of the empress. </p>

    <h2>  Changes </h2><p>  In the period of the 20-30s of the 20th century, it was time for radical changes that affected this place.  There was a conclusion of the river Nadprudnaya in the pipe cavity for flowing along its entire length.  In the center of the project organized a space for the square.  Until some time, it was adorned by the Church of St. John the Warrior in <span>Moscow.</span>  <span>Suvorov</span> Square can no longer boast of this building, it was demolished. </p><p>  In 1947, the hotel was built on the site of the Central House of Artists, which was subsequently renamed ‚ÄúSlavyanka‚Äù.  During the period from 1935 to 1940, a theater dedicated to the Red Army was built in the north of the territory, an excellent monumental building.  Now, having come here, we will see a beautiful building named after the Russian Army. </p><p>  Many tourists follow here to live in the hotel complex "Slavyanka". </p><p>  Suvorov Square knew a lot of changes.  For example, in 1928, the Catherine Institute was rebuilt and placed there an institution dedicated to the Red Army.  Frunze monument was erected nearby.  Since 1928, the local area is also decorated with the face of Suvorov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After 12 years, in honor of the commander received the name and Suvorov Square.  A nearby metro works and transports people from different points of the city. </p>

    <h2>  The form </h2><p>  This place has an oval shape.  There is a slight elongation when viewed to the northwest from the southeast.  Between Olimpiysky Prospekt and Samotyochnaya Street, there is a park that is connected to beautiful plantings in the south. </p><p>  The most important part of this complex can be called two large buildings: the former Catherine Institute, which stretched in the east and the <span>Theater of the Russian Army</span> located in the north <span>.</span> </p><p>  The center of the square has a flower garden with a monument in the middle.  In the north you can find the entrance to the neighboring <span>Catherine Park.</span> </p><h2>  Important buildings </h2><p>  The most interesting architectural building that you can see here is the Saltykov house, which later began to serve the goals of science.  The central office was built in 1779 in order to provide housing for Count Saltykov, who at that time held the position of vice-governor of Moscow.  The project was designed by D. Ukhtomsky. </p>

Two outbuildings were added.  The years from 1818 to 1827 were characterized by the fact that the building was expanded and the facade was redone.  During the period from 1918 to 1928, he put his hand to the Toporov building, creating a project for the restoration of the front stairwell.

    <p>  In addition, here you can find an academic theater created in the shape of a star with five ends.  Each beam was surrounded by columns.  Construction was completed in 1941.  The authors of the project were architectural figures Alabyan and Simbirtsev.  You can feel all the features of totalitarian architecture if you look at the Slavyanka Hotel, built in 1947. </p><p>  It is also extremely interesting to look at the <span>monument to Suvorov,</span> which was erected in 1982 under the leadership of the sculptor Komov and architect Nesterov, as well as at the Frunze monument, whose construction was done in 1960 by E. Vuchetich. </p><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  In June 2010, the subway began to function here.  The station is called ‚ÄúDostoevskaya‚Äù and belongs to the Lyubomiro-Dmitrov line.  There is direct access to Suvorov Square.  There are plans for improving the project by creating a transplant.  The location of the ring line tunnel falls precisely on the section above which Suvorovskaya Square rises.  He enters the drive from Novoslobodskaya to Prospekt Mira. </p><p>  Before Dostoevskaya was opened, the closest station to this place was just Novoslobodskaya.  Also nearby is Prospect Mira.  Not long to go from Tsvetnoy Boulevard. </p>
