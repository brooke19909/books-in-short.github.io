    <p>  The debtor is simply obliged to return the money on time.  Unfortunately, he does not always have such an opportunity.  <span>Credit debt</span> leads not only to overpayments, but also to the fact that relations with the lender deteriorate. </p><p>  Violation of the terms of the contract is a serious misconduct.  Material measures can be very serious.  In some cases, it comes to <span>collecting debts in a judicial proceeding</span> .  Checking loan debt is not so difficult.  In general, there are enough measures that can somehow ease the situation.  To find out the loan debt, assessing the situation, come up with tactics of action, if necessary, come to the creditor and explain the situation - this is the correct scheme of action. </p><p>  Everything is unstable.  Today we have money, and tomorrow it may not be.  Do not panic if the deadline for paying a loan installment has almost come and your pocket is empty.  The bank is used to everything.  Credit debt is a fairly common phenomenon.  She won‚Äôt surprise anyone today. </p><p>  It is better to honestly admit that you do not have money to pay for obligations.  It is desirable to clearly explain the reasons for their material difficulties.  What is the attitude of the bank towards those whose loan debt is growing, but they themselves do not show any attempts to correct the situation or simply explain it?  Of course, very bad.  Fooling bank employees with ridiculous excuses is also not a good strategy.  This institution always wants to receive specific information that would help to understand the situation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, the bank may require a breakdown of the <span>loan agreement</span> even if payment has not been made only once.  In this case, you will have to repay the entire debt in full and in a short time.  Fortunately, this does not happen often. </p><p>  Credit debt is something you should not joke with.  You can solve the situation in various ways.  You can, for example, ask for a deferral of payment of the main debt.  The thing is that for a certain period the borrower will pay only interest.  The loan repayment period is extended.  You can ask for the so-called "credit vacation."  In this case, all payments on the loan are simply frozen.  This option is used infrequently. </p><p>  Sometimes it is possible to reduce the amount of monthly installments.  We pay less, but again longer.  What is the benefit of the bank?  Yes, the fact that you, one way or another, have to pay anyway more.  The sum may run up a little, but it's not so scary, because it will be possible to pay everything on time and without problems. </p><p>  Sometimes the pay schedule changes.  In this case, the borrower does not begin to produce them monthly, but, for example, quarterly. </p><p>  Each bank has its own schemes for supporting borrowers who find themselves in a difficult financial situation.  However, help is by no means given to everyone.  The fact is that the lender must see that the borrower is indeed in a difficult position, as well as the fact that changing the <span>terms of the loan</span> agreement will be worthwhile, as well as real benefits. </p><p>  Debt on a loan becomes a cause of a serious conflict with the bank when the debt cannot be repaid through the sale of collateral (collateral may not even exist at all), restructuring and refinancing of debt is impossible. </p><p>  In such cases, the bank goes to court.  Of course, the court forces the debtor to return the full amount in a strictly allotted time.  Legal entities and individual entrepreneurs may be declared bankrupt. </p><p>  Sometimes when collecting a debt, various violations of the rights of debtors occur.  As a rule, they can serve as the basis for going to court.  So many borrowers are trying to somehow fix their situation.  Are they able to do this?  Only in some cases. </p>
