Throughout her life, helping people and saving them, she never found happiness in her personal life.  Juna's only joy was her only son, Vakhtang Davitashvili. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  After graduating from the Rostov Medical College, Evgenia Sardis (Dzhuna) received a distribution in Tbilisi.  There she met her future husband Viktor Davitashvili, a senior official. </p><p>  In this marriage, Vakhtang Davitashvili, the beloved and only son of a healer, was born.  After a difficult and tragic first pregnancy, during which Juna lost her newborn daughter Emma, ​​her son became a real gift for her. </p><p>  Vakhtang was born on July 22, 1975, on the birthday of his mother.  The boy grew up very kind and inquisitive.  Like his mother, he showed a talent for drawing and writing poetry.  He was very fond of sports, even had a rank in karate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vakhtang Davitashvili" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33305/1031358.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Matured Wahoe became a tall, athletic and very attractive young man.  Juna really wanted to quickly nurse her grandchildren, and she decided to urgently marry her son, despite the fact that he was not yet 16 years old.  And Vakhtang Davitashvili got married.  The bride was a very good girl, a luxurious wedding was played according to all traditions, but the marriage did not last even two months.  Perhaps the reason for this was life without a father's upbringing, and unlimited love for the mother. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Educated at the Krasnodar Institute of Foreign Languages, Vakho became an indispensable assistant to his mother.  At the International Academy of Alternative Sciences, which was headed by Juna Davitashvili, Vakhtang served as Deputy Prime Minister.  Together they worked on the creation and implementation of miraculous devices.  Of the thirteen patented inventions in the field of medicine, the physiotherapy apparatus "Juna-1" has no analogues in the world. </p><h2>  Early care </h2><p>  Unfortunately, Vakhtang was destined for early departure.  Both he and Juna foresaw this, but could not do anything.  Celebrating his 26th birthday with his mother, he, as if knowing something, told her that he would not celebrate this holiday anymore.  And he was right. </p>

    <p>  Vakhtang Davitashvili died in a car accident, saving the lives of pedestrians who suddenly ran out onto the road.  This happened on a summer evening in 2001.  He received injuries incompatible with life. </p><p>  In turn, Juna always called a different version of what happened.  She claimed that her son was killed. </p><h2>  Not reconciled </h2><p>  This terrible tragedy forever divided Juna’s life into “before” and “after”.  She even after a long time could not come to terms with this loss. </p>

    <p>  All the time it seemed to her that her son was very uncomfortable in the grave at the <span>Vagankovsky cemetery.</span>  And a few months after the funeral, she was able to agree on the exhumation of the body.  After that, the remains of Vakho were reburied in the crypt, where, according to his mother, he was more comfortable and the earth did not press him.  She put a cell phone in her son’s grave, on which she replenished her account until the end of her life so that she could communicate with her son. </p>
