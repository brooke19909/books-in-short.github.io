  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will attract stitch embroidery</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  To date, in needlework, there are various types of embroideries that are performed along a drawn contour.  The surface also refers to them, which is filling the free contour of the pattern with satin stitches.  Most often, these are patterns of plants and flowers; they are carried out with a thread of various shades on any fabric.  So, stitch embroidery for a long period of time serves as the main <span>type of embroidery</span> used in decorating linen, clothes or other household items. </p><p>  Currently, widespread white surface, shadow and slotted, as well as the so-called gold embroidery.  However, all types of surface can be divided into two groups: </p><p>  1. One-sided - the front side when embroidering has big differences from the wrong side, since it alone is covered with a dense flooring of thread.  Thus, the stitches on the front surface fit tightly, on the wrong side - dashed lines are formed along the outline of the pattern. </p><p>  2. Bilateral smooth surface - both the front and wrong sides are completely covered with stitches. </p><p>  White surface is performed with a white silk thread on such fabric as cambric or crepe de chine.  Such types of smoothness as ‚Äúcrumpet‚Äù, ‚Äúleaf‚Äù, ‚Äúsplit‚Äù, as well as ‚Äútassel‚Äù, ‚Äúbundle‚Äù and ‚Äúspider‚Äù are widely used for embroidery of original beautiful things and decor items. </p><p>  It should be noted that it is necessary to select a certain type of thread for each embroidery.  So, convex embroideries are made by a mouline <span>thread</span> or <span>silk thread of</span> various colors, linen is recommended to be embroidered with a twisted thread.  Also, needlework uses such threads as madeira, linen, darned or cotton.  In general, the thread and fabric are selected depending on the purpose of the product and the nature of the pattern performed on it.  It must be borne in mind that stitch embroidery is done on the hoop, and a pattern is applied to the fabric using <span>carbon paper.</span>  In this case, it is recommended to choose a dense and smooth fabric.  To prevent the contour of the drawing from being visible on the product, it is necessary to pierce the needle beyond the contours of the image lines. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Basically, the stitch embroidery technique is used to create a large panel, bright flowers and leaves will look beautiful on a <span>plain background.</span>  However, stitching can embroider not only large parts of the image, but also small details, for example, flower stems or twigs. </p><p>  It can be noted that <span>embroidery stitching for beginners</span> should be <span>started</span> with a choice of fabric and threads.  To save thread, you need to pierce a new stitch from the front side as close as possible to the location of the latter.  In addition, you need to embroider on tightly hooped fabric, otherwise it will wrinkle.  The stitches should be even and neat. </p><p>  Satin stitching was widespread when creating appliqu√©s, that is, patches on napkins or tablecloths, as well as lace embroidery when decorating clothes.  Most often, clothing items such as collars and cuffs are decorated, in some cases large patterns of flowers, chains or leaves on blouses or other underwear can be created.  Tablecloths and napkins woven by stitch will decorate any room. </p><p>  Thus, satin stitch embroidery was used by needlewomen for many centuries.  Currently, she has not lost her popularity, the craftsmen create magnificent patterns that attract attention with their beauty and originality.  The surface is used not only for decorating clothes, but also for creating interior elements.  Today, there are a large number of types of stitch embroidery, which one to choose depends on personal preferences, as well as the purpose of the product.  In any case, whatever the embroidery, it will be unique, as it is done with your own hands. </p>
