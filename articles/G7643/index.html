    <h2>  At the crossroads of two seas </h2><p>  On the very tip of the Apennine Peninsula is the magnificent resort of Calabria.  Italy is proud of its resorts and provides tourists with excellent conditions for a beach holiday.  The landscapes here are beautiful: rocky mountains covered with forests, hills twined with vineyards, fertile plains, on which endless fields and kitchen gardens stretch, wonderful sandy beaches.  The coast is washed by the gentle waters of two <span>seas: Tyrrhenian</span> and Ionian, and the coast of the second, due to the mild climate and an incredible number of sunny days, is more suitable for recreation.  Here you can find both well-equipped modern beaches, turning in the evening into noisy discos, and secluded coves, hidden from prying eyes.  Of particular charm is the coast in the small town of Pizzo, where the Orovacanze Club Porto Ada 4 * hotel is located.  The most popular activity off the coast of Calabria is <span>scuba diving</span> to <span>sunken ships.</span>  Many of them have been resting for more than 3 thousand years at the bottom of the Ionian and Tyrrhenian seas. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Calabria? </h2><p>  If you decide to relax on <span>the Italian coast</span> and bought a tour to Orovacanze Club Porto Ada 4 *, then it is most convenient to get here from Moscow by Alitalia airlines, which make regular flights from the Russian capital to Italy.  And at the Roman airport Leonardo da Vinci - Fiumicino you will need to transfer to a local airline that will take you to Lamezia Terme Airport in 30-40 minutes.  In Calabria there is another airport, only this one is very close to the town of Pizzo, next to which (9 km) is the Club Porto Ada.  Usually, when buying a tour, operators suggest including the cost of a package from the airport to the hotel.  And this, of course, is the best option, because otherwise you will have to take care of yourself, and in Italy without a knowledge of the language it will be quite difficult. </p><h2>  Pizzo Calabro - Coast of the Gods </h2><p>  This small resort town with a funny name, as noted above, is located on the Calambrian coast near Lamezia, in the picturesque bay of Euthymius.  He has a glorious past.  The shores of Pizzo have repeatedly witnessed heroic battles.  This is evidenced by the remains of sunken warships off its shores.  Why is the city called Pizzo?  In this region, fishing for tuna is very popular.  So, the fishermen who went to sea to catch this fish called "pizza."  And since the bulk of the men in this fishing village were engaged in precisely this matter, the city began to be called as well. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, this coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea is also called the ‚Äúcoast of the gods", since the residential sector is located high on the rocks, and the resort area is located below, next to the beaches.  For example, Club Porto Ada is located just 500 meters from the beach line, and Pizzo rises above it.  This tiny town, by the way, is known throughout Italy for its tartuffo chocolate ice cream.  This dessert was first made in 1943 in honor of the arrival of the Prince of Savoy Ferdinad in the city.  Since then, the city has launched the production of this delicacy and thanks to it the locality has become famous not only in Italy, but throughout Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="club porto ada 4 calabria" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/475177.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  If you come to the south of Italy, Calabria with its wonderful beaches will conquer you, and you will love this amazing country with all the strings of your heart.  The beaches of this region are famous for their beauty and purity of water.  From the first glance at the turquoise surface it becomes clear that rest on this coast will surely succeed. </p><p>  The private beach of the Club Porto Ada hotel is very close (500 meters) and can be reached in just 5-10 minutes.  A path leading through a pine forest leads to it from the hotel.  There are all conditions for the comfort of vacationers: there are various types of water activities (water skiing, parachuting, windsurfing, catamarans, bananas, scooters, etc.), a bar, beach equipment.  As already noted above, diving is especially popular here - an underwater trip to sunken ships, although this entertainment is not for the faint of heart. </p><p>  The beach is quite large, and there are few vacationers, only hotel guests, because Ada is far from civilization, like many other hotels in <span>Calabria.</span>  <span>The opinions of tourists who</span> have already visited this hotel are mixed.  Some praise her for peace and quiet, while others complain about the lack of a hectic life.  Some people like the beaches here, while others are annoyed by waves, jellyfish, etc. However, everyone unanimously praises the hotel's kitchen, the friendliness and friendliness of the staff, as well as the cleanliness and well-groomed throughout the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in italy prices" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/475187.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The hotel has a travel agency, so if your tour package does not include excursions, you can always contact this service.  On the other hand, you can rent a car for 30 euros per day and go on a tour of local attractions on your own.  And there is no need to go far, because very close to the city of Pizzo, which is 9 km from the hotel, there are a lot of historical monuments that you must definitely see.  For example, the Aragonese fortress (15th century).  It rises above the city and magnificent citrus orchards and captivates everyone at first sight with its grandeur.  This impregnable fortress with a drawbridge at the entrance is also called Murat Castle.  One of Napoleon's most ardent supporters was shot in the walls of this building in 1815. </p><p>  Another attraction of the city is the Piedigrott Church.  Neapolitan sailors who escaped from the storm knocked it out in the rock 300 years ago.  It is absolutely inconspicuous from the outside, but inside there is a whole group of beautiful tuff sculptures by three masters of the Barone family: Angelo (father), Alfonso (son) and Giorgio (grandson).  If desired, tourists can go to Sicily, wander around Palermo or Carleone, as well as have fun in the water park.  You can also go to the foot of active volcanoes, visit ancient monuments of architecture scattered across the coast. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Holidays in Italy will surely appeal to all those tourists who are partial to beautiful landscapes, historical sights, delicious cuisine, warm and welcoming smiles, friendliness and hospitality of local residents.  All this can be found in the region of Calabria - the southernmost point of the Apennines. </p>
