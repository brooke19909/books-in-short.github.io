    <p>  Like other branches of knowledge, <span>history as a science</span> has its own definition, subject and object of study, goals, as well as techniques and methods. </p><p>  Definition </p><p>  If we talk about the definition, then historical science means a system of knowledge that collects specific information and comprehends the life of human society at different stages of its existence.  It follows that the <span>object of study of</span> historical science is precisely all of humanity, individually taken as its totality and all of it as a whole.  And the subject of study can be considered each individual civilization or each individual nation, starting from the moment of its occurrence, the first mention of it, and ending with the moment of disappearance or transformation into something new.  Moreover, this society is not considered separately, but in relationships with other societies and civilizations. </p><p>  Typology of the <span>methods of studying history</span> as a science </p><p>  Having in its arsenal a variety of <span>research methods,</span> history seeks to maximize the objectivity of its conclusions and conclusions.  Therefore, when studying this or that era, each scientist uses not one, but several methods.  The most common include: </p><ul><li>  comparative historical method; </li><li>  historical genetic method; </li><li>  historical and typological; </li><li>  chronological research method; </li><li>  historical description. </li></ul><p>  About the methods in detail </p><p>  Each of them has its own characteristic features, so that together they give an objective picture of the studied historical period. </p><p>  When applying the comparative historical specialist compares, compares the periods of development of one culture, as well as several cultures that replaced each other.  This approach is also called the diachronic method. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol></ol><p>  With another approach, coexisting cultures, contemporary cultures or their individual manifestations are compared - this is the so-called synchronous method. </p><p>  1. In historical science, the historical genetic method is considered one of the most popular.  It is of interest in that the reality being studied, together with its properties, functions, features, is revealed in the context of time, against the background of its historical movement.  Its originality lies precisely in the fact that the genetic method makes it possible to more naturally, plausibly reproduce the studied object of study.  This is achieved by successively penetrating the past in order to identify the causes of already existing facts, accomplished events or phenomena.  There is still a nuance explaining the commitment of historians to this method.  In order to identify in the <span>process of historical</span> development the correlation of personal, subjective factors and objective ones, such as the logic of the political, ideological and class struggle, economic development, it is necessary to apply the same historical-genetic method. </p><p>  2. The task of the chronological method is to study how historical objects appeared, formed, and developed in accordance with the chronological sequence. </p><p>  3. The following situation can be considered an example of the implementation of the historical description method: a written historical source is found.  When studying it, it is necessary to describe it, answering questions about when the source was printed or written by hand.  Where is the monument written?  The author of the work?  What was used by the author as the primary source, what material formed the basis of the monument?  Is it the original or is it a copy, but the source is currently missing?  Does the source really deserve serious treatment and to what extent? </p><ol></ol><p>  Thus, the methods of historical science are an excellent tool for studying the past of your country, your people, as well as the past of all world civilizations.  Together with the inquiring mind, honesty and integrity of the researcher, he can become a reliable support in the search for answers to the most complicated questions.  Indeed, to find the truth, sometimes it‚Äôs not enough to have a set of knowledge.  It is also necessary to be able to apply them in a certain sequence and combinations.  The historical genetic method teaches this and allows you to look at the <span>subject of research</span> from all sides. </p>
