All the eyes of guests and casual passers-by are focused on a young couple.  Naturally, they want everything to go perfectly.  All the little things are thought out in advance - how to become right, how it is more convenient to accommodate guests, how to arrange a room, what dishes to order on the festive table. </p><p>  One of the attributes of the celebration is a pillow for rings.  With your own hands it is not difficult to sew it, if you have patience and prepare the necessary materials.  On this product rings are made for the wedding ceremony.  Typically, the pad is square in shape, but there are other varieties. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider several options for DIY pillows for rings with a detailed description of sewing.  After step-by-step instructions, each bride will be able to create a unique and spectacular craft for the most significant event of her life. </p><h2>  Color selection </h2><p>  Usually, a solemn white color is chosen for a pillow for rings with their own hands, but other delicate shades and pastel colors are possible.  These are traditional varieties of colors for our culture.  But recently, many couples have ordered an exit wedding ceremony at the venue.  It can be a restaurant or a summer cafe.  Depending on the design of the room, the colors for this type of crafts are also selected. </p><p>  For example, if chair covers are decorated with bright blue chiffon bows, then a pillow for the rings with your own hands is done with the inclusion of this color and even material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Gray crafts </h2><p>  Sewing a fabric stand for rings requires a small amount of material: gray satin, white guipure, wide ribbons of gray and cream colors, satin ribbons of the same shades, synthetic winterizer.  First, according to the pattern, a synthetic winterizer is cut into several layers and sewn along the edges.  Then one and the second part of the fabric of the required size is cut, on the wrong side, two layers of material are sewn with a stitch seam on three sides. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gray pad" class="if uuid-2304456" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304456.jpg"></div><p>  Then the workpiece is turned on the front side, the synthetic winterizer is pushed inside, the corners are neatly straightened.  Only after this is the last side sewn up with an internal seam.  Further work on a pillow for rings for a wedding with your own hands will consist in decorating the product with flowers.  From a wide chiffon ribbon folded in half, roses are folded, and the bottom of the roll is sewn together.  The upper petals are beautifully straightened.  Sew decorative elements in the middle of the front side of the product.  Bows are made from satin ribbons and attached to the flowers.  The marriage rings are attached by wrapping the tape around several turns. </p><h2>  Creamy pad </h2><p>  This option of a wedding pillow for rings with your own hands has a round shape.  It is sewn from satin fabric of a gentle cream color.  The base of the product is a simple small round pillow.  It is cut out on contours of a circle from two identical parts.  A synthetic winterizer is sewn into the middle, cut out by 2 cm of a smaller diameter than the pattern for the fabric. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="round pillow" class="if uuid-2304459" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304459.jpg"></div><p>  The seam is not located in a circle until the end, since the product still needs to be turned on the front side and inserted into the center of the synthetic winterizer.  The remainder is sewn with an inner seam so that the thread is not visible.  Then, rosettes made of strips of fabric are sewn along the edge of the circle.  You can also buy an extra satin ribbon of the same color and attach a beautiful bow or lace insert on the side.  In the middle of the pillow, we got a comfortable space for the rings.  So that they hold and do not slip while carrying to the side, two small bows made of thin satin ribbon are sewn exactly in the center.  The photo shows that thanks to these bows, the rings will be securely fixed. </p><h2>  Brooch Pillow </h2><p>  The next version of the crafts for the wedding is a white satin pillow with guipure, a longitudinal bow and a round beautiful brooch with pebbles.  First, the synthetic winterizer is folded in several layers and sewn together.  Then you need to measure the length of the filler and draw a square on the back of the atlas, each side of which is 1 cm longer than the synthetic winterizer. </p><p>  On the back, the satin is stitched on three sides.  Then the fabric is turned on the front side and the filler is inserted.  Then the last side of the square pillow is finally sewn up.  The seams should not be visible, so that everything is sutured with internal seams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brooch cushion" class="if uuid-2304462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304462.jpg"></div><p>  Then, from a piece of white guipure, a pipe-shaped cape is made.  The seam is hidden on the back of the product.  Further, a longitudinal bow is formed from a wide ribbon, which is performed by folding the stripes in waves.  The central joint is closed with a beautiful bright brooch on which a thin ribbon for rings is hung.  They need to be wrapped with tape 2 times, then when carrying the rings, they will not slip down. </p><h2>  Product with beads </h2><p>  You can also make a pillow for rings with peach-colored brocade.  How to sew the stand itself, the reader already knows, we will not repeat.  Let us focus on decorating an already sewn product.  A wide strip of lace with patterned edges is attached in the middle.  A strip of rows of beads of the same color is sewn in the center of the lace.  Two bows with hanging ribbons are sewn on two sides of the central strip.  The middle of each bow is decorated with a homemade flower with a rhinestone or a sewn-in pebble in the center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beige pillow" class="if uuid-2304465" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304465.jpg"></div><p>  Any flower can be made.  If you are not a master in the manufacture of plant elements, then you can simply create a magnificent bow.  To do this, wrap a thin ribbon with two fingers and tie them in the middle with a strong thread.  Then the wrapping is removed from the hand, and all the turns are moved apart in different directions. </p><h2>  Big bow pillow </h2><p>  This craft is sewn in several stages.  First you need to cut the material and the synthetic winterizer.  Then, lace is sewn on the upper half in the center, and also two large beads on top and bottom.  Then the upper part is turned inside out and sewn with the lower part of the pattern on three sides.  After this procedure, the pattern is turned out on the front side and the sintepon layer is inserted inside.  The last side is sutured with an internal seam. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bow pillow" class="if uuid-2304469" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304469.jpg"></div><p>  The second stage of work is done on the bow.  The pattern is drawn in the following sizes: the bow length is equal to the length of the pillow, and the width is ¬Ω of this value.  Two parts are cut out with a seam allowance of 0.5 cm. Three sides are sewn together on the wrong side, and one side edge of the bow closes after the product is turned on the front side.  Then a small tube is sewn from a narrow strip of fabric, which wraps around the bow, pulling it along the center point.  Then the ends are carefully sewn to the pillow.  Hand folds are carefully aligned.  Rings before the wedding ceremony are put on beads.  There they are well fixed and will not budge while moving around the hall. </p><h2>  Pillow in an envelope </h2><p>  The difference between such a wedding pillow and other options is the presence of two elements.  Firstly, it is the pillow of their atlas, drawn by an elastic band, under which the rings are inserted.  Secondly, this is the envelope in which the pillow is hidden.  This is a piece of brocade cut in the shape of a rhombus. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="envelope pillow" class="if uuid-2304473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304473.jpg"></div><p>  Two buttons are sewn on the upper and lower corners and a figure-eight elastic band is put on.  Thin ribbons are attached to the other two corners.  They are pulled together with a bow. </p><h2>  Craft with lace </h2><p>  How else can I sew a pillow for rings with my own hands so that it is original?  Consider the following option.  Stuffed lace around the perimeter is sewn onto the satin pillow.  A bead on a loop is attached to each corner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lace pillow" class="if uuid-2304475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304475.jpg"></div><p>  And in the very center of the pillow a wide white nylon cord is attached, tied to a bow with large ends.  Rings are strung on it from two sides, and the bow loops hold them in one place. </p><h2>  Rectangular pillow </h2><p>  Now consider another option of wedding pillows for rings with your own hands.  The photo below shows that this product is different in its shape.  A pillow is made of white rectangular fabric.  Then, using lace, the surface is divided into two separate zones, for the male and female rings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rectangular craft" class="if uuid-2304477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304477.jpg"></div><p>  In the middle of each square bows from satin ribbons are sewn and rings are attached to them.  At the corners, as in the previous version, beads on the ringlets are sewn.  Only here they have the shape of a drop. </p><h2>  Heart for rings </h2><p>  Such a cute heart will look original at any wedding celebration.  The edges of the pattern are trimmed with lace, gathered in folds.  The upper part of the craft is divided into three zones.  A large and lush flower with a pebble or bead is sewn in the middle.  And on the sides are already attached two small bows for rings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="heart pillow" class="if uuid-2304482" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2304482.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, it‚Äôs not difficult to sew wedding pillows for rings yourself (photo in the article), the main thing is to choose suitable decorative additional elements - ribbons, lace, bows, beads and rhinestones, pebbles and flowers, brooches and others.  But remember that the article should not be too lapidy, so the inserts should be aesthetic and tasteful. </p>
