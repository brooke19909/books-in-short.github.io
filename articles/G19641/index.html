    <h2>  Cubes </h2><p>  From boxes of juice, you can make cubes that can replace your child with a store designer.  To make them, take containers from the drink and wash them thoroughly.  When the boxes dry out, cut off all the excess edges and flatten the top.  Glue the top with glue or tape. </p><p>  Your cubes are almost ready.  It remains to glue them with colored paper or self-adhesive tape.  To keep them in shape, wrap them with tape.  For decoration, you can use stickers and a variety of pictures, for example, numbers and letters.  It is worth noting that such cubes are ideal for construction. </p><h2>  Where to store pencils? </h2><p>  Crafts from juice boxes can replace some accessories even for a desk.  If you still care about the question of where it is better to store children's pencils, then the answer is simple.  Make a pencil box from improvised means.  To make such an accessory you will need: </p><ol><li>  Box of 1 liter juice. </li><li>  Colored paper in gray, white and pink, cardboard. </li><li>  Red fabric ribbons. </li><li>  Pencils, glue, adhesive tape. </li><li>  Lace ribbon. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from boxes animals" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/607601.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  How to make a pencil box </h2><p>  We begin to create original crafts from the boxes.  Animals in this case are just perfect for a pencil box.  Therefore, we will make a beautiful cat out of an ordinary box, which will become a keeper of pencils. </p><p>  To start, wash the juice container thoroughly and dry it.  Then glue the box on the outside and inside with gray paper.  From a cardboard of the corresponding color, cut an even circle.  This will be the face of the cat.  Cut the ears out of the same cardboard.  Stick them on top of the circle.  In the center of each eyelet, stick white paper parts that are similar in outline to the ears, only smaller in size. </p><p>  In the middle of the muzzle, stick the nose of the cat.  It can be made in the shape of a heart.  Make eyes over the nose.  They can also be cut out of paper or replaced with ordinary buttons.  Do not forget about the cheeks.  Cut two small circles of pale pink paper and glue them so that the nose is located between them.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine a cat without a mustache.  From the tip of the nose to the cheeks, stick on a white rope so that each of them forms an arc.  Hole holes in several places over each thread and thread the wire.  This will be the antennae.  Glue the top edge of the box from the juice with a lace cloth.  Fasten the face on the front so that most of it is above the upper edge of the container. </p><p>  From the white paper, cut out two front legs and two back legs.  These details will make the cat more attractive.  Stick the front ones to the front at the very bottom, and the rear ones to the sides of the box.  After that, decorate the cat with red bows.  They can be fixed on the sides, as well as in front under the face. </p><p>  That's all, the pencil holder is ready.  To make the craft more attractive, it is better to use textiles instead of paper.  This will make the cat more alive. </p><h2>  Finally </h2>

    <p>  Children's crafts from boxes can be a real decoration.  Children very often see the beautiful in what adults and adults do not even notice it.  Creativity allows the baby to realize his ideas and make dreams come true.  Parents can help their child find exactly the activity that he likes.  At the same time, remember that the child must develop not only physically, but also emotionally.  Experts have proved that children who began to engage in creativity early in the future react to what is happening around them more clearly than others.  And the joint work of parents and kids makes the connection between them even stronger. </p>
