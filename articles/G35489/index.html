Of course, after all, what resident of a modern metropolis does not like to spend time outdoors, in the open air?  The question should be left rhetorical.  The Green Theater has a rich history, which will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  A little history, or How it all began </h2><p>  The Green Theater was built in 1830 near the palace.  It was an open summer amphitheater that had a semicircular shape.  For the theater, neither scenery nor special repairs were needed, since it itself was surrounded by trees and bushes that separated it from other buildings, creating a hedge. </p>

    <p>  To this day, records of the summer theater have been preserved, which describe not only its size (length is 35 fathoms, the width in the front is 19 fathoms and 21 in the rear end), but also the colors of the walls (“painted with white and wild colors”). </p><p>  And in 1930, a huge open stage was built on this territory, which could accommodate 5,000 spectators.  This place was intended for rallies, various spectacles of the Olympics, as well as for demonstrations of home-made arts (crafts). </p><p>  And three years later, it was decided to build a large open theater in <span>the Gorky Park.</span>  The main and main requirement of the project was the availability of an open area that could accommodate 20,000 spectators and a large stage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of open air theater </h2><p>  The construction site was not chosen by chance.  The Green Theater was built on the square `` Bow ''.  The place is located in front of the Neskuchny Palace, on a picturesque slope.  The terrain was just perfect, which is important.  After all, places for spectators - this is the slope of the mountain, which is covered with asphalt. </p><p>  Looking at the Green Theater (photos are presented in the article), you can see that it has fifteen belt sections, of which 7 are for seating, and the remaining 8 (rear) are for standing.  Seats designed for seating are benches with backs and strong concreted legs. </p><p>  The stage itself was a wooden structure, which consisted of a theater platform, a gallery, furnished on both sides with pylon towers.  In the center, a large place for the orchestra was placed - the so-called orchestra pit.  Inside the stage there is a room for staff, rooms for artists and the like. </p><p>  The frame of the building consisted of wood, which was sheathed, covered with plywood and painted with oil paint. </p>

    <h2>  New place </h2><p>  The Green Theater was built in thirty days and existed until 1956. It was in this year that the question arose about the need to rebuild the premises.  The new Green Theater building was built during the year and opened in 1957 before the start of the World Festival of Youth and Students. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Changes appeared in the new building: the Green Theater was moved away from the Moscow River by twenty-five meters.  Also, the architect reduced the area of ​​the amphitheater by 400 m. And thanks to this, an alley was laid connecting the theater with the Neskuchny Garden. </p>

    <p>  Many years have passed since that time, and the Green Theater operates to this day.  Every year, with the advent of spring, restoration work in the theater begins.  Paint or replace wooden benches, repair the stage and the like. </p><h2>  No criticism </h2><p>  Naturally, like any novelty, the Green Theater also met with criticism from many architects and not only.  However, this did not prevent him from becoming a favorite place for a pleasant pastime of thousands of people.  Many Muscovites proudly demonstrate the miracle of their visitors to the open-air city. </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  Over the years, the Green Theater has been reconstructed and restored more than once.
