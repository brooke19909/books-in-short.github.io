  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting berets with knitting needles - patterns for knitting.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many ladies today choose knitting as their hobby.  Cloak <strong> </strong>  lace, poncho with a jacquard pattern, an original beret, a baby dress and a variety of handmade booties will help the needlewoman not only save her family budget, but also reveal her creative potential. </p><p>  By the way, you can learn to knit at almost any age.  And knitting berets with knitting needles and crochet <strong> </strong>  or a poncho, sweater or coat is also an excellent sedative.  Some needlewomen even undertake such complex large work as the execution of rugs and carpets. </p><p>  One of the simplest activities can be called knitting berets with knitting needles.  Of course, one cannot do without certain skills here, but for beginners, one can recommend knitting with an ‚ÄúEnglish rubber band‚Äù for a beret.  It is simple in execution, beautiful and voluminous. </p><p>  English gum </p><p>  Practically for this figure, the skill of knitting the front loop is enough.  The first row consists of an alternation of facial loops with non-knit, which are removed with the crochet.  In the second row, the non-knit stitch that was removed with the crochet should be knit with the front, and the next one should be removed in the same way without knitting with the crochet.  This algorithm is repeated throughout mating.  Is it true that there is nothing complicated? </p><p>  Corn </p><p>  More skilled craftswomen can recommend knitting "corn".  <span>Knitting berets with</span> knitting needles in a corn pattern makes the model magnificent.  These hats look especially beautiful on babies. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The algorithm of this</span> figure includes four rows.  For convenience, a description of the knitting pattern is worth introducing additional notation: </p><p>  front loop - X, </p><p>  yarn loops without knitting - U, </p><p>  removal of a double crochet stitch with another crochet - K, </p><p>  and the wrong side, which is knitted with a double crochet - Sh. </p><p>  So, for the sample you should dial an odd number of loops (edge ‚Äã‚Äãloops will not be mentioned here) </p><p>  1st row: X, U. The row will end with a front loop. </p><p>  2 row: U, K. The row ends with a facial loop. </p><p>  3 row: U, S. The row ends with a facial loop. </p><p>  The 4th row is knitted according to the drawing with an elastic band 1X1. </p><p>  Openwork drawing "wreath of leaves" </p><p>  Today, knitting berets with knitting needles made of cotton thread is very popular.  These products are worn in the summer to protect the head from sunlight.  The drawing "wreath of leaves" is also extremely simple in execution, but very beautiful.  To indicate the loops in the circuit, we take the following symbols: </p><p>  front loop - X, </p><p>  nakid - b </p><p>  back loop - T, </p><p>  two together front - F, </p><p>  three together facial - J. </p><p>  The knitting algorithm includes four rows.  For the sample, dial 13 working loops (edge ‚Äã‚Äãones are not taken into account).  When performing even rows, you need to knit the crochets as loops - due to this, openwork holes are formed in the figure, which make the product airy and beautiful. </p><p>  1 row: 4T, b, F, X, F, b, 4T. </p><p>  2 and 4 rows: 4X, 5T, 4X. </p><p>  3 row: 4T, X, b, F, b, X, 4T. </p><p>  So, when the craftswoman decides on the choice of a pattern for her product, she can begin the process itself.  Knitting berets with knitting needles starts from the bottom, with a rim that will hold the hat on the head.  Therefore, the rim should fit snugly to the head.  They knit it either with an ordinary elastic band or with a double elastic band, into which you can later insert a cord or elastic band. </p><p>  Then you need to increase the number of loops so that the beret acquires the required volume.  After knitting as many rows as necessary in height, they begin to reduce the number of loops, knitting two loops together.  This will be the bottom of the beret, so you don‚Äôt need to knit it according to the pattern, you can simply perform the reduction of the loops with ordinary facial ones. </p><p>  Often, beret models have visors of various shapes.  Perfectly decorate their brushes that come from the top of the cap, or fluffy pompons, pigtails or flirty bows, which can also be knitted. </p>
