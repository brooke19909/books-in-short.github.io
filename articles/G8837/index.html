    <h2>  General information about holidays in the Maldives </h2><p>  By the beauty of nature, this place has practically no competitors.  The coast of all islands is the finest white sand and clear water - the cleanest in the Indian Ocean.  Tall palm trees, as if descended from frames of famous advertising, create a feeling of paradise.  Shallow water for bathing young children is the best option, and the climate in the Maldives is so mild that there are practically no problems with acclimatization, despite the long flight.  Out of almost two thousand islands, about eighty are accessible to tourists today.  You can move between them by boat, seaplane or boat.  As a rule, hotels here occupy the whole island, so the beaches are quiet and not crowded.  In general, the hotel infrastructure in the Maldives is very diverse.  There are hotels for every taste: guest houses, considered a relatively cheap accommodation option, three-star hotels, four-star complexes, such as Vilamendhoo Island Resort &amp; Spa, and, of course, the luxurious apartments that the Maldives is famous for.  Accommodation prices depend on the season. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Weather on a paradise island </h2><p>  In terms of temperature, it is comfortable all year round.  Tourists definitely will not need warm clothes on the islands.  You need to know that the high season begins in November and lasts until the end of spring.  It was at this time that many tourists prefer to go to the Maldives.  Prices in hotels during this period are higher than during the rest of the time.  For example, at the hotel Vilamendhoo Island Resort &amp; Spa (4 *) the cost of a seven-day tour for two with three meals a day and living in a bungalow will cost about one hundred eighty thousand rubles without a ticket. </p>

    <p>  According to tourists, it is better not to come to the Maldives from May to September, because during this period the wet season begins.  It rains a lot and in large quantities, sometimes all day.  Although you can relax at this time, because the water in the ocean resembles fresh milk, and rainfall stops as abruptly as it begins.  But the prices in hotels this season are significantly lower.  At this time, only those who are little interested in the weather come here.  Vilamendhoo Island Resort &amp; Spa, for example, offers rooms much cheaper.  For example, in September you can book a standard double room for eighty-eight thousand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Vilamendhoo Island Resort &amp; Spa is built on the small island of Vilamedu, located in the Ari Atoll.

    <p>  Those who prefer a private vacation, it is better to choose a villa in the sea.  True, some of our compatriots did not particularly like the sound of waves breaking on piles, however, there are those who like the feeling of living in the middle of the ocean.  Another drawback of the rooms of this category is the shallow water on the descent into the water. </p><p>  Our compatriots praised the decoration of Jacuzzi Beach Villas - a four-poster bed, a cozy sofa with many pillows, a half-open bathroom and a private area with a jacuzzi.  Another plus is the proximity to the beach. </p><p>  As for the territory, here the opinions of the Russians are the same: lush vegetation is excellent for relaxation.  Little lizards run everywhere.  The area is always clean.  Some tourists say that for the entire time of rest they never wore shoes.  Even the restaurant is allowed to go barefoot. </p><p>  I really liked the fact that you can sign up for excursions yourself using the ipads at the registration desk.  There is even a Russian menu.  Those who are struggling to overcome the language barrier are not particularly worried.  A Russian girl is working at the reception desk. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots liked the spa and water sports center. </p><p>  It can be concluded that the vast majority of Russians liked this hotel.  A huge number of impressions and a quiet calm atmosphere, when no one interferes, did their job: our tourists returned home with renewed vigor.  Rest here, as many compatriots write in their reviews, this hotel is not for partygoers, but for complete relaxation. </p>
