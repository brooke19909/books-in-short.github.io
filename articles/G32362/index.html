Warm sunny days are called to go for a walk in the park or forest.  And at the same time you can collect very beautiful leaves, because soon the time for crafts for the kindergarten will begin! </p><p>  Think what will be yours?  Make a beautiful bright peacock of leaves! </p><p>  The process of creating a simple, interesting.  Take care of it with your child and you will have an interesting evening! </p><h2>  Tools for creativity </h2><p>  You will collect all the materials for the peacock from the leaves during a walk, on the way from school or kindergarten, as well as in a public garden near your home.  Needs leaves - maple, birch - it does not matter!  The main requirement is not too large and very bright! </p><p>  In addition, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Color cardboard; </li><li>  Velvet cardboard in black or dark green; </li><li>  A piece of dense (corrugated) cardboard; </li><li>  Glue gun; </li><li>  Plasticine. </li></ol><p>  Take any tools and materials, for which there is enough imagination, then create! </p><p>  If you decide to skeletonize the leaves, then prepare a soda and an old toothbrush. </p><div class="photo" data-original="semeynaya-kuchka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="skeleton sheet" class="if uuid-2931772" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931772.jpg"></div><p>  In order for your panel to become the most original and beautiful, make skeletons of leaves and brightly color them.  To do this is quite simple, but the result is surprising. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We present to your attention 2 methods of skeletonization of autumn leaves. </p><p>  With the first option, the lesson will not be too pleasant, and the work will need to be started at least 3 weeks before the creation of the craft.  If you are ready for this, then try. </p><p>  For this method, a container is taken, foliage is laid in it, warm water is poured and everything is closed with a lid.  In a warm place, such leaves quickly begin to rot.  In this case, the flesh of the leaf is more likely to be destroyed, and this process concerns hard veins last. </p><p>  After 3 weeks, we need to remember about our leaves.  Pure water is poured into the basin and raw materials are laid out there.  It is very necessary to clean the rot, trying not to damage the veins.  Anything that cannot be removed by hand should be removed with a toothbrush.  Skeletonized leaves are placed under oppression and dried. </p><p>  As you can see, this is not a very pleasant experience.  Again, in our life it is not always possible to prepare in advance, so there is another method - much faster! </p><p>  In the second option, you need to boil the leaves in a soda solution. </p><p>  To do this, 200 grams of washing soda powder is dissolved in 600 ml of warm water.  Prepared leaves are immersed in the mixture, boiled for an hour and a half at low heat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="semeynaya-kuchka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gentle peacock" class="if uuid-2931762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931762.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, pour this liquid, and pour pure water into the pan and continue cooking for about 30 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Use a fork to check the condition of the sheet.  We finish when the separation of the pulp from the veins becomes free. </p><p>  Now we get the leaves and carefully, without pressing, wipe them.  Some parts may not come off, in which case re-boil the raw materials.  Get out of the "broth" carefully, because the leaves are very fragile and can be destroyed!  Dry as in the first option. </p><p>  Before work, the skeletons of the leaves can be ironed and then applied with dye - gouache, dye for eggs, watercolor, paint from spray cans.  Bright colors are welcome, because the peacock from the leaves can not be dull! </p><p>  You can whiten them with the usual "White". </p><h2>  Do-it-yourself peacock </h2><p>  To create a bright panel, prepare a sheet of light-colored cardboard, velvet cardboard, scissors and leaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="detkisemya.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leaf panel" class="if uuid-2931757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931757.jpg"></div><p>  On the cardboard in the middle, draw a semicircle - this will be a sketch of the tail.  Squeeze the glue along the largest arc and very quickly, without allowing the glue to harden, spread the leaves. </p><p>  In order for the work to be fun, first sort all the leaves by size and shade. </p><p>  Let the first row be from ordinary leaves, but the second and all subsequent ones can be laid out from skeletonized ones. </p><p>  After the entire surface of the tail is filled, cut out the silhouette of the bird from the black velvet cardboard and stick it on top of the leaves. </p><h2>  Peacock made from maple leaves and plasticine </h2><p>  To make such a bird even easier, you just need to remember the modeling lessons!  Better yet, if your baby helps you build your body, neck and head. </p><p>  To do this, take the blue plasticine and knead it, and then perform the desired shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pochemu4ka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="peacock from leaves" class="if uuid-2931748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40077/2931748.jpg"></div><p>  For the tail, collect maple leaves - the brightest and most beautiful.  But all the fallen leaves have an unpleasant feature - they dry and warp, losing their delicious appearance.  To prevent this from happening in your case, prepare them - preserve in glycerin or coat with wax. </p><p>  In the tail of the plasticine body, stick a few leaves so that they peek out one from another.  For the head, you can make a crest of twigs. </p><p>  Create legs from sticks and caps of acorns. </p><p>  From a thick cardboard, cut a small stand and paint it green or stick green paper.  Glue peacock from leaves on it. </p><p>  That's all!  The child is delighted - after all, his craft will be amazing! </p>
