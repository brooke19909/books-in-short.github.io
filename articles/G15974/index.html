This simple procedure can be troublesome. </p><p>  To start working with an ATM, a citizen will have to insert bank plastic into a special receiver without fail.  It is usually labeled ‚ÄúInsert Card,‚Äù and a highlight is lit around the receiving area. </p><p>  It is important to correctly insert the plastic into the receiver.  It is required to hold the card face up.  The reading tape should be in the lower right corner.  If chip plastic is used, make sure that the chip is in front. </p><p>  After the actions taken, the client will be prompted to enter a PIN from the plastic.  3 attempts are given.  If the client makes a mistake so many times, the card is ‚Äújammed‚Äù by the ATM.  A person will not be able to independently remove the plastic from the ATM. </p><p>  PIN is assigned upon receipt of a credit card.  It can be changed.  A combination of 4 digits.  Nobody should know her, except for the owner of the plastic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Is the card inserted in the machine and the PIN entered correctly?
