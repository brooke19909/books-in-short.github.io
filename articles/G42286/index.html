Moreover, in fact, our devices are constantly connected to different networks that provide mobile coverage in the area where we are.  Due to this, the cost of services, like their provider, is constantly changing.  This led to the emergence of such a thing as ‚Äúroaming‚Äù. </p><h2>  What is roaming? </h2>

    <p>  This concept in itself means the provision of mobile communication services to a subscriber at a time when he is outside the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe so-called home network - the coverage in which he is registered.  Each of the operators has a number of agreements with other service providers, due to which the latter are provided on different conditions.  Depending on how much this or that service costs for the provider company, the subscriber will also have to pay.  Everything directly depends on the conditions on which the operators cooperate with each other. </p><h2>  What is roaming? </h2><p>  In general, the term ‚Äúroaming‚Äù means an international message - communication with people who have left outside Russia and are calling, for example, from a mobile network of an American, European or other operator.  However, in our country, this concept also characterizes the relationship between the regions.  This is due to the large territory of the country, and therefore the distance over which mobile communications are common.  In regions where, for example, there is no Beeline coverage area, customer service is provided by a partner network, due to which the cost of services increases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Even roaming may be due to some specifics of the territory in which the subscriber is located.  For example, again, in the Beeline network there is Crimean roaming.  This option is due to the fact that on the peninsula, subscriber services are carried out by local operators. </p><h2>  Beaming from Beeline </h2>

    <p>  In this article we will discuss the terms of profitable roaming from one of the domestic mobile operators - Beeline.  You can connect roaming in Russia on the most favorable terms.  We will talk about what they provide and how much the subscriber will ultimately cost the communication services from this operator in this article.  Also, with regard to the international service of subscribers who have left the country, we will consider further in the text.  Thus, a general analysis and a brief description of the plans in force for the subscribers of this company will be carried out.  And let's start with the Russian tariffs introduced by Beeline.  Roaming in Russia, by the way, is much simpler and cheaper than international. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "My country" </h2><p>  The first tariff that I would like to pay attention to is a package that provides a single cost for outgoing calls to any number in the amount of 3 rubles per minute;  and incoming - 3 rubles for the first and 0 for all subsequent minutes of the conversation.  The cost of SMS messages to any region of the country is set at 3 rubles. </p>

    <p>  In order to switch to the tariff, you need to pay another 25 rubles (one-time, when connecting the service).  To activate the service, you must enter the command * 110 * 0021 #.  The tariff is disconnected according to the same scheme, only instead of the last four digits it is necessary to enter 0020. </p><p>  This option is the basic and easiest for calls to numbers in Russia that Beeline offers.  Roaming in Russia on other tariff plans has some features, which we will discuss later. </p><h2>  "My intercity" </h2><p>  The next interesting package provides a minimum <span>monthly fee</span> (at the level of 1 ruble for each day of validity) in case the user is ready to make an advance payment for the cost of the service.  If the subscriber is served on a so-called postpaid basis (pays after using traffic, minutes and other things), then the price is 30 rubles per month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  This differs from the previous tariff in that the cost of calls to numbers of other regions is 2.5 rubles per minute of conversation.  Moreover, the cost of one SMS message is lower: it is 1.5 rubles.  For those who are looking for how to enable roaming on Beeline for calls throughout the country, the instruction is available on the official website: you need to pay a one-time fee of 25 rubles, then call 06741. To disconnect from the option, dial 06740. </p><h2>  World Roaming </h2>

    <p>  Above were given the tariffs (roaming) applicable in Beeline, the territory of which is the Russian Federation.  If we talk about trips abroad, then in this case the conditions are much more complicated, and the cost of services is higher.  This is very easy to verify.  We give three relevant tariffs at the time of writing, which will make you feel the difference between the services.  We will also describe how to enable roaming on Beeline for communication in other countries.  It is not difficult to do this - it is much more difficult to decide which package of services suits you best. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúThe most profitable Internet in roaming‚Äù </h2><p>  So, the first tariff that I would like to characterize is called: "The most profitable Internet in roaming."  As you might guess, it is focused on the consumer of Internet traffic. </p><p>  According to the terms of the package, in the most popular countries (Europe, the CIS and some others, the list is on the operator‚Äôs website, it includes the USA, Canada, Turkey, Japan, Lithuania, Norway and so on) the cost of the provided traffic (40 megabytes per day) equals 200 rubles a day.  Moreover, each additional megabyte of data is paid for in the same ratio - 5 rubles each. </p><p>  If the subscriber travels to another country (where Beeline international roaming does not work according to the indicated tariff plan), the cost of 1 megabyte of data will be 90 rubles. </p>

    <p>  In fact, a dedicated 40 MB traffic package is not enough for everything that a subscriber may want to use, but for social networks, viewing mail and some minimal needs like reading books online or getting to know the news should be enough. </p><p>  Since the package provides Internet orientation, it does not provide any bonus minutes for conversations, SMS messages or anything.  It can be assumed that it was prepared specifically for working with a tablet computer. </p><h2>  "My planet" </h2><p>  This is another tariff plan introduced by Beeline.  Roaming abroad for users on this package provides both the availability of special prices for minutes for calls and ‚Äúbonus‚Äù SMS messages of 9 rubles each. </p><p>  As for calls, incoming calls will cost 15 rubles per minute, and outgoing calls will cost 25 rubles if the subscriber is in the territory of the states listed on the special list.  If a person went to another state, those who enter will cost him 19 rubles, and outgoing - 49. </p><p>  How to enable roaming on Beeline on the terms of this tariff plan is noted on the official website.  To do this, just dial the combination of numbers * 110 * 0071 #.  As for the cancellation of the service, instead of 0071, you just need to enter 0070 - the rest of the combination will be the same. </p><h2>  Planet Zero </h2><p>  The latest tariff plan with which easy roaming is provided, Beeline called Planet Zero.  To be honest, the marketing ploy, aimed at suggesting the subscriber accessibility of services at this tariff, plays a large part in this name.  In particular, this concerns the absence of a fee for incoming calls.  However, this is not worth much to rejoice. </p><p>  When you start looking for how to enable roaming on Beeline according to this plan, you will understand that not everything is as beautiful and profitable as the operator tried to submit.  According to the terms of use, the subscriber must pay 60 rubles for each day of using the tariff.  At the same time, incoming calls are really free - but only from the 1st to the 20th minute of the conversation.  Then begins a charge of 10 rubles per minute. </p><p>  As for outgoing calls, their cost is 20 rubles per minute, provided that the subscriber is located in one of the ‚Äúcountries on the list‚Äù.  If the user is located in another state, the cost of services will increase to 100 rubles per day of subscription and 15 rubles.  - for incoming from 21 minutes, as well as 45 rubles - for every minute of outgoing calls. </p><p>  To activate the service, you need to enter the command * 110 * 331 #.  True, you should not rush into this - it‚Äôs better to go to the Beeline website (‚ÄúTariffs‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoaming‚Äù - in these sections) and read all the information regarding certain plans yourself.  This will allow you to once again identify the features of certain packages, understand what the operator offers for the amount indicated in the conditions and, finally, make an independent decision. </p><p>  We also recommend that you view information about additional options, for example, about the possibility of buying up Internet traffic in case the limit of your basic plan is exhausted;  or find out how much it will cost to increase the package of minutes for calls outside the country where you are. </p>
