    <h2>  Popular rock routes </h2><p>  The village of Planicheskaya Shche annually receives more than one thousand tourists.  This small village in the Seversky region of the Krasnodar Territory, located on the Afips River, is currently gaining popularity primarily with its rocks.  They are also called Planic.  They laid excellent rocky routes with various categories of difficulty.  Moreover, they are, in fact, the closest to the city of Krasnodar.  Perhaps this explains their outstanding popularity both among climbers and ordinary tourists.  On weekends, there are always a lot of people on Planic Rocks or on the Planes, as they are popularly called.  They are stretched almost three hundred meters.  Composed of armored sandstone, these cliffs reach a height of twenty-two meters. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the village there are two objects well known to tourists.  These are Planic rocks and Reds.  The first locals call Golden Stones, while the second Naumovsky, in memory of the famous climber V.P. Naumenko. </p><p>  Red and Planic rocks are very close to each other.  They became especially famous in the country in the seventies of the last century, when a tourist boom began in the Kuban. </p><p>  Then Planic rocks turned into a training ground for climbers and climbers preparing for more serious peaks.  They perform this function to this day. </p>

    <h2>  Just relax </h2><p>  People come to the Planar Slit just to be distracted.  The townspeople are attracted by the fresh air here, the noisy forest that sprawls around the village, mountain streams and just pleasant sensations. </p><p>  The Planar Slit from Krasnodar is only sixty kilometers away.  The road from the city takes only an hour and a half.  And only the last ten minutes of the journey have to go on an unpaved primer, which, however, is in a fairly good condition. </p><h2>  Recreation center </h2><p>  Those who prefer to rest "savages", pitch tents on the banks of the river Afips, enjoy barbecue and relax after picking mushrooms.  But those who prefer comfort can stay at <span>the</span> Plancheskaya <span>recreation center</span> , located in the village itself.  The complex consists of cozy wooden houses, always ready to accept both noisy companies and vacationers with children. </p><p>  You can come here for a few days or just for a picnic.  There are gazebos equipped with barbecue facilities, wooden tables and benches in the shade of trees, which can be rented for several hours.  Depending on the number of vacationers, you can rent four-, eight-, ten and sixteen-seater houses. </p>
