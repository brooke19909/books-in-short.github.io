    <h2>  Why do you need an assessment </h2><p>  When applying to a financial organization for registration of a mortgage on an apartment, the borrower may ask why it is necessary to evaluate the apartment?  For Sberbank and other credit organizations, this is one way to protect themselves from malicious defaulters or those borrowers who find themselves in a hopeless situation and can no longer repay monthly payments. </p><p>  For example, a certain family decided to purchase housing on a mortgage.  The choice is made, only money is needed.  People go to the bank, which provides them with the necessary amount.  After some time, due to unforeseen circumstances, it turns out that the family is not able to pay monthly payments.  Bank for non-payment sells this housing in order to pay back the loan.  But the money from the sale may not be enough to fully repay the debt, and it turns out that the credit institution worked in the red. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And this is one example.  And if there are not one or two such situations, then the bank will simply go bankrupt.  For this, we need a preliminary <span>assessment of real estate so</span> that a financial institution can calculate all possible risks. </p><h2>  Evaluation Sequence </h2><p>  Appraising an apartment in a new building for Sberbank is not a complicated matter.  All that is needed is to take your time and stick to some algorithm in your actions.  Firstly, it is necessary to prepare all documents and a certain amount for valuation work. </p>

    <h2>  Valuation Companies </h2><p>  Appraisal of an apartment for Sberbank is carried out exclusively by appraisal companies that have passed the accreditation of this bank.  The companies themselves do not belong to Sberbank itself and are independent, and the accreditation passed indicates that the appraiser has been verified by the bank and can be trusted. </p><p>  At the same time, the minimum requirements that companies of appraisers must comply with are as follows: </p><ul><li>  the presence of at least two people; </li><li>  the employee must have at least three years of work experience; </li><li>  the presence of insurance poles worth more than 3 million rubles .; </li><li>  the company must be a member of the SRO; </li><li>  the absence of any debts to Sberbank. </li></ul><p>  Naturally, the question arises of how to find the companies that evaluate the apartment for Sberbank?  Accredited companies are listed on the bank‚Äôs website in the section ‚ÄúRegister of Sberbank Appraisers‚Äù.  This need is associated with more frequent cases of fraud and the development of all kinds of risks. </p><h2>  Why does the bank need such cooperation? </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartment valuation for Sberbank" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1699307.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  Appraisal of an apartment is a process in which in any case three parties take part: the borrower, the appraiser and the lender.  If the outcome is positive, everyone remains the winner.  A person receives the necessary amount for the purchase of housing, the bank - the confidence that the appraisal company did not fail him, and the latter, in turn, is rated for future work.  Any oversight in the submitted report will entail a refusal to issue funds and withdraw accreditation. </p><p>  Not every company can evaluate an apartment.  The accreditation of Sberbank issued to the appraiser is a kind of confirmation of the honesty and experience of a company that knows all the requirements of this financial institution and fulfills them.  Consequently, the borrower does not have to face the return of the report and its revision. </p>
