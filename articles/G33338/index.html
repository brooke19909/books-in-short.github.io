It is here that you can find a huge number of architectural monuments of the VIII-X centuries, which miraculously survived after numerous fires and hostilities.  The city is also one of the largest industrial centers in Russia, it actively produces food and chemical products, as well as radio electronics. </p><p>  The city is a millionaire and continues to expand actively due to the merging settlements located near Voronezh.  A large number of museums and other monuments of architecture and culture allows you to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe current state of the city and the changes that have occurred with it in the course of history. </p><h2>  Moscow </h2>

    <p>  The capital annually receives several thousand guests, among whom are surely those who would like to move and acquire the favorable social status of a Muscovite.  The Voronezh-Moscow bus, which runs daily, does not always cope with the flow of passengers, very often additional flights are assigned, which are served by high-capacity cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital is called the city of opportunities, it is here that you can find a suitable job, make new friends, discover something new in yourself or just get acquainted with local attractions.  The route ‚ÄúVoronezh-Moscow‚Äù is popular with those residents of the south who are going to the capital to enter and make a transfer in this city.  The number of guests in Belokamennaya increases during the holidays, as well as in early September, when the capital of Russia celebrates its birthday. </p><h2>  Riding a bus </h2>

    <p>  The Voronezh-Moscow bus daily runs between the two cities with an interval of 30-120 minutes.  The travel time will be from 6.5 to 9 hours; comfortable buses equipped with everything you need are offered at your service.  The fare will range from 800 to 1000 rubles, depending on the time of departure and movement on the way.  All buses leave from the Voronezh bus station, and disembarkation in Moscow takes place near the Paveletskaya metro station. </p><p>  You can also take advantage of passing flights, in which Voronezh is an intermediate stop.  They move somewhat faster, the average travel time on such flights along the Voronezh-Moscow route and vice versa is 7.5-8 hours.  The main advantage of these flights is completely different destination points (Kursky Station, Lyublino metro station, etc.), so you can choose the most convenient flight and use it to get to the right point in Moscow.  The bus timetable is best clarified at the box office of the capital or Voronezh bus station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rail travel </h2>

    <p>  Another way with which you can travel along the Moscow-Voronezh route is by train, with it you can reach your destination in an average of 11-14 hours.  There are a number of trains that are high-speed, and cover the distance between two cities in 7-8 hours, for example, No. 045/046, which is equipped with <span>double-decker</span> luxury <span>cars</span> .  The cost of tickets in this case will range from 800 to 7.5 thousand rubles, it will depend on the type of car in which you plan to go.  The cheapest trip will cost a reserved seat, the most expensive - in a suite. </p><p>  If you are traveling on the Moscow-Voronezh route, the train will most likely take you to <span>Voronezh</span> I <span>station</span> , but trains moving in the opposite direction most often arrive at Kursky or Kazan station, only a few trains arrive at Paveletsky station, therefore, when buying a ticket, be sure to specify where your train will arrive.  The train schedule on this route can be found at any railway ticket office, as well as on the official website of Russian Railways.  Please note that the schedule is constantly changing, some trains are introduced and canceled depending on the time of year. </p><h2>  How far to go? </h2>

    <p>  If you are going to take the Moscow-Voronezh route, the distance between the two cities will be 516 kilometers, this should be borne in mind if you go with young children or pensioners.  It can be overcome in 7-8 hours when driving at a speed of 80-90 kilometers per hour.  The highway has a fairly large number of campsites, cafes and parking lots, so if necessary, you can stop and relax at any time. </p><p>  According to motorists, the quality of the route between Moscow and Voronezh is not too high, so it is best to take along a spare wheel and all the necessary tools.  Of course, it is necessary to withstand the high-speed mode in order to prevent emergencies.  Pay particular attention to signs, as there are a large number of difficult sections on this highway. </p><h2>  Other ways </h2><p>  You can also travel along the Voronezh-Moscow route using various additional services, for example, when several passengers gather in one car and fold onto the road.  This is a fairly convenient way in terms of costs, but most often you have to go in cramped conditions, in addition, no one knows if you are lucky with fellow travelers or not. </p><p>  Many <span>travel by hitchhiking,</span> and truckers happily drive up random fellow travelers.  But such trips are more suitable for young people who travel light.  If you do not feel the strength for such a trip or if you have too much luggage with you, it is best to choose a more traditional vehicle. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now that you know what the Voronezh-Moscow route is, how to get to the capital and how much time you have to spend on the road, the trip will be easy and enjoyable.  Most of the buses running on this route have built-in bathrooms, due to this it is possible to significantly reduce travel time. </p><p>  Rail transport will also offer you a range of additional services.  Each train has a restaurant car, an additional baggage car, the guides will be happy to bring you tea at your first request.  Have a nice trip! </p>
