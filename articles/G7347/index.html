And every citizen should know about them.  Otherwise, you can get a huge number of problems with the law.  In particular, with the tax service.  At the moment, all citizens who officially receive a profit are taxed.  This is the so-called income tax.  It is 13% of the <span>salary.</span>  But is it always?  Is it possible to somehow reduce it?  Or even remove?  What profit is taxed?  Is it valid for all citizens? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="income tax is 13 on wages" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1481765.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is taxed </h2><p>  Not really.  Some people do not pay income tax.  And not everyone transfers part of their profits to the tax service.  What restrictions apply in this regard in 2016? </p><p>  <span>Income tax</span> has been 13% of wages for many years in the Russian Federation.  It is due for payment by all citizens who receive official profits.  It is not necessary to work according to the work book.  After all, this payment is put for: </p><ul><li>  earnings at work; </li><li>  profit received as a result of the sale of property; </li><li>  rental of real estate / apartment; </li><li>  income received as a result of doing business; </li><li>  earnings outside the Russian Federation; </li><li>  winnings. </li></ul><p>  But some sources of profit are not subject to this payment.  Which ones? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is not taxed </h2><p>  Personal income tax (from salary) always takes place.  But some sources of receiving funds do not require the payment of this penalty to the tax service.  What specific situations are we talking about? </p><p>  The following are not taxable: </p><ul><li>  profit from property owned by a person for more than 3 years; </li><li>  allowances; </li><li>  pensions; </li><li>  social payments; </li><li>  inheritance; </li><li>  profits transferred by donations from close relatives. </li></ul><h2>  Is it always 13% </h2><p>  Accordingly, in some cases, you can not pay the specified percent of the profits.  No other benefits are provided.  But is income tax always equal to 13% of wages? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much income tax" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1481766.jpg"></div>

    <p>  To answer this question is not so difficult.  Many people think that yes, all profits are taxed by such a payment.  In reality, everything is somewhat different. </p><p>  In Russia, the rules currently apply, according to which 13% are paid by organizations and citizens who are residents of the country.  Under certain circumstances, income tax is reduced or increased.  The second option in practice is much more common. </p><p>  If we talk about official earnings, then yes, 13% will have to pay all citizens of the Russian Federation.  And no exceptions are provided in this area. </p><h2>  Other rates </h2><p>  And under what circumstances will it be possible to transfer more or less earnings to the tax authorities?  It is enough to study the established legislation to answer this question. </p><p>  How much income tax will be if the payer is a citizen of another country?  Foreigners transfer 30% of their profits.  15% - tax on income received from Russian organizations by non-residents of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Less than the indicated interest rates are paid when it comes to profit on dividends until 2015 or received on bonds issued before 2007.  In practice, such situations are extremely rare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax on salaries" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1481764.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In most cases, income tax is 13% of wages.  But you have to pay more for a win.  At the moment, if a person wins something, he must pay 35% of the value of the prize or give the indicated share of money. </p><p>  Perhaps this is all tax rates for profits received by organizations and individuals.  It turns out that with official earnings you always have to give 13% to the state.  It is not planned to change this rule so far. </p>
