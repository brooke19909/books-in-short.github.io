    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  The hotel in question has a very good location.  So, from the city center of Side it is only one kilometer away.  Thus, all the entertainment and infrastructure of a major tourist center are within walking distance for hotel guests.  The distance to Manavgat is five kilometers.  The nearest airport to the hotel is in Antalya, 65 kilometers from Side.  Thus, after arriving in this air harbor, the road to the Gera Park Hotel will take you just over an hour.  And along the way, you can not only enjoy the local scenery from the windows of a car or bus, but also listen to the entertaining story of the guide about the features of this region (in case the transfer will be arranged for you by a tour operator).  The hotel in question also has its own magnificent sandy beach.  It is only 150 meters away.  There are both sun loungers and parasols, as well as equipment for water activities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As for the rooms, then mainly our compatriots were satisfied with them.  However, for some tourists the rooms seemed cramped.  The other part of travelers assures that the room in the rooms is quite enough for comfortable accommodation.  Also, experienced tourists are advised not to be afraid to take rooms on the lower floors of the hotel, since the music in the Hera Park Hotel 4 * bar plays quietly.  The noise from the disco will also not interfere with your sleep.  In addition, living on the lower floors, you protect yourself from the need to expect an elevator, but you can easily get by the stairs.  As for filling the rooms, then they have everything you need.  In addition, furniture and appliances are in excellent working condition.  Pleased with our compatriots and the presence of Russian television channels.  Cleaning the rooms, according to the guests, carried out efficiently and in a timely manner.  Linen and a towel were also changed regularly.  In addition, the maids were not too lazy to build various nice figures from towels and sheets for hotel guests.

The beach itself is very clean, sandy.  The entry into the water is gentle, convenient for small children.  The only minus of the vacationers considered a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach, as a result of which many sunbeds do not fit here.
