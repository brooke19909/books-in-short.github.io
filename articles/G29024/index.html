  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paper plastic: animal, color schemes, explanations, recommendations for working with children</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Paper plastic, the schemes of which are very diverse, is an art form in which paper is the main material.  This type of work is similar to a mixture of origami and kirigami, however, unlike them, it has a hollow structure and, as it were, is a shell of the depicted object.  The works are created on a flat background, have an outward resemblance to paintings or <span>volumetric applications.</span> </p><p>  Paper is moody, but fairly obedient and appreciative.  With some perseverance, real masterpieces are created.  Sculptures, which allows you to create paper, are not inferior in beauty and perfection to marble, and their availability is many times higher. </p><h2>  Materials and Tools </h2><p>  Before you begin, you must select the right materials.  The variety of textures offered by the market of goods for creativity favorably collaborates with this area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  Usually, several <span>types of paper are used</span> that successfully shade each other.  The strongest cardboard, thin corrugated paper, mica, old newspapers or magazines - any material is useful. </p><p>  Of the auxiliary tools with which the product itself is assembled, scissors and glue are most often used, rarely a ruler and a pencil.  Each master is free to use the tool that will allow him to give the paper the desired shape and securely fix it.  It is worth considering the features of each material in the work - traces of excess glue may remain on light and thin paper, and thick cardboard is easier to cut through with a scalpel or clerical knife. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does the work look like </h2><p>  The technology is simple, easy to learn.  However, getting down to the beginning, it is also necessary to take into account the texture of the material selected for the paper technology.  The schemes that the process will follow may suggest folding the tube or conveying the paper in a convex shape.  Paper curl is necessary only along the fibers.  Direction is determined using a simple experiment.  Having cut off two small strips of the same length and width, they are twisted into a spiral with a pencil.  In one embodiment, the spiral will turn out to be elastic and even, in another - the surface of the paper will be covered with small kinks with bends.  In a smooth spiral, the fibers are arranged along, this should be taken into account in the work. </p><p>  The main manipulations are wrapping and gluing sheets of paper previously cut with scissors.  To give them the desired shape, auxiliary tools are used. </p><h2>  Paper plastic for children </h2><p>  The construction of various figures from paper, in which new artistic images are created, associative relations arise and new models are built - this is paper plastic.  The schemes for working with children are no different from those for working with adults. </p><p>  In the process of creativity, brain regions are activated that are responsible for the development of intellectual and creative activity in the child.  Also, the work teaches you to plan your activities, because paper does not tolerate errors and it is most often impossible to correct them.  The development of eye coordination and hand movements during work helps in the future to easily master writing and coordinate finger movements. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper plastic schemes for children" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12967/1558613.jpg" width="350"></div>

Schemes for children should be just that.  Starting to master the new methodology, the child must rely on the already formed basic principles of application.  Sensomotor development that occurs in this case is especially useful in preschool age, as it is strongly associated with the development of motor and mental activity.  Attractive for the child, the processes of creating from a simple flat sheet of paper a complex and recognizable image activate various parts of the brain. </p><p>  As a result, attracting the child to creativity, it implements paper plastic schemes for the development of creativity and motor functions, without which the introduction into society is almost impossible. </p><p>  In this case, the tasks are solved: </p><ul><li>  development of creativity and cognitive interest; </li><li>  increase productive as well as speech activity; </li><li>  the development of imaginative and spatial thinking; </li><li>  improved hand coordination and fine motor skills; </li><li>  formation of self-reliance skills; </li><li>  development of artistic taste and spatial sphere. </li></ul><h2>  What to make of paper </h2><p>  Aesthetically as well as emotionally attractive paper plastic.  Flowers, whose patterns also evolve from simple to complex, can be realized most realistically. </p>

    <p>  Lilies, crocuses, tulips are similar to real ones, however they will not fade and will delight the eye with beauty for a long time. </p><p>  In order to create a flower, you need A4 paper (3 sheets of delicate color), scissors, glue, a sheet of paper for the base. </p><p>  From album sheets, oval-shaped leaves are first cut out.  With the help of scissors they bend a little inward.  To give the future petal a shape, it is necessary to gently iron the petal with the handle of scissors so that it takes a concave shape.  When all the petals are ready, they must be glued with glue on a circle to each other, with a slight overlap.  Leaves are made in the same way as petals, only the size of the cut sheet should be several times larger than the petal. </p>

    <p>  What else allows you to create paper plastic?  Animals whose patterns are diverse will delight nature lovers.  Birds, the creation of which is a pleasure, will decorate the house with fluttering wings.  Particularly good models of the <span>head of a deer</span> or, for example, a butterfly.  Often with the help of paper sheets whole panels are created with a clearly traceable plot, as well as individual paintings. </p><h2>  Work application </h2><p>  In the technology of paper plastic, you can create not only elements of the plant or animal world, but also copies of architectural structures. </p>
