Since then, gambling has become almost the main source of income for the principality and the ruling family.  And Monaco has become the most expensive and fashionable resort in Europe.  Four cities located on the territory of the principality have conditional borders and smoothly pass one into another.  The capital of Monaco has the same name as the mini-state.  Monte Carlo has a world famous casino.  La Condamine is a principality seaport.  Fontvieille is a closed region for tourists, the industrial center of the country.  The Principality of Monaco is, first of all, an elite vacation.  Luxury reigns here literally everywhere: restaurants, night clubs, spas, beaches, streets.  Therefore, speaking about the hotels of Monaco, first of all, it is necessary to talk about elite, world famous hotels.  In the La Condamine area you can find a relatively budget hostel or small hotel, but you can‚Äôt talk about low prices.  The article gives a brief overview of the best hotels in Monaco. </p><h2>  The Hermitage Hotel </h2><p>  The chic Hermitage Hotel is located in the center of Monte Carlo, a four-minute walk from the famous casino.  The architecture of the building and the interior interiors resemble the palace of the Prince of Monaco.  In 2003, the hotel was completely renovated, while maintaining its original appearance.  Ancient luxury is combined here with the most modern level of service.  Huge rooms of the hotel are decorated with luxury furniture and decorated in red and white colors.  Almost all of the windows offer wonderful views of the harbor.  The hotel has two hundred and eighty rooms, accommodation in one of which will cost two thousand euros per day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of monaco" class="if uuid-2279854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2279854.jpg"></div><p>  The Hermitage is famous for its thalassotherapy center, conservatory and restaurant with delicious fish dishes.  There is also a fitness center, two large pools, eight conference rooms and a spa. </p><h2>  Hotel "Paris" </h2><p>  One of Monaco's oldest hotels, Paris, was built in the mid-nineteenth century.  In the legendary empire-style palace, world celebrities and representatives of bohemia love to visit.  Hotel Paris has 191 rooms, most of which are suites of the highest class.  The interior is made in bright colors, real antiques harmoniously combined with modern amenities.  Living in this luxurious place will cost from one thousand euros per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="luxurylaunches.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monaco hotels" class="if uuid-2279844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2279844.jpg"></div><p>  Particularly noteworthy are the hotel restaurants, which are recognized by world centers of high gastronomy, and the best wine cellars store more than six hundred thousand bottles of rare and expensive wine. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel "Monte Carlo Bay" </h2><p>  This hotel is famous for its vast territory of 4 hectares and a warm lagoon with a soft sandy bottom.  The hotel itself is built in a neoclassical style, with many columns and arches.  The chic rooms have spacious balconies with sea views.  In total, the hotel has 334 rooms, the cost of accommodation in which will be from three hundred euros per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.monaco-saltlakecity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monaco hotels 5 stars" class="if uuid-2279862" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2279862.jpg"></div><p>  Among the 5-star Monaco hotels, Monte Carlo Bay stands out for its <span>Michelin-starred</span> restaurant <span>.</span>  The hotel grounds are worthy of special admiration.  It is decorated with gardens, parks, waterfalls, terraces and gazebos and resembles a truly heavenly place. </p><p>  The hotel also offers its guests tennis courts, golf and squash courts, spa and gym services. </p><p>  The hotel often hosts business events: conferences and seminars.  For this, the "Monte Carlo Bay" created the perfect infrastructure. </p><p>  The hotel has repeatedly received high awards and prizes in the hospitality industry. </p><h2>  Hotel "Metropol" </h2><p>  In the center of the capital of Monaco is another legendary <span>hotel "Metropol".</span>  The building, built in 1886, combines Baroque and Art Nouveau styles.  Although the Metropol underwent reconstruction in 2004, all elements of the style were preserved: ancient tapestries, majestic columns, upholstered walls and stucco moldings on high ceilings.  The hotel is a favorite place of residence for representatives of the ruling elite, aristocracy and world stars.  Accommodation in this fashionable place costs from four hundred euros per day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.metropole.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monte Carlo hotels" class="if uuid-2279867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48915/2279867.jpg"></div><p>  "Metropol" is distinguished by refined, elegant luxury and impeccable service. </p><h2>  Hotel Meridian </h2><p>  Among the hotels in Monaco, Meridian should be noted separately.  Firstly, it is built in a modern style and the only one has its own beach.  These are two tall glass towers filled with light.  The Meridian Hotel has 430 rooms, equipped and decorated to the highest class.  The pride of the "Meridian" are luxury apartments on the roof of high-rises with personal service.  The local restaurant offers its own concept of Mediterranean cuisine. </p><p>  It is worth noting the Marine Club, located on the territory of the hotel.  This is a separate modern complex, where various business events of the highest level are held. </p><p>  Holidays in Monaco hotels are expensive and not everyone's pleasure.  But if you are lucky enough to visit this wonderful principality, it will be like a trip to a fairy tale. </p>
