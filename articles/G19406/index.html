This can largely explain the popularity of the southern destinations.  Of course, among modern tourists there are many true connoisseurs of culture, architecture and antiquity, but if you choose between excursions and the beach, most vacationers are likely to prefer the beach.  But there is a universal option.  How do you like Greece?  This is a country with a centuries-old history, an ancient culture, which is located in one of the most beautiful places on the planet. </p>

    <p>  Crete is perhaps the most popular Greek island washed by several seas.  Historians call it a center of intersection of cultures, primarily Europe and Asia, which is why this place is really colorful.  Even a huge number of tourists and vacationers could not break his peace, humility, culture and uniqueness.  Here, every tourist will find something to do: chic beaches and warm, gentle sea provide opportunities for an excellent beach holiday, and the abundance of really beautiful scenic spots allows you to make the resort's excursion program rich and varied.  If we talk about the <span>hotels of Crete,</span> they are presented in full variety: there are luxurious villas with a vast territory, as well as simpler, sweeter and more comfortable hotels of a city type.  Good service, comfortable rooms and well-developed infrastructure are what distinguish hotels in Crete.  We offer an overview of the mid-range hotel Malia Central 3 *.  It is often advertised by tour operators working with Greece.  Reviews of real vacationers will help to make an objective assessment and understand what conditions await potential guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  Hotel Malia Central Apartments 3 * could not earn a high rating on the largest tourist portals, but our task is to understand why it did not live up to the expectations of vacationers.  If you believe the description of the administration, the hotel is located in the center of the resort village of Malia, just 400 meters from the coast.  <span>Heraklion</span> International <span>Airport is</span> only 30 km away, while the nearest major city of Hersonissos is 7 km away.  That is why we can quite safely say that the hotel is in the center of the resort life of the island, and its vacationers will have access to all infrastructure facilities. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Before booking a hotel, it‚Äôs good to get to know its location first.  So, this option is located in a busy area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort: if it‚Äôs still quite quiet during the day, then loud music doesn‚Äôt stop on the streets in the evening, nightly places open on every corner.  This is a great place for young people to relax - they will definitely not be bored here. </p><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Hotel Malia Central 3 *, like most others in Crete, operates in accordance with certain rules, which all potential vacationers should be aware of.  First of all, there are rooms for non-smokers only.  Pets are not allowed in the hotel, which is why if you decide to go on a trip with your four-legged friend, you will have to find another place.  At the same time, the hotel is equipped with everything necessary for children of any age; upon check-in, parents will be provided with a separate sleeping place for the crumbs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Check-in takes place from 14:00, and eviction - until 12:00.  All vacationers should understand: do not expect that they will be settled ahead of schedule.  All that the hotel administration can offer is the ability to leave things for temporary storage at the reception.  And another important point: the hotel accepts payment only in cash. </p><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  By local standards, the Malia Central 3 * hotel (Crete) is quite small.  Guests are offered a choice of 28 rooms of various categories: double rooms with a balcony, triple rooms, as well as one-room apartments, which can accommodate up to four people at a time.  The arrangement of the rooms is quite simple, modest: the walls are painted, the furniture is far from new, it is very small, but quite enough for relaxation. </p>

    <p>  Each room has a private bathroom, a set of furniture necessary for sleeping and relaxing, as well as a balcony.  If you give preference to apartments, then in addition to the equipped recreation area, you will receive a separate kitchen with household appliances and electronics. </p><p>  So, it remains only to understand how the situation is in fact in the rooms of the Malia Central 3 * hotel (Crete).  The reviews of tourists suggest that not everything is as rosy as we would like.  Some descriptions say that there is a hairdryer in the room - so it is not there, which is why for those vacationers for whom this point is of principle it is better to take the hair dryer with you so as not to experience disappointment after checking into the room.  If we talk about a sleeping place, then there are no complaints about it: the mattresses are comfortable, the linens are clean, fresh - therefore, sleeping and relaxing here will be great. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Perhaps the main drawback of the Malia Central 3 * hotel for many vacationers was just the bathroom.  Ventilation works disgustingly, maybe it is not at all thought out by the structure of the building.  Accordingly, the bath is always humid, smells of dampness - even to be here for several minutes is unpleasant.  The shower is primitive;  in some rooms, the drain is clogged to such an extent that the water stands for an hour.  Plumbing looks as if nobody had washed or cleaned it for several years, so it probably doesn‚Äôt work as well as we would like.  There are sometimes interruptions in the supply of hot water. </p><p>  The lack of air conditioning in the room will also disappoint vacationers: it is quite hot in the season.  The hotel administration partially took into account the claims of customers and equipped some of the rooms with climate control equipment, however, it is used at an additional cost. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Malia Central 3 * offers guests breakfast in its own restaurant.  All those who purchased a food tour regretted it, because they had breakfast anyway, either on the beach or in local cafes.  Breakfast is more than scarce, even the average tourist is definitely not full.  That is why, even at the stage of acquiring a tour, it is better to refuse food.  Not far from the hotel there are enough taverns, cafes where the best chefs of the island will introduce you to their culinary masterpieces. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The front desk is open around the clock.  Tourists can count on the help of kind staff at any time of the day or night.  But this is only ideal.  In practice, even in the evening to find at least one of the staff is quite problematic.  Yes, and multilingual staff can not dream of - only some hotel staff speak English, and then at the initial level. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Of course, all vacationers in Crete are interested in what service the Malia Central 3 * can offer.  Reviews of tourists confirm that the hotel service is not bad: at the reception you can book tickets and book a transfer to the airport.  Moreover, here you can get acquainted with the rich excursion program of the resort and choose for yourself the most interesting offers.  For an additional fee, you can use the laundry services, as well as scan documents and send a fax.  If you can‚Äôt forget about work even on vacation, you‚Äôll have to deal with some business and matters, the availability of office equipment in the hotel will definitely please. </p><p>  Rooms are not cleaned every day, towels and bed linen are changed only once per week stay.  Many tourists complain that there is no result of staying in the room of a cleaning lady: even garbage from the basket is not always thrown away.  Most likely, the staff is only sweeping, there is no question of any wet cleaning.  Tourists will have to keep their rooms clean. </p>

    <p>  Wireless high-speed internet is available on site.  Connection to it is at an additional cost.  But it‚Äôs better not to overpay and use the Internet in public places, for example, the nearest cafe.  The speed is decent: it is quite enough to view mail, share with friends and acquaintances messages and photos through applications and social networks, and even watch movies. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  The territory of the Malia Central Apartments 3 * hotel is quite small, we can say that it is simply not there.  There is a small pool, clean enough, with umbrellas and sun loungers.  It is enough to sunbathe and swim. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Only 400 meters from the Malia Central 3 * hotel is a public sandy beach.  Walk to it for 7-10 minutes in a calm step.  The beach is excellent, the sea is clean and incredibly warm.  If you prefer a beach holiday, then, having barely been on the coast, you will simply forget about all the shortcomings of the hotel.  Along the sea you can rent an umbrella with a sunbed, as well as sports equipment and various water activities.  Here you can have a bite to eat: locals will pamper you with amazing seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as soft drinks. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  So, the hotel Malia Central Apartments 3 * (Greece, Malia) is a budget hotel with enough shortcomings.  But if, when going on vacation, first of all you pay attention to the resort itself, its infrastructure, beach, hotel room you need only for an overnight stay, and this option may become suitable.  Moreover, living in it is more than budget.  If you, as a tourist, are not confused by the discovered flaws, you can safely book a hotel room. </p>
