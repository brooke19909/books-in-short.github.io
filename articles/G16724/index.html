Therefore, anyone who wants to breed trout can buy fry here.  In addition to carp and trout, scientists have established the elimination of white fish.  A repair herd has already been formed, which gives hope for a quick recovery of the population.  The fish has a wonderful taste and significant nutritional value, which is why it has undergone mass extermination and was listed in the Red Book as disappearing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  For tourists and residents of Kislovodsk, trout farming offers fishing in ponds.
