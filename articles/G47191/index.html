It slowly decomposes and rots in the soil for centuries.  Why not take a little care of the planet and adapt the trash to make it serve you and your home?  But for this you need to give him a second life.  And let this life be brighter and more beautiful than in the form of an ordinary flask.  After all, what crafts can be made from plastic bottles!  Just awesome!  Craftsmen not only adapt the containers cut in half to protect the seedlings of roses from frost, they also create the roses themselves.  And from the bottles you can make candy cans, vases and even a holder for a cell phone! </p><p>  But let's talk about beautiful decorations for your garden, balcony and living room.  In order to make flowers from plastic bottles with your own hands, you will need paper, a marker, a candle, sharp scissors, nail polish, wire, tweezers or pliers.  And a large number of used jars, of course.  Part of the work will have to be done outdoors or in a well-ventilated area.  Since you have to work with open fire, take precautions: work on the iron surface, avoid ignition of various household utensils. </p><p>  So, we begin to work.  What do we want to create: poppy, rose, lotus, tulip?  The algorithm of our actions will depend on which flowers from plastic bottles we ‚Äúgrow‚Äù.  Let's start, as a warm-up, with the lightest - a tulip.  If you have a small half-liter bottle, draw a star with 8-10 rays on paper.  Cut her out.  Apply the stencil strictly to the middle of the bottom of the bottle, we bend the edges of the star to the sides of the flask.  Circle the stencil with a marker and cut the plastic.  Let it not bother you that you have a crown, not a flower.  We pass to fresh air and proceed to the second stage. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We light a candle and bring the teeth of the crown to the flame.  It is important not to overdo it: the plastic should only heat up, and not catch fire, blacken or begin to bubble.  With tweezers or pliers we form the tulip petals, quietly pulling them out.  Thus, we create a cup.  Flowers from plastic bottles will turn out prettier if we give them a bright, saturated color.  For this we use nail polish and our own imagination.  While the varnish dries, take on the stems.  Take the top of the flask and cut out a spiral from it (as if we were cleaning an apple).  With this curl using a candle, to make the plastic supple, we wrap the wire.  The last tip is threaded into the sepal bottom (for this, we make a hole with scissors or an awl). </p><p>  You can also make flowers from plastic bottles with many petals - roses, poppies.  Then you will need several stencils of these parts of plants, where they will be of different sizes - from large (external) to small (internal).  Cut plastic according to these patterns.  For one flower, you may need several bottles.  Heating over the candle, form the petals.  The more stencils you have of different sizes, the more magnificent the future rose will be.  From the bottom, form the base of the flower, drill a few holes in the center.  Also, the hole should be at the bottom of each petal.  Now sew the semi-finished products to the base with threads.  It remains only to decorate your rose with nail polish. </p><p>  Flowers from plastic bottles look very stylish in the decoration of the garden.  If you have a 5-6 liter flask lying around, you can make it something amazing in the form of a water lily or lotus.  From the bottom, cut a beautiful flat sheet with a low edge sticking up.  Fuse the plastic in the flame of the candle to make it look natural.  Paint it with green <span>waterproof paint.</span>  Set a decorative frog on it (a finished sculpture or a rubber toy).  Carefully place the leaf in your little pond.  Now it will never turn yellow, and the amphibian will not escape anywhere. </p>
