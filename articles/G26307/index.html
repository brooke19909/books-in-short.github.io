On the shelves of domestic stores, a helmet can be bought in the region of 35 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  maximum immersion in virtual reality due to advanced sensors and sensors; </li><li>  matrix with a response of 2-3 ms; </li><li>  multi-platform; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  comfortable to wear design; </li><li>  attractive design; </li><li>  impressive delivery set. </li></ul><p>  No flaws were identified. </p><h2>  HP Windows Mixed Reality Headset </h2><p>  In third place in our ranking is a model from the well-known brand HP.

All this allows you to accurately track the user's position in the virtual world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.harveynorman.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HP Windows Mixed Reality Headset" class="if uuid-3231734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3231734.jpg"></div><p>  The visual portion rested on the shoulders of two 2.89-inch LCD displays each.  A resolution of 1440 by 1440 pixels is enough to display a picture in high detail.  Helmet viewing angles in the region of 95 degrees with a screen refresh rate of 90 Hz. </p><p>  Also, users were pleased with the availability of convenient branded controllers from Microsoft.  They are only slightly inferior in functionality to the two previous counterparts, but users do not note a critical difference. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  As for ergonomics, then from a habit the helmet may seem heavy.  800 grams for such equipment is really a lot, but the company almost completely leveled this minus due to the soft and comfortable headband, as well as competent weight distribution.  So users leave mostly positive reviews regarding the comfort of the device.  Helmet is a frequent visitor in specialized stores where you can buy it in the region of 30 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  almost complete immersion in the world of VR; </li><li>  convenient design; </li><li>  advanced integration in Windows 10; </li><li>  an abundance of interfaces for peripherals; </li><li>  high-quality assembly; </li><li>  Warranty from the manufacturer for 18 months. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  controllers work only on the bluetooth protocol; </li><li>  some have problems with IPD (Interpupillary Distance). </li></ul><h2>  Samsung Gear VR (SM-R325) </h2><p>  In the mid-price segment, this helmet has no equal.

As a result, the user receives a aligned and optimized image regardless of the plane of location. </p><div class="photo" data-original="siamrath.co.th" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Gear VR (SM-R325)" class="if uuid-3231737" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3231737.jpg"></div><p>  The ergonomics of the helmet did not disappoint.  The wireless touch joystick is equipped with a trigger and it is a pleasure to control it.  To connect mobile gadgets, micro-USB and Type-C interfaces are provided.  Synchronization takes place without problems, especially with devices from Samsung. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The model is in many ways superior to its competitors, but still it has disadvantages, and for domestic consumers it is even critical.  The fact is that the headset is ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù mainly for premium smartphones from Samsung and related branded applications. </p><p>  Games from the Oculus are also available, but you will have to pay for the worthy content.  Given that the domestic consumer prefers a freebie, this helmet has not gained enviable popularity in Russia.  Well, those who are used to paying for content, this device is completely satisfied.  The cost of the gadget varies around 8 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  soft adjustment of focal length; </li><li>  excellent viewing angles in the region of 101 degrees; </li><li>  comfortable to wear for long periods; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  community support "Oculus". </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  you have to pay for good gaming applications; </li><li>  some users complain about the quality of the lenses. </li></ul><h2>  Zeiss VR ONE Plus </h2><p>  The VR headset from a well-known German brand received a lot of praise from users around the world, including from Russian consumers.  For a complete immersion in the virtual world, you additionally need a smartphone with a normal gyroscope and accelerometer on board.  The helmet perfectly synchronizes with both the Android platform and iOS. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zeiss VR ONE Plus" class="if uuid-3231736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3231736.jpg"></div><p>  The device lacks functionality for optical settings, because there is no need for this.  The fact is that the manufacturer equipped his helmet with proprietary aspherical lenses, so that you can do without adjusting the interpupillary distance.  A range of 53-77 mm is enough for all categories of users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Zeiss VR ONE Plus helmet" class="if uuid-3231738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3231738.jpg"></div><p>  There are no complaints about the ergonomic part.

The cost of a helmet in the domestic market fluctuates around 5 thousand rubles, which is quite acceptable for the average gamer. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent viewing angles in the region of 100 degrees; </li><li>  an abundance of interfaces for connecting third-party peripherals; </li><li>  comfortable to wear for long periods; </li><li>  universal tray for smartphones; </li><li>  extremely high-quality assembly; </li><li>  the ability to upgrade to VR ONE Connect with two-handed controllers; </li><li>  attractive cost. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  no joystick included; </li><li>  no support for 6 inch screens. </li></ul>
