  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System concept</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  And in everyday life, and in technology, and in science, whenever they want to say something orderly, they use the concept of a system.  It is basic for both theoretical and practical disciplines.  Any system looks like a complex of interconnected phenomena, objects and information.  It can also be knowledge about society, nature, etc. </p><p>  <span>The concept of a system</span> can include any object that has the following basic features: </p><p>  - the desire to maintain their own structure; </p><p>  - the need for leadership, management. </p><p>  In addition to the main ones listed above, the concept of a system also includes the following properties: </p><p>  1. <span>Integrity.</span>  <span>This is an</span> indispensable feature of the system, since it is one whole, consisting of several parts, which may vary in quality, but, nevertheless, are well combined and interact. </p><p>  2. Stable relations between the elements themselves or their attributes.  The system cannot exist if this internal connection is weaker than the connection with those parts that are not part of it. </p><p>  3. The presence of the organization.  This feature is characterized by a lower degree of uncertainty of the system compared to the degree of uncertainty of those factors that form it and generally determine the possibility of its creation. </p><p>  4. Emergence.  This feature means that the whole system has properties that none of its elements taken separately have.  And in turn, this indicates that it is not only a combination of these parts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The concept of a system implies that it can belong to one of three types: </p><p>  1. Social.  It is characterized by the presence of both elements connected with each other, and a person. </p><p>  2. Biological.  It includes the animal and plant world of the planet. </p><p>  3. Technical.  It includes all products intended for use by people and having instructions (for example, machines, computers, various equipment). </p><p>  These three subsystems, in turn, can be: </p><p>  1. Natural.  They are created by society or nature itself.  For example, a land use system consisting of several cycles;  the universe;  a strategy designed to ensure the stable development of the world economy. </p><p>  2. Artificial systems.  They are created by people in order to realize the goals and objectives outlined earlier.  <span>This is a</span> student <span>union</span> , family, political organization, formed during the election campaign. </p><p>  3. Predictable, or deterministic systems.  They work according to the rules that are set in advance and the result of which is predetermined.  This, for example, the production of a certain type of product, the process of training students.  This also includes the <span>concept of an operating system</span> consisting of programs aimed at making the most efficient use of all possible resources of a computing system. </p><p>  4. Probabilistic systems.  They are influenced by both internal and external environment, and their results are predictable in advance.  This, for example, a lotto game, entrepreneurial activity, units engaged in scientific research. </p><p>  5. Open systems.  They are directly related to the environment and depend on it.  This includes the concept of the tax system, and commercial firms, and <span>local governments,</span> and the press, radio and television. </p><p>  6. Closed systems.  They are created by people or companies to satisfy the interests and needs of only their circle.  This, for example, the organization of Masons, the Eastern family, <span>political parties.</span> </p><p>  Absolutely all the mentioned <span>properties of the system are</span> characteristic for any organization.  If at least one of the signs falls out, it will cease to exist.  That is, the main condition for the functioning of the organization is its systemic nature. </p>
