Soviet schoolchildren from the late USSR sang indecent rhymes during breaks with the mention of his name.  Of course, they did it out of children's stupidity, and not because of opposition views.  Over time, some of those who sang began to be ashamed of their act, and another part to this day sees this as a contribution to the debunking of the myths of war.  But the true story of the boy was much more dramatic than the one that teachers spoke about in schools.  This does not make Marat‚Äôs feat less significant.  On the contrary, the boy‚Äôs courage and dedication is even more respected. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Kazey Marat Ivanovich, whose feat will be described in this article, was born in the village of Stankovo ‚Äã‚Äã(Belarus) in 1929.  The boy's father was a convinced communist.  In the past, Ivan Kazei served in the Baltic Fleet.  He named his son in honor of the battleship on which he was a sailor.  And he gave his daughter an unusual name - Ariadne, in honor of the main character of the ancient Greek myth he liked. </p><p>  Ivan met Anna, the mother of Marat, in 1927, when he arrived on a visit.  He fell in love with a girl with no memory.  A year later, the young man wrote off ashore and married a beautiful woman. </p>

    <h2>  Father's arrest </h2><p>  Activist and communist Ivan Kazey was an ardent Bolshevik, respected by his colleagues, taught courses in tractor training and headed a friendly court.  It all ended in 1935 when he was arrested for sabotage.  The false denunciation was anonymous.  Apparently, the ideological Ivan, who did not take a penny of state money in his pocket, irritated those who wanted to fill their pocket at the expense of folk funds.  According to the verdict, he was exiled to the Far East and rehabilitated only in 1959, posthumously.  Marat Kazei, whose feat will inspire the soldiers of the <span>Soviet army,</span> was small at that time and did not understand what was happening. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mother's arrest </h2><p>  After the exile, Ivan Anna was fired from her job, expelled from the institute and expelled from the apartment.  She had to send her children to relatives.  And this was the right decision, since soon the woman was arrested for ‚ÄúTrotskyism‚Äù.  But Anna did not repeat the fate of her husband.  She was released before the war. </p><p>  The conclusion did not change the political views of the convinced communist.  From the first days of the occupation, she actively collaborated with the Minsk underground.  The history of the people included in it turned out to be tragic.  Due to lack of experience, they were quickly exposed and arrested by the Gestapo.  Anna Kazey, together with the underground, was hanged in Minsk. </p>

    <h2>  Marat and Ariadne </h2><p>  The death of his mother served as an impetus for Marat and Ariadne to an active struggle against the Nazis.  In 1942, they joined a partisan detachment.  The boy was 13 years old, and the girl was only 16. </p><p>  Marat Kazei, whose feat is forever inscribed in the annals of World War II, became a scout.  The boy unusually deftly penetrated into the garrisons of the enemy, extracting valuable information.  In battle, he was distinguished by fearlessness.  In 1943, being wounded, he repeatedly rose to attack the enemy.  Also, the boy repeatedly participated in sabotage at facilities of particular importance to the Nazis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Once Marat Kazei, whose feat is known throughout the world, was saved by a partisan detachment named after Furmanov.  The punishers took him into a ring near the village of Rumok, and only the young scout managed to break through the obstacle and bring help. </p><p>  At the beginning of the winter of 1943, a partisan detachment, which included Marat and Ariadne, left the encirclement.  The girl received a severe frostbite.  To save her life, doctors in the field amputated Ariadne both legs.  Then, by plane, the girl was taken to the rear, where the doctors managed to cure her.  Marat remained at the front to avenge his crippled sister, murdered mother and scolded motherland ... </p>

    <h2>  Last battle </h2><p>  In May 1944, Operation Bagration, which would free the Belarusian people from the German yoke, was in full swing.  But the boy will not see this.  May 11, he will die near the village of Khoremetskoye.  Marat and the squad leader returned from the mission and stumbled upon the Germans.  The commander was killed, the boy fired back until the cartridges ran out.  There was nowhere to go, moreover, he was wounded.  Then he took his last weapon - two grenades hanging from his belt, and when the Germans came very close, blew himself up together with the enemies. </p><p>  People who came to the funeral of the young hero carried posters with his photograph.  On them was the inscription "Marat Kazei - a pioneer."  His feats are still remembered by all the residents of Stankovo ‚Äã‚Äã- the native village of the boy where the funeral took place. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><ul><li>  <span>The order of Lenin.</span> </li><li>  Medal of Honor". </li><li>  <span>Order of the Patriotic War</span> (1 degree). </li><li>  Medal "For Military Merit". </li><li>  Hero of the USSR. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazey Marat Ivanovich feat" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/790910.jpg" width="374"></div></h2><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know what a feat Marat Kazei performed.  What was he thinking at the last moment of his life?  About how frightening it is to die young?  About what will bring victory closer to death?  Or that will no longer see relatives? </p><p>  Most likely about all this at the same time.  And it is more likely that Marat was driven by a fierce rage, multiplied by a desperate daring, characteristic of exclusively young fighters.  Subconsciously, they understand that they only have to live until the moment the Germans draw near.  And death itself does not become scary, because, as Gaidar wrote before the war, all the same, enemies will flee, cursing the awesome people of this country in fear with its invincible army and unsolved military secret. </p><p>  In 1965, Marat Kazei, whose feat will never be forgotten, received the title of Hero of the USSR posthumously.  In Minsk, a monument was erected to him. </p>
