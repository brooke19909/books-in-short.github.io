This is especially true for owners of 8 and 16 GB models.  We have to constantly monitor the number of megabytes and ask the question: ‚ÄúHow to free up space on the iPhone 5S?‚Äù </p><p>  Users are forced to put up with the fact that almost any media content needs to be transferred to a personal computer, and supposedly simply unnecessary applications are simply deleted.  Alas, memory cards for the ‚ÄúiPhone 5S‚Äù are not provided, so you have to look for some way out.  What we will do in our article.  The material is designed for users of all categories, so beginners should have no problems, at least not any serious ones. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to free up space on the iPhone 5S and make it as painless as possible for the gadget and for the owner himself.  Along with traditional actions, we also consider a number of more cardinal and advanced methods. </p><h2>  Forced reboot </h2><p>  The very first and easiest way to clear the memory of excess garbage is to reboot the iPhone 5S.  In addition to performance gains, local OS tools will remove the cache accumulated during the session.  The latter is growing day after day after almost every user action. </p><div class="photo" data-original="postnews.com.kh" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clear cache on iphone" class="if uuid-3253615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253615.jpg"></div><p>  Naturally, completely erasing the cache on the iPhone 5S this way will not work.  Rebooting only reduces it.  But if you have not performed it for at least a week, then the memory gain can be very significant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Delete unnecessary applications </h2><p>  Despite the obviousness of this method, many users ignore it.  Some people completely forget that they have installed one or another program.  Therefore, to clean the internal memory, it is worthwhile to regularly audit applications on the iPhone 5S. </p><h2>  Temporary program files </h2><p>  Some applications, even after removal, may leave ‚Äútrash‚Äù behind them.  The latter are video, audio, PDF files, presentations, text documents and other content created or used somehow in this program. </p><p>  Some applications move their files to temporary folders, which are very difficult to access.  But a few days later they themselves are removed.  This moment also allows you to clear the memory on the iPhone 5S. </p><h2>  Unsubscribe from the ‚Äúover the air‚Äù update </h2><p>  Of course, getting updates over wireless protocols is much more convenient.  But in this case, the whole process is implemented through the internal memory of your phone.  Updates "over the air" - this is a mass of temporary files, some of which, alas, remain even after the successful installation of the operating system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="memory card for iphone 5s" class="if uuid-3253621" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253621.jpg"></div><p>  As a panacea, ‚ÄúAytuns‚Äù acts.  To free up space on the iPhone 5S, perform updates using the desktop client.  In this case, all the ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù is stored on a personal computer, and only a clean OS is installed on the mobile gadget without any temporary folders and files. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prohibition of current OS versions </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that not all users have a desire to switch to the latest version of the operating system.  But in the default settings is meanwhile loading the current platform.  The latter is stored in the internal memory of the device and is waiting in the wings.  The volume of the OS distribution can reach 2 GB, which is a lot, especially for devices with 8 GB of memory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reboot iphone" class="if uuid-3253616" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253616.jpg"></div><p>  To remove downloaded updates and free up space on the iPhone 5S, you must perform the following procedure: </p><ol><li>  Go to the "Settings". </li><li>  Click on the item "Basic". </li><li>  We find the line "Storage Usage and" Iklaud. </li><li>  Click on "Management". </li><li>  From the presented list, delete the saved OS distributions. </li></ol><h2>  Voice mail </h2><p>  Separate voicemail files almost do not take up space, but the volume accumulated over several months is very impressive megabytes.  If the existing messages are not valuable to you, then they can be deleted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bedroomfurniture.club" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clear memory on iphone 5s" class="if uuid-3253622" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253622.jpg"></div><p>  Voicemail Cleaning Procedure: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Go to the "Phone" application. </li><li>  Open the item "Answering machine". </li><li>  We mark all (or some) messages. </li><li>  Click on "Delete" and agree with the consequences. </li></ol><p>  Next, you must follow these steps: </p><ol><li>  Go to the "Phone". </li><li>  Select the item "Deleted Messages". </li><li>  Click on the button ‚ÄúClear all‚Äù. </li></ol><p>  After that, all your voicemail, including in the cache, will be permanently deleted. </p><h2>  Audio, video and SMS </h2><p>  If you often use this kind of functionality, then it is obviously superfluous to configure the settings for deleting such messages.  Otherwise, they can hang dead weight for more than one month and occupy precious megabytes on the drive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="delete posts" class="if uuid-3253620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253620.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, go to the "Messages" section and set the frequency of automatic cleaning using the "Expires ..." item.  Another optimization method, but already SMS, is in the same section, in the ‚ÄúLeave messages‚Äù sub-item.  Here, the period after which they will be deleted is limited to one month.  Alas, it is impossible to set less. </p><h2>  Photo stream </h2><p>  Functional "Photostream" organizes the storage of your photos on iOS devices and makes them common.  The solution is quite interesting and extremely convenient in some cases, but it requires too much space for implementation.  Therefore, on phones with 8 and 16 GB of internal memory, this feature is better off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="my photo stream" class="if uuid-3253617" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253617.jpg"></div><p>  The procedure for disabling the "Photo Stream": </p><ol><li>  Open the "Settings". </li><li>  We pass to the section "Photo and Camera". </li><li>  We find the line ‚ÄúUpload to My Photo Stream‚Äù. </li><li>  We put the beacon in an inactive position. </li></ol><p>  The same thing can be done with shared access to "Iklaud", where album sharing is implemented.  It‚Äôs enough to move the beacon opposite the item ‚ÄúiCloud Photo Sharing‚Äù in the same section. </p><h2>  Mail cache </h2><p>  Even if you regularly clean your mailbox, all text information along with attachments is deposited in the cache.  The application responsible for receiving emails can thus grow to several gigabytes. </p><p>  To clear the cache on the ‚ÄúiPhone 5S‚Äù in the mail program, you must perform the following procedure: </p><ol><li>  Open the "Settings". </li><li>  Go to the "Basic" section. </li><li>  We find the sub-item "Use of storage and" Iklaud ". </li><li>  Click "Management." </li><li>  In the "Storage" section, delete the "Mail" application. </li></ol><p>  Alas, another way to clear the mailer‚Äôs cache is impossible.  After uninstalling the program, you must reinstall it in normal mode through the App Store.  Fortunately, such a procedure should be carried out no more than once a month. </p><h2>  Browser cache </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSafari‚Äù neatly arranges everything on its shelves, which require a lot of space on the internal drive.  This is about search queries, downloads, visits, and other user data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="safari cache" class="if uuid-3253618" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253618.jpg"></div><p>  You can clear the Safari cache as follows: </p><ol><li>  Open the "Settings". </li><li>  Go to the "Safari" section. </li><li>  At the bottom of the group there is a line ‚ÄúClear History‚Äù. </li><li>  Click OK and agree to the warning about deleting the cache. </li></ol><h2>  Safari Reading List </h2><p>  If you use a full-time browser as an offline reading list, then it will be useful to delete all previously downloaded data.  The fact is that this function implies the preservation of individual web pages for later familiarization with them when the Internet is turned off.  Each such page takes up a lot of space on the internal drive. </p><p>  To delete an offline list, do the following: </p><ul><li>  Open the "Settings". </li><li>  Go to the "Basic". </li><li>  We click on the section "Storage Usage and" Iklaud. </li><li>  Click on "Management" and "Storage". </li><li>  In the list that appears, find the Safari browser and click "Change." </li><li>  We click on the line ‚ÄúOffline List‚Äù and agree to the cleaning. </li></ul><h2>  Application cache </h2><p>  IPhone games and other applications leave behind temporary files.  The volumes of the latter can reach several gigabytes, especially when it comes to modern and serious gaming programs. </p><p>  Delete application cache: </p><ol><li>  Open the "Settings". </li><li>  Point "Basic". </li><li>  We select the section "Storage Usage and" Iklaud. </li><li>  Click on the item "Management". </li><li>  In the "Storage" section, select the desired application from the list. </li><li>  In the window that opens, click on the "Clear Cache" button. </li></ol><h2>  Social networks </h2><p>  Social network applications are the real ‚Äúpests‚Äù that, not only do they have long roots in the platform, they also clog it with a large number of temporary files.  Moreover, in the usual way described above, it is not always possible to delete the accumulated cache. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="remove social apps" class="if uuid-3253619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3253619.jpg"></div><p>  As an effective method, the complete removal of applications and their subsequent installation helps.  In this case, the platform completely clears the temporary folders attached to the programs from the accumulated ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù.  A similar procedure is recommended to be done at least once a month. </p><p>  After reinstalling social applications, you will need authorization, so it will be superfluous to take care of logins and passwords in advance in order to avoid unpleasant situations.  Such a procedure significantly adds free space on the drive. </p>
