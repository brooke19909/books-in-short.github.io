What teachers do not try to diversify the leisure of students in schools and kindergartens.

    <p>  <strong>What</strong> <strong>can we offer</strong> </p><p>  As strange as it may seem at first glance, it‚Äôs easier to build such a <span>suit from improvised material.</span>  How exactly?  And here include both you and your child!  For instance: </p><ul><li>  A scene is played in which aliens participate.  What you need?  A black training suit (or white, green, in a word, plain and without stripes).  Sheathe it with a film so that it shines (putting on his child‚Äôs pants separately, a trowel separately).  A <span>mask for swimming</span> under water is suitable on the face, on the hands are medical or work gloves.  Attach flippers to your feet.  A humanoid costume from improvised material is ready.  It will cause laughter and fun among the friends of the son (or daughter) and will cheer everyone up.  And your creativity will be appreciated very positively! </li><li>  Awesome mummy can be fun.  Do not believe?  Then get 5 rolls of plain toilet paper.  Remember the corresponding episode from the adventures of Carlson, living on the roof, and build a costume from improvised material.  Wrap your child with paper, just leave the hanging rags in places with unevenly torn ends.  Leave the hands free; put them in gloves.  Wrap the legs to the feet themselves.  Bandage the head with the face, making slits for the eyes, mouth and nose.  Draw a creepy grin, circle the eye circles in black.  How?  And fun and scary, right?  Have you made sure that such a suit from improvised material can be very effective?  Here you go!  Just let your child not forget at the matinee from time to time to howl, breathe heavily, or somehow show signs of an ‚Äúafterlife‚Äù existence.  Can you imagine how classmates will laugh? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's costume from improvised materials" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/237265.jpg" width="450"></div></li><li>  <span>Pirate costume.</span>  Or pirates.  Well, there's really nothing to think about.  The ‚Äúnail‚Äù of the outfit is a vest.  No such - any long T-shirt-top-T-shirt (optionally with a long sleeve) of white color is painted with stripes.  Felt pens or regular paints are suitable.  Smooth lines are optional, by the way.  And then you need regular pants (jeans are also good, especially ripped ones).  The belt is made of red material, and from it is also a bandana.  <span>The blindfold</span> can be made from ordinary rubber and a mug of paper.  Consider a children's suit from improvised materials you have already made.  The final touch is the boots.  Treads (lapels) are made of cardboard.  Plug a couple of <span>toy guns</span> over your belt <span>.</span>  Or cut a dagger from a tree.  Insert a ring clip into your ear.  It will be believable and interesting. </li><li>  And finally, such an offer: <span>a fairy-spring costume.</span>  It is suitable for girls of kindergarten age or primary school.  For the outfit, take your daughter‚Äôs dress, elegant, but already one that the girl does not wear and which is not sorry to ‚Äúspoil‚Äù.  On the sleeves and skirt, cut the material along in the shape of triangles.  It will be a kind of petals.  From colored and corrugated paper, cut flowers of different colors and shapes.  Sew or stick on the material.  It turns out bright, elegant, beautiful, isn't it?  Decorate the shoes as well.  Lay your hair nicely, put a wreath of paper flowers on your head, attaching them to a hoop wire. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="suit from improvised materials photo" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/237267.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  What a suit will result from improvised materials, the photo will give you a complete picture.  The proposed ideas can be supplemented with your own, come up with something else special, original.  The main thing is that everything should be done with sincere desire and pleasure. </p>
