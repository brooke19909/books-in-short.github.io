However, in reality, you need to drive twice as much - 969 kilometers.  This journey will take approximately 13 hours.  The route Krasnodar - Sevastopol goes through Bakhchisaray, Simferopol, after which it passes through Feodosia and Kerch, and then ends up in the <span>port "Caucasus".</span>  Then you need to drive through the village of Sennaya, after - Temryuk, Slavyansk-on-Kuban, after which there will be a "final".  Between the designated cities there are several more points that you need to pass, following the specified route. </p>

    <h2>  Flights </h2><p>  So, the distance Sevastopol - Krasnodar in a straight line is a little, but if you go by car or other land transport, it will come out twice as much.  However, there is an option, choosing which can be reached much faster.  And this is a plane.  In this case, the path will take no more than half a day, but only a couple of hours.  Significant time savings.  To date, the cost of an air ticket for the Krasnodar-Sevastopol route is about 11,000 rubles.  But there are a few more nuances.  The price of a ticket depends on the time of purchase, as well as on the day of the flight.  Actually, the same principle works here, which is valid for other cases when a person wants to get to a city.  And it consists in the following - the sooner a ticket is purchased, the cheaper it will be.  That is why many people get it in a few months.  Of course, there are cases in which it is simply impossible to predict the trip.  But if the need to fly arose spontaneously, then you will have to buy a ticket more expensive.  The most disadvantageous are sold 14 days before departure and closer to the departure date.  And the most budgetary options are tickets with a morning departure and in the middle of the work week. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Buses </h2><p>  Of course, fly fast by plane, but not everyone can afford it.  Some opt for vehicles such as buses.  Krasnodar - Sevastopol is a very popular destination.  Many people purchase these tickets, evening flights are especially in demand.  The trip does not seem long, because most of the time a person sleeps.  Buses are comfortable, so 13 hours a person can stand calmly and arrive at the place without back pain.  In addition, a bus ticket can be bought at the box office at the bus station or at pre-sale ticket offices.  It may seem that such long flights go infrequently, but this is not so - every day, at noon, there is a <span>transit flight</span> in the direction of Sevastopol-Krasnodar.  And the cost of a ticket is almost 9 times less when compared with air travel - about 1300 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Single ticket </h2><p>  Much has been said about travel by bus.  Indeed, this is a popular flight, and especially now.  Everyone knows the single ticket system, which was introduced relatively recently.  A single ticket can be reached from anywhere in the Russian Federation to the Crimea.  So, this ticket includes train travel to Krasnodar, after which the passenger transfers to the bus and goes to the ferry, on which he is transferred to the peninsula.  And there it is already taking a bus to any Crimean city - Sevastopol, Yalta, Simferopol, etc. A single ticket for the Sevastopol-Krasnodar route can also be purchased, however, crossings from the continent to Crimea are still more in demand today.  This, I must say, is a very profitable option, since visitors do not need to think about the route - just go to the ticket office and order a single ticket.  This option is the most budgetary today, since the official fare for the route Sevastopol - Krasnodar is only 830 rubles.  That is why now such coupons are grabbed in a matter of days. </p>

    <h2>  Driving details </h2><p>  If the process of traveling by bus and airplane is familiar to everyone, then the principle of a single ticket has not all figured out yet, so special attention should be paid to this.  So, the ferry crossing is the main mode of transport going through the <span>Kerch Strait.</span>  But for large organized groups, the so-called high-speed catamaran will be used, which can accommodate three hundred people.  One more fact should be noted.  Trains from the peninsula and through the territory of Ukraine have already been stopped - all because of the political situation.  But a solution was found quickly - and this is a train to Kerch.  Of course, then it will be more difficult to get there, because you will have to change trains and take the bus to Krasnodar, then take the train to the city where you need to come.  And the route from the hero city to Kerch will take a little less time than the road Sevastopol - Krasnodar.  The train leaves at 20:00, and arrives at six in the morning of the next day.  Total 10 hours.  Too much to overcome the distance between two nearby cities, but it is reliable and safe. </p>
