  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY frame doll: photos, step-by-step instructions and interesting ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A frame doll is an original toy that will be the perfect complement to a private collection or decoration of a room.  The cost of such toys is quite high, some copies are generally made to order.  You can make a doll yourself, showing skills for needlework, imagination in creating an image, enjoying the process.  At the same time, the family budget is saved. </p><h2>  Making a skeleton of a toy </h2><p>  A skeleton doll is a toy whose base is made of flexible material.  Often, wire is used for these purposes, since it is strong, bends well, easily deforms, and takes the necessary shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="making wire frame" class="if uuid-2515690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515690.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced masters in their work do not use any wire, but a certain type.  It is convenient to work with copper, aluminum and steel.  Often pick up material with a diameter of 4 millimeters.  This parameter may increase depending on the need for rigidity of the frame and the size of the doll. </p><p>  To strengthen the overall frame, several wires are sometimes intertwined.  In order not to overload the ‚Äúskeleton" with wire too much, it is worth reinforcing with several bindings only the most functional areas: legs, arms, the body itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having decided on the size, two identical pieces of wire should be cut, from which the legs, trunk and head will be formed.  By measuring the length of the legs, you can begin to twist the workpiece.  The place of twisting is the torso.  Having reached the site of the position of the hands, you need to take the third piece of wire and bind with the workpiece.  After performing the skeleton under the arms of the main strips of wire, you should continue to form the neck and the head in the form of a loop. </p><p>  There are other techniques for forming a wire frame.  Each master selects the option with which it is most easier to work.  Experienced craftsmen make the body mobile and flexible, connecting all parts of the body of the toy with the help of loops. </p><h2>  What material is suitable for trimming the body </h2><p>  When the "skeleton" of the toy is ready, you can begin to manufacture the torso.  There are many options that require the use of a particular technique, depending on the material selected. </p><div class="photo" data-original="morezmore.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the process of creating a body for a wireframe doll" class="if uuid-2515689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515689.jpg"></div><p>  The body of the frame doll can be made of the following types of materials: </p><ul><li>  Polymer clay is suitable for those craftsmen who have modeling skills.  A polymer clay product will be durable, but not flexible. </li><li>  The work uses textiles and a synthetic winterizer, the process is similar to creating a soft toy: the base is sewn, which is stuffed with soft material. </li><li>  The metal frame can be tied with a hook or knitting needles.  Creating is similar to working with textiles. </li><li>  The body, made using the papier-m√¢ch√© technique, accurately repeats all the lines of a person, but remains too fragile. </li><li>  Using the technique by which motank dolls are created, one can easily create a body.  Threads, strips of fabric, ribbons are wound on the frame. </li><li>  Formation of the base with cotton wool and paperkley.  Vata is used to create volume, and paperkley fixes a soft base. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes several techniques are combined in one product, each element of the doll‚Äôs body is created from a certain type of material. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design Tips </h2><p>  The design is formed with the help of little things: the colors of dolls, clothes, hairstyles, jewelry.  But the general image needs to be thought over initially, when choosing a theme.  The most popular version of frame dolls is Columbine, which is available in any collection of a self-respecting collector. </p><p>  No less interesting are Harlequin, clown, gypsy, Gothic-style doll.  More romantic and bright images are: a fairy, an angel, a girl in a light dress, an elf and other fairy-tale characters. </p><p>  DIY frame dolls can have any theme and design that suits the master to complete the collection.  To make the product bright, memorable and original, you should pay special attention to the costume, pose and face painting. </p><h2>  Secrets for details </h2><p>  In any hand-made product, it is important to think about the details and details of appearance.  For a better understanding of the process of creating a unique toy, it is useful to familiarize yourself with master classes.  In frame dolls, professionals for the most part focus the attention of the viewer on the manufacture of hair, eyes, eyelashes, eyebrows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="viola.bz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="themes for making dolls" class="if uuid-2515691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515691.jpg"></div><p>  Masters say the hardest thing to do is make the eyes.  There are several options for preparing this element: buy finished parts from plastic, glass, ceramics or make your own eyes for the doll: from transparent beads, by drawing on the material, using embroidery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Eyelashes and eyebrows are formed in several ways.  Most often, these details of the doll‚Äôs appearance are made from false eyelashes.  Used natural fur hairs.  If the doll is made in a playful style, then the eyelashes are made of loose braid. </p><p>  To make the doll look more natural, it is better to use natural or synthetic hair.  In special departments you can buy hairpins, hairpieces, strands.  Less commonly used are fluffy strings, brocade seperated into fibers.  This option will alienate the doll from resemblance to a person. </p><h2>  What you need to crochet a doll </h2><p>  Creating <span>a crochet</span> wireframe <span>doll is</span> quite simple for those who know how to knit.  With this product you can decorate the interior, present it or use it for games. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ardiafm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet dolls" class="if uuid-2515692" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515692.jpg"></div><p>  To bring the idea to life, it is worth preparing the necessary tools and materials: </p><ul><li>  <span>Cotton yarn is</span> suitable for creating the torso <span>.</span>  It is recommended to choose beige, white, peach and pink tones. </li><li>  For mobile fastening of hands and feet, buttons will be needed. </li><li>  In accordance with the diameter of the thread, the number of the hook is selected. </li><li>  If the body parts will be stitched, then silk threads and a needle will be required. </li><li>  Caton yarn is suitable for making hair. </li><li>  Beads and several floss flowers will become relevant when creating a face. </li><li>  Any threads for knitting are necessary for the outfit. </li><li>  Decorative materials: ribbons, nylon, buttons. </li><li>  Prepared wire frame. </li><li>  Filler to create volume. </li></ul><h2>  Crochet a small doll </h2><p>  The easiest option for beginners will be a crochet frame doll (description of the process in the text below).  The product knits entirely without connecting parts.  The height of the toy will be approximately 15-18 centimeters. </p><p>  To create a wireframe, you need the following materials: </p><ol><li>  50 grams of beige cotton yarn. </li><li>  Hook number 3. </li><li>  Synthetic winterizer. </li><li>  A wire with a cross section of 2 millimeters. </li><li>  Long skewers. </li></ol><h2>  Getting started: crochet a frame doll </h2><p>  A master class in manufacturing consists in describing the procedure.  You need to start by tying certain parts of the body, it is better - with the hands.  Scheme regarding the start of work: </p><ol><li>  Form an amigurumi ring of 6 single crochet stitches. </li><li>  In the 2nd row, increase the number of loops by 2 single crochet. </li><li>  We knit the 3rd and 4th rows according to the given algorithm. </li><li>  5th row: 1 single crochet, 2 double crochet in 1 stitch, 6 single crochet </li><li>  1 double crochet, decrease and knit 5 single crochet. </li><li>  Reduce the stitches again and knit 5 SC. </li><li>  3 rows knit 6 single crochet </li><li>  Single crochet, add, 4 single crochet. </li><li>  2 rows knit obtained 7 single crochet </li><li>  2 single crochet + increase + 4 single crochet. </li><li>  14 rows of knit 8 single crochet in each row. </li></ol><h2>  Knit legs </h2><p>  Now for a knitted frame doll you need to make legs: </p><ol><li>  Work begins with the right foot. </li><li>  The first row is the same as for the hands. </li><li>  Increase in 3 subsequent rows of 1 single crochet. </li><li>  Knit 3 rows of 9 single crochet. </li><li>  Knitting 4 SC, 4 times to rotate the work. </li><li>  In the next row, decreasing after a single crochet, knit 1 loop in a circle. </li><li>  Add columns until 12 loops are obtained. </li><li>  In each subsequent row, reduce the columns until you get 9 loops. </li><li>  Knit 6 rows so. </li><li>  Add 1 loop. </li><li>  2 rows fits in 10 loops. </li><li>  Add 2 loops = 12 loops. </li><li>  7 rows knit 12 single crochet </li><li>  Reduce the column. </li><li>  Reduce the column again. </li></ol><p>  To create a knee, it is worthwhile to gradually reduce the loops to 10, and then again gradually restore the initial amount.  To create the shape of the hips, it is better not to do any reduction / addition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amigurumi dolls in the making" class="if uuid-2515693" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515693.jpg"></div><p>  In the process of assembling the torso and legs, it will be precisely visible where to reduce, and where to increase the number of rows.  Sometimes such a correction "by eye" is simply necessary, because knitting often has a different density. </p><h2>  Knit torso and head </h2><p>  Amigurumi frame dolls are very easy to knit if you stick to the scheme.  The next step will be the manufacture of the body: </p><ol><li>  One leg joins the first air loop, then 11 single crochets are knitted, add 3 columns.  Make an air loop that is the basis for the second leg.  Another 3 additions and again knit 11 columns.  Close the circle. </li><li>  Add in each successive row one column until the total is 19. </li><li>  Knit 12 rows with the number of columns 19. </li><li>  Next, the hands join in the same pattern as the legs. </li><li>  In each row, 2 times decrease. </li><li>  When moving to the neck, only 5 columns should remain. </li></ol><p>  Without looking up from the body, it is worth starting to knit a transition for the head: </p><ol><li>  In the next four rows add 5 columns. </li><li>  11 rows of knit 40 columns without changes. </li><li>  Reduce 4 columns, and in 4 subsequent rows of 6 columns. </li><li>  After 12 columns remain, it is worth making another reduction so that 6 columns remain. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="meo-my-crochet.blogspot.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting with torso" class="if uuid-2515696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515696.jpg"></div><h2>  We assemble the product </h2><p>  For an experienced craftsman, a crochet frame doll is made without seams if knitting is done with a crochet or knitting needles.  In the process, sequential assembly takes place, by attaching body parts to the air loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet doll assembly" class="if uuid-2515694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2515694.jpg"></div><p>  On knitted dolls, eyes and other facial features usually embroider.  "Hair" is threaded with a hook.  Next, an outfit is made and decoration is made.  Knitted doll fit outfit with textile elements. </p><h2>  Creating costumes and auxiliary equipment </h2><p>  The finished frame doll needs to be beautifully dressed.  Sometimes making a costume takes longer than creating the doll itself.  You can sew costumes manually or on a sewing machine. </p><p>  Some craftsmen sew an outfit directly on the doll.  This fixes a ton of problems: </p><ul><li>  The outfit will exactly match the size of the doll. </li><li>  The manufacturing procedure is simplified and accelerated. </li><li>  If you wear separately sewn items, you can damage the doll. </li></ul><p>  There are many options and design solutions for creating outfits.  Slices can be finished with ribbons, lace, braid, spoilage - it all depends on the design of the doll itself. </p>
