    <h2>  What is the Golden Ring </h2><p>  The Big and Small Golden Ring of Russia are tourist routes in ancient Russian cities.  <span>This tourist product</span> appeared in the 60s of the 20th century, when the mass tourism of Soviet citizens across the expanses of the homeland began.  The author of the title was journalist Yuri Bychkov, who in 1967 published in the newspaper Sovetskaya Kultura a series of literary and artistic essays on the cities of Ancient Russia.  Later, this name was officially assigned to the route through the famous cities. </p><h2>  Route Features </h2><p>  The specificity of the route is that there is no single list of cities included in it, and the exact sequence of their inspection.  Differences start at the start.  Where does the Small Golden Ring of Russia route start from?  St. Petersburg or Moscow are the starting points for the Big Ring.  Small usually begins in Sergiev Posad or Vladimir.  A feature of the route is also not only the ability to make a circular motion from city to city, but also radial departures from large cities.  For example, you can stop in Suzdal and from it go to Kideksha and Yuryev-Polsky.  Almost all the famous cities participating in the Golden Ring have such outstanding satellites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City List </h2><p>  The Small Golden Ring of Russia route, the list of cities of which varies slightly in each agency, traditionally includes eight major ancient Russian capitals.  These are Vladimir, Rostov the Great, Pereslavl-Zalessky, Suzdal, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, Sergiev Posad. </p>

    <p>  However, the route may additionally include small cities, such as Alexandrov, Bogolyubovo, Ples, Uglich.  Some agencies refuse to visit Ivanovo, whose historical and cultural significance is much lower than other capital cities of the Russian principalities.  Sometimes routes are built around two or three nearby cities and their environs.  For example, in the vicinity of Vladimir there are 23 more cities of significant interest to tourists. </p><h2>  Vladimir </h2><p>  The route Little Golden Ring of Russia, whose cities are the pearls of Russian culture, often starts with Vladimir.  It was founded by Grand Duke <span>Vladimir Red Sun</span> in 990.  The development of the city is associated with the names of Vladimir Monomakh and Andrei Bogolyubsky.  The main attractions that can not be missed are the Golden Gate and the Assumption Cathedral - an outstanding monument of ancient Russian architecture.  The temple has preserved several frescoes of Andrei Rublev. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Kostroma </h2><p>  A tour of the Small Golden Ring of Russia would be incomplete without a visit to Kostroma.  This ancient city on the Volga is considered the birthplace of Ivan Susanin and is proud of its history.  Founded by Kostroma in 1152 by Yuri Dolgoruky.  The city gained special fame during the Time of Troubles, when the heir to the throne, Mikhail Romanov, was saved from the Poles by Ivan Susanin and hidden in the Ipatiev Monastery.  In subsequent years, Kostroma enjoyed the special location of the royal family.  Two outstanding monastery complexes have survived in the city: Ipatievsky and Epiphany.  Kostroma is considered the <span>birthplace of the Snow Maiden,</span> there is even her tower, which is visited with pleasure by children and adults.  Slow walks along the Volga give a special charm to Kostroma; magnificent views of this ancient city open from the ship. </p><h2>  Yaroslavl </h2><p>  The Golden Ring of Russia route (Big and Small) necessarily runs through the ancient city of Yaroslavl.  The settlement in this place existed in the Neolithic era.  But the formation of the city is associated with the name of Yaroslav the Wise.  There is a legend about the appearance of the city - here, allegedly, Prince Yaroslav defeated the bear, in honor of this event, the coat of arms of the city adorns a bear with an ax.  Historians doubt this version and say that the city was founded by a completely different prince with the same name.  The oldest sight of the city is the Transfiguration Cathedral in the Spassky Monastery, it dates from the beginning of the 16th century.  The churches of Elijah the Prophet and John the Baptist are a special pride of the city, they are outstanding examples of the famous Yaroslavl architecture school.  The unique Tolgsky Monastery has been operating in the city since the 14th century and is one of the oldest in Russia.  Ancient churches and buildings in Yaroslavl are at every step, the city retains the atmosphere of antiquity, many historical films were shot on its streets. </p>
