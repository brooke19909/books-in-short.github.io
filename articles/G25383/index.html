  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Welton Park" on Marshal Zhukov: location, description, infrastructure</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The North-Western Administrative District of Moscow is a huge territory on which there was a place for residential complexes offering residents and guests of the capital apartments of various classes.  One of these is the Welton Park on Marshal Zhukov.  Business class housing is presented here, which is characterized by increased comfort, the ability to purchase an apartment with a finished finish and the solution of the parking issue for owners of personal vehicles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Welton Park by Marshal Zhukov" class="if uuid-2343551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2343551.jpg"></div><h2>  Location and transport accessibility </h2><p>  A land plot was allocated for the development of the Wellton Park residential complex between the huge transport highway - Marshal Zhukov Avenue and Karamyshevskaya Embankment, which runs along the Moscow River. </p><p>  This is the Khoroshevo-Mnevniki district in the north-west of the capital.  Such a location determines excellent transport accessibility for residents of the complex, who can easily get home and work both in personal cars and public transport.  A little more than two kilometers separate Velton Park on Marshal Zhukov from the Moscow Central Ring station Khoroshevo and the metro stations Polezhaevskaya and Khoroshevskaya.  But even without the indicated methods of transportation, the complex can be reached on other public transport routes: buses, fixed-route taxis, and personal cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pronovostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from above" class="if uuid-2343557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2343557.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  ‚ÄúVelton Park‚Äù on Marshal Zhukov is ten residential buildings of different floors, the number of levels is from 10 to 28. The developer of the quarter is the concern ‚ÄúKROST‚Äù.  His new project is presented as an object of business class.  The territory of the complex is closed and guarded. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of Velton Park on Marshal Zhukov is the penthouses located on the top floors of the houses, and spacious apartments on the first.  All houses are equipped with low-noise high-speed elevators, central air conditioning and video surveillance systems.  Completed panoramic glazing, many houses have underground parking. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Speaking about infrastructure, it is difficult to disagree that it was impossible to imagine the most successful place for building.  Everything that is necessary for life and education is within walking distance: schools and kindergartens, shops and supermarkets, pharmacies and a hospital, bank branches and beauty salons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vsnr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Inland" class="if uuid-2343556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2343556.jpg"></div><h2>  Another concern project </h2><p>  The KROST concern did not stop in its activity on one <span>residential complex</span> and implemented another similar project - Wellton Park New Skhodnya <span>residential complex</span> .  The specified complex is located just 15 kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road in the village of Podolino, Solnechnogorsk district.  The developer has provided for his project unique architecture, landscape design, public areas.  This is a real city-park, combining four residential areas with places for walking, recreation and sports, the territory of which resembles a dragon silhouette. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mskguru.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD in New Skhodnaya" class="if uuid-2343561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2343561.jpg"></div><p>  Each residential building is painted in bright but calm colors, creating a unique architectural look.  Ventilated facades are finished with brick, forming an asymmetric pattern.  Public areas in the interior of buildings are finished with natural materials with 3D effects.  For the local area, the Italian designer developed a unique landscape. </p><h2>  Apartments in the complex </h2><p>  As for the apartments, there is also a huge selection of them in this residential complex - from modest one-room apartments to spacious business apartments.  If you wish, you can purchase a home with a finished finish in various styles: classic, modern, minimalism.  The first floors of the buildings were given to accommodate social infrastructure facilities designed to make life in the complex very comfortable.  The cost per square meter here is slightly lower than on Marshal Zhukov. </p>
