You can start by walking around the city.  During which you can visit Ribat and the old medina, a Spanish fortress of the sixteenth century, located near the sea.

    <p>  The resort is filled with outdoor cafes, restaurants and small shops where you can buy souvenirs. </p><h2>  Medina Belisaire Thalasso 4 *: 2016 reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited it.  Especially interesting is the opinion of tourists who visited the complex this year.  The hotel has a good location.  It is located on the second line, here all the hotels are built along the road from which the noise comes.  However, Medina Belisaire Thalasso 4 * is located in the depths of the territory, at some distance from the street, due to which extraneous sounds are not so audible.  The hotel is surrounded by a beautiful blooming garden.  Some rooms have private pool access.  Of course, in such places it is a bit noisy during the day, but there is no need to use public corridors.  The hotel is very beautiful and comfortable. </p><p>  Upon arrival at the reception, employees fill out documents very quickly and check into rooms even earlier than the deadline without any additional charges. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medina belisaire thalasso 4 tunisia hammamet" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1525220.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has nice rooms with comfortable beds and quality furniture.  High-quality cleaning is carried out daily, if you leave a small tip, then the beds are sprinkled with flower petals.  Towels are also changed every day.  The bathroom has detergents, but gels and shampoos are given in very small bottles.  During cleaning, their stocks are forgotten to replenish.  You can remind the maids, then they bring a new portion.  During check-in, a bottle of water and a plate of fruit are left for each guest in the room.  In the future, water can be taken in a bar, and its amount is not limited, which is convenient in hot climates. </p><p>  The pools at the hotel are clean and staff are watching.  One of them is indoor, it is filled with water.  You can use it for free at lunch (from 13.00 to 15.00).  There is a children's room for children, there is an animation area.  The complex provides the possibility of a free one-time visit to the amusement park and water park, which are within walking distance.  The hotel has animation for children and adults, but it is not as intrusive as, for example, in Turkey.  In the evenings, shows and discos are organized. </p><p>  What is the situation with nutrition in Medina Belisaire Thalasso 4 *?  Guest reviews regarding food are only positive.  On the tables there are always several varieties of meat, fish, chicken, quail.  Incredibly sliced ​​vegetables.  The local chef pampers guests with wonderful pastries and 4 varieties of ice cream.  The main restaurant always has tea, coffee, juices, carbonated drinks, pink, white and red wine, beer.  The bars also have local alcohol of an acceptable quality.  There are always a lot of fruits and sweets on the tables. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medina belisaire thalasso 4 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1525221.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has its own beach.  There are no problems with umbrellas and sunbeds; there are a sufficient number of them.  If necessary, the hotel employee helps to put a deck chair in the right place.  The beach of the hotel is sandy and very beautiful.  It is cleaned daily.  The sea is clean and warm, basking on the beach is very nice.  Merchants walk along the coast very rarely, so they don’t particularly bother.  There is a bar on the beach where you can refresh yourself with drinks. </p><p>  The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful.  Despite the fact that people sometimes look tired, they are very attentive to the guests.  The waiters in the restaurant serve quickly and efficiently even without a tip, and a small amount of money generally turns you into a best friend.  In general, the hotel service is delivered up to standard.  Tourists are very pleased with the service and the friendliness of the staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="medina belisaire thalasso 4 reviews 2016" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1525222.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a local guide, but you can get to all the most interesting places on public transport and not depend on a large group.  Moreover, the cost of such a trip is several times less than sightseeing tours.  In resort areas and just on the roads, there are a lot of police and military, keeping order.  Patrol cars constantly ply around the city, so there is a sense of security.  So, you can go on an independent trip along the coast. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Based on reviews of tourists about Medina Belisaire Thalasso 4 * <span>(Tunisia, Hammamet),</span> we can conclude that this hotel is a great place to relax on the Tunisian coast.  It will certainly appeal to those who value coziness and comfort, but at the same time do not want to overpay for a five-star hotel.  So, the complex can be considered as an economy class vacation spot. </p>
