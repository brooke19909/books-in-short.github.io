  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inventory Rules</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>  <strong>The general rules for conducting an inventory</strong> provide for the establishment of a standing commission at the enterprise or organization, whose task is to periodically conduct a census of property.  In cases where the organization has an audit commission and for sufficiently small volumes of production, it is permissible to keep the inventory under the authority of the audit team.  If there is a large amount of work to conduct an inventory of financial obligations and property, then the creation of working inventory commissions is mandatory. </p><p>  The commission includes representatives of the enterprise administration, accountants, auditors, specialists (economists, engineers, technicians, etc.).  The rules of the inventory require the presence of all members of the commission during the procedure, because otherwise its results will be invalidated. </p><p>  <strong>The main stages of the inventory</strong> include the preparatory, verification phase and the final analytical stage.  The first stage is accompanied by orders to appoint a permanent and working inventory commission, an <span>order to conduct an inventory,</span> receipts of financially responsible employees.  The second - by acts of measurements and calculations;  inventory acts;  <span>inventory records.</span>  The third - reconciliation statements;  consolidated act, act of control check of values;  checkbook registration book. </p><p>  Before starting the inventory, you need to get all the recent income and expense documents showing the movement of material values.  The chairman of the commission should endorse them and make a note ‚ÄúBefore inventory‚Äù, which serves as the basis for identifying property balances on the date the procedure begins. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Responsible persons sign receipts stating that at the beginning of the event all documents for tangible assets were handed over to the accounting department, the values ‚Äã‚Äãwere capitalized, and those that were withdrawn from circulation were written off as expenses. </p><p>  The commission should ensure the accuracy and completeness of verification of all data on the balances of fixed assets, financial liabilities, goods, stocks. </p><p>  The rules for conducting an inventory require that the head of the enterprise create the conditions for the inspection to be carried out in a timely manner (provided people for hanging goods, moving valuables, necessary equipment, devices, containers, etc.).  Verification of the actual availability of verified material assets should be carried out with the mandatory presence of those responsible for it. </p><p>  <strong>The terms of the inventory</strong> are appointed by the head of the enterprise, except when it is mandatory (on the eve of the preparation of annual reports, before transferring the property for rent, when changing materially responsible, identifying the theft, etc.). </p><p>  The rules of the inventory require that during the inspection, if it takes more than one day, when the commission leaves, all the premises in which the valuables are stored should be sealed.  Documents should be stored in closed cabinets, safes. </p><p>  If an inventory error is found during verification, they should be reported immediately to the chairman.  The commission should check the discovered facts, if confirmed, eliminate errors in the manner prescribed by law. </p><p>  After the end of the inventory, control acts of checks of its correctness can also be conducted in the working order.  In the periods between compulsory inspections at enterprises with a large number of valuables and funds, random inspections may be carried out by order of the head.  Such checks are called inter-inventory. </p>
