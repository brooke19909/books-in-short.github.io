    <h2>  Ivanovo region </h2><p>  Its territory is one of the smallest in Russia.  It was formed relatively recently by the standards of history, and occupies the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe former Vladimir and <span>Kostroma provinces.</span>  Most of the land is located under the Gorky Sea - a reservoir formed from the construction of the Nizhny Novgorod hydroelectric station.  The shores and islands of this man-made reservoir are a favorite vacation spot of the indigenous people and visitors of the region.  Ivanovo textile enterprises with their products are known to everyone, they have become the hallmark of the region.  Light industry began its development from here, and today the life of the city is also associated with the work of spinning and manufactory factories and combines.  The production history of the region is clearly represented in the <span>museums of Ivanovo chintz,</span> as well as industry and art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo region" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/472618.jpg" width="357"></div>

The revolutionary mood of the workers also grew.  The turn of the century was marked by large-scale revolts that were brutally suppressed by the Cossacks.  The descendants are reminded of those events by the erected memorial complex, called the "Red Talka", and the factory-kitchen, telling about the workers' dreams of a new life.  Now it houses a museum and a library.  The oldest cities in the Ivanovo region are Yuryevets, preserved miraculously after the flooding of the reservoir, and Ples, modestly spread out on the high bank of the Volga.  In the first, the childhood of directors Arthur Rowe and Andrei Tarkovsky passed, the second was glorified by Isaac Levitan, depicting it on his canvases.  Crafts have long flourished in these places, the main fishing centers were the famous villages of Kholui and Palekh.  In the first, secrets of the local school of icon painting are kept, and in the second, lacquer boxes and souvenir crafts have been painted for hundreds of years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yuryevets Ivanovo region fishing" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/472617.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  City Yuryevets, Ivanovo Region </h2><p>  The history of this locality begins in 1225.  Today it is the administrative center of the Yuryevets district of the Ivanovo region.  Located near the railway station Kineshma (58 km) opposite the mouth of the river.  Unzha, on the right bank of the river.  Volga (Gorky reservoir).  The distance from the regional center is 159 km. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Yuryevets is one of the oldest cities founded by Yuri II, Prince of Vladimir, in 1225 as a fortification.  Here he received the icon <span>of St. George the Victorious,</span> in whose honor the city was given the name Yuryev-Povolsky.  After 12 years, he was destroyed by the army of Batu.  Initially, it was a defensive fortress, protecting Central and Northern Russia from eastern raids, eventually turning into an important trade hub.  In the middle of the twentieth century, during the construction of the Gorky reservoir, the city was supposed to be completely flooded, but it survived, while nearby villages with churches and other buildings were under water.  The fate of the movie-teller A. Rowe and the cult director A. Tarkovsky are connected with these places.  One of the streets is named after the latter, and the house where he grew up is turned into a museum.  Both of these people spent their childhood here. </p>

    <h2>  Gorky reservoir </h2><p>  In fact, a man-made reservoir occupies the territory of 4 regions: Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, as well as Ivanovo.  However, the most picturesque places are recognized as one, the last.  They are located next to Ples and Yuryevts.  Here, nearby, are the <span>Asaf Islands,</span> which were mountains until the middle of the twentieth century.  They remained on the surface of the water after the flooding of the surroundings, and today 5 land areas with small lakes and sandy shores have become especially popular among bathers and fishermen.  This is almost a tropical corner, only the vegetation is represented not by palm trees, but by pines.  You can get here by boat, between the banks the distance is only 3 km.  The swimming season is the perfect time to relax on the islands, especially with tents. </p><h2>  Ples </h2><p>  For most visitors to the town, even if they have never been here, many places seem familiar.  This is due to the preserved image of an ideal province - prosperous, comfortable, clean, modest.  Therefore, films were shot here many times.

They are interesting for both adults and children, because pictures of the everyday life of their ancestors come to life before our eyes, which is much easier to perceive than the abundance of ‚Äúdry‚Äù dates and historical events. </p>

Many of the works in his creative life are connected with Ples, this period has become one of the most productive.  The painter, as a true connoisseur of Russian nature for good reason, singled out precisely these places.  Everything is impressive here: the water surface of the Volga, and quiet evenings, and birch groves.  And the main value of these landscapes is their intactness: in the city today there are completely no industrial enterprises.  Another characteristic local feature is the tradition of laying full tables, as in the days of merchants, with fish soup, pies, and fish pies.  However, the appetite quickly plays out after long walks along the promenade.  And from December to March, a ski center with a cross-country route and two tracks "Sweet Mountain" is open here, which additionally attracts visitors.
