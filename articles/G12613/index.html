    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG smartphone is not much different from its predecessors.  The rectangular shape and rounded edges remind the buyer of other models of the company.  Although the appearance is familiar, the phone looks interesting.  Simplicity is adjacent to solidity, which, in fact, distinguishes Asus products from competitors. </p><p>  The device is made of plastic with <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  Despite the fact that there is protection from fingerprints, fingerprints still remain.  However, removing dirt from the case is not difficult.  The case of the apparatus is collapsible, which is now very rare.  <span>The Asus</span> ZenFone Go ZC500TG smartphone is assembled efficiently, and there should be no complaints regarding creaks and gaps. </p><p>  Dimensions are quite familiar for a 5-inch device.  Using plastic allowed to make the device lightweight, it weighs only 135 grams.  Bends sharpened by the arm on the rear panel contribute to comfortable work with the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the front panel of the device are: earpiece, frontalka, display, logo and touch elements.  The entire front panel is protected by glass.  On the back of the model, the main camera "sheltered", in the middle of the device, there is a logo, a speaker and, of course, a flash. </p><p>  The microphone and the USB connector are located on the bottom end, and at the top there is a headphone jack.  The power button along with the volume control are located on the right side.  The left side of the smartphone is empty. </p><p>  The back panel is removable.  A battery is hidden behind it, as well as SIM card slots, information about the device and a place for a flash drive.  Although the phone has a removable cover, the user will hardly notice any gaps or crevices.  The only drawback is a slight crunch that occurs when pressure is applied to the plastic near the camera.  This is due to an air bubble. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Equipped with Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG Black 5-inch screen.  The display is protected by glass, like most of the front panel.  The device does not have a very high ppi, only 293. This is very strange, especially on a display with HD-resolution (1280 x 720).  Of course, if you don‚Äôt peer at the screen, the ‚Äúcubes‚Äù are invisible. </p><p>  The manufacturer equipped the Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG IPS matrix.  Overview of angles and brightness is much higher than the old TFT-technology.  The display hardly fades in the sun.  This contributes to an excellent supply of brightness.  When tilted, picture distortion almost does not occur, but a little contrast is lost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Not without the device and ‚Äúchips‚Äù of the manufacturer.  The user can unlock the screen with a double tap.  There is also the ability to control the device using gestures. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The matrix in the Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG (8Gb) is only 8 megapixels.  However, the quality is quite tolerable.  Pictures get a resolution of 3328 x 1872 pixels.  The image is saturated and with a lot of details.  Unfortunately, there are also disadvantages.  The camera does not take small items in the best way. </p><p>  Recording videos on the Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG is also not bad.  User reviews noticed the stabilization.  Video is shot in HD (1280 x 720), 30 frames per second.  There is a microphone near the camera, but this does not fix the fact that the video sound is lame. </p><p>  The front camera has a mediocre quality of shooting.  Actually, you should not expect much from the 2 megapixel matrix.  The manufacturer added the ‚ÄúPortrait Enhancement‚Äù function, but it works very badly.  The mode blurs the details of the picture. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The ZC500TG is running under the direction of Android 5.1.  The system is supplemented by the ZenUI 1.4.0 shell.  The interface was not only attractive, but also smart.  Together with the shell, the user will get a bunch of applications.  Most programs are useful, but you can turn them off if you don't need them.  Unfortunately, you cannot uninstall applications. </p><p>  The system is well adapted and stable.  The presence of 2 GB of "RAM" also played a role.  In general, the OS will appeal to most users. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The model is equipped with an MTK6580 processor.  The chip is quad-core and operates at a frequency of 1.3 GHz.  With most tasks, the device copes with a bang.  The company installed the Mali-400 MP as a video accelerator.  High-demanding games slow down a bit, but otherwise performance is up to par.  The phone heats up a bit under heavy load. </p><p>  Native memory in Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG 8Gb.  There is a possibility of its expansion due to a flash card up to 64 GB.  The owner of the device will receive as much as 2 GB of RAM. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  The battery capacity of the device is 2070 maH.  A smartphone with minimal use will last more than a day or two.  On average, the device "lives" day.  However, increasing the load reduces the duration of the work.  Watching the video will lead to the discharge of the ZC500TG in 6 hours, games will put the battery in 3 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  You can buy Asus brainchild for 10-11 thousand rubles.  The phone is in the middle between state employees and the middle class.  Excellent characteristics make the ZC500TG a tidbit for fans of the company's products. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The rejection of expensive processors in favor of MTK did not particularly affect the performance of the Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG.  Owner reviews noted the speed of work and the absence of ‚Äústicking‚Äù.  Of course, advanced games slow down, but they are also designed for more expensive devices. </p><p>  It should be noted and the system in the Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG.  Customer reviews say that the shell and Android are well adapted.  Claims to the OS does not arise.  A bright interface and a large number of programs turn everyday tasks into pleasure. </p><p>  Attractive was the cost of the model.  Strict design and low price played a role.  Public sector employees are not able to compete with the ZC500TG in terms of performance, and representatives of the middle class are much more expensive.  The model was between two classes and definitely attracted attention. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The battery installed by the manufacturer is rather weak for the Asus ZenFone Go ZC500TG.  Reviews of most users indicate the inability to quickly charge the device.  A battery of only 2070maH runs out quickly when loaded.  The user spends time recharging the device. </p><p>  The weak speaker of the device is also upsetting.  Even at maximum volume, the sound is muffled.  In a noisy place without vibration, the call may not be heard. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The ZC500TG is definitely worth the money.  <span>Replacing the processor had</span> almost no effect on performance.  Asus has proven once again that it knows how to balance its products. </p>
