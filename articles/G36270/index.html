  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Privatization of the apartment pros and cons, is it needed - privatization?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Privatization of an apartment is a free transfer to a joint common, as well as to shared common ownership of housing to those persons who were registered in this apartment (house), provided that these same individuals had never <span>privatized housing</span> before <span>.</span>  As in all other directions, the <strong>privatization of the apartment has pros and cons</strong> ; the privatization procedure can be carried out independently or with the help of special agencies.  With an independent process, a person can save much more, but this will take a lot of time.  But if you turn to the services of real estate organizations, privatization will take less time, but you will have to pay for the services.  This is the <strong>privatization of the apartment is the pros and cons</strong> . </p><p>  For starters, you can consider only the positive aspects in this process: </p><p>  - after the procedure, the apartment completely passes into the ownership of the owners (owner), this property can be disposed of as you like - to sell, give, bequeath or otherwise. </p><p>  - if a person takes a loan and he needs a guarantee, then a privatization apartment can do just fine in this.  In addition, the privatization apartment may become a pledge for a third party with the consent of the owner. </p><p>  - According to the law, only a privatization apartment can be inherited or in case of death to the new rightful owners, which are indicated in the will. </p><p>  That is why the privatization of the apartment is beneficial to the heirs and businessmen.  Thus, the <strong>privatization of the apartment the pros and cons</strong> - for someone are of great importance, but for someone they are completely worthless. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider the disadvantages of privatization: </p><p>  - if you privatize a communal apartment or a dorm room, for example, the <strong>privatization of state property</strong> in which the state once owned and then provided to current residents, then there are some disadvantages.  According to estimates of real estate companies, such transactions account for about 20% of the entire market segment.  Thus, the sale of communal apartments or dorm rooms is not in demand.  If you privatize such property, then it will be difficult to sell. </p><p>  - People who are single, poor and have no heirs, privatization of the apartment will only hinder.  The fact is that homeowners are required to pay <span>tax on the privatization apartment,</span> as well as pay expensive <span>utility bills,</span> and independently make <span>major repairs.</span>  People who have heirs will benefit from privatization, but for those who do not, privatization will only be an additional burden.  Note that those people who live in apartments under a special social hiring agreement are free from all of the above losses. </p><p>  Thus, the <strong>privatization of the apartment has pros and cons</strong> , but if a person lives in a non-privatized apartment, he is partially exempted from paying expensive utilities, receives subsidies to pay for his housing, and the premises (roof, basement, facade) will no longer be repaired homeowners, and the state. </p><p>  Recall that from March 1 last year, the free <strong>privatization of municipal housing ended</strong> .  Since that time, when privatization was just a rush, people sought to quickly transfer their apartment into ownership, a lot has changed.  Of course, there were many transactions in which people privatized their possessions, but there were also many reverse transactions, the so-called deprivatization of housing.  It all depends on a person‚Äôs personal preference - whether he wants to privatize the apartment or not.  But in any case, you need to consult a competent lawyer who will certainly tell you the right decision individually for each owner. </p>
