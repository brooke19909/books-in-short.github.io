At the same time, it has an almost identical design, reminiscent of the newer 8 model, it is waterproof when it splashes or falls into the water, as well as a tactile feedback button.  When iPhone 7 came out, what are its hallmarks? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when iPhone 7 came out in Russia" class="if uuid-3106832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3106832.jpg"></div><p>  Its most important feature is that it does not have a headphone jack.  In addition, the iPhone 7 does not have wireless charging, like the models 8 and X. However, this does not matter much, because Lightning works fine.  Today it can be upgraded to iOS 12, which promises a significant increase in performance.  The iPhone 7 has a really good A10 processor, so this addition will look very good. </p><h2>  Release Date and Distribution </h2><p>  When did iPhone 7 come out?  The pre-order for the device in the countries of the so-called ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù took place on September 9, 2016.  Then all the features and specifications of the new gadget were revealed. </p><p>  When the iPhone 7 went on sale, the demand for it was great. In the above countries, it entered stores on September 16th.  At the same time, Russia belonged to the ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù countries, so on this date the smartphone could only be ordered via the Internet from abroad. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When did iPhone 7 come out in Russia?  Officially, the arrival of devices in stores was announced on September 23.  The announcement stated that it looks almost the same as the iPhone 6S of 2014 and 6S of 2015. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did the iPhone 7 go" class="if uuid-3106826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3106826.jpg"></div><h2>  How is it different from other devices </h2><p>  There are many good or even great Android phones released during 2016.  IPhone 7 surpasses each of them in speed, but not in battery life.  Its size, performance and camera are unique features, along with the ability to use iOS, of course.  The most important thing is that this smartphone is waterproof, that is, it can be immersed in water for a while without damage. </p><p>  Compared with the previous model, the camera takes significantly better photos, especially in low light, and adds the function of optical image stabilization.  The battery lasts a little longer, and sometimes it is very noticeable, especially compared to the iPhone 6S.  The processor in the smartphone is definitely faster when compared with previous-generation iPhones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 7 went on sale" class="if uuid-3106828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3106828.jpg"></div><p>  He also has a screen with a "wide color gamut" with increased color accuracy and improved stereo speakers.  According to user reviews, these improvements are not as important as those described above.  In addition, the Home button is no longer clickable - it has the same pressure sensitivity and vibration feedback as the touch screen.  The key works fine, but it takes some getting used to, because when it is pressed there is no mechanical click. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New A10 Fusion Processor </h2><p>  This is the biggest advancement in technical parameters.  Shortly before the release of iPhone 7, Apple announced that the A10 Fusion chip has four cores: two high-performance for the most intensive tasks and two low-energy to perform simpler functions while saving energy.  According to user reviews, when using the device, its speed is noticeable from the first clicks. </p><p>  Applications start up quickly, updates are installed quickly, and the camera is ready to shoot right after switching on.  According to many users, any performance differences are not noticeable in resource-intensive (such as Pixelmator) and lightweight applications (such as Mail). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.expertreviews.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when will the iPhone 7 exact date" class="if uuid-3106829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3106829.jpg"></div><p>  However, despite the A10's power management features, in practice there is no significant saving in battery life.  Being charged in the morning, iPhone 7 warns the user already in the early evening (usually between 5 and 8 o‚Äôclock in the evening) that the battery power is reduced to 20 percent. </p><h2>  The best screen, memory and speakers </h2><p>  Many have been wondering for a long time when iPhone 7 will be released.  The exact release date of the device for sale was so interesting to the mass consumer for various reasons, including because the developers promised to introduce an improved screen of a new generation. </p><p>  When the smartphone became available, numerous reviews confirmed that the update was indeed present.  The screen has become brighter, which makes it easier to read in bright sunlight.  It also supports a wider color gamut, making photos and videos look rich, vibrant. </p><h2>  Sound features </h2><p>  When the iPhone 7 came out, Apple developers removed the analog headphone port and added a second speaker for stereo sound.  It is located next to the FaceTime camera, and the sound improvement is noticeable immediately. </p><h2>  Inner memory </h2><p>  Another nice addition is doubling the size of storage.  The entry-level iPhone 7 now has 32 GB instead of 16. Other models offer 128 and 256 GB.  This is very important if you always have to manage the available storage by deleting photos and videos.  For comparison: IPhone SE has a maximum capacity of 64 GB, and iPhone 6s - 128 GB, so if you need a large amount of memory, model 7 is what you need. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The iPhone 7 has one 12-megapixel iSight camera, but its performance is significantly improved compared to the 6s.  The lens has a wider aperture - f 1.8, which gives more light for better photos in low light. </p><p>  The iPhone 7 also has optical image stabilization, which was previously limited to the larger Plus models.  The TrueTone flash is also 50% brighter thanks to four LEDs.  Apple said it could even compensate for the faint flickering of interior lighting. </p><p>  On the front, the FaceTime camera has grown from 5 megapixels (as it was in the iPhone 6s) to 7 megapixels, although it retains the same f 2.2 aperture.  Now it can record 1080p video, and its performance in low light is also improved.  In general, it works more like a rear view camera, so your selfies will always look good. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="when iPhone 7 Plus came out" class="if uuid-3106827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3106827.jpg"></div><h2>  Waterproof smartphone </h2><p>  When the iPhone 7 came out, its declared water resistance immediately began to be discussed.  This is not surprising: an accidental fall of the device into the water can occur in everyone.  However, Apple support recommends that you do not wet the iPhone specifically, and if you do, unplug all the cables and make sure it is completely dry before trying to charge it again. </p><h2>  Subsequent plus sign </h2><p>  Many are surprised to find out in which year ‚ÄúiPhone-7‚Äù was released.  Being released in 2016, it is still ahead of new devices, even produced much later.  Today, it remains one of the frequently purchased and used devices. </p><p>  At the same time, Apple used the already familiar formula and a little later released another version of the device.  It will not surprise you with a new design or massive innovation, but the iPhone 7 Plus is a great phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did the iPhone 7 go" class="if uuid-3106825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/3106825.jpg"></div><p>  It offers everything the Model 7 has - high performance, waterproof, loudspeakers, excellent cameras, and at the same time adds some smart features that are more important to many users than the vibrant features. </p><p>  When did iPhone 7 Plus come out?  Its appearance on the market was noted in September 2017, that is, a year later.  At that time, the price of it was more than 60 thousand rubles.  Its main advantage and addition is the increased battery life.  According to reviews, the device works without recharging for 6 hours longer than iPhone-7, with the same activity of use.  Therefore, the smartphone is suitable for active people using mobile gadgets throughout the day.  The only drawback with this is the lack of fast charging. </p>
