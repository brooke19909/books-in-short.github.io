  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Satin ribbons for needlework</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Satin ribbons are a wonderful material for the embodiment of creative ideas.  They have not only the most different colors, but also size, and even thickness.  Three-dimensional bows and flowers, butterflies, and whole paintings on fabric are obtained from satin stripes.  It is convenient to work with them, since the lateral edges of the fabric are processed and do not split, and the slices are perfectly fused with a candle or a lighter. </p><p>  Satin ribbons are used for embroidery, combining wide and thin strips in the composition.  The paintings look bright and original, as the fabric is shiny.  In the article, we consider several options for using satin stripes.  The samples presented in the photographs will give a clearer picture of the final result. </p><h2>  How to make a rose </h2><p>  A satin ribbon rose can be created in several ways.  Consider how to make a lush flower from cut segments.  To begin with, cut a tape 4 cm wide into equal lengths of 10 cm. You need to cook 12-15 pieces.  For the central bud, the length of the cut is larger, about 15 cm. The middle of the rose is made of satin ribbons by first folding the corner of the fabric at a right angle, then making another turn and fastening the bottom edge with stitches with a simple thread to the tone of the fabric.  Then they perform a couple more revolutions of the matter around them and additionally strengthen them with seams.  When the middle is ready, you can begin work on creating the petals.  The photograph shows that the segments are turned into corners by corners so that right angles are formed.  It must be taken into account that the strips of fabric are folded to the wrong side.  The lower part is stitched along the base line with stitches.  The thread is better to choose the same color as the flower petals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fabartdiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a rose from ribbons" class="if uuid-2510212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2510212.jpg"></div><p>  Further <span>out of satin ribbons with their own hands</span> make up a rose.  Petals are mounted around the central bud face up.  They are distributed around the circumference of the flower in a checkerboard pattern so that every detail is clearly visible.  The handicraft made of different colors looks beautiful.  You can add a rose with several green leaves.  At the end of the work, the flower is turned on the other side and the excess tissue is cut (to the seams).  The rose itself can be glued onto a felt base with a glue gun.  It is more convenient to place the finished product on a hoop or sew it on an elastic band for hair, stick it on a gift box or a holiday card. </p><h2>  Rose embroidery </h2><p>  Flowers from satin ribbons are not always made into separate parts, often a rose is sewn into a fabric for decorating clothes, creating a floral composition for wall panels.  Consider how to sew a flower into the main fabric with a wide-eye needle.  You will also need a hook, thread, matched to the tone of a satin ribbon, scissors.  Work begins in the same way as in the previous version, that is, first the middle is made, the twisted bud. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rose of ribbons" class="if uuid-2510207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2510207.jpg"></div><p>  The only thing that distinguishes this model from the previous one is the sewing on a bud of a ribbon rolled up by corners.  Take a length of 30 cm and sew it to the middle from the bottom, then turn the tape for each petal at right angles to the base.  From the bottom with stitches, the edge of the strip is fastened to the previous turn. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The midline from the bottom is cut off so that the bundle of the fabric is not too voluminous.  Next, take a needle with a wide eye and insert a satin ribbon into the hole.  Petals are arranged around the entire circumference around the middle.  Each loop is neatly aligned with a hook.  It is necessary to ensure that all petals have the same length at the same level.  The lower ring is made of larger loops, and the middle one is slightly smaller.  If you don‚Äôt need to sew a rose onto a fabric, you can use a glue gun to attach the loops.  Then cut the tape into equal segments. </p><h2>  Small roses </h2><p>  You can use the following scheme to create small flowers <span>from satin ribbons with your own hands</span> .  You will need a thin ribbon for the base of the craft and a wide structural strip, a ‚Äúgypsy‚Äù needle with a wide eye. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wonderfuldiy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple rose from ribbons" class="if uuid-2511984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2511984.jpg"></div><p>  At first, work is carried out with a thin ribbon, wide stitches are made from a central point (like a snowflake).  Then they thread the tape wider and stretch it under the stitches through one in a circle.  In this case, the fabric is constantly twisted.  In the middle you can insert a bead or pebbles for beauty. </p><h2>  Embroidery with thin ribbons </h2><p>  You can create not only roses loved by many from <span>satin ribbons with your own hands</span> .  Even the simplest flowers from thin satin stripes look original.  In order to nicely arrange many small details in the picture, it is advisable to draw a future image on paper using pencils of different colors.  Then transfer the drawing to the fabric with a simple pencil.  It is best to start the craft by embroidering stems and thin leaves.  Then perform the middle of the flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon picture" class="if uuid-2510205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2510205.jpg"></div><p>  At the very end, petals are embroidered.  The details with twisted stripes look beautiful.  To embroider flowers from satin ribbons, a needle with a wide eye is selected, you can additionally insert small blotches of thread floss.  Consider the diagram below how to work with a needle to create panel elements. </p><h2>  How to embroider ribbons: patterns </h2><p>  In the first figure, you can see how the stitch is embroidered with stitches with a thin green ribbon.  First draw a line with small or simple pencil and, having previously tied a knot on a ribbon, hang it on the end of the stalk from the back of the fabric.  After each stitching, the needle returns back to the middle of the previous stitch.  The tape should always be on one side. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to embroider ribbons" class="if uuid-2510201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2510201.jpg"></div><p>  Orange threads show how to make beautiful nodules that can be used to create berries on branches or in the middle of flowers.  Satin ribbons can be made as wide petals of tulips, as well as thin pointed elements of chamomile.  If, after piercing the fabric, the tape is wrapped several times around its axis, you will get a thin part, and it will be quite dense, so that you can give it any shape. </p><h2>  Satin Ribbon Bows </h2><p>  Decorative bows are most conveniently twisted from satin ribbons.  It can be magnificent spherical crafts or horizontal flat bows.  The edges are cut at an angle, even or dovetail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pp-ribbon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="satin ribbon bows" class="if uuid-2510216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2510216.jpg"></div><p>  Loops of bows can be both sewn and knotted.  Often, such products are made from a single strip, but there are options for creating the original bow from individual segments.  Consider this option in more detail. </p><h2>  Ribbon Bow </h2><p>  Such a magnificent bow can be attached to a hairpin for a girl or used as a brooch on a dress or hat.  To create such a craft, you need to cut equal sections of a satin ribbon 2 cm wide. The length is chosen at will, depending on the size of the future bow.  There should be 24 loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="meusartesanato.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lush bow from segments" class="if uuid-2510215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2510215.jpg"></div><p>  Collect the bow together with a glue gun.  As a basis, you can take a small circle of dense fabric or felt.  A brooch or a large pebble in a frame is attached in the center from the top.  You can use decorative insects, for example, a dragonfly or a ladybug. </p><h2>  Embroidery labels </h2><p>  Masters use satin ribbons in many crafts.  With a thin ribbon, put into a needle with a wide eye, you can embroider a bright inscription on the fabric.  First you need to write it with a marker or a simple pencil, and then simply arrange the stitches along the contours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dicraft.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="embroidery ribbons" class="if uuid-2511987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2511987.jpg"></div><p>  As you can see, from satin ribbons of different widths and colors you can create beautiful, spectacular products.
