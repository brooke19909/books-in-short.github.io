He was a direct witness to many sharp turns in history that befell Russia in that era.  One of the most prominent sociologists in the world survived <span>political repression</span> under the tsarist regime, two revolutions, a civil war, and expulsion from the country.  Unfortunately, the importance of the scientific works of Pitirim Sorokin was not appreciated either in Russia or in the United States of America, which became his second homeland.  An exceptionally erudite sociologist wrote dozens of books and hundreds of articles, subsequently translated into forty-eight languages.  According to many modern experts, his theories that reveal the problems and contradictions of human society remain relevant in our days. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  The future scientist and politician was born in 1889 in the <span>Vologda province.</span>  Biography of Pitirim Sorokin began in a small village called Turia.  His father, a master of decorating icons, was engaged in restoration work in temples.  Mother died as a result of an illness at the age of thirty-four.  This tragedy was the first childhood memory of Sorokin.  My father taught Pitirim and his older brother Vasily the intricacies of his profession.  The head of the family did not marry a second time and tried to cope with grief from the loss of a loved one with the help of vodka.  After the father finished his fever, the sons left home and became wandering artisans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="biography of Pitirim Sorokin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065040.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  A short biography of Pitirim Sorokin is set out in his book entitled "The Long Road."  In his memoirs, the author recalls his young years and describes in detail the event that became a turning point in his difficult fate.  Almost by accident, having passed the entrance exams at a special institution for the preparation of teachers for parish schools, he passed the tests and was enrolled.  Although living on a tiny scholarship was a challenge, two years later Sorokin successfully completed his education.  For excellent results, he was given the opportunity to continue his studies at public expense. </p><h2>  Student years </h2><p>  In 1904, Sorokin began teaching at a school for the training of teachers in the <span>Kostroma province.</span>  At that time, political unrest raged in the Russian Empire.  Fermentation of minds at all times was typical of the student environment.  The future sociologist joined the revolutionary group adhering to the populist ideology.  This period of the biography of Pitirim Sorokin played a significant role in the formation of his worldview and value system. </p><p>  Passionate character did not allow him to stay away from the dangerous illegal activities of the circle of revolutionaries.  As a result, the student was arrested by the police on suspicion of political unreliability.  He spent several months in prison.  Thanks to the liberal attitude of the guards, the revolutionaries, being in custody, spoke almost freely with each other and with the outside world.  According to Sorokin, the time spent in prison made it possible to get acquainted with the classical works of socialist philosophers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Freed from the conclusion, the future famous sociologist decided to stop participating in the revolutionary struggle and devote himself to science.  After a couple of years of wandering around the country, he managed to enter the law faculty of the State University in St. Petersburg.  A new stage has begun in the biography of Pitirim Sorokin, which opens up the path to academic heights for young talented people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pitirim Sorokin short biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065046.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  As a university student, he showed tremendous performance.  In a short time, Sorokin wrote and published a large number of reviews and essays.  He actively collaborated with a number of specialized scientific journals devoted to issues of psychology and sociology.  The main achievement of this period in the biography of Pitirim Sorokin was a book entitled "Crime and punishment, feat and reward."  She received very high marks in the academic community. </p><p>  Despite the intense scientific work, Sorokin returned to political activity and again attracted the attention of the police.  In order to avoid trouble from the guardians of the law, he was forced, using a false passport, to leave for Western Europe and stay there for several months.  After returning to Russia, the scientist wrote a pamphlet criticizing the monarchical state system.  This led to a new arrest.  Sorokin managed to get out of prison only thanks to the intercession of his mentor Maxim Kovalevsky, who was a deputy of the Duma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sorokin Pitirim Alexandrovich biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065047.jpg"></div>

During the period of World War II, he continued to publish in large quantities his literary works, among which there was even one fantastic novel.  The defense of the dissertation was prevented by the outbreak of revolution. </p><p>  In the dramatic 1917, Sorokin married Elena Baratynskaya, a hereditary noblewoman from the Crimea.  They met at one of the literary evenings.  The couple was destined to share all the joys and sorrows and stay together until the end of life. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sorokin Pitirim Alexandrovich short biography" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065042.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Revolution and Civil War </h2><p>  In a brief biography of Pitirim Alexandrovich Sorokin, it is impossible to mention all the events that he became a witness and direct participant in during the turbulent years of the collapse of the Russian Empire.  The scientist assisted the work of the Provisional Government and even acted as secretary of the Minister-Chairman Alexander Kerensky.  Sorokin before others saw a serious threat in the Bolshevik party and demanded the use of harsh measures to strengthen order and stabilize the situation in the country. </p><p>  After the October Revolution, he entered the fight against the Soviet regime and took part in an attempt to overthrow it in the Arkhangelsk province.  Sorokin was arrested by the Bolsheviks and sentenced to death.  However, in exchange for a public promise to give up political activity, he was not only saved his life, but his freedom was returned.  Sorokin resumed scientific and teaching work at the university.  After the Civil War, he received the title of professor and successfully defended his doctoral dissertation in sociology. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pitirim Sorokin work" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065043.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Exile </h2><p>  In 1922, mass arrests of representatives of the intelligentsia began on suspicion of dissent and disloyal attitude to the Bolshevik government.  Among those detained by the Moscow Extraordinary Commission was Sorokin.  The arrested were offered a simple choice: to be shot or to leave the Soviet country forever.  The doctor of sociological sciences and his wife went to Germany, and then to the United States of America.  They took with them only two suitcases, in which was the most important - handwritten main works.  The biography of Pitirim Sorokin from the beginning of his academic career and until the moment he was expelled from his native country began to be called the Russian period of his work.  The famous scientist was forever deported, but escaped physical reprisal and was able to continue his activities in distant America. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scientific works of Pitirim Sorokin" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065044.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Life and work in the USA </h2><p>  In 1923, Sorokin came to the United States to give lectures on revolutionary events in Russia.  He received offers of collaboration from the universities of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois.  Sorokin took less than a year in order to fluently master the English language.  In America, he wrote and published a book called "Pages of the Russian Diary", which is a personal memoirs of a scientist about turbulent revolutionary times. </p><p>  The works of Pitirim Sorokin, created in exile, made a significant contribution to world sociology.  In just a few years of his life in the USA, he wrote a lot of scientific works in which he outlined his theories of the structure of human society.  Sorokin became a prominent figure in American academic circles and received an offer to head the Department of Sociology at the world-famous Harvard University.  This may seem incredible, but according to contemporaries, he continued to maintain relations with friends who remained in Russia, even during the Stalinist repressions.  After many years of fruitful work at Harvard, Sorokin resigned and devoted the rest of his life to gardening.  He died in 1968 at his home in Massachusetts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pitirim Sorokin sociology of revolution" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52736/2065039.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Ideas and books </h2><p>  Particular attention was attracted by readers of the work of Pitirim Sorokin, ‚ÄúSociology of Revolution,‚Äù published by him shortly after moving to America.  In this book, he emphasizes the inefficiency of the violent change of government, since in practice such actions always lead to a reduction in personal freedom and the suffering of millions of people.  According to the author, revolutions devalue human life and engender universal cruelty.  As an alternative, Sorokin proposes peaceful constitutional reforms that pursue not real, but utopian goals.  The ideas of one of the greatest sociologists in history are not outdated in our time. </p>
