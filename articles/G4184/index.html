The beauty of pearl lakes, green hills, picturesque rivers with waterfalls, caves and gorges, lost in the rocks, intoxicates with its beauty.  Anyone who once visited the "Siberian Alps" will never forget them.  Then this place beckons and calls to itself, beautiful memories haunt us, and again we begin to choose one of the comfortable hotels in the Altai Mountains. </p><h2>  Determine the area </h2><p>  In the first place is Maima.  It is in this area that places are concentrated that are in demand among couples and youth.  This direction is distinguished by massive flows of tourists, it is conveniently located in the north-west of Gorny Altai and is the first on the way from Biysk.  There is a warm lake Aya, and on the border of the area there are amazing Tavdinsky caves.  A visit to them does not require special training and equipment, they are fully equipped for sightseeing shows. </p>

    <p>  In order to see the picturesque <span>Kamyshlinsky waterfall,</span> tourists rush to the Shebalinsky district.  On its territory there is a natural monument "Clean meadow", as well as the only bison nursery outside the Urals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Chemal district is a little further, it stretches along the left bank of the Katun for 3000 km.  People come here to see the beautiful hydroelectric power station, located among the cedar forests growing among the rocks and mountain rivers.  A large number of hotels in the Altai Mountains is located near the village of Katun. </p><p>  Many tourists come here "savages" in their own cars, stop in the summer in a bungalow that can be rented from private owners.  Practice shows that such a vacation is even more expensive due to unbalanced food in different roadside cafes and restaurants.  In addition, it is not quite comfortable, especially when traveling with a small child. </p><h2>  Rating of the best hotels in Gorny Altai </h2><p>  On one of the most popular booking sites, top hotels, recreation centers and other tourist complexes of this region were compiled based on almost 5,000 tourist reviews.  The first place was the modern eco-hotel "Altika" in the Ust-Munsky district near the village of Manzherok with the lake of the same name.  The complex is very quiet and calm, designed for family vacations. </p><p>  Panoramic windows offer unforgettable views of Katun, the main water river in the region.  Its main advantages are a wide range of wellness services in the SPA complex (for example, phytobarrel and pantotherapy), comfortable rooms from environmentally friendly materials and a large swimming pool.  By the way, wellness treatments (baths, saunas, pools, antlers and aromatherapy) are offered in many hotels in the Altai Mountains. </p>

    <p>  Reasonable pricing policy of the hotel "Mountain Fairy Tale" and a wide range of services provide excellent results: every year the number of guests is growing steadily.  On the beautiful territory there is a small water park, in which both large and small children are happy to rest. </p><h2>  Setting priorities </h2><p>  This is the main criterion for choosing a hotel.  First of all, you need to decide what you need most.  A lot of b / o is located on the right and left banks of the Katun, away from the hustle and bustle of major highways, in an ecologically clean place.  If you plan hiking or more extreme hiking, it is worth staying in remote alpine regions. </p><p>  Beach holidays are good near the lakes Aya, Teletskoye.  It is impossible to swim in Katun: the river is mountainous and very cold, the temperature does not rise above 12-14 ¬∞ C even in the hottest months.  But grayling, taimen, Siberian char, burbot, etc. are well caught in the river. Try to ensure that within walking distance there is what you want from the rest. </p><p>  The choice of accommodation is a very responsible task, because the quality of rest depends on proper sleep and nutrition.  Hotels on the banks of the <span>turquoise Katun</span> or Lake Teletskoye, the village of Manzherok, Chemal and in many other picturesque places of the Altai Mountains will give you an unforgettable vacation that will be remembered for a lifetime. </p>
