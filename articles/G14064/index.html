However, many even bathe here in January - +13 for some it is quite an acceptable temperature. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is about the weather in Spain.

    <h2>  Hotel Policies &amp; Booking Features </h2><p>  Having decided to go to this complex, it is worth knowing that check-in here starts at 14:00.  And the departure lasts until 12:00.

The facility accepts Visa, Diners Club, American Express and JCB.  Upon check-in, you will need to present your card with your passport. </p><p>  It should be noted that cash at the hotel accepts payments up to a maximum of 2,500.  e.

The beach is just that. </p><p>  Tourists say that in these places the coastline is incredibly clean, the sea is striking in its transparency.

    <h2>  Other reviews </h2><p>  Having examined the comments about the hotel left by travelers, we can conclude that this is a really good hotel with excellent service.  About Sol Palmanova Mallorca 4 * they tell a lot, but here are some points that tourists pay special attention to: </p><ul><li>  Cleaning.  High-quality and daily, as well as the replacement of linen with towels. </li><li>  Security.  The area is calm, but at night the policeman watches the hotel grounds and the prevailing atmosphere. </li><li>  The location is really good.  There is a bus stop just around the corner from the hotel, and a little further down the street there is an endless string of souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants. </li><li>  Nutrition.  There is a variety, but most importantly, everything is tasty and fresh.  You can eat from morning to evening, you can‚Äôt stay hungry.  Many even jokingly attributed this to the minuses, since with such a free regime after vacation, the scales showed a ‚Äúplus‚Äù in terms of kilograms. </li><li>  Staff.  Friendly and good-natured.  Nobody takes tips - it‚Äôs not allowed. </li><li>  ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù to the upper floors.  There are two elevators, so people who have arrived with a very small child who have not left the stroller can not worry about what to do if they give a room on the top floor. </li><li>  Silence.  The rooms are well isolated.  If guests are used to going to bed early, then they may not worry about the fact that the evening animation will interfere with them - just close the balcony door and turn on the climate system so that it is not hot. </li></ul><p>  Well, the summary is: the hotel is very decent, the combination of price and quality fully justifies itself.  But if you want to go here, then you should book a room in advance.  The hotel is popular, booking apartments here is not just weeks - months ahead. </p>
