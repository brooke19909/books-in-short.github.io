Firstly, the availability of this OS, its openness to developers.  Secondly, the presence of a large number of developments and relatively stable versions.  Thirdly, the widest range of software, presented in the form of millions of applications available for installation. </p><p>  Of course, in addition to Android, there are alternative options for working OS.  First of all, this is iOS - a product developed by Apple to interact with their devices.  The latter include iPad Air and iPad mini of all generations. </p><p>  The third ‚Äúwhale‚Äù of the tablet operating system market, of course, is Windows.  Its presence is explained by the fact that Microsoft also decided to participate in this software race, presenting its generation of systems - first the 8th, then the 10th. </p>

    <p>  We will talk more about this system, as well as about devices that support working with it, in this article. </p><h2>  How to install Windows on a tablet? </h2><p>  And we will start with the most common question that some owners of mobile devices may ask (of course, those that do not contact technology too often).  However, we will answer it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The question is how to install Windows on a tablet running another operating system.  The answer to it depends on which processor your tablet is based on.  If we are talking about a gadget with support for i386 or x64 architecture, then theoretically you can boot Windows onto it.  This applies to processors VIA, Intel and AMD.  If you have NVIDIA, Snapdragon, MediaTek or Tegra (and there are, in essence, the majority), then nothing will work.  Even theoretically, you can not install Windows on these devices. </p><p>  But how to install <span>Windows on a tablet,</span> if it belongs to the category of suitable ones?  First of all, you need to take care of creating a bootable USB flash drive with the Windows distribution of the desired version.  After that, after copying all the important data, you should install ‚Äúover‚Äù the native Android.  It is impossible to say for sure whether the tablet will work after this.  The procedure is similar to a simple flashing, but nothing is known about the stability of the device after such an operation. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, we do not recommend experimenting and putting ‚ÄúWindows 8‚Äù on the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù tablet.  And, frankly, there is no obvious need to do this, since the version of Microsoft software installed in this way is unlikely to show better results than the ‚Äúnative‚Äù preinstalled Android.  So, the game will not be worth the candle.  It is better to get rid of the old device and purchase a new one that has support for Windows initially.  Moreover, some of them have an affordable price.  You do not have to buy Microsoft Surface Pro 3. Read more about which devices in question, read further in our article. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In its framework, we will consider only those gadgets that were offered with Windows initially. </p><h2>  Versions </h2><p>  Another important nuance to which you should pay attention is the version of the operating system, which can be preinstalled on a mobile device.  The last and most relevant (at the time of writing, at least) is the tenth modification.  She was preceded by the 8th.  It is logical that specialists simply finalized their product and released a new version of it, which was better than the previous one. </p>

    <p>  Some users in their reviews ask if it is possible to find Windows 7 preinstalled on the tablet.  The answer is a categorical no.  This version of the OS is delivered to stationary PCs (or at least to laptops, but without touch control support).  Versions 8 and 10 are also found on laptops, but you can interact with them (if you have a touch screen).  This is convenient, because to some extent it turns a stationary working PC into a tablet. </p><h2>  Update </h2><p>  To the topic of versions, you also need to add that formally there are no borders between how the tablet works with Windows 8 and 10.  The explanation is very simple.  As we mentioned above, the tenth is just the modification following the eighth (in the update hierarchy).  Accordingly, buying a gadget with the "eight", you can independently update the software (by connecting the device to a Wi-Fi network, of course).  So get a tablet on Windows 10. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Main difference </h2><p>  Should I do an update?  In this matter, it is better, of course, not to turn to technical parameters, but to seek information directly, exploring the experience of others.  If you believe the reviews of users whose Windows tablet came with version 8, and they switched to 10, then it makes sense to update.  The system began to work much more lively and became much more understandable.  And this means a lot, especially since the G8 was initially considered in many ways ‚Äúraw‚Äù.  After all, before it, the Windows have never been presented to the Windows tablet, and in some ways it is the ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù of this market. </p><h2>  Windows Devices </h2><p>  So, a little theory about how the tablet with Windows 8 differs from the same on the ‚Äútop ten‚Äù, as well as about the possibilities of switching from Android to Windows, we told you.  Now it's time to take a look at which tablet computers are presented with this operating system, and that a buyer who wants to use this OS can take a look. </p><p>  Conventionally, all devices from this category can be divided into several classes.  These are: budget computers from little-known manufacturers (for example, Prestigio MultiPad, Qumo Vega, Digma Eve, Bravis WXI89, Cube iWork 8);  mid-range devices (PIXUS TaskTab, Lenovo IdeaTab, Dell Venue);  as well as the premium segment (Acer Iconia, HP Pro Tablet, Microsoft Surface Pro 3, Lenovo ThinkPad 10).  We made the classification based on the cost of the device.  The first group included those that cost up to 7-9 thousand rubles;  second - from 10 to 20 thousand;  the third - over 20,000 rubles. </p><p>  Each of these segments has its own characteristics. </p>

    <p>  So, for example, the first group includes manufacturers who produce a product that operates on the basis of an operating system that is interesting for certain customers.  Due to this, they are going to sell their equipment using the ‚Äúbig‚Äù name of the Windows system.  In fact, it may turn out <span>that such a gadget</span> will not be stable, will receive low-quality equipment and low performance.  Such devices are suitable only for basic operations such as surfing the net, checking mail. </p><p>  The second group of gadgets includes good samples on the principle of ‚Äúcheap and cheerful‚Äù, among which you can find representatives that are really worth their money.  Devices have wide functionality due to this operating system and at the same time they can please the buyer with their price tag. </p><p>  Finally, the third group is really upscale devices, often designed for professionals.  For example, it is very convenient to work with them in the field of graphic development or due to the rich capabilities of office software. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  You can talk endlessly about the pros and cons of the tablet (Windows).  It would be easier to say this: it is a completely different (in terms of logic and arrangement) OS, which you need to get used to.  Those who managed to work with it for a long time, most often call it much more convenient than Android and iOS.  And vice versa - if you take the tablet on "Windows 8.1" in your hands for the first time, you can get confused.  The user most often in this situation raises the question: and what next? </p><p>  The fact that this OS is presented on the market is a very positive phenomenon in any case, since it suggests the existence of an alternative, which means that it is possible to choose a system in accordance with your preferences, which is important. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  If there are a large number of models in the assortment, you can also get confused, trying to make a choice.  We would advise you to take it easier and reason as follows: clearly define your goals.  If you need a device for periodically reading books and watching news, taking a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù gadget does not make sense, since you simply will not reveal its potential.  On the other hand, if you want to draw on the device, and also if you need a personal assistant at hand, for example, to work with presentations, reports at any time, it is better to take something like the ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù version of Microsoft Surface (adjusted for the financial side , of course). </p>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Do not forget to pay attention to the recommendations of other buyers.  Most often, they contain the most truthful information about how the device behaves under certain conditions, what should be expected from it, how justified its cost, and so on. </p><p>  So you can, after finding for yourself a few acceptable options, determine the most suitable tablet for Windows 10. </p><h2>  The ‚Äúbest" tablet </h2><p>  We specifically used the characteristic ‚Äúmost suitable‚Äù, since it is impossible to say which computer is the best.  After all, there is a certain balance between the quality of the device and its cost, which are in direct proportion to each other.  The higher the performance of the gadget, the more expensive it is and, therefore, less accessible to customers.  In turn, developers of budget versions are forced to compromise, equipping devices with less technological stuffing.  As a result, a loss of part of the functionality and level of performance. </p><p>  You can find the ‚Äúbest‚Äù tablet on Windows exclusively for yourself, based on your own requirements, preferences and capabilities. </p>

    <h2>  Platform perspectives </h2><p>  Separately, I would like to note about the future of such a platform on tablet devices.  Since now iOS and Android are considered as those that go in the same development vector, the Windows installed on the tablet is more likely some other option, something alternative for both.  Therefore, she may be interested in more buyers, which gives her a serious prospect. </p><p>  Therefore, it is safe to say that Windows gadgets have considerable potential.  The main thing is that software developers understand this and continue to develop the product, not stopping there. </p>
