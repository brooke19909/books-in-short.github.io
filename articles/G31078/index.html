Siberian Khanate: time of occurrence</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to the all-knowing Wikipedia, the Siberian Khanate is a feudal state that was located in <span>Western Siberia.</span>  It was formed in the middle of the <span>fourteenth century.</span>  The indigenous people of the Khanate were the Turks.  It bordered on Perm land, the Nogai Horde, and the Irtysh teleuts.  The northern borders of the Siberian Khanate reached the lower reaches of the Ob, while the eastern borders were adjacent to the Pega Horde. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Siberian Khanate" class="if uuid-446923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446923.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  Is it all so clear? </h2><p>  Oddly enough, there is practically no information about this state formation.  All written sources that have survived to this day relate to the period when the annexation of the Siberian Khanate took place.  They are mainly Cossack memoirs, collected together by Archbishop Cyprian in 1622.  The reliability of this information is poor.  All subsequent annals were compiled to please the Christian church and the ruling dynasty.  Any documents that contradicted official theory were simply destroyed.  What is most interesting, not a single coin of the Siberian Khanate has even come down to our days (apparently, they were hastily assembled and re-melted, since they were contrary to the generally accepted version).  Actually, quite cynical manipulations with the history of our state are not news, it happens all the time, and there is no need to look into its depths, it‚Äôs enough to see how distorted the events of the Second World War are, despite the fact that many eyewitnesses of that period are still alive . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="the capital of the Siberian Khanate" class="if uuid-446920" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446920.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  And the indigenous peoples of Siberia are against ... </h2><p>  Historians in compiling a chronology of the development of our state rely solely on written documents.  For comparison: when describing the ancient civilizations of the world, scientists often used oral traditions of peoples, their legends, tales and others as sources, and only when it comes to Russia, they stand in the pose and demand irrefutable written documents, and all other artifacts: architecture, they refuse to accept precious jewelry, weapons, not to mention the huge layer of oral information transmitted from generation to generation.  Why is that?  The fact is that all these sources sharply contradict the officially recognized version of history.  We will not even take as a basis Russian tales, epics and legends.  Let us turn to an independent source - the indigenous <span>peoples of Siberia, the</span> Far East and the Russian North.  It turns out that they keep in their legends information about who populated these territories in antiquity.  According to the keepers of the ancient culture: Evenks, Chukchi, Yakuts, Khanty, Mansi and many others - there used to be bearded white people with eyes the color of the sky, they taught the ancestors of modern indigenous peoples to hunt, fish, raise deer and other wisdom that allows them to survive in difficult natural conditions of the north.  And there are a lot of similar stories, but scientists prefer not to notice them.  As a result, a lot of questions arise, including about who settled the so-called Turkic states?  Is this all clear?  After all, there is not a single written source of that time for a reason. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Well, let‚Äôs end our lyrical digression on this and get acquainted with the official version of the history of that period and find out how the annexation of the Siberian Khanate took place.  Moreover, a competent person himself will catch inconsistencies and obvious falsifications in this theory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="annexation of the Siberian Khanate" class="if uuid-448543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/448543.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  T√ºrks of Western Siberia: before the Mongol conquest </h2><p>  It is believed that these are the same Huns who originally lived in the region of China and subsequently migrated first to Siberia in the 90s BC, and then some of them in the 150s of our era - further to the west.  This second wave in the fourth century terrified all of Europe.  There is practically no information about what the Siberian Khanate was at the dawn of civilization (its origin is unknown).  However, the historian G. Fayzrakhmanov gives a list of the first rulers of this state (Ishim Khanate): Kyzyl-tin, Devlet-Yuvash, Ishim, Mamet, Kutash, Allagul, Kuzei, Ebardul, Bakhmur, Yakhimet, Yurak, Munchak, Yuzak, Munchak and On- sleep.  The scientist refers to a certain chronicle, which he was lucky to study, but there is no reliable data on this document anywhere.  Provided that this list is real, it turns out that the rulers held power from the end of the eleventh century until the 1230s.  The last khan from the list obeyed Genghis Khan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="peoples of the Siberian Khanate" class="if uuid-446921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446921.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  <span>Western Siberia</span> after the Tatar-Mongol conquest </h2><p>  Here we are again confronted with limited information.  Almost nothing is known about how the <span>conquest of Western Siberia</span> by the Mongols took place.  It can be assumed that everything worked out with small forces.  Therefore, the campaign of a small detachment simply did not begin to be included in the official Mongolian chronicles.  Although the name "Siberia" is mentioned in their documents, it means that Genghis Khan nevertheless conquered this state.  Official annals (for example, Peter Godunov) say that after Genghis Khan conquered Bukhara, Taibuga asked him for his inheritance along the rivers Ture, Irtysh and Ishim.  The descendants of this Taibugi continued to own these lands.  According to the annals, Taibuga was the khan of a small nomadic detachment that joined the army of Genghis Khan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Turkic states" class="if uuid-446924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446924.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  New dynasty </h2><p>  So the old dynasty of the Ishim Khanate was interrupted, and a new ruler appeared.  At this time, a new capital of the Siberian Khanate - Tyumen, which can be interpreted as "Tumen", that is, "ten thousand."  Apparently, Taibuga undertook to expose a ten thousandth army from his possessions.  This concludes the information about the Khanate.  True, the historian G. Fayzrakhmanov, again referring to an unknown chronicle, gives a new list of the rulers of this state: Taibug, Khoja, Mar (or Umar), Ader (Obder) and Yabalak (Eblak), Muhammad, Angish (Agay), Kazy (Kasim ), Ediger and Beck Bulat (brothers), Senbakta, Sauskan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Siberian Khanate" class="if uuid-446925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446925.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  Tokhtamysh and the Siberian Khanate </h2><p>  The Great Khan of the Golden Horde came from the Blue Horde, which was adjacent to the Tyumen yurt.  After losing the battle in Vorskla, he fled to Western Siberia.  What he was doing here, there is no information; most likely, he headed the Siberian Khanate.  What happened next, one can only guess, for two hundred years the rulers succeeded each other.  More or less reliable information appears with the coming to power of Khan Kuchum in 1563. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="Siberian Khanate" class="if uuid-446918" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/446918.jpg?1539090962"></div><h2>  The conquest of the Siberian Khanate </h2><p>  On May 30, 1574, the prototype of the modern geopolitical mission is born in the capital of the Russian state.  Ivan IV issues a letter of merit to the Stroganov clan (within the framework of this article we will not consider political reasons and behind-the-scenes games preceding these events) for land ownership, which should first be won.  And here begins the epic of Ermak Timofeevich, who led the military campaigns in these lands.  We will not describe this company; it is well stated in the traditional version of the history of our country.  We will only say that the Siberian Khanate was officially conquered in 1583.  However, <span>Kuchum Khan</span> goes underground and continues to conduct a guerrilla war with the invaders, as a result of which Yermak dies, having been ambushed by the Khan‚Äôs troops in 1584.  But this can no longer save the khanate.  In 1586, a squad of archers sent from the metropolis completes the work begun by Yermak. </p><h2>  The peoples of the Siberian Khanate </h2><p>  Summing up, we should once again ask ourselves about the peoples who inhabited this state.  Was it the Turkic population?  Maybe the official version is hiding the truth from us? .. </p>
