  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LCD "Maple Yard" (Krasnoyarsk): characteristics, layouts, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Residential complex</span> "Maple Yard" - a new building in Krasnoyarsk, located in the Sverdlovsk region on the very shore of the pond.  According to the project, the residential complex consists of two houses 9 floors high.  The attention of buyers is attracted by the new building due to its good ecological situation, picturesque surroundings, landscaping of a residential building and price (apartments in the Maple Yard in Krasnoyarsk are cheaper than the average property price in the Sverdlovsk Region). </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  The developer of the LCD "Maple Yard" is a large construction company "SibLider".  Construction is carried out according to an individual project, where during the development all modern requirements for economy class apartments were taken into account. </p><p>  The materials used in construction are characterized by high quality and fully meet international safety criteria.  The walls of houses are built of bricks, and insulation is achieved through polystyrene boards.  The use of energy-saving materials in conjunction with an improved layout of apartments allows you to achieve a high level of comfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krom360.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://krom360.ru/zhk-klenovyi-dvorik/#1498134194933-7a3b2e5f-b8cc"><img itemprop="image" alt="yard area" class="if uuid-2234162" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2234162.jpg"></div><p>  The exterior design of the houses is made in a single architectural style, and the color palette is designed in brown and sand color.  Thanks to this, the aesthetic attractiveness of the residential complex is achieved. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Stages of construction of the LCD "Maple Yard" </h2><p>  The construction of the residential complex is carried out in two stages. </p><ul><li>  Stage 1, this is house number 37 - it has already been completed and put into operation in the 3rd quarter of 2017. </li><li>  Stage 2 (house number 35) - is currently under construction.  The commissioning of the Krasnoyarsk LCD "Maple Yard" is scheduled for the 1st quarter of 2018.  According to the builder, the work is going almost on schedule. </li></ul><h2>  Apartments and housing area </h2><p>  Real estate in LCD will appeal to buyers of two categories: </p><ul><li>  those who are looking for a suitable apartment for their own residence; </li><li>  investors interested in the subsequent rental of housing. </li></ul><p>  The developer of Krasnoyarsk "SibLider" tried to take into account the wishes of both groups and offers real estate objects of different sizes and with a different number of rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krom360.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New buildings of Krasnoyarsk" class="if uuid-2234164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2234164.jpg"></div><p>  According to the design documentation, 160 apartments will be placed in two houses, among which there will be: </p><ul><li>  1-room apartments (area from 36 sq. M) - such options are especially attractive for renting and living people who value comfort and mobility; </li><li>  2 rooms; </li><li>  3-room apartments are spacious apartments with an improved layout, ideal for families with children. </li></ul><h2>  Apartment renovation </h2><p>  Choosing an apartment in the residential complex of Krasnoyarsk "Maple courtyard", buyers receive housing that is completely ready for occupancy.  All apartments have been finished, which saves time, nerves and money of new residents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What finishing work is done: </p><ul><li>  the ceilings and walls are aligned; </li><li>  engineering networks were carried out (this is central heating, water supply, sewage system, electrical wiring); </li><li>  finishing ceiling coating - paint; </li><li>  floors in residential premises are covered with high-quality linoleum on a special basis (improves thermal insulation and sound insulation); </li><li>  the floors in the bathrooms are finished with ceramic floor tiles; </li><li>  the walls of the rooms and the kitchen are glued with wallpaper of neutral colors; </li><li>  double-glazed windows are installed on windows and loggias; </li><li>  entrance doors - steel; </li><li>  interior doors are made of laminated MDF. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the cost and quality of housing purchased remains in the optimal ratio. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  For maximum convenience of residents in the residential complex "Maple Yard" all conditions are provided.  Work is underway to equip parking spaces, asphalt access roads to the house and pedestrian walkways. </p><p>  A playground for children is planned between two houses.  It is planned to install a special rubber coating here.  The project provides for the construction of a sports ground, comfortable places for recreation and a site for household purposes. </p><p>  Unlike many new buildings in Krasnoyarsk, Maple Yard does not provide commercial premises on the ground floors.  This significantly increases the level of silence and purity in the house. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krom360.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://krom360.ru/zhk-klenovyi-dvorik/#1498134194933-7a3b2e5f-b8cc"><img itemprop="image" alt="house under construction" class="if uuid-2234158" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2234158.jpg"></div><h2>  District Infrastructure </h2><p>  The residential complex is located on Sudostroitelnaya street in the Sverdlovsk district. </p><ul><li>  in the north, very close to the new building there is a small pond with green spaces and places for a quiet rest; </li><li>  south of the Maple Yard there is a highway - this somewhat reduces the attractiveness of the region‚Äôs ecology; </li><li>  on both sides (east and west) - one-story houses. </li></ul><p>  As for the infrastructure of this region, it can be called quite formed and suitable for a comfortable stay.  Nearby are located: </p><ul><li>  Kindergarten; </li><li>  comprehensive school; </li><li>  polyclinic; </li><li>  several branches of different banks; </li><li>  cafes and restaurants; </li><li>  large shopping complexes; </li><li>  beauty salons and hairdressers. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="krom360.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Maple courtyard in Krasnoyarsk" class="if uuid-2234194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2234194.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews on Krasnoyarsk LCD "Maple Yard" </h2><p>  If you believe the reviews about the apartments in this residential complex, then among the advantages of living here: </p><ul><li>  convenient courtyard (many residents noted a closed location); </li><li>  spacious entrances; </li><li>  almost silent large elevators - this characteristic is important for families with small children (the carriage easily fits in the elevator); </li><li>  good layout of apartments; </li><li>  scenic view from the windows. </li></ul><p>  Among the shortcomings, many note poor sound insulation between neighboring apartments.  Some residents complain about the cold in the apartments. </p>
