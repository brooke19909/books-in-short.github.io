    <h2>  Lake history </h2><p>  Larnaca Salt Lake is located near the city of Larnaca, which is Greek for Aliki.  You can see it only in the cold months, because in the hot season, the water from the lake evaporates, and salt beds remain in its place. </p><p>  The history of the appearance of the lake was overgrown with legends, one of which tells that once upon a time there were huge vineyards managed by a stingy mistress.  At the request of a passing bishop of St.  She refused Lazarus to quench her thirst with a bunch of grapes, citing the fact that salt was in her basket.  Lazarus was angry with a woman for greed and sent a curse to this place.  Since then, a lake of salt has appeared here. </p><p>  Researchers and historians have no common opinion about the origin of the lake: some believe that there was a sea bay in its place, and the reservoir formed after raising land, others talk about underground salt deposits that rise together with water after rains, while others believe that salt comes from the underground labyrinths along with the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Larnaca Salt Lake: Description </h2><p>  The lake itself consists of 4 reservoirs: large - Aliki - and 3 small - Orfani, Soros and Spiro.  All of them are connected by small isthmuses. </p><p>  Its area is 2.2 square meters.  km, the maximum depth is about 1 m. </p>

    <p>  In the summer and autumn time of the year, the shiny, snow-white, iridescent lights look amazing and very impressive.  Salt snowdrifts are very reminiscent of snow, and when walking it seems to creak. </p><h2>  Salt mining </h2><p>  For many years, the extraction and development of salt reserves served as the basis of the island's economy.  According to historical data, during the years of trade in the <span>Republic of Venice</span> , 70 ships loaded with salt each year left this place: in those days, it was considered an important commodity. </p><p>  Salt collection in the lakes of Cyprus continued until the middle of the 20th century: in the summer months it was collected in dry form after the lake dried up.  All mining was carried out manually due to the surrounding silty shore.  With the help of shovels, workers dug up salt, put it in baskets, and transported it on land on donkeys and unloaded it to the ground.  Before sending, the layers had to dry for a whole year. </p><p>  Now the collection has been stopped for several reasons: due to severe pollution, as well as due to the fact that the Larnaca Salt Lake received the status of a nature reserve. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Cypriot ecologists have created a program to protect local animals and birds and preserve the lake.  In winter, several thousand birds fly here, about 85 species. </p>
