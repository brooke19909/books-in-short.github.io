At the interview you will have to tell about your vision of business development. </li><li>  Specialists of credit institutions perform their calculations on the stability of the company, so you need to provide the necessary information, reports, forecasts. </li><li>  Lending to small and medium-sized businesses is provided with the presence of property in the property. </li><li>  Validity of the client is checked.

    <p>  According to your program, you need to create a business plan: draw up a marketing plan, determine a place for the office and solve other issues.  Then, documentation is required to obtain a loan: passport, TIN, certificate of individual entrepreneur, business plan.  An application is submitted with them.  Funds should be prepared (30% for the first payment).  After a positive decision, a contract is drawn up.  Sberbank usually approves applications if the client has chosen a franchise partner. </p><h2>  Funds work </h2><p>  Many entrepreneurs apply to the lending fund of small, medium-sized businesses.  They act as guarantors for obtaining loans to open their own business.  An entrepreneur must apply for a loan from a bank, notifying him of the desire to support a state organization. </p>

    <p>  Then the bank considers the application, taking into account all the details.  With a positive decision, a tripartite contract is drawn up.  Often, a small percentage is taken to facilitate lending to small and medium-sized businesses.  Many banks work under such a scheme, but not all. </p><h2>  Recommendations for borrowers </h2><p>  When concluding a transaction, you should familiarize yourself with the contract so that no further disputes arise.  You need to immediately ask questions to a specialist.  If the business is profitable, it is advisable to pay the loan ahead of schedule, since most of the interest is included in the first months of payments. </p>

    <p>  Borrowers should consider the following nuances: </p><ol><li>  Such loans are issued at sufficiently high interest rates.  Therefore, if there is an opportunity to do without them, it is better not to arrange such cash loans.  But if this still does not work out, then you should carefully approach the procedure for obtaining a loan. </li><li>  For the bank‚Äôs decision to be positive, you need to create a unique business plan.  It will <span>immediately</span> be clear from it whether funds are needed and how profits will be distributed. </li><li>  The business reputation of the owner of a business also plays an important role.  Therefore, it is necessary to provide accounting documentation to increase the chances of obtaining a loan.  All papers must be composed correctly. </li><li>  The bank must provide a business plan in which all the subtleties of organizing a business will be spelled out.  If it is prospective, then usually the application is approved. </li></ol><p>  Lending to small and medium-sized businesses is a big risk for banks.  If a company goes bankrupt, a financial institution may lose funds.  Therefore, it is usually required to provide documentation on the availability of property, as well as guarantors, co-borrowers.  Only with full compliance with the requirements is it possible to approve a loan for business development. </p>
