  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Iowa is one of the most colorful states in the USA. History and Attractions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The name of this state is related to its Native American origin.  About 13 thousand years ago, the territory was inhabited by the Iowa, Missouri and Santi tribes.  In the XIII century, France and Spain fought for these fertile lands, and after 100 years, US authorities bought their future staff, which later became one of the main objects of the struggle for the Wild West. </p><h2>  Clashes with the Indians </h2><p>  In the mid-19th century, Iowa became fully American.  But the policy of crowding out the Native American Indian population led to armed conflicts in different parts of the state in which a large number of people died.  Later, the authorities think about how to attract immigrants to the liberated territory, as a result of which the state is gradually settled by immigrants from Germany and Scandinavia, who subsequently took an active part in the development of agriculture. </p><h2>  Food capital </h2><p>  <span>The state of Iowa,</span> called "corn," was visited more than 50 years ago by N. S. Khrushchev.  During the visit, he looked at the farms of local residents and wanted to grow the "queen of the fields" in the USSR. </p><p>  It is not for nothing that this American territory is considered the world food capital: annually a large crop of oats and soybeans is received here, and the state has long been recognized as the leader in terms of the number of pigs and cattle. </p>

    <p>  However, economic crises led to the fact that the agricultural region began to pay special attention to industry.  The state has several factories for processing and producing canned foods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Multi-million state </h2><p>  Famous for the vast plains and prairies that make up a large part of the natural landscape, Iowa has a large population.  More than 3 million people live in it.  The state capital is the former Fort Des Moines, built back in 1843.  Now it has turned into a large beautiful city with developed infrastructure and a powerful insurance sector. </p><p>  This is not to say that the state is extremely attractive for tourists, because there are very unstable weather conditions that lead to storms, tornadoes and floods up to 37 times a year.  However, despite this, the state has numerous museums that attract curious travelers, and natural attractions are unusual for their special beauty untouched by civilization. </p><h2>  USA, Iowa: attractions.  Law library </h2><p>  The main attraction is an architectural monument, opened in 1886 in the state capital.  The capitol with 5 domes is the only one in the country, it houses the working office of the Iowa Governor.  Until the 30s of the XX century, this building, causing great interest among tourists, was the highest. </p><p>  On the 2nd floor of the Capitol there is a law library, the doors of which are always open for those who are interested in issues of law, the history of jurisprudence and international legal problems.  It is worth noting that among visitors to this unusual library there are many ordinary inhabitants who have heard about the beauties of this magnificent building.  Iowa State is famous for this unique attraction, first of all (see photo below). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The library has over 200 thousand items and is one of the most significant collections of legal literature in the United States. </p><p>  You can climb into the central hall, which accommodates 4 levels of galleries, through metal forged stairs equipped with handrails.  The ceiling and floor are decorated with bright <span>glass mosaics</span> , and the high walls are decorated with marble panels.  This ancient building is rightfully one of the most beautiful libraries in the world. </p><h2>  Religious shrine </h2><p>  The historic site, considered an important religious shrine, is located in West Bend (Iowa).  Sights, consisting of 9 grottoes, were created by human hands.  Built by a priest cured of illness and offering prayers to the Virgin Mary, the Atonement Grotto now looks like a small block. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iowa photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1148895.jpg" width="600"></div>
