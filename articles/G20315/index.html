    <p>  Centuries have passed, but today there are those who continue to slander the prince.  But in fact, we know little about Sergey Alexandrovich, about his nobility and spiritual beauty.  Who is he really - Grand Duke Sergei Romanov? </p><h2>  Short biography of Sergey Romanov </h2><p>  The son of Emperor Alexander II was born on April 29, 1857.  At first he was brought up by maid of honor A.F. Tyutchev, and already from the age of seven this duty was transferred to D.S. Arsenyev.  His teachers saw him as a good person, unusually kind. </p>

    <p>  Until 1884, there were rumors that the Grand Duke had many vices.  They began to ridicule him, but high society rejected him.  Against all this, Prince Sergey Alexandrovich Romanov found a good remedy - a cold face, inaccessible appearance, excessive severity.  Perhaps this is the whole secret of his duality: a strict appearance and a vulnerable soul.  Attacks from society decreased in 1884, when Sergei married Elizaveta Fedorovna.  It was a truly spiritual marriage, although some thought quite differently. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Politics of Sergey Romanov </h2><p>  After the death of his parents, young Sergey joined the guard, until 1887 he commanded the tsar‚Äôs battalion of the <span>Preobrazhensky regiment,</span> and then the entire regiment as a major general.  In 1891, he became Governor-General of Moscow.  Already here, Sergei Alexandrovich Romanov becomes an adherent of the autocracy, acts as a cruel conservative.  He has a clear conviction that only loyalty to Orthodoxy can save the country. </p>

    <p>  With such convictions, Prince Sergey made many enemies.  He began to deal with the labor issue that was acute at that time for Russia, doing everything so that the working class could live better.  Thanks to Sergey, people got the opportunity to send their complaints to the police.  In February 1902, Sergey Romanov organized a working demonstration. </p><p>  Such a policy caused discontent from the revolutionaries and capitalists.  The latter even achieved the liquidation of workers' organizations.  Sergei Alexandrovich Romanov himself <strong> </strong>  He was an opponent of the revolution, an opponent of <span>constitutional reforms,</span> was against the creation of a people's government in Russia. </p><p>  Already after Bloody Sunday on January 9, 1905, the opposition proclaimed Sergei Alexandrovich the culprit of the use of military force.  <span>The Socialist-Revolutionary Party</span> already sentenced Prince Romanov to death. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  January 1, 1905 Sergey Romanov resigned as <span>governor-general of Moscow</span> and became commander-in-chief of the Moscow Military District. </p><h2>  The last days of the Grand Duke </h2><p>  Although Sergei Alexandrovich resigned, he was dangerous for the revolutionaries.  A hunt was declared for him, so every day he received threatening notes. </p><p>  On January 9, Prince Romanov moved with his family to the Kremlin, from where every day he went unnoticed to the governor's house.  He knew that an attempt was being made on him. </p><p>  February 4, Sergei left the gates of the Kremlin and was torn apart by the so-called infernal machine that the terrorist Kalyaev abandoned.  The remains of the deceased were transported to the Alekseevsky temple of the <span>Chudov Monastery.</span>  Already on February 10 the deceased was buried. </p>

    <p>  Sergei Romanov died with the realization that his life was in danger, that he was being hunted.  But with all this, he did not react to any persuasion about caution.  He was the man whom it was impossible to frighten or force to change his beliefs and principles. </p><h2>  Burial of Prince Romanov </h2><p>  Sergei Alexandrovich Romanov, Grand Duke, was not buried in the <span>Peter and Paul Cathedral</span> in St. Petersburg.  His remains were buried in the temple, which was built under the Alekseevsky Cathedral of the Chudov Monastery.  In 1995, the remains were transferred to the Novospassky monastery. </p><p>  The assassination of Prince Romanov was a shock to the monarchical circles of society.  Many people came to the defense of Sergei Alexandrovich, saying that he was a humane person, did good to ordinary people, without putting it on display.  That is why many loved and respected him. </p><h2>  Appearance of Sergey Romanov </h2>

    <p>  Sergey Romanov was tall, had natural beauty and elegance.  But on the people around, he impressed a restrained and cold man.  Many claimed that he was self-confident and cruel.  This opinion is false, since Sergey Alexandrovich was a kind person, helped people, but secretly from everyone. </p><h2>  Opinions about Sergey Romanov </h2><p>  Many people believed that the Grand Duke played a major role in the fall of the empire.  It was believed that Sergei was ignorant in matters of command of the troops, flaunted his shortcomings, giving society a reason for slander and slander.  But few knew that the mask of a cold and unemotional person was hiding a vulnerable and kind soul.  Those who knew Sergei Aleksandrovich well could say with confidence that he was a sensitive and responsive person, although he never showed off his true feelings for show.  He put on the mask of the ‚Äúiron man‚Äù thanks to those who so furiously ridiculed him.  And since the man he was deeply vulnerable, it caused him considerable pain. </p><h2>  In memory of Grand Duke Sergei Romanov </h2><p>  An ascetic of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Grand Duke was a patron and a member of many institutions, ranging from public, scientific and ending with charity.  He was chairman of the Historical Museum.  The entire Romanov dynasty could be proud of Sergey, since he had great merits before the Church and the country.  He was a hero of the war with Turkey, a hero of Plevna.  But perhaps his greatest merit was the strengthening of Orthodoxy in Palestine and throughout the East. </p>

    <p>  During the twelve years of his governorship, the prince tried to raise the capital.  Lost under the influence of other cultures, the importance of shrines, sights, the life of Russia under him not only returned, but also significantly increased. </p><p>  Sergei Romanov was a truly amazing person who managed to not lose faith in God, to show the whole society as an example his family life, to the end of his days to be devoted to his inner convictions and duty during the time of the general debauchery of minds.  He, who experienced severe moral and personal upheavals, ridicule and betrayal, managed not to lose himself. </p><p>  Atheistic propaganda has done everything in order to erase the <span>name of Sergei</span> Romanov from the history of Russia.  Many stamps were fabricated that were imposed on his life.  And thank God that today we have the opportunity, by reading archives and looking through original documents, to discover the truth in this complex matter. </p>
