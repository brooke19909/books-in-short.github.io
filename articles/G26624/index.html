    <h2>  Briefly about the complex </h2><p>  Kouros Palace Hotel 5 * was built in 2014.  Over the two years of its existence, it has already managed to become popular.  Many people staying here once come again.  The hotel is modern, attractive, beautiful, and it is also in a convenient location. </p><p>  The hotel is located on the second beach line, so the sea can be reached in 10 minutes.  In 22 kilometers from the complex is the city of the same name Kos.  And by the way, the airport is not so far away - only 7 kilometers away.  It is worth noting that this is the most optimal distance that can only be.  Seven kilometers is enough so that landing and taking off planes do not cause much discomfort to the guests with their noise.  But it‚Äôs also close enough - tired guests don‚Äôt have to get another hour and a half to the hotel after their plane has landed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the village of Mastichari is still very close by.
