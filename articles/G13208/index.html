If financial opportunities allow, it is better to buy real estate in new complexes, as they are built in accordance with all modern standards and have developed infrastructure.  Peredelkino Middle, reviews of which will be presented at the end of the article, is not just a residential complex.  This is a whole area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew Moscow.  It is fully planned to be completed by 2020, but housing in it is being sold today.  The project involves the construction of 87 houses of various storeys according to a certain scheme, the central element of which will be a city park with a lake.  The UK pays great attention not only to residential, but also to municipal buildings.  In the area will be built several schools, hospitals, catering establishments, kindergartens, shopping centers and shops, hairdressers, fitness centers and much more.  The largest federal networks will also start working here.  Thus, the <span>residential complex</span> will have an excellently developed infrastructure, providing the most comfortable accommodation. </p><h2>  general information </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mosday.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="comfortable residential complex" class="if uuid-2753423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2753423.jpg"></div><p>  RC "Peredelkino Middle" is a large-scale project for the development of the vast territory of the capital, which is an ideal example of what a modern city should be like.  It has a well-thought-out layout and individual style, so it will become an excellent decoration of Moscow.  Here will be one of the largest park areas with artificial pond.  In addition to landscaping and landscaping, the architecture of houses has been carefully worked out.  All buildings will begin to be built using modern technologies, and the exterior decoration will give them more color and make the appearance unique, so the area will look very stylish and modern.  Also, the residential complex will have a developed entertainment, social and commercial infrastructure, so that residents can have a great time and there is no need to travel to other urban areas to solve various issues. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Houses will begin to be built both in panel and in monolithic technology.  Both types of buildings have certain advantages and disadvantages, so buyers have complete freedom of choice.  But regardless of this, all objects correspond to a single style filled with bright colors, so the microdistrict will not be like the rest of Moscow. </p><p>  Another argument in favor of buying an apartment in "Peredelkino Middle" (the secondary is already filled with many offers) is that everything is thought out literally to the smallest detail.  There are several hiking and cycling routes in the park area.  A huge number of playgrounds and sports grounds have been equipped throughout the residential complex, where instead of the usual asphalt and concrete, special tiles made of pressed rubber crumb are used.  The developer did not leave without attention the ennobling of the territories.  Unlike other Moscow districts, which are experiencing a catastrophic shortage of greenery, Peredelkino Blizhne planted trees and ornamental shrubs everywhere, as well as arranged flower beds, so the LCD is not only very beautiful, but also has cleaner and more pleasant air in it. </p><p>  The best architects and designers participated in the development of the residential complex project, so it contains many interesting and unique solutions.  For example, one of these is the curb, which in some places goes into the bench.  This has long been practiced in Europe, and now it can be seen in our country.  Among the innovations, pedestrian crossings are worth noting.  Images are applied in a special way, which allows you to create the illusion of volume. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Playgrounds in a city-park is a completely separate topic.  They look like works of art buried in verdure.  The playgrounds are equipped with everything necessary for a fun and exciting pastime with children, and are also very safe for the health and life of the kids.  The probability of injury during the game is almost completely excluded. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.absrealty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="residential complex" class="if uuid-2753426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2753426.jpg"></div><p>  Having decided to move to the new buildings "Blizhne Peredelkino", which are being built using modern construction technology, therefore have high strength, as well as good heat and sound insulation, you get many advantages when buying an apartment. </p><p>  The main ones are the following: </p><ul><li>  excellent combination of price and quality; </li><li>  well-established infrastructure; </li><li>  clean ecology; </li><li>  excellent traffic intersection; </li><li>  the presence of balconies and loggias with panoramic glazing; </li><li>  the opportunity to purchase housing in a mortgage; </li><li>  the presence on the ground floors of places for strollers; </li><li>  purchase of apartments with or without decoration; </li><li>  relatively low prices for Moscow. </li></ul><p>  In addition to all of the above, the school is also a great advantage.
