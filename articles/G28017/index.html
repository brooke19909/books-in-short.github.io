In 1947, she graduated from the Theater School.  Schukin.  She devoted the years from 1947 to 1968 to contract work, and from 1968 to 1983, to the works on the basis of the Theater Studio of the film actor.  We learn about the life of a stunning woman and a talented actress further from the article. </p><h2>  Youth of the future star </h2><p>  Born as the daughter of a lieutenant general who served in artillery, Ninel Myshkova.  The biography of the girl began during the time that followed right after the revolution.  Then inventing interesting and unusual names for your children was a common practice.  So the future actress Ninel Myshkova got her own.  A rather interesting clue lies at the heart of this decision.  The girl‚Äôs parents, being exemplary patriots, simply wrote ‚ÄúLenin‚Äù in the reverse order of letters in her birth certificate. </p>

    <p>  Myshkova Ninel Konstantinovna, in turn, admitted that she would not refuse another name.  She really liked Eve.  Under it, she meets her future husband, Vladimir Etush. </p><p>  He worked at the Vakhtangov Theater.  By <span>occupation</span> , Ninel Myshkova was close to him.  Their personal life began with a stormy and exciting love affection.  At that time, the girl studied at the <span>Shchukin school,</span> was pretty pretty and charming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Relations quickly moved forward, and after some time Myshkova Ninel became a happy wife.  An interesting fact is that until the painting in the registry office, the future husband considered his beloved Eve. </p><h2>  Carier start </h2><p>  1947 was the moment of graduation.  A movie debut immediately followed.  She played Shabunina Ninel Myshkova.  The films with this wonderful actress that we can watch began with the well-known film ‚ÄúFor Those at Sea,‚Äù in which Alexander Faynzimmer was the head of the filming process. </p><p>  It was a brilliant start.  It would seem that a beautiful star was lit in the sky of the world of cinema.  But life is an unpredictable thing, so I had to pause in the filming. </p>

    <p>  The marriage, which began enthusiastically and promised to be long and happy, fell apart, as Myshkova Ninel became interested in another man.  Her house often hosted evenings at which talented and intelligent young people gathered. </p><p>  She liked a composer named Antonio Spadavecchia.  It was he who wrote the musical accompaniment for the first picture, where she was shot, as well as for the fairy-tale film "Cinderella."  The difference in their age was 19 years, but Myshkova Ninel was not embarrassed because of this, because true ages are submissive to true love.  However, in this case, a divorce soon followed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The year 1953 brings the actress another love with which she was imbued with cameraman Konstantin Petrichenko.  This man was 11 years older.  There is a tendency towards addiction to more mature people.  The wedding was played in the year of dating.  In this marriage, the first-born Konstantin was born, who later chose diplomatic activity in life and became famous in his industry. </p>

    <h2>  Filmography </h2><p>  As we see, the personal life of the actress during this period proceeded violently, in contrast to professional activities.  For a decade, Myshkova played only a few roles.  Although this is the case when they say "rarely, but accurately."  She was remembered for her work in a picture created based on the tales of Sadko by Alexander Ptushko.  There Ninel happens to get used to the role of Ilmen Tsarevna.  Another fabulous role she played in "Ilya Muromets."  This time she was Vasilisa. </p><p>  Beautiful and sweet special was Ninel Myshkova.  Photos show this quite clearly.  She was very fabulous imagery, and sincerely she enjoyed, working on such paintings.  After all, the set was for her a wonderful and bewitching world.  The year 1959 is notable for the busyness of the actress in the fabulous production of Alexander Rowe, where she plays the role of Mary the artisan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The main love of life </h2><p>  When the film "Hello, Gnat" was shot, the woman met a man who in the future played a very important role in her life's journey.  It's about <span>Viktor Ivchenko.</span> </p><p>  In 1965, the filming of the extremely successful Nineli day of the movie "Viper" begins.  At the moment, she is becoming not only more successful in the profession.  There are changes on the personal front. </p><p>  A feeling flashes between her and Victor.  Before that, he was married and occupied a rather significant position, but passion grips him with his head and the man attaches less and less importance to marriage.  I had to honestly tell my wife about a new hobby and leave the family. </p><p>  His heart belonged to Myshkova.  This man was very fond of the actress, was ready for anything for her.  Together they healed in a new, happy way.  The couple has been in such an idyll for six years.  From this moment, the director gives the main roles in his paintings to his beloved.  She was always in the center of attention, and all the best conditions were created for her to reveal her talents most fully in a suitable role.  The couple lived soul to soul, rejoicing in each new day and engaged in a common cause. </p>

    <h2>  The death of a beloved husband </h2><p>  Everything tends to end sooner or later.  Nothing lasts forever, like the well-being of these two.  In the autumn season of 1972, Ivchenko was busy with field work in Rostov.  There he had a heart attack, which was already the fourth in the life of a man. </p><p>  This was a shock for Ninel.  The woman went to the scene.  The director was taken to the hospital, but he died there on September 7, 1972 in front of his wife.  It is hard to imagine a more terrible shock.  This affected the nervous system of the actress, it even seemed as if the woman had sharply aged. </p><p>  The body was transported to the territory of Kiev, funeral procedures were organized.  Previously, the couple corresponded, and now the envelopes lay in the grave of the deceased.  When the burial was over, the actress left the capital of Ukraine and never returned there. </p><h2>  Moral Injury for Life </h2><p>  At first, the work was difficult.  She could not think of anything but her grief.  Nothing in life brought pleasure, even a favorite pastime.  Then gradually came back to work in the cinema.  The roles were small, unremarkable.  They could not be compared with what the woman had worked on before. </p><p>  1982 is notable for the fact that during this period work was carried out on the last role of the actress in the cinema.  It was Valentine - a character in the series "Racing Vertical."  After this, Myshkova had to face new difficulties.  Health was knocked out by progressive sclerosis, a terrible disease.  Life has become different.  The actress did not recognize loved ones, lost orientation in space. </p><p>  Fortunately, the mother was always supported by her heir Konstantin Petrichenko.  She lived in his house and was under sensitive care.  The best doctors in France were found for Nineli, but none of them could help in this problem, because the disease was called incurable.  So 20 years have passed. </p>

    <h2>  Death and funeral </h2><p>  Autumn 2003 was the time of the death of the actress.  She is buried in the land of the Novodevichy cemetery near the grave of her father.  Many journalists and TV presenters talked about her, recalled her old roles and a great game.  We also noticed that she had great potential, not fully revealed.

Here is such a contribution she left in the cinema. </p>
