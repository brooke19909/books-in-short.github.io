The local coast has sand and pebble. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Capo Peloro Club Resort is located on the <span>island of Sicily,</span> which is one of the unique and mysterious places in Italy, surrounded by a halo of rumors, myths and mysteries.  And now it is a good resort in the south of the country, striking the imagination with beautiful beaches and numerous natural and architectural attractions.  The island has the country's largest active volcano Etna.  I must say that in Sicily not only different eras, but also cultures were interwoven: here you can see many temples, medieval churches, magnificent palaces. </p><p>  Capo Peloro Resort 4 * (Sicily) is located near the city of Messina, which is one of the largest settlements in Sicily and a picturesque resort.  The city is a port with active trade; it stretches thirty kilometers along the coast.  Messina is located five minutes from the mainland, only the strait separates it from it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capo peloro club resort 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1499926.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The city has not only the historical part, but also modern areas.  There are many historical attractions that will be interesting to tourists.  Therefore, interesting leisure is provided to vacationers.  Messina as a resort is good because, in addition to the most beautiful beaches, it has many interesting places that can be studied by guests of the island. </p><p>  Tourists, who first visited this town, are certainly amazed at the abundance of fountains in it, which gives it some airiness, lightness and fabulousness.  I would like to emphasize that in Messina not only lovers of the sea coast will like to relax, but also lovers of historical sights.  Since the city is always crowded with vacationers, its tourist infrastructure is well developed.  There are many cafes and restaurants offering the best dishes of local cuisine, hotels, shops and entertainment centers. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  The historical sights of Messina are very interesting.  Unfortunately, not all of them have survived to the present.  Many of them were destroyed during the war, which caused significant damage to the town. </p><p>  Nevertheless, tourists will certainly be interested in a sightseeing tour of Messina, during which you can look into the regional museum and admire the famous works of Caravaggio and Antanello de Messina, as well as visit the museum of folk culture and music. </p><p>  It will be no less interesting for vacationers to see the Cathedral of Messina, the fountain of Orion, the church of Santa Maria Annuciata dei Catalani of the 12th century, the Cathedral of Santa Maria delli Alemanni. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capo peloro club resort" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1499934.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <p>  In addition to historical places, guests can see the most beautiful fountains: Senatorial, Neptune, etc. Local guides can tell the most interesting history of the city to tourists. </p><p>  The mild Mediterranean climate in Sicily and in Messina makes it possible to rest comfortably throughout the year, the active tourist season in the region lasts from early April to late October.  Although the rest of the months of the year are warm enough, the sun almost always shines. </p><p>  Messina is rich not only in attractions, but in entertainment for active people.  On the beaches for tourists - a variety of water activities, and local hotels vying to offer the best pools and spas. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Interesting places in Sicily </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Capo Peloro Resort 4 * (Messina), you can not only limit yourself to excursions in Messina, but also see the most interesting places on the island.  Almost every town in Sicily has its own unique attractions.  For example, in the famous Palermo you can see churches, monasteries, castles of various eras.  Of particular interest to tourists is always the most important building of the city - the Palazzo Normanni (the former residence of the kings). </p><p>  On the island, near the town of Agrigento, is the Valley of the Temples.  Here among the ancient ruins you can see the Temple of Concord, built in honor of the <span>goddess Juno,</span> and the temple of Olympian Zeus.  In Sicily there are many places where archaeological excavations are still being carried out. </p><p>  Shopping enthusiasts will be surprised, but you can make wonderful purchases on the island.  There are excellent shopping centers that are in no way inferior to Milan, as well as good outlets.  In Palermo, you can visit the most popular and old markets - Il Capo and Vucciiria. </p>

    <p>  Palermo has some pretty well-known shopping malls like Forum Palermo.  In addition, tourists can visit the main shopping streets - Liberta, Viitorio Emanuele, Ruggiero Settimo.  Fans of fashionable things will find shops from eminent fashion designers here.  But all kinds of souvenirs can be bought in numerous shops. </p><h2>  Capo Peloro Club Resort 4 * (Messina): reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I would like to discuss the reviews of tourists who managed to relax in it in order to have a more complete picture of this place and to understand whether it is worth paying attention to it. </p><p>  According to vacationers, Capo Peloro Club Resort 4 * (Sicily) is of interest to lovers of sea holidays, as it is located on the coast.  It is separated from the beach by a busy road, but guests do not need to cross it, since there is a special tunnel under the highway. </p><p>  The hotel is located in a green area surrounded by vegetation.  Near the complex is a bus stop.  Here you can catch a bus and head to Messina.  But to see Sicily, it is better to rent a car at the hotel, it is much more convenient than acquiring sightseeing tours.  Just remember that in order to be able to rent a car, you need to have 800 euros on the card for a deposit or leave cash (500 euros). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capo peloro resort 4 messina" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1499937.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The on-site restaurant serves a buffet.  For breakfast, tourists are served pies, yogurts, toasts, fruits, tea, coffee, jams, preserves, omelets, bacon, sliced, salads, croissants.  For lunch, mashed soups, snacks, meat dishes.  And in the evenings you can taste seafood, salads, side dishes, all kinds of meat dishes.  Every Wednesday, the chef arranges an Italian day, preparing excellent national food for the guests.  The desserts offered to guests throughout the day deserve special praise. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are well-equipped, all the plumbing is serviceable.  Housekeepers clean their apartments daily, and it‚Äôs not necessary for them to tip. </p><p>  The hotel rests Germans, Bulgarians, Poles and other representatives of European countries, there are very few Russians in the complex.  The hotel staff is normal, only not all girls are happy with the girls from the reception, although they are quickly served upon arrival.  Few staff know the Russian language, and not everyone speaks English.  German, French are more often used here.  In general, the service at the hotel is up to standard, except for minor flaws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capo peloro club resort 4 messina" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1499948.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the animators and their entertainment events delight absolutely all guests.  Every day they come up with new programs, not only letting children, but also adults, get bored.  In the daytime, animators offer sports classes (water aerobics, darts, volleyball), and in the evenings tourists will enjoy music evenings, karaoke, and various shows.  In general, you do not have to be bored. </p><p>  The complex has its own sand and pebble beach, equipped with sunbeds and umbrellas.  Sunset at sea is gentle, but the bottom is covered with small pebbles.  If you do not like rocky cover, then you can go to the neighboring municipal beach, which is dominated by sand.  The sea is always clean and warm. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to certainly give time not only to sea vacations, but also to sightseeing, of which there are a great many in Sicily.  Here, cultures of completely different eras are miraculously combined, which was reflected in architecture.  Entertainment can also be found for shopping lovers.  In the huge local malls you can buy a lot of great goods at sales.  No less interesting and water activities, especially boat trips with fishing, scuba diving.  Sicily is rich in interesting places and entertainments, it is simply impossible to see everything during one vacation, but there is always a reason to return to the resort again. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to note that the hotel is quite good for families.  Tours to this complex can be purchased at very competitive prices, unlike other similar hotels.  Despite the fact that there are some minor flaws associated with the need to update the interiors, the hotel can be recommended to vacationers, as it has an excellent price / quality ratio. </p>
