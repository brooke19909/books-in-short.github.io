Wielding a stapler, you can get a lot of blanks for garlands in literally a few minutes.  In this case, the cut hearts are sequentially threaded onto a thread or a silk ribbon threaded through them.  And you can cling one after another during the manufacturing process using the same staples for the stapler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Actions are repeated until the desired length is reached.

    <p>  So, what does it take to make a felt garland of hearts with our own hands?  First of all, it is felt itself, sheets of red and white flowers, pompons or balls of the same shade or tone, a long white thread, a needle, a ruler, scissors, chalk, a sewing machine. </p><p>  At the beginning of the work, a pair of equal-sized rectangles that are stacked on top of each other is cut from a sheet of red felt.  On one side, with a typewriter, they are sewn along a long edge, then two fastened strips are turned around and a line with an indent of 1-1.5 centimeters is drawn in chalk on the ruler. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Continuation of work </h2><p>  Each of the rectangles should be turned out so as to connect their edges, and stitch along the long side.  To form hearts, we take scissors and carefully cut the resulting workpiece along the chalk strip.  Then repeat the procedure with a white sheet of felt.  As a result, we get two stacks of heart elements - red and white. </p>

    <p>  Such a garland of hearts with your own hands, made of felt, will look even better if you decorate it with multi-colored pompons.  We take the thread, thread it into the needle and alternately string the workpieces, alternating with fluffy balls.  Felt hearts will look even more elegant if each of them is edged with a thread of contrasting color along the edge.  Such a garland will look quite luxurious and will become a worthy decoration of any celebration, right up to the most luxurious wedding. </p><h2>  DIY Valentine's Day Garland </h2><p>  It's easier to make a garland more easily with children.  This occupation will surely seem extremely interesting to them.  The resulting product can then be hung in the classroom, for example, on Valentine's Day. </p><p>  What should I take for crafts?  Double-sided colored paper, scissors convenient for children‚Äôs hands, a simple pencil.  Hearts of different sizes are drawn with a pencil or outlined in patterns.  Some of them may be with a cut out center.  Paper can be taken not only matte, but also shiny, which looks much more elegant.  A thread or ribbon is attached along all hearts on one side.  To speed up the process, you can stitch blanks on a sewing machine. </p>

    <h2>  Wire products </h2><p>  As you know, a huge number of crafts can be made from such material as wire.  But few people associate this material with the romance of delicate wedding decorations.  However, if you think about it, wire is an excellent material for creating anything, and now you will see for yourself.  We will explain <span>how to make a garland</span> of hearts using this durable and practical material. </p><p>  Take a thin wire skein, pliers, a large jar, stock up on a beautiful satin ribbon, yarn or thread.  Still need nippers for cutting the frame.  We divide the wire into segments of arbitrary length - one for each of the hearts.  With pliers, we bend all the segments exactly in half, rounding the wire with its free ends along the body of the can, we get elements of a semicircular shape.  Having removed (carefully, so as not to unbend the wire) them from the can and fastened with free ends, we will form a wonderful heart of the correct form. </p><p>  Then the operation is repeated according to the number of harvested wire segments.  You can decorate the resulting frames by wrapping them with bright shiny ribbons of different colors, beautiful yarn or ordinary threads.  Then, using the tape, all the hearts obtained are bound together.  Do not forget to carefully twist the ends of the wire with pliers so that our product does not fall apart into two halves. </p>

    <h2>  Beautiful hearts for a wedding </h2><p>  How to make a garland of hearts for a wedding, and where exactly can it come in handy?  You can hang it in any cafe or even a restaurant, also this product will be a wonderful decoration of an exit ceremony.  We stock up this time with a large number of sheets of colored paper.  The most tender and romantic of all will look white-pink or red elements.  And also - a round plate, scissors, a needle and a pink thread. </p><p>  We apply a plate to each sheet, then circle it with a pencil and cut it out.  It is very easy to get a classic heart silhouette from a round billet with scissors.  To give it volume and a spectacular appearance, the cut out elements can be folded, and we will get a garland of accordion hearts. Similar ornaments can be made not only from paper, but also from fabric. </p><h2>  Additional decor ideas </h2><p>  Another great idea, how to decorate a wedding or any other festive garland of hearts, is to use pom-pom balls, which will bring brightness and create a feeling of cosiness and romance.  We will prepare a large number of fluffy pompons of all kinds of bright colors.  If we are talking about a wedding or Valentine's Day, still the most popular can be called white, red and pink. </p><p>  We also take thick sheets of cardboard, double-sided tape, a hole punch, a pencil with scissors and thin ribbons.  We turn each of the cardboard sheets with a pencil and scissors into a heart in the same usual way.  The resulting figures must be the same size. </p>

    <p>  Using double-sided tape, we attach ball pompons to each of the cut elements.  To hold them firmly on both sides, gently push them in the process of connection.  If there is no double-sided tape at hand, you can ‚Äúplant‚Äù the balls on the simplest PVA glue, but the procedure will take a little longer, since gluing should first be done on the pompom on one side, and only after the glue has completely dried, take the second one and place it on the back side. </p><p>  To thread the tape on the top of each heart, we make a hole with an ordinary hole punch.  Round paper pompons can be replaced with voluminous colors.  Having strung all the prepared elements on a long thread, we get a wonderful decoration made on our own. </p><h2>  Give volume </h2><p>  Another great idea is a voluminous garland of hearts with your own hands.  The materials here will need all the same - many sheets of colored paper and PVA glue (and, of course, scissors).  Getting started is exactly the same as in previous cases.  That is, we take a sheet of paper, cut out hearts according to templates, each of which then needs to be slightly bent along the central axis, then we connect the elements in pairs according to the principle of a corrugated Christmas tree toy. </p><p>  A lot of elements will be needed - the more, the longer our garland is planned.  The result promises to look very interesting and contribute to the creation of a romantic mood, as well as become a wonderful accessory at a wedding photo shoot. </p>
