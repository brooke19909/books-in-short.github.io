  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An alternative to iPhone - frameless smartphones: an overview of models</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Last year, the "apple" company presented to the public its brainchild - the tenth iPhone.  The gadget is in many ways good: high performance, excellent screen, ergonomic body and frameless display.  And perhaps the only fly in the ointment that overshadows the new product is the prohibitive cost of a brand new device.  Apple products do not differ in affordable price tags, but the "ten" surpassed everyone and everything. </p><p>  An advanced modification of the iPhone will cost almost 100 thousand rubles.  For this money, you can buy a dozen ordinary smartphones, and for the delivery of more accessories for them.  In this regard, many practical domestic consumers are asking a completely logical question: ‚ÄúWhich phone is an alternative to an iPhone?‚Äù  That is, about the same nimble and with a frameless display. </p><p>  Those in the market of mobile gadgets are not so few, but not every model can boast of decent and balanced characteristics.  We will talk about products of companies other than Apple, so we will not consider dilemmas like ‚Äúwhat to choose - iPhone or iPad‚Äù.  In addition, such questions are, as they say, butter, and as such there is no hint of practicality here.  Separately, it is worth noting that we also will not disassemble explicit fakes such as iPhone X replicants (Taiwan, China).  Because there‚Äôs nothing from them: neither performance, nor normal assembly, nor acceptable matrices, except perhaps the appearance. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of devices that can be called an alternative to an <span>iPhone.</span>  <span>It‚Äôs</span> difficult to single out the <span>best</span> , since all participants have balanced characteristics, frameless displays and a more adequate cost compared to Apple‚Äôs ‚Äútop ten‚Äù.  All of the models described below can be found in specialized online or offline stores, so there should not be any serious problems with ‚Äútouching‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S9 </h2><p>  The Samsung company has been and remains a direct competitor to the apple company, and in its assortment you can always find a worthy alternative to the iPhone of any series.  In addition, the pricing policy of the South Korean brand is much more attractive than the American one.  Apple‚Äôs tenth model was no exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="best alternative to iphone" class="if uuid-2734996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734996.jpg"></div><p>  Let's try to figure out what is better - Samsung 9 or iPhone.  The ninth generation of Galaxy boasts a powerful eight-core processor, QHD-resolution screen (2960 by 1440 pixels), 12-megapixel camera, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory.  Prices for this alternative to the iPhone start at 60 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  As such, there is no difference in performance or visualization between the Samsung gadget and the Apple device.  That is, running even the most demanding applications today, you will not see any differences.  This also includes the capabilities of cameras and battery life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.knowyourmobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="frameless smartphones" class="if uuid-2734981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734981.jpg"></div><p>  In a word, Samsung devices are a great alternative to an iPhone.  The technical part of the South Korean gadgets is no worse, as well as the visual.  Some users even consider the ninth series of Galaxy to be much prettier than tenth iPhones.  So if you are thinking about what is better to buy - an iPhone or a smartphone, be sure to pay attention to this model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  HTC U11 + </h2><p>  At the end of last year, a Taiwanese company introduced an extremely interesting U11 + model.  It can be called a perfectly acceptable alternative to the tenth generation iPhone.  The gadget turned out to be quite productive, with a good QHD-matrix and original chips. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wondamobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which phone is an alternative to iphone" class="if uuid-2734985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734985.jpg"></div><p>  One of the most interesting features of this frameless smartphone is the touch insert on the Edge Sense body.  The latter allows you to interact with the device by pressing the housing with your hand.  For example, here you can end a call in this way, turn off an activated alarm clock, or zoom in / out images. </p><p>  In all other respects, this frameless smartphone has a classic set of advanced gadgets late last year.  Here we have a 6-inch screen with a scan of 2880 by 1440 pixels, a powerful Snapdragon processor of the 835 series, 4 GB (6 GB) of RAM and 64 GB (128 GB) of an internal drive. </p><h2>  Distinctive features of the model </h2><p>  It will also be useful to note that on sale you can find a modification in a transparent case, where the entire technical background of the device is visible.  The solution is quite original and ambiguous, but the geeks are just delighted with it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This model made many think in choosing between an iPhone or an Android OS phone.  In addition, the price of the flagship model can not be called bites, given the available characteristics.  A model can be bought for over 40 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia XZ1 </h2><p>  Another more than worthy alternative to "apple" devices.  In the exterior of the model is easily recognizable corporate identity "Sony".  Although some consider it conservative and angular, a good half of fans of the Japanese brand really like it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sonymobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is better to buy an iPhone or smartphone" class="if uuid-2734982" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734982.jpg"></div><p>  The body of the gadget is made of high-quality metal alloy and received a matte finish.  The latter is not only practical, because the phone does not strive to slip out of hand, but it is also pleasant to the touch.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the sensible fingerprint scanner, which is built into the side power button, which is much more convenient than on the same iPhone. </p><p>  On board there are also two loud speakers, an excellent IMX400-based camera with a matrix of 19 MP and f 1 / 2.3 ‚Ä≥.  It is also worth noting that the flagship received an innovative feature - ‚ÄúFocus Prediction‚Äù.  That is, the matrix automatically recognizes, for example, a person‚Äôs smile or some other factors indicated in the menu and performs a preliminary survey before pressing the shutter button.  This feature allows you to catch important points during dynamic shooting without any problems. </p><h2>  Smartphone Features </h2><p>  As for performance, the model also has no problems with this.  The smartphone processes any modern and ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications even without a hint of lags and brakes.  Perhaps the only thing inferior to ‚ÄúXperia‚Äù to the tenth iPhone and previous respondents is in the layout: 1920 by 1080 pixels.  But this is enough for a 5.2-inch gadget. </p><p>  The flagship XZ1 model, equipped with what is called, according to the full program, will cost about 45 thousand rubles.  There are modifications and cheaper - with less RAM and internal storage.  They can be purchased at a price of about 35 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 </h2><p>  The new frameless flagship Xiaomi received a 5.9-inch display, which occupies almost all the space on the front panel (93%).  The smartphone case is made of ceramic and has a matte finish.  If you compare the Xiaomi gadget with previous devices, then in terms of design, it looks in a very favorable light.  He is really beautiful, eye-catching, and indeed, judging by the reviews, the phone is simply nice to hold in your hands. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone or phone" class="if uuid-2734983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734983.jpg"></div><p>  There are no questions about the performance of the gadget, it perfectly pulls everything, even the most demanding modern applications.  The Snapdragon 835 series, 6 GB of RAM and a powerful video accelerator will digest everything that you slip into it. </p><h2>  Smartphone Features </h2><p>  The camera did not disappoint either.  Sony‚Äôs proprietary 12-megapixel sensor with 4-axis stabilization works wonders - the output is excellent quality pictures.  There is also a fingerprint sensor familiar to flagships.  The latter is located under the main camera (greetings from Samsung). </p><p>  The visual part also pleased.  The explanatory matrix with a resolution of 2160 by 1080 pixels gives an excellent picture - juicy and balanced.  The layout here, of course, is not like an iPhone, but the cost of the gadget is almost three times lower.  It is also worth mentioning a decent battery life.  Here it is 20 percent higher than other devices on our list. </p><p>  This model in domestic stores is a frequent guest and stands on shelves with a price tag slightly below 30 thousand rubles.  By the way, on the notorious "Aliexpress" you can even buy this gadget for over 20 thousand.  So the smartphone is definitely worth the money and beats them with interest. </p><h2>  Moto Z2 Play </h2><p>  This is a rather interesting model from the famous Motorola.  Its main feature is modularity.  At the rear of the device is a magnetic interface for connecting various modules.  Marketers have called this technology Moto Mods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motorola.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motorola Z2 Play" class="if uuid-2734987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734987.jpg"></div><p>  With their help, you can significantly expand the functionality of the device.  In addition, the manufacturer took care of a decent choice of add-ons.  Consider the most noteworthy. </p><h2>  Modular system </h2><p>  The Hasselblad True Zoom module makes an advanced professional-grade camera out of your gadget.  Here we have a serious lens with a well-thought-out stabilizer and with the possibility of increasing the focal length from 25 to 250 mm, as well as 10-fold optics.  You can also add a xenon flash and a hardware key to activate the shutter. </p><p>  The Moto GamePad module turns the phone into a game console with a joystick.  It includes specific controls and its own 1030 mAh battery.  The latter allows you to enjoy your favorite games much longer. </p><div class="photo" data-original="propakistani.pk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modular motorola" class="if uuid-2734986" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2734986.jpg"></div><p>  The Incipio offGRID module is a backup of the standard battery and adds 2200 mAh to the existing ones.  Of course, in this case, the weight of the device increases markedly, but on the road and traveling this add-on is indispensable.  The module provides more than 20 additional hours of operation for the smartphone in mixed mode. </p><p>  The Insta-Share module is a kind of projector that allows you to project an image from a smartphone onto a wall.  Moreover, the output is a 70-inch diagonal with a very decent resolution - 854 by 480 pixels.  This may not be enough for a detailed analysis of photographs, but more than for watching a video.  It also has its own 1000 mAh battery. </p><p>  The speaker module adds powerful speakers of 3 watts each to your smartphone.  Branded acoustics JBL Soundboost will add low frequencies and turn the phone into a music center - again, in nature it is an indispensable thing.  The kit also has an additional 1000 mAh battery. </p><h2>  Gadget features </h2><p>  With regard to performance, here we have quite decent characteristics: the Snapdragon 626 series, 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal storage.  Such a set of chipsets may not be enough stars from the sky, but it copes with modern applications very worthily. </p><p>  The visual component did not disappoint either.  The 5.5-inch super-amoled screen with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels boasts an excellent picture: juicy, contrasting and true.  All reviews about the model are almost entirely positive (more than 75% by 5 points), so the device is clearly worth the money. </p><p>  It is strange that the model is rarely found in ordinary offline stores such as Euroset or MVideo, so a good half of users have to order the device on-site or buy on the Internet, the benefit of the Internet is a dime a dozen.  The approximate cost of the device ranges from 20 thousand rubles.  Modules, of course, will have to be purchased separately, depending on your goals and wishes. </p>
