    <h2>  What is attractive for Kazakhstan </h2><p>  Kazakhstan is an unexplored region for many tourists, in which there are resorts for any type of vacation.  The vast territory has high mountains with glaciers, many lakes and the beach strip of the Caspian Sea.  Traveling to different regions of the country, you can find deserts, steppes and forests, there are more than a dozen nature reserves that are radically different from each other.  A centuries-old history has been preserved in ancient buildings and traditions, while in the cities buildings built in different centuries coexist.  Due to such a variety of Kazakhstan, resorts are available for recreation and treatment at any time of the year. </p><p>  We add that for residents of the CIS countries a visa is not required, and you can safely include this multifaceted country in the list of priorities for visiting and a detailed study. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Caspian resorts of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  The south-west of the country is washed by the waters of the largest enclosed lake, which is also called the sea because of its size and geological features.  The coastal cities were not originally aimed at <span>beach vacations;</span> they began to think about such a direction only in the new millennium.  Then the projects of coastal resorts began to appear and be implemented.  The coast is most actively developing near the city of Aktau: the Kendirli cottage village has recently been built, there is talk of creating a large Aktau City complex. </p><p>  Construction in the country is proceeding very quickly, new cities appear in 5-10 years in places where before there was not even a hint of human habitation.  Hotels and resorts are being built even faster: they are built in a year, for a maximum of two.  The main problem of new tourist destinations is the difficulty of transportation.  Sometimes the distance to the nearest settlements is 200-300 km, there are few roads, they are not in the best condition.  Most often, tourists arrive in the nearest major city by plane or train, then get to their destination by bus, car or boat. </p><p>  In addition to the coast of Aktau, rest on the Caspian Sea in Kazakhstan is possible in Atyrau, Fort-Shevchenko, Ganyushkino and Kuryk.  There are practically no full-fledged beach resorts here, there are separate hotels and resorts located on the Caspian coast. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
