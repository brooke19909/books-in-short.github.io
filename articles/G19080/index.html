It is located at the confluence of the <span>rivers Nyaris</span> and Nemunas.  The city is separated from the capital by a distance of 100 kilometers.  Created in the 14th century, it has preserved to this day a piece of history, which was imprinted in its old part.  Here, miraculously, the historical, archaeological and architectural attractions of Kaunas were able to complement each other.  The map clearly tracks their location. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaunas attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233804.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, this city is famous not only for historical monuments.  In the first half of the 20th century, before the outbreak of war, many beautiful streets dotted with modern buildings were built here.  The most elegant of them is Laisves Alley.  No less attractive with a huge number of green spaces is considered Kaunas Arbat.  This is an elegant alley, the length of which reaches one and a half kilometers.  It is located in the very center of Kaunas.  You will not see the sights in the form of magnificent <span>architectural structures</span> or monuments here, but nevertheless, every tourist tries to spend at least a little time here.  A lot of all kinds of shops, excellent restaurants and cozy cafes are concentrated on this avenue.  There is also a funicular here.  With it, you can climb the Aleksot hill, from which the beauty of the whole city is visible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What to see first of all, having arrived in the city of Kaunas?  Sights include in their list a number of buildings that recall the past victories of Lithuania.  The most popular is <span>Kaunas Castle,</span> built in the 8th century in order to repel the attack of the Crusaders.  This stone structure rises at the confluence of the Nyaris and Nemunas rivers.  Today, only one third of the castle is accessible to tourists.  One of the largest Gothic buildings is the house of Perkun.  Immediately after construction in 1440, it was the residence of Hanseatic merchants.  After the house was sold to the Jesuits in the 16th century, a chapel was established here.  Today it houses the Museum of Matskevich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaunas attractions on the map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233803.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  If you list the most <span>interesting places</span> that Kaunas is famous for, the sights must be supplemented with such a structure as the city Hall, which skillfully blended into the interior of the beautiful square.  Its height reaches 53 meters.  Today, the Town Hall serves as the Wedding Palace.  In addition, there are structures that are separate versions of the North European Renaissance.  These include the Holy Trinity Church and the complex of Masalkis Mansion.  No less interesting is the Pazaislis Monastery, which is a magnificent Baroque monument.  This wonderful creation of Italian masters does not pass by any tourist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaunas what to see" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233802.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  We continue to explore Kaunas.  Religious sites can be continued with such a magnificent building as the church of Vytautas the Great, which is considered one of the oldest in the city.  It stands proudly on the right bank of the Nemunas.  This church is a striking example of Lithuanian Gothic brick architecture.  Its appearance as a whole resembles a <span>Latin cross.</span>  The bell tower was added a little later.  Its <span>architectural style is</span> slightly different from the main building.  In the eastern part of the Old Town, on the Freedom Avenue, you can see the church of St. Gertrude.  No less attractive is the church of the Archangel Mikolas, which is a structure built in the Neo-Byzantine style. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kaunas what to see" class="if" height="143" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/233805.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But these are not all the interesting places that Kaunas is famous for.  What else to see here?  Perhaps in no city you will meet the Museum of the Devils.  Already one name kindles curiosity and a desire to visit it.  In addition, there are a number of monuments and museums that deserve the attention of every tourist.  After a long walk around the city, you can go to the Zoological or Botanical Gardens. </p>
