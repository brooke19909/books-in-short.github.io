    <h2>  Box </h2><p>  The phone comes in a white box.  It is transparent in some places, so before buying a person can make sure that everything is in order with the device.  On the back you should note the presence of the described advantages of the phone and the series as a whole, here the manufacturer asked to support him in new endeavors. </p><p>  The phone in the box looks neat, compact.  When you open, you can find special details that will make using the phone more convenient.  We suggest that you familiarize yourself with the complete set later in the article.  There is a guarantee, a charger and so on. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The manufacturer's specifications of the Nokia Lumiya 625 phone in the reviews are fully confirmed.  The device itself is sold with a warranty and additional documentation.  There is also a headset, charger and cable for connecting to a computer.  It is made in a standard form, which is typical for wires from Nokia.  The small size does not allow you to comfortably connect to a stationary computer, while with a laptop there is no inconvenience. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design and ergonomics </h2><p>  Phones of the Lumiya series can be recognized by any active user of devices from Nokia.  The smartphone is considered a monoblock.  A protective glass is installed on the screen.  The device weighs 160 grams. </p><p>  In reviews of the Nokia 625, they often talk about ergonomics.  On the top is a speaker gap.  Under it, the owners see the developer's logo.  On the same surface are the camera and sensors.  There is nothing on the left side of the phone.  On the right are the keys that are responsible for changing the volume and turning on the smartphone.  A headphone port was placed on the top and a charging port on the bottom.  The gadget cover is made of high-quality plastic matte shade.  The color tone is black.  It is difficult to remove the back cover of the phone because the manufacturer has not integrated the notch for convenience.  In reviews of the Nokia 625, customers note that to remove the battery, use a small slot near the memory card slot.  Under the battery is a port for an external drive and SIM cards.  The latter can be used two pieces. </p><p>  The quality of the rear panel leaves much to be desired, but buyers still like the assembly.  There is no backlash and no scripts.  All built-in buttons of a mechanical type work without glitches and false clicks.  Matte plastic is an excellent solution, however, the fact that there is no <span>oleophobic coating</span> spoils the overall impression of the owners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625 specifications reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013123.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The described Nokia 625 smartphone, reviews of which will be given below in the article, operates on the Windows Background 8 operating system.  The design is standard and recognizable - all the tiles are ‚Äúlaid out‚Äù in a known manner.  There is a small amount of information on the locked display, but to receive detailed data about calls, messages, and so on, you must enter a password.  All applications can simply be brought out with icons on the desktop. </p><p>  It is possible to set a photo on the screen saver.  The main type screen is made up of ‚Äúliving‚Äù cells.  What does this mean?  For example, the design of the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù icon changes many times in automatic mode.  In addition, each such label must have special characteristics.  Do not forget that tiles can be of three sizes: the entire width of the screen, half and a quarter.  This is confirmed by the reviews about the Nokia 625. </p><p>  If there are too many tiles in the system, the device will freeze.  However, this is easy to prevent, so the owners do not consider this nuance critical.  Tile on the main screen, you can install any of the applications. </p><p>  In order to learn more about the utility, just make a long tap.  A built-in menu appears immediately.  Four points are observed in it: removal to the desktop, reviews and reviews, and also sending, deleting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumiya 625 owner reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013124.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Navigation </h2><p>  Among all the applications that are preinstalled on the Nokia 625 phone (reviews, photos will make it possible to determine the device), HERE should be noted.  This utility allows you to track cars and people traveling somewhere by public transport.  Due to the installed set of ‚Äúoffice‚Äù, you can easily work and edit all the changes.  Ergonomics as clear as possible. </p><p>  HERE application was convenient and high quality.  It may indicate an excess of standard speed indicators.  Maps are all detailed and detailed.  The owners in the reviews note that it is convenient to use the application. </p><h2>  Hardware platform </h2><p>  The Nokia 625 phone, the reviews and review of which is the topic of our article, runs on a chipset from the manufacturer Qualcomm.  A processor on two cores, the frequency of each of them is 1.2 GHz.  Built-in memory is 8 GB, but the storage can be increased using external drives.  RAM - only 512 MB.  Although the processor is not the best or even average, the smartphone still works smoothly. </p><p>  But you need to understand all the negative aspects.  For example, not all videos are played on this phone.  The problem is solved by downloading an additional player.  At the same time, there are practically no such utilities.  Therefore, the easiest option is to convert the file to the desired one.  However, all owners declare that such a procedure takes quite a long time.  This is evidenced by the characteristics and reviews of the Nokia 625. </p><p>  Copying any files is very easy.  When connected to a computer, the phone immediately opens as a drive and there are no problems - the process of folding can be started instantly. </p><p>  The wireless network module works without any errors or malfunctions.  The data transfer over the connection is maximum.  Also, the phone is able to track any data at high speed using the GPS module.  In a few seconds, the smartphone already finds the necessary satellites to work.  The main thing is that the Internet is turned on.  Thanks to the reviews about the Nokia 625, this can be known for sure. </p><p>  Smartphone autonomy at an average level.  With active work with the phone, it sits almost half.  However, if you restrain your desire to sit in VK and review sites, then this smartphone, in principle, is pretty good.  There are no particularly outstanding indicators, which is not very pleasing to the owners.  Next, we consider the details of battery operation. </p><h2>  Runtime Indicators </h2><p>  If you disconnect all wireless modules, as well as the Internet connection from the operator, you can achieve less battery consumption.  It is also recommended to reduce the brightness level from maximum to minimum.  This is confirmed by the reviews and description of the Nokia 625. </p><p>  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that while listening to music via the Internet, data is synchronized automatically.  This also puts additional stress on the processor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625 phone review reviews" class="if" height="493" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013125.jpg" width="597"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The phone operates on a display with a resolution of 800 √ó 480 pixels.  If we talk about the diagonal, then we are talking about 4.7 inches.  During operation with the device, the function of changing the color design of the display is available.  This can be found in the reviews on the Nokia 625.  Of the interchangeable options available: sensitivity, temperature and color saturation.  The sensor always works fine, even in winter, even in summer.  The display received a maximum brightness level of 323 km / m <sup>2</sup> .  At the same time, this indicator will be enough for comfortable work with the device.  Minimum - 75 km / m <sup>2</sup> .  Unfortunately, this information is not very reliable.  Owners do not believe that automatic brightness adjustment correctly performs its task, often failures occur.  The indicator at night is lower than in normal mode.  Contrast is good. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the display is so flexible in terms of options, you can configure it completely only for you.  However, special miracles can not be expected, since the gray color of the display itself will be striking.  It is especially noticeable in dark rooms. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The device‚Äôs camera is designed for 5 megapixels.  Reviews and description of the Nokia 625 model regarding the front matrix are not impressive.  Its resolution is 0.3 megapixels.  Video recording is performed in resolutions up to Full HD.  The matrix received a large number of changeable settings, so the video mode and its characteristics can be easily edited.  However, all options should be changed before recording.  You can experiment with exposure, white balance, shooting mode, picture format and ISO value.  Owner reviews of the Nokia Lumiya 625 confirm the importance of such features.  Many buyers really like the fact that the device received a mechanical release button, and not just a touch.  Focusing occurs when half-pressed.  Using this button, you can simplify the use of your smartphone. </p><p>  The quality of the photographs is average.  In good and clear weather, you can get great shots.  However, in poor lighting conditions the quality drops very much, this is noticeable.  Pictures are fuzzy and blurry, with distortion.  But users are satisfied with this quality, since the device belongs to the budget segment. </p><p>  The front camera is advised to use only for video calls.  The quality of the clips that are recorded on the front matrix slightly does not reach the average level.  Reviews about the Nokia 625, or rather, the quality of the received video, are negative. </p><p>  Built-in photo editor from the manufacturer.  It is called "Nokia Photo Studio."  It has many settings.  With their competent change, you can achieve an increase in the quality level of the resulting photos.  There are also ready-made filters.  There are only nine of them, but you can use many other options, creating them yourself.  Manual settings consist in searching for distortions and their corrections.  This is confirmed by the characteristics and reviews of the "Nokia Lumiya 625". </p><p>  In the blur menu, you can set a certain focus on specific things captured in the photo.  A radial shift with distortion is also available.  The creation menu has various options, for example, changing the color palette of a photo. </p><p>  In the settings there are a large number of interesting functions.  We are talking about brightness, balance, clarity, saturation, which can be changed in active mode even after shooting.  In the correction menu it is allowed to crop and rotate pictures.  You can also correct red eye. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The successful parameters of Nokia 625 in the reviews include many factors.  Among them, the ideal quality of the case should be noted.  Build in good standing.  In addition, performance and navigation are excellent. </p><p>  The diagonal of the screen is considered by many to be beautiful, since the device is not too wide not to fit in your pocket, but you should not look closely, sorting out the small text on the screen.  The device works stably, you do not have to constantly run to the service center.  Autonomous operating time - at an average level.  The case is assembled perfectly, without backlashes and creaks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 625 specifications reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013126.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Considering user reviews in the review of the Nokia 625 phone, the screen, or rather, its resolution, should be highlighted among the main shortcomings.  In addition, not all video codecs are available on the system.  Accordingly, the clips may not play.  Therefore, you should carefully choose when buying the phone that is most suitable for the requirements.  No oleophobic coating.  This is also often voiced in negative reviews. </p><p>  Many people think that there are too few games on Windows Background.  The device weighs sensitively.  Screen resolution is a byproduct of increasing battery power and resource consumption.  Even with a small price, the camera still seems awful. </p><h2>  Overall customer experience </h2><p>  Quite often, in reviews from owners about the Nokia Lumiya 625 phone, they admitted that they had bypassed the device for a long time.  This is due to the work on the "Windows Background", where not all applications function perfectly.  There were few toys initially.  But over time, readers began to produce readers, office utilities, etc. in such numbers that there are already too many of them on the Internet.  In this regard, the device began to gain popularity. </p><p>  Buyers are satisfied that the battery life has good characteristics.  For the sake of such a long period, the manufacturer sacrificed the screen resolution and its size.  But buyers note that there are no special complaints about the display.  They also advise not to purchase this model for taking pictures. </p><p>  The performance is excellent, the owners praise it.  For example, pages in a browser open "at the speed of light."  In general, they write that this phone for their money is ideal for standard tasks. </p><h2>  Comparison with Apple iPhone 4 </h2><p>  Reviews from the owners about the Nokia Lumiya 625 phone make it clear that the device is not a competitor for the next iPhone model, but users are constantly comparing them.  Therefore, we‚Äôll continue to talk about what is common and different in these devices. </p><p>  The first difference is the definition of classes.  For example, Nokia refers to only two: multimedia and business class.  At the same time, the iPhone should be attributed to them as a plus to such classes as the touchphone and image. </p><p>  The release of the product from the "apple" took place in 2010, from the "Nokia" - in 2013. </p><p>  Talk about the intricacies of the battery.  The iPhone has a 1420 mAh battery.  It is capable of withstanding standby time of 300 hours.  The type of battery is lithium polymer.  Nokia received a lithium-ion version with 2 thousand mAh.  Accordingly, in standby mode, as in active, it can withstand much longer - up to 500 hours. </p><p>  The iPhone has a TFT display.  Nokia uses an LCD.  The screen resolution is worse for the second gadget - 480 √ó 800 versus 640 √ó 960 pixels.  The diagonal of Nokia is larger - 4.7 inches. </p><p>  The camera matrices are the same - both have 5 megapixel quality.  Videos on the "apple" are worse.  The resolution of the iPhone is 720 √ó 480 pixels.  Flash type LED, the "Nokia" - also LED type. </p><p>  Any owner will obviously say that the iPhone is much better, but this is a subjective opinion.  Everyone should decide for themselves what it will be more convenient to use. </p><h2>  Comparison with Samsung Galaxy S III Phone </h2><p>  Continuing to consider the characteristics and reviews of the Nokia 625, it should be noted the difference with the Samsung.  The device from the South Korean manufacturer came out a year earlier - in 2012.  It belongs to the multimedia class, but Nokia is also considered a business option. </p><p>  Both devices run on a lithium-ion battery.  Samsung has a more powerful version - 2100 mAh, while Nokia has 2 thousand mAh.  It seems that these indicators are almost the same, but in standby mode, Samsung will last 900 hours, and the described Nokia will only last 550 hours. </p><p>  The Korean device has an 8 megapixel camera.  The quality of the recorded videos leaves much to be desired, however, by resolution, it coincides with those parameters that Nokia offers.  Flash type LED. </p><p>  The processors for these phones are different.  Owner reviews about Nokia Lumiya 625 are good.  It runs on the Snapdragon S4 Dual-core, while Samsung runs on the Exynos 4412 Quad.  The frequency of the latter is greater: 1.4 GHz. </p><p>  Antennas in these devices are built-in type.  The materials used to create the case are the same. </p><h2>  Comparison with HTC Desire 600 Dual Sim </h2><p>  Specifications and reviews about Nokia 625 allow you to compare the device with one of the gadgets of the HTC Desire family.    -   2 . ,            HTC   1860 .    :    ¬´¬ª      ‚Äì  550 . </p><p>   ¬´¬ª .  HTC   8 .       .   ‚Äì 1280 √ó 720 . </p><p>      . </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p> The hero of this review belongs to the budget class, but the Nokia Lumiya 625 gets good reviews.  The device is accessible even to the middle class.  Not everyone likes its 4.7-inch display, but deserves some pretty good reviews.  The materials used are not too low-quality - this is the opinion of many buyers. </p><p>  HERE navigation perfectly copes with all the tasks of the device, so most note its speed.  She very accurately and quickly serves in the corresponding operating modes.  The speed of the interface functionality for a budget smartphone is very good. </p><p>  The screen is not liked by everyone, but especially its transmission of a black tint.  Due to the fact that the display does not have an oleophobic coating, fingerprints constantly accumulate on the surface.  This question is not critical for many owners, as they are easily erased. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 625 reviews overview" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2013121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The smartphone also does not play some videos.  This drawback does not apply to the device itself, but to the software, so it is impossible to fix it yourself.  This failure refers to the Windows Operating System. </p><p>  If you compare with other similar devices "Nokia Lumiya 625", the reviews will make it clear that the level of competitiveness is not at a high level.  The undisputed leader will be able to choose only users, focusing on their individual needs.  And in defense of the smartphone from Nokia, we say that it has its own special qualities and advantages, so the choice is yours. </p>
