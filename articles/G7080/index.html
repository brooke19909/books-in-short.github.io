The main ways</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Privatization is a form of transformation of ownership by transfer to private hands.  The purpose of the process is to attract a more effective way of managing property.  Depending on the type of facility, the privatization of apartments, land and property enterprises is distinguished.  This question may be of interest, for example, to relatives of a deceased person who want to sell a house.  Read more about where and how to find out if the apartment is privatized or not, read in this article. </p><h2>  Data access </h2><p>  Today in Russia, most of the housing is privately owned.  After the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Privatization‚Äù has entered into force, citizens of the Russian Federation can obtain for free the right to own the housing premises that they use.  But some of the apartments are still state or municipal.  Therefore, the free privatization of the apartment has been extended until 2018. </p>

    <p>  The parliamentarian made this decision, since most of the citizens who occupy housing in emergency or dilapidated premises may lose the right to change the form of ownership.  And people who are registered as needing square meters may not have time to use this same right. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Privatization of an apartment legally permits citizens to make sale and purchase transactions, inheritance transfers, etc. Participants in the process can obtain reliable information on the property. </p><h2>  How to find out if an apartment is privatized or not </h2><p>  The easiest and most convenient way is to request information from Rosreestr.  The same option is suitable if housing was privatized before January 31, 1998, but then it was the object of a sale, gift, or exchange transaction.  All this information is displayed in the Unified State Register of Real Estate Rights (USRR).  This is the largest database created in 1998 with the aim of exercising state control over the implementation of real estate transactions.  In addition, it contains information on the presence of arrests or encumbrances.  Any citizen of Russia can receive information on the facility by providing: </p><ul><li>  identification; </li><li>  request for data request; </li><li>  duty receipt. </li></ul><p>  For legal entities, this list is expanded: </p><ul><li>  certificate of state registration of the institution; </li><li>  statutory documents; </li><li>  extract from state registration; </li><li>  TIN assignment document; </li><li>  power of attorney and passport of the representative of the organization. </li></ul><p>  Here's where to get the privatization certificate.  The document is valid for 30 days.  Information is 100% correct only on the first day of receipt of paper.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to provide the document to interested parties as soon as possible.  If there is no data in the Unified State Register, it means that the process of changing the form of ownership did not occur at all or was completed earlier than 1998 and no transactions were concluded on the property. </p>

    <h2>  How to get data through the privatization department </h2><p>  Contact the Registration Chamber and fill out the application form.  An application form is issued by an employee.  A copy of the passport is attached to the document, and for legal entities, an additional certificate of state registration of the company, statutory documents, memorandum of association, a notarized power of attorney will be required.  The state duty can be paid directly at the Registration Chamber through the cash desk.  Next, the employee will issue a ‚ÄúReceipt on the acceptance of information for processing‚Äù, which will indicate the period for receipt of the statement.  Usually it is three days.  On the appointed day, you must come to Rosreestr with a passport, a receipt and pick up the original extract with a live signature of the registrar.  The certificate of privatization of the apartment contains the following data: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  <span>cadastral number of the</span> object; </li><li>  name; </li><li>  appointment; </li><li>  exact area; </li><li>  address; </li><li>  Name of copyright holders, share of each of them; </li><li>  existing restrictions; </li><li>  presence of an equity agreement; </li><li>  data on current judicial requirements. </li></ul><p>  Information is provided on a fee basis.  The amount depends on who exactly requests the data.  Individuals need to pay 200 rubles, legal entities - 600. </p><h2>  Alternative way </h2><p>  Where else to find out if the apartment has been privatized?  The key point in solving this issue is the estimated time of change of ownership.  The law was adopted in 1991.  Over the next 7 years, the <span>Bureau of Technical Inventory (BTI) dealt</span> with this issue <span>.</span>  Each privatization department establishes its own procedure for providing data and issuing certificates.  Therefore, if there is no information in the EGRP database, then you should contact this service. </p>

    <h2>  Fifth stage </h2><p>  The last step is to submit documents to the Registration Chamber for registration of a <span>certificate of ownership.</span>  All participants who apply with a similar application must pay a state duty of 1000 rubles and wait 14 days.  Registration is carried out if: </p><ul><li>  cadastral and technical passports; </li><li>  extracts from Rosreestr; </li><li>  a notarized refusal to privatize all non-participating persons; </li><li>  applicants passports, birth certificates of the child; </li><li>  extracts from the house book for each participant; </li><li>  warrants; </li><li>  privatization agreement of each participant in the process. </li></ul><p>  Upon completion of the procedure, an extract is issued on the existence of ownership rights to the apartment. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The process of changing ownership of a property takes a lot of time.  But without it, it is legal to make purchase and sale transactions, inheritance is impossible.  Therefore, it is worth asking in advance the question of who owns the property.  How to find out if an apartment is privatized or not?  Submit a request to Rosreestr.  This can be done both in the privatization department and via the Internet.  The deadline for extracting from the USRD is three days.  Help is valid for 30 days.  Information on a fee basis is available to all interested persons.  If the deal on changing the form of ownership was completed before 1998, then these data can be requested from BTI.  But this can only be done by the owners of the apartment, their heirs or state bodies with a certain permission. </p>
