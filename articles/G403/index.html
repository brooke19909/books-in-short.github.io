    <h2>  Types of devices </h2><p>  First of all, the separation of models is carried out by the number of sensors.  Nowadays, modifications are made to 2, 4 and 6 sensors.  On average, the angle of definition of objects does not exceed 140 degrees.  Cameras are made with low or high resolution.  If we consider expensive models, then their specified parameter fluctuates around 600 by 480 pixels.  Another separation of the cameras is by the type of installation.  Some modifications are mounted on the car panel.  However, there are compact devices built into the <span>rearview mirror.</span> </p><h2>  Setting up the Falcon FN 170-R </h2><p>  Setting up the marking (grid) of the reverse camera is very fast.  For this, the motorist must first start the car.  Next, it is important to include dimensions.  The next step is to go to the device‚Äôs service menu.  Then the camera tab is selected.  To adjust the color of the markup, go to the "Advanced Options".  If this is not required, go to the "Images" tab.  Next, you only need to select the markup and click the end button. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
