In 1940, in these places, NKVD officers shot several thousand captured officers from Poland who were arrested during the Soviet occupation of Polish lands.  This is a scandalous crime, since a secret burial was discovered by German troops back in 1943.  At the same time, the international commission pleaded guilty to the USSR in the commission of this massacre.  However, after the end of the Second World War, an investigation was conducted on the orders of the Soviet authorities, during which it was possible to "find out" that the Germans allegedly carried out the executions in 1941.  Only in 1990 justice was restored and documents related to the mass killings in the region were declassified.  Very soon, the Katyn <span>memorial complex</span> dedicated to the memory of the victims of the NKVD appeared.  According to some reports, victims of repressions were shot here right up to the 40s of the last century.  Today, the memorial consists of Russian and Polish parts, there is a long wall with memorial plates on which the names of the deceased officers are embossed and <span>mass graves are</span> decorated <span>.</span>  Also in the memorial complex is a pavilion at the main entrance, where you can see the commemorative exhibition "The totalitarian past of the Smolensk region."
