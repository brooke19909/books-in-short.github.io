  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to connect the Internet to the phone?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Internet is a worldwide network where anyone can search online for any data, any movie, etc.  However, at present, most people use the Internet because it makes it possible to communicate with people living around the world.  That is why, in order not to lose contact when you are away from home, and there is no your favorite computer or laptop at hand, you just need mobile Internet.  However, for this you must know how to connect the Internet to your phone. </p><p>  Of course, today there are a huge number of various Internet modems that allow you to connect to the Internet through a laptop, netbook or tablet device.  But sometimes it is inconvenient and best if there is the possibility of accessing the Internet through a mobile phone.  Stop tormenting yourself with thoughts that you do not know how to connect the Internet to your phone, contact your friends for help.  Well, if they are not in the know, well then you need to remember the following information. </p><p>  So how to connect the Internet to your phone? </p><p>  The most convenient, high-quality and cheap way to access the Internet using your mobile phone is to connect via GPRS.  That is why, for starters, you should check if this service is connected on your phone.  If not, then you need to enter in the appropriate field on your mobile phone all the necessary data, including the access point.  You can easily get all this information from your mobile operator, thereby clarifying the cost of Internet access on your tariff plan or to find out special offers that will help you save money if you intend to often use the services of Internet resources.  It is also worth noting that this service is free in many countries, although somewhere free gprs are just memories. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then, in order to more accurately understand how to connect the Internet to your phone, you will have to read a series of information about which browser program will suit your particular phone model.  Otherwise, you risk getting a couple of three extra problems.  So, if the Internet browser was not installed on your mobile phone from the beginning, then after reading the instructions for your mobile phone, you will understand which version you need.  After finding and downloading this program, you proceed to install it.  After completing the last operation and saving all the data, you can safely go to the world famous information and entertainment portal. </p><p>  Gprs service and its advantages. </p><p>  Internet users are well aware that without this service they can‚Äôt get anywhere.  It is convenient and practical.  After all, it is GPRS that provides its users with an instant and high-quality Internet connection via a mobile phone. </p><p>  The main advantage of this service is the lack of a remote access server, to which you do not have to dial up every time you want to go online.  After all, now you can connect in a matter of seconds and stay online all the time, forgetting about interruptions in communication. </p><p>  Also, the gprs service provides high speed data transfer.  So, you can easily download and transfer various files four times faster than usual.  The presence of this service guarantees you payment for the used traffic strictly after the fact.  That is, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much time you spent on the Internet, you only have to pay for the amount of information that has been transmitted or downloaded. </p><p>  The ability to answer calls and send SMS messages without losing your Internet connection is very important.  So, if while downloading a song, your phone rings, you can easily receive an incoming call, and the download of the file will never be interrupted. </p><p>  Thus, if you want to always have access to the network, then you just can not do without the Internet on your mobile phone. </p>
