Although the mini-devices were always named after their older brother, all of them in reality to a large extent represented its ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù version.  The same goes for the S5 mini-model. </p><h2>  main parameters </h2><p>  The Samsung S5 Mini smartphone <span>has the</span> following <span>specifications</span> : 4.5-inch display with 720p resolution, 4-core 1.4-GHz processor, 8-megapixel camera, 4G LTE, <span>fingerprint scanner</span> and heart rate sensor.  The phone runs on the outdated Android KitKat OS.  The S5 also has a quad-core 2.3-GHz chip, full HD - display and a 16-megapixel camera.  The younger model looks exactly the same as its older brother, although the smaller size makes the smartphone much more convenient to use in one hand. </p><p>  It would be more honest to call the Samsung S5 Mini, specifications, the price of 240 US dollars and other parameters of which do not meet the data of the S5 smartphone, its lightweight version.  An example of this approach is Sony, whose mini-phone <span>Xperia Z3 Compact</span> uses the same technology as in the older model.  Moreover, the cost of the mini version of the Galaxy S5 and its older brother is almost the same. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  In addition to dimensions, the Samsung S5 Mini Duos features no difference from its full-sized older brother.  It has the same soft-touch rubberized back panel with a dotted pattern, a ‚Äúchrome‚Äù plastic edging, a return button to the home screen and the same square camera at the back with a heart rate sensor below it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The smartphone is made of similar plastic materials, although they feel even more plastic in the smaller model, which is facilitated by its very light 120-gram weight.  If someone is looking for luxury in a small phone, then she probably will not be inspired by this modification of the <span>Samsung Galaxy.</span>  Another thing is the HTC One Mini 2, which has a magnificent all-metal design, which is much nicer to hold in your hand. </p><p>  With 131 mm of length and 65 mm of width, the Samsung S5 Mini smartphone has a size characteristic much smaller than a full-size model, so that it not only does not burden the trouser pockets, but is also much more convenient to use in one hand.  With your thumb you can cover all areas of the screen, which is more difficult to do on the S5. </p><p>  The rear panel is removable and provides access to the microSD card slot, which allows you to expand the built-in ROM by 16 GB, as well as replace the battery when necessary.  The smartphone is available in the same colors as the S5, including white, navy, electric and gold. </p>

    <h2>  Dust and water resistant </h2><p>  Like his colleague, the Samsung S5 Mini G800F has protection characteristics that correspond to IP67, which means the phone is dustproof and can be immersed for 30 minutes in a depth of no more than 1 m. In practice, this will allow the device not to stall when you accidentally hit the toilet .  Unlike the S5, however, its mini-implementation does not need a shutter covering the micro-USB port below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is difficult to say how the Samsung S5 Mini provides waterproof performance with this open port, especially since electricity is connected to it, but, of course, it‚Äôs practical that you don‚Äôt have to worry about inserting an uncomfortable plug.  This is noted by users who have lost this part in the Galaxy S5, which automatically deprives the device of water resistance. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The 4.5-inch screen of the Samsung S5 Mini, which is characterized by 1280 x 720 pixels, is a step backward compared to full HD on the S5.  True, a smaller screen does not require a larger number of dots to stay sharp.  Indeed, the pixel density of 326 dpi corresponds to the density of the iPhone Retina-display, so you need to be too picky to call the display not clear enough. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, high-resolution images show a lot of detail, although of course, high-resolution panels seem clearer.  But for everyday tasks like sending tweets or viewing photos on Instagram, a 720p display is more than enough.  It is bright and easy to read in the dim midday sun of the northern latitudes, but it is difficult to say how it will behave in the southern countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The colors are very vibrant, which makes watching cartoons an unforgettable sight, but you can delve into the settings to balance the color balance, if preference is given to less saturated colors and natural tones. </p>

    <h2>  Android software </h2><p>  The phone runs on the Android KitKat operating system, which is far from the latest version of Google software.  The interface is almost identical to the usual S5, which is not necessarily good, since the S5 and Mini have so many customizable parameters that even veterans of Android can easily get confused. </p><p>  The smartphone has a private mode that allows you to protect certain files and folders with a password or the need to scan a fingerprint built into the return button to the home screen.  Owners do not recommend using the latter option, since the fingerprint sensor does not always work.  For example, users complain that in most cases the sensor is not able to recognize the fingerprint, as a result of which they have to enter their backup password after a large number of unsuccessful attempts.  The same problem is observed in S5. </p><p>  The phone has a bunch of brand-name software pre-installed on the phone, including its own app store, an email client and web browser, a TV remote control for the TV, and the S Health app, which allows you to track your fitness progress by entering the number of steps and heart rate with using a heart rate sensor on the back of the phone. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini SM G800H, the characteristics of the 1.4-GHz quad-core processor which provide a fairly fast operation of the device, basically works without delay.  They become noticeable when navigating the interface.  According to the owners, the same problems are observed in S5.  In addition, the phones of the manufacturer suffer from a gradual deterioration in the speed of operation throughout the entire period of their use.  For smartphones, it‚Äôs a common thing to slow down a bit when filling them with applications, music and photos, but, according to some reviews, the Samsung S5 Mini has slowed down its performance so much that the device needed up to 5 seconds only to open the photo gallery.  The Galaxy S4 had similar problems.  Mini in this regard immediately after the purchase seems normal and may remain so, but it should be borne in mind that from time to time it will be necessary to do a full reset of the phone so that it continues to work on and on. </p><p>  Instagram, Twitter, Netflix and image editing in Snapseed do not cause difficulties for the S5 Mini, as well as more demanding games such as Asphalt 8 and Riptide GP 2. </p><p>  The G800H phone model differs from the G800F in dual SIM support, lack of LTE support, a newer Exynos 3470 processor instead of the outdated Snapdragon 400 with the same frequency and video accelerator. </p>

    <h2>  Battery life </h2><p>  The smartphone is powered by a 2100 mAh battery, and Samsung claims that the device on a single charge can support about 10 hours of talk in 3G mode, which is confirmed by the owners of the device.  Two hours of watching video over Wi-Fi reduced the battery charge to 80%, and this is not such a bad result.  If you use the phone sparingly enough, avoiding games and streaming video, and do not take a lot of pictures, you can even squeeze it out all day. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini camera: specifications </h2><p>  User reviews suggest that, like all other key specifications, the Mini camera is also a ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù version of the one installed on the S5: the sensor has only 8, not 16 megapixels.  The number of megapixels was not so critical, as the owners note the lens works well. </p><p>  According to customer reviews, the photos come out contrasting and well convey the deep blue sky.  The exposure is uniform, with great detail.  Automatic white balance does not do its job very well, which leads to light greenish tones.  But fortunately, the camera allows you to manually control the white balance, as well as other parameters, such as exposure and ISO speed, along with a standard set of graphic filters. </p><p>  There are other shooting modes - panoramic and serial, and you can download even more from the Samsung store.  There is an HDR mode called Rich Tone, but it does not provide a live HDR image similar to that of the S5, and there is no HDR video support. </p><p>  In Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini <span>SM G800F</span> , camera specifications are generally satisfactory.  Although it does not have high resolution and always on HDR, like the S5, exposure, contrast and colors make it quite capable of creating spectacular images for Twitter. </p>

    <h2>  You should not expect much </h2><p>  As in the case of the S4 Mini and S3 Mini before, the manufacturer took its flagship phone, lowered all its parameters, but retained the name of the top model Samsung Galaxy S5.  Mini, specifications, price ($ 240) and other parameters of which simply do not correspond to the data of its ‚Äúbrother‚Äù, those users who are looking for elite specifications in a smaller format will simply disappoint.  Instead, experts advise you to purchase the Xperia Z3 Compact - a smartphone that meets the parameters of its older brother, only in a reduced case. </p><p>  It is impossible to say that the Samsung S5 Mini has a very poor performance.  Its screen is bright and bold, it has enough power for most tasks that the user will probably want to perform, the camera is decent, and its moisture resistance will protect it from spilled drinks.  If you want to buy a phone with the Samsung name on it, which you can easily control with one hand, then the S5 Mini will do just fine.  You just should not expect the performance of a full-size model. </p><h2>  pros </h2><p>  The Samsung Galaxy Mini S5 has the same rubberized design as its full-sized counterpart.  The smartphone is waterproof, with a bright screen and a decent camera. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Like all previous mini-flagships of the South Korean manufacturer, the S5 Mini has seriously diluted the specifications of the base phone.  This means that the user receives a device of inferior quality, called by someone else's name, and at an inflated price.  The plastic design does not allow you to feel the luxury of the design as it is implemented in the metal HTC One Mini 2, and the fingerprint sensor rarely works properly. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  If someone was deceived by the name of the phone and hoped to get the characteristics of his namesake in a more compact size, he would be disappointed.  Galaxy Mini S5 is similar to the S5 only in name and appearance, but not in its specifications.  Those customers who are looking for usability in a smartphone, Samsung‚Äôs brand name and are unpretentious with the power of their device will find what they are looking for.  As a decent compact alternative, which echoes the characteristics of its older model, experts recommend considering the candidacy of Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. </p>
