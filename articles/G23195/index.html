Every year, new models enter the market.  They meet all modern requirements.  Young people are happy to acquire these devices and enjoy innovative developments.  However, there is such a category of users that prefers gadgets, so to speak, ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù, therefore it is not surprising that many Samsung still use the Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus GT-S7500, which went on sale in 2012. </p><p>  It is worth noting that not everyone is ready to switch to huge smartphones, even taking into account their wide functionality.  It is for this category that this model is suitable.  Does it have more advantages besides its compact dimensions?  Let's get it right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy ace plus s7500" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1936308.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Externally, the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Ace Plus S7500 is not much different from similar gadgets.  Rounded edges harmoniously fit into the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdesigners.  Thanks to the chrome frame located on the front panel, the device looks pretty impressive.  The glossy surface of the back cover somewhat confused buyers, as the company already presented models made of matte plastic.  This option is practical, fingerprints do not accumulate on it and there are no traces of mechanical damage.  But with the gloss you have to be extremely careful, if possible, use a case to protect the case from scratches. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If we talk about the assembly, then there are no comments.  The back cover does not bend, does not play anything and does not creak. </p><p>  From customer reviews it follows that the dimensions of this device are an indisputable advantage.  They are 114.5 √ó 62.5 √ó 11.2 mm.  Compared with previous models, the thickness indicator decreased slightly, and the height increased.  The streamlined shape of the case allows you to control the phone with one hand, without feeling discomfort.  The weight of the device is only 114 g. With long conversations, fatigue does not occur.  If you use a smartphone without a case, you need to be very careful, since the glossy surface of the back cover is rather slippery. </p><p>  The front panel is framed as standard.  Above the touch screen are a proximity sensor that automatically <span>locks the screen</span> and speaker.  Users respond positively to the latter.  The volume is good, the interlocutor's speech sounds legible. </p><p>  Under the screen there is a control panel with one mechanical button, displayed in the center, and two touch buttons.  There is a backlight that facilitates the use of the phone.  It is not bright enough, the shade is white. </p><p>  At the top there is a standard headphone jack, with a microphone and a USB port on the opposite side.  On the side faces are keys for adjusting the volume (left) and locking the device (right). </p><p>  On the back of the smartphone there is a stereo speaker, a flash and a camera lens.  The latter protrudes slightly beyond the general line of the housing, which can lead to damage to the surface of the protective glass of the optics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung galaxy ace plus gt s7500" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1936309.jpg" width="500"></div>

This element is an important criterion for many buyers.  The model uses a 3.65-inch display.  It is framed by a black frame.  On the sides, it is thin, expanding only in the upper and lower parts.  The resolution with which the picture is displayed on the screen is critically small.  It remained the same as its predecessor: 480 √ó 320 mm.  Pixelization is quite noticeable even with the naked eye, since the resolution of the display is only 158 ppi. </p><p>  The screen uses a TFT-LCD matrix.  It is worth noting that it is not perfect.  Viewing angles are not as wide as we would like.  When tilting the device, the contrast is significantly reduced.  The brightness level can only be adjusted manually; there is no automatic option in the gadget.  On the street in sunny weather, it will be somewhat difficult to consider the information, since the screen glare. </p><p>  The device has a multi-touch function, thanks to which the sensor layer is able to recognize up to five touches made simultaneously. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung s7500 galaxy ace plus specifications" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1936310.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><p>  Specifications <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Ace Plus S7500 even at the time of release were considered rather weak.

Paired with the main chipset, the Adreno 200 graphics accelerator is installed. </p><p>  Such a "filling", although not considered quite powerful, but allows the gadget to work without freezes.  Most owners noticed that the phone is stable and copes with all everyday tasks. </p><p>  RAM in this model is only 512 MB.  Only about 200 MB will be available to the user.

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus S7500 is able to work with networks of the second and third generation.  There is a Wi-Fi module.  The phone works as an access point.  There are two ways to transfer files - via Bluetooth and USB.  The transmission speed is excellent.  All options work smoothly. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Ace Plus GT-S7500: reviews </h2><p>  The opinions of users are divided.  The reason for this was weak technical specifications.  Given that the device at the start of sales was sold for about 10,000 rubles, everyone expected much more from it.  This phone is suitable only for undemanding users.  It copes with everyday tasks, but resource-intensive applications on it will not start. </p>
