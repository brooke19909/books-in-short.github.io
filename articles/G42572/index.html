    <h2>  Abbreviations </h2><p>  Having seen the announcement of the sale of the site, most of the population will try to guess what the letters in front of the name "Mozhaisk expanse" mean.  By the way, there are a sufficient number of such abbreviations, and it is simply necessary to navigate them.  It can be letters LPH, SNT, IZHS, DNT.  Those who did not study the issue will immediately decide that IZHS is the coolest of the options, DNT is probably a summer residence, private household plots are something farmer's, and SNT is a <span>horticultural partnership.</span>  But no need to guess even after deciphering the abbreviations.  Names are only the intended purpose of the construction.  The appointment will indicate all the shortcomings, advantages and features of each type of land acquired by the population. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First of all, a category should be indicated for land.  If you are interested in your own house and its construction, then only the land of settlements and agricultural purposes will do.  In addition, each of the two categories should have notes regarding permitted uses.  This is exactly what the above abbreviations are talking about.  For example, SNT and DNP can be located on <span>agricultural</span> land, private housing - on the land of settlements, but LPH - anywhere.  First, we decrypt: </p><ul><li>  DNP - summer non-profit partnership. </li><li>  IZHS - individual housing construction. </li><li>  LPH is a personal subsidiary farm. </li><li>  DNT - summer non-profit partnership. </li><li>  SNT is a garden non-profit partnership. </li></ul><p>  So, Mozhaisk expanse refers, rather, to partnership.  Nevertheless, it is desirable to know the differences from other types of land in order to be sure of the right choice. </p>

    <h2>  IZHS </h2><p>  Individual housing construction is dominated by the number of purchases, even Mozhaisk expanse is not sold so well.  IZHS - originally a legally understandable type of purchase, and therefore attractive.  Firstly, there is a specific address, which means that there will be no problems with registration in your home.  People who do not have registration in the conditions of modern Russia have problems living, and they will not be hired.  In addition, the address may receive mail: letters, parcels, newspapers, orders from the Internet and so on.  You can also easily use the address to call an ambulance, firefighters - it‚Äôs expensive to invite specialists to the country, this will result in a need for a tidy sum.  Land IZHS - municipal, therefore, the infrastructure should be simply obliged: roads that are cleaned in winter, schools, transport, shops and hospitals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, not everything in IZHS pluses compared to the DNP "Mozhaisk expanse."  First of all, a huge minus is the limitation of the size of the plot by the number of hundredths.  The house, which was dreamed of for many nights, will not be the same as in a daydream, because it is necessary to coordinate the project with the rules of GOST and SNiP.  In addition, a requirement will be presented for the indispensable and full <span>commissioning of the house.</span>  Well and most importantly: taxation will be very different.  For example, in the Mozhayskoye expanse DNP, property tax makes up only 0.3% of the cadastral value, but in IZHS - as much as one and a half percent. </p>

    <h2>  SNT, DNT and DNP </h2><p>  There is little difference between the types of these sites.  For SNT, a more fertile soil is assumed than, say, for DNP.  But at the same time, the cadastral value that the Mozhaisk expanse (country house) has is lower, because all non-profit partnerships have a lower bonus score.  Even if all the basic conditions are the same, then any section of SNT will cost more.  The purpose is similar - a garden and a summer house.  But we must admit that it has recently become much wider.  Like most cottage buildings, Mozhaisk expanse is a holiday village intended for living.  Only here the house in it will be cheaper! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Register in SNT, DNP and DNT is also quite possible, except that this does not happen by itself, as in IZHS.  It will be necessary to conduct an examination to recognize the structure in accordance with the established norms, and then seek recognition of the right to register in court.  Although this is a formality, it is mandatory.  But people do not care where to be.  Mozhaisk expanse is worth fighting for the right to reside there and still get state registration.  It is not so easy to conduct communications in a holiday village - the differences in legislative consumer standards for life and for leisure interfere.  But Mozhaisk expanse is a cottage village with amenities.  Local residents will have roads, gas, water and electricity of sufficient capacity: administrative barriers have already been overcome. </p><h2>  Hidden cost </h2><p>  Finished houses in SNT, DNP and DNT are usually sold on similar conditions, where it is indicated that the price is included in the price.  In order for electricity and roads to appear, a targeted contribution is needed.  Timing for gas connection is usually not guaranteed, and even poorly defined.  Most often residents do water supply on their own.  Thus, the rise in price of the site will necessarily happen at least four hundred thousand rubles excluding water and gas.  However, Mozhaisk expanse offers a completely different idea.  The pricing policy is entirely customer-oriented. </p><p>  It provides for the general plan to supply electricity to each section (voltage of 380 V and a power of 10 kW), as well as central water supply and sewerage.  Gas distribution substation is also in the plan of the cottage village "Mozhaisk expanse."  The characteristics of the sites are such that it is unlikely that there will be people who do not like it here.  Equipped with a garbage collection area.  Around the village there is a fence around the perimeter and a checkpoint at each entrance with round-the-clock security and the ability to call a quick response group.  The roads inside the village are sand and gravel.  Sports and children's playgrounds, swimming and fishing ponds and mangal zones on the shore are provided. </p>

    <h2>  Indisputable Pros and Caution </h2><p>  A person who buys land in a holiday village will never be left alone with his problems: like-minded people who will also "raise the virgin land" will be nearby.  Neighbors will surely turn out to belong to the same social layer, that is, none of them will build a palace with columns and a helipad on the roof: everyone will have approximately equal financial opportunities and similar landscape requirements that can be solved jointly. </p><p>  Nevertheless, each person has a secret desire to belong to a certain layer and feel a certain selectivity: the shack and huts will not build the Mozhaisk expanse.  Characteristics of buildings provide for individual wishes of residents.  The convenience is that you don‚Äôt have to do the technical specifications on communication yourself - by the way, it‚Äôs cheaper than to stretch a pipe alone or buy and install a <span>gas distribution point</span> or a <span>transformer substation.</span>  All these concerns are shared between neighbors, construction participants. </p><h2>  Own </h2><p>  Details accompanying almost every purchase of land and real estate can sometimes ruin all previous dreams.  The owner must know exactly what belongs specifically to him, what is jointly owned by the participants in the DNP, and what will remain in the seller‚Äôs property.  First of all, these are common lands - access roads and so on.  Most often, they remain under the responsibility of the original owner of the land.  The most interesting thing is that, most likely, this will remain: either the common land with common infrastructure belongs to the seller, or transferred to DNP or some management company.  Most often, the owner will not only sell the land, but will also manage the entire complex further.  This will mean that all of the above grace - a children's and sports town, roads and even fish ponds - will remain in its charge. </p><p>  After all, the owner does not just want to sell the land - he probably also wants to manage this complex in the future.  This means that access roads and all other common lands (for example, a common children's town or a pond with carps, a barrier blocking entry into the village, video surveillance systems) remain in its ownership.  Neither roads, nor infrastructure, nor pipes, cables and wires will in any case become the property of an individual who has bought a plot in the Mozhaisk expanse DNP, the characteristics of the plots must be guaranteed, and this must be known from the very beginning.  The point is that each site is acquired in close interconnection with a common infrastructure system built on joint funds, and all further time will also be used together. </p>

    <h2>  Liabilities </h2><p>  You need to know that it is impossible to separate from the community.  Any education of this kind (DNT, DNP, or whatever else) necessarily leads its members, which means that you need to accept all its rules completely.  So, financial too.  Accordingly, before buying, you need to objectively evaluate not only your desires and opportunities, but also compare this with the hopes and expectations of your neighbors and other owners.  Plus, you need to very soberly assess all the opportunities in general that the Mozhaisk expanse has.  The characteristics of the village are simply excellent, but this does not mean that there will be no difficulties on the way to the new house.  The purchase decision must be balanced, the documents are carefully studied, and further life, that is, free time and free finance, is strictly regulated. </p><p>  The decision to purchase a plot is almost as difficult as getting married.  This is an equally long-term relationship, at least.  The association will certainly be created, and it will not work to abstract from it.  After acquiring a site, a person will comply with the laws of this partnership, even if he has not joined the ranks.  This means that financial expenses, if there is a decision of the general meeting, will have to be equally borne by everyone.  You can, of course, find as many like-minded people among your neighbors and punch or veto decisions, but this is very troublesome and does not always bring the desired result.  If relations with the neighbors in the village become strained, there are only two ways out: to put up with all the conditions and financial pressures or to leave forever, that is, to sell your dream house in the Mozhaisk expanse. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  Twenty kilometers from the city of Mozhaisk, not far from the villages of Denisyevo and Shalikovo, on the edge of the forest is the object of desire for many Muscovites, not even indigenous.  From the Moscow Ring Road this place is located at a distance of seventy-five kilometers along the Mozhaisk or Minsk highway.  This is the Mozhaisk expanse.  Photos clearly demonstrate how picturesque nature is here.  On the territory there are 193 different land plots - from nine to twenty-two hundred square meters.  You can choose a piece of land with your own access to the forest, or you can - in the field, to the water, on the shore of the canal. </p><p>  The cost of each site is also not the same, the price ranges from twenty to forty-five thousand rubles per hundred square meters.  You can live in the village year-round, such is the transport accessibility here.  Great ecology and the proximity of the "big water" - two reservoirs are located less than twenty kilometers away, huge forests with mushrooms and berries - all this characterizes the "Mozhaisk expanse" from the best side.  Reviews about the construction are already appearing on the relevant information resources, they most often note positive aspects: emerging infrastructure elements, electricity networks, road improvement, winter water supply. </p><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  Transport accessibility, judging by the reviews, is just excellent.  Not only is there a year-round convenient asphalt road to the cottage village, there is also the opportunity to visit the workplace in Moscow, daily by public transport.  The <span>Minsk highway</span> is eight hundred meters from the checkpoint, and this is a European-level highway, and in addition, an eight-minute walk from the village is the Shalikovo station, where independent trains will not depend on any traffic jams in the morning to Moscow and will be brought back in the evening to in the lap of nature you could rest from the hustle and bustle of the working day. </p><p>  In addition, you can work in Mozhaisk - its infrastructure is doubly developed.  Moreover, due to the proximity of this city, the Mozhaisk expanse DNP will not feel isolated from civilization, since this proximity makes it possible to receive qualified medical or other help on time, to use any social facilities, as well as cultural ones - the city is ancient, with a glorious history, and very beautiful.  There are hospitals, shops, institutes, banks, huge shopping and entertainment centers, cinemas and amazingly atmospheric museums. </p>

    <h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  Here you can buy not only an empty plot (without a contract), but also at the request of the buyer to build a house according to an individual project at a convenient time for him.  Recently, the owner changed in DNP.  They became the bank "Absolute".  Mozhaisk expanse still offers land.  The status of the plots is the same: the land assignment category is agricultural, that is, any type of summer house construction is allowed, but there are types that the status will change, and this will be IZHS (individual housing construction), with corresponding advantages of registration type and minuses - taxation.  However, there is already the right to erect a house.  Each section of the Mozhaisk expanse is equipped with a cadastral passport and a certificate of state registration of ownership.  A purchase and sale agreement is drawn up with the purchase of land, and after a short (twenty-one day) time the rights to the land will be confirmed by receipt of the relevant certificate. </p><p>  The infrastructure of a holiday village is worthy of a detailed listing. </p><ul><li>  There is a fence along the perimeter of the village, there is year-round security for the entire territory. </li><li>  Guest parking at the administrative building. </li><li>  Site for construction waste and household waste. </li><li>  Grocery store and gas distribution substation. </li><li>  Recreation areas in the forest area and on the canals. </li><li>  Children playground. </li><li>  Playground for adults. </li><li>  Electrification. </li><li>  Highway. </li></ul><h2>  Afterword </h2><p>  That‚Äôs almost all about the Mozhaisk expanse.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village is as much as seventy and a half hectares, and therefore all areas are different - for every taste.  You need to carefully look at those located in the lowlands, since a high rise in groundwater is possible if the river flowing through the territory can not cope with the seasonal level increases.  The entire <span>Mozhaisk district,</span> and in particular the location of the DNP, is not considered industrial in the Moscow region.  Here, clean air and clear water, rich forest and meadow grasses.  There are no existing enterprises near the cottage village and not a single landfill.  The standard of living from this point of view is very favorable, which is confirmed by numerous reviews. </p><p> Even the nearest highways are quite far from the checkpoint - at a distance of 750-800 meters, and the railway is separated from the village by a wide forest.  The place, however, is flat.  But coniferous forests protect the village from strong winds.  By any transport, including public, you can get to the reservoirs - both Ruzsky and Mozhaisk.  A walk (about a kilometer) to the village of Shalikovo, where there are a variety of shops.  Five kilometers away is the village of Sputnik, where a school, a kindergarten, and all kinds of shops function.  The cottage settlement "Mozhayskoye expanse" is fertile land for the future garden, a cozy house you dreamed about, and a maximum of an hour and a half to the center of Moscow by rail. </p>
