  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Making a simple origami - dragon's claws</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, some people believe that origami claws came up after watching the movie "People X", impressed by the formidable, heroic and damn romantic way of Wolverines.  However, this is not so: people knew how to make paper claws for a long time.  Of course, in fact, these are not Wolverine's claws at all and not even Freddy Krueger's deadly manicure.  These are just the claws of an ordinary dragon, which is so revered in China.  But be that as it may, let‚Äôs try now in a popular way to explain <span>how to make origami</span> claws, which will probably come in handy for some kind of masquerade one day. </p><p>  So, we take a regular rectangular sheet of paper and bend it diagonally so that we get such an isosceles triangle with a rectangular excess.  Usually, using this method, a square sheet is made from a rectangular sheet, trimming the excess.  But to make origami claws, we need this surplus.  So, wrapped up.  The resulting triangle is folded again, connecting the top with its right corner.  Keep in mind that a narrow rectangular excess remains visible and untouched for the time being.  After folding, we got a figure, in silhouette similar to a tent or a house. </p><p>  To make it more convenient to further claws origami, turn our "tent" upside down, that is, the "roof" down (not backwards, but as if clockwise).  Now we take up the rectangular not cut off excess: we bend corners on it so that their base coincides with the base of our inverted ‚Äúroof‚Äù, that is, very slightly.  At the base, we bend the rectangles with the corners turned inward.  We got the triangle again, but already full.  From the top of the triangle we mentally draw a straight line down, this will be our imaginary axis, which divides the triangle in half.  And now we connect the left side of the triangle with this axis.  Next, wrap the same left side in the same way again.  You will get a figure similar to the arrowhead, but the left half of the figure will turn out with a small pocket.  We fold the ‚Äúarrow‚Äù in half, and bend its upper corner inward and put it into this pocket.  The claw is ready.  It remains only to put it on your finger.  But we don‚Äôt put our finger in the pocket, but in the upper part of the longer side of the claw, we can say from the end. </p><p>  Now, knowing the basic principle of how to make origami claws, you can take for the rest, because they need as many as ten.  And in addition to them, you can easily and simply build a paper gun.  To do this, we again take a rectangular sheet and, with the usual gesture, bend it obliquely to cut off the lower rectangular part to obtain a square.  But do not discard the cut-off part, it will come in handy.  In the meantime, take the main sheet that you just made, put it at any angle to you, and begin to roll it into a fairly tight roll.  When you completely roll up the entire sheet, bend the resulting tube in half and set aside for now. </p><p>  Now take a rectangular piece and fold it along.  Next, grab both edges and connect them together so that you get a twisted loop.  To make it clearer, just connect the two tails, and twist the middle.  Thus, you have the future grip in your hand.  With your second hand, take a roll folded in half (‚Äúdouble barrel‚Äù) and thread it into the loop of the ‚Äúhandle‚Äù so that the handle is between the muzzle.  Pull the handle to the very end, and then push the tails into the loops and tighten the paper knot.  The gun is ready, you can shoot it. </p><p>  As you can see, there is nothing complicated in the art of folding <span>toys from paper</span> .  Of course, there are more sophisticated crafts that require perseverance and dexterity of fingers, but for such fun as a gun or nails of origami it takes only a few minutes. </p>
