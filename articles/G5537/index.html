    <h2>  What are irrigation systems? </h2><p>  Irrigation, or irrigation, is a special way of supplying water to lands sown by different crops in order to increase moisture reserves at the roots and, accordingly, increase soil fertility and accelerate the growth and maturation of crops.  This is one of the types of land reclamation. </p><h2>  Irrigation methods </h2><p>  In the modern world, there are several ways to irrigate the land: </p><ol><li>  Watering takes place on special furrows in the ground, where water is supplied through a pump or from an irrigation canal. </li><li>  Spraying - water is dispersed in the area from the laid pipes. </li><li>  Aerosol system - using the smallest drops of water, the surface layer of the atmosphere is cooled, thereby creating favorable conditions for plant growth. </li><li>  Intrasoil irrigation - water is supplied to the root zone of crops underground. </li><li>  Estuary irrigation - irrigation occurs once in the spring with the help of local water. </li><li>  Sprinkler system - here, irrigation occurs using a self-propelled system that uses the accumulated rainwater. </li></ol><p>  All these systems have been modernized and improved by man.  New technologies and methods were invented and introduced.  But the irrigation system in ancient Egypt was born in the least mechanized form.  It happened before our era. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How did the first irrigation system work? </h2><p>  The very first irrigation <span>farming system</span> in the world was invented at the foot of the Nile River.  People began to notice that when the Nile spills, it brings water and sludge to the sown areas, which contribute to the accelerated growth of plants and increased yield. </p><p>  Even then, people began to lay special channels and drainage drains to the land plots.  Thanks to this, the water during the spill did not just flood the entire area, but flowed exactly where it was needed. </p><p>  Also, over time, people began to dig out special reservoirs where water could be stored and used a little later for irrigation or other purposes, since it is known that rains could be expected for a long time, and the Nile was the only source of water. </p>

    <p>  The irrigation system of Ancient Egypt was called the basin type system.  And it‚Äôs called just that, because water flowed through the canals surrounding the land allotment.  And access to cultures was opened to her when it was necessary.  It so happened that when access was open, the land was flooded with water and looked like a pool.  When, according to farmers, the field was saturated with moisture in sufficient volume, the water descended through a special waste channel.  At first, water was discharged wherever necessary - to neighboring fields.  But soon the system was improved, and the water returned to the canals, where it came from. </p><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History of irrigation systems </h2><p>  Irrigation systems were also widely used in the countries of the Ancient East - Mesopotamia, China, and <span>Near East.</span> </p>

    <p>  Very often, these countries were attacked, and irrigation systems became the subject of exploitation, slowing down the development of the state.  Despite this, people still revived them and continued to improve. </p><p>  Over time, people began to divert channels from the riverbeds and retain water using the first primitive dams and dams.  In view of this, it was possible to irrigate the fields on time during the entire period of crop ripening. </p><h2>  The use of irrigation systems in the modern world </h2><p>  In the modern world, the concept of irrigation system is used not only for agriculture.  Not many people know, but there is such a narrow concept as ‚Äúoral irrigation‚Äù.  Yes, the term ‚Äúirrigation‚Äù is also used in medicine, in particular in dentistry. </p><p>  In this area of ‚Äã‚Äãmedicine there is such a device as a physiological dispenser.  This device can be used in maxillofacial surgery, endodontics, as well as in implantology. </p><p>  Irrigation systems for the physiological dispenser are special tubes with which, during and after all procedures, the oral cavity is rinsed with a special medical solution or with a stream of clean water. </p><p>  Among the drugs that can be used for irrigation in dentistry, the most common are furatsilin, <span>sodium hypochlorite,</span> chlorophyllipt, as well as herbal decoctions. </p>

    <p>  The fluid is supplied to such a system under pressure from 2 to 10 atmospheres, due to which it cleans the oral cavity from small fragments, disinfects, and also performs the massage function of the gums. </p><p>  Irrigation systems in dentistry are an actual technology, since this is an indispensable thing in the work of a doctor, as well as ensuring the health of the patient's teeth and gums. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Thus, it is worth noting that irrigation systems are still a great discovery, since they are used everywhere in the world.  Many did not even know that today the irrigation system is not only a field irrigation system, but also a necessary thing used in oral medicine - dentistry. </p>
