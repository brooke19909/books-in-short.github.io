  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Victory Park of Saratov. Crane Flight Over Falcon Mountain</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Victory Park in Saratov, opened in memory of fellow countrymen who died during the Great Patriotic War, is known primarily for the ‚ÄúCranes‚Äù memorial.  Created by three great people, <span>Rasul Gamzatov,</span> Ian Frenkel and Mark Bernes, the song about white birds soaring into the sky inspired artists, poets and sculptors to create new, heart-wrenching works. </p><h2>  Park bookmark </h2><p>  On the outskirts of Saratov there is a high mountain, which has always attracted attention.  It offers a panorama not only of this city, but also of neighboring Engels.  Photographers and artists have long chosen her for work, so the views from her can often be found in paintings and postcards.  During the war years, Sokolovaya Mountain was always the height beyond which fierce battles fought.  It was here that 80 hectares of land were to become Victory Park.  Saratov supported this idea. </p><p>  It should be noted right away that all the work was carried out on a voluntary basis: project competitions were organized, the townspeople went to subbotniks to clear the place, a truly national construction was carried out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Viewpoint" class="if uuid-2944409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2944409.jpg"></div><p>  The stone at the installation site of the future memorial was laid in April 1975, but work to create a park zone did not stand still.  Paths were laid, lighting was installed, trees and shrubs were planted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Monument "Cranes" </h2><p>  The work of Yu. I. Menyakin was recognized as the best monument project on Sokolovaya Gora.  Laureate of the State Prize, front-line soldier, he felt with his soul what a memorial should be, causing both pain and pride for fellow countrymen - soldiers in the Victory Park of Saratov. </p><p>  For three years, work was done to create the composition.  According to eyewitnesses, Yuri Ivanovich himself chose the installation site of "Cranes" in order to provide the best overview, he designed and calculated the size of the stele and birds, and monitored their manufacture at the local factory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turisticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex Cranes" class="if uuid-2944405" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2944405.jpg"></div><p>  On May 9, 1982, the monument was inaugurated, and the cranes soared into the sky.  At an altitude of 40 meters, a three-section slender stele is pierced by a bird wedge of 12 cranes.  From a height of flight, they see the Victory Park of Saratov and the whole city.  And they can also be seen almost everywhere. </p><p>  There is a viewing platform around the stele, where you can spend a lot of time.  And in order to climb it, you need to go along the steps collected in five spans.  Each span is a year of war.  Rising, you read the names of the cities that were liberated that year with the participation of the Saratovites.  On the first flights, native Soviet cities, and on the last - European capitals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In front of the stairs is the Fountain of Tears.  Its jets slowly roll off a granite rectangular stone and go down.  On the perimeter - the city of the Saratov region, where fighters went to the front. </p><h2>  Museums of military glory and military equipment </h2><p>  At the same time as the monument in the Victory Park of Saratov, a museum of military glory was opened.  Materials tell about fellow heroes.  Famous and not very, they all accomplished a feat.  At first, the collection belonged to the local history museum of the city, but since 1999 it gained independence.  Until 2005, at noon on Sokolova Gora the gun was fired as a tribute to the fallen soldiers.  But at the request of the residents, they had to refuse shots. </p><p>  In the open air there is a museum of military equipment.  There are familiar exhibits here, and there are rare ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gtrk-saratov.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hospital train" class="if uuid-2944397" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2944397.jpg"></div><p>  A sanitary armored train carrying wounded soldiers to the rear stands on rails.  In order for more people to be transported in one flight, seating and lying places were arranged for the wounded of varying severity.  There is an operating room for emergency care, and a dressing room. </p><p>  Shown in the museum and post-war technology, such as the Yak-38.  This is a vertical takeoff attack aircraft, and it was made in Saratov.  You can go to the museum of technology for a long time, because it's interesting. </p><p>  How to get to Victory Park in Saratov? </p><p>  Shuttle taxis and buses go to Sokolova Gora from different areas of the city.  Stop "Victory Park".  It should be noted that the climb uphill from the stop is quite long. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="51.5442373" data-lng="46.04957890000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/2/0/1/11201.png"></div><p>  Upstairs to the complex are tourist buses and taxis.  So you can choose what is more convenient for everyone. </p>
