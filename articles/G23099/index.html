Principles and laws of discipline</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The discipline "Pedagogy" has a clear distinction between theoretical knowledge and practice, as well as between ordinary ideas and scientific generalizations.  The latter include: concepts and main categories of pedagogy;  principles and laws of this discipline.  Consider in more detail the main provisions. </p><p>  At the stage of the formation of discipline as a science, three main categories of pedagogy were identified. </p><p>  Education is a social phenomenon, which refers to the transfer of cultural and historical experience accumulated by mankind to subsequent generations.  In this process, the child enters the world of culture.  In the narrow sense refers to education under the formation of the individual child's social environment (family and educational institutions), its philosophy, ethics, morality and <span>value orientations.</span>  The main goal should be to encourage him to self-education. </p><p>  The main categories of pedagogy also include training.  In a broad sense, it is understood as the transfer of theoretical knowledge and skills, as well as the formation of practical skills in the educational process in all subjects.  In the narrow sense, we are talking about the activities of a teacher who conducts academic discipline and transfers knowledge, skills. </p><p>  The main categories of pedagogy are interconnected.  They are aimed at the <span>development of personal</span> and activity characteristics of the child, which are formed on the basis of his interests, acquired knowledge and skills, as well as skills.  In this case, we are talking about education, the third category, which is most often interpreted as the result of a single process of education and training. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These are the basic concepts of pedagogy that are studied in its framework. </p><p>  Let us dwell in more detail on the basic principles and laws of this discipline. </p><p>  Firstly, there is a connection between education and the <span>social system,</span> since its nature will depend on specific historical conditions. </p><p>  Secondly, there is a connection between education and training, as mentioned above. </p><p>  Thirdly, education is closely related to activities.  To educate and educate, you need to include the child in a variety of activities. </p><p>  Fourth, there is an interaction between the education and activity of the child himself.  It will be successful if the object gradually becomes the subject of this process, showing active behavior, independence and will.  The child must be aware of the need for activity and, most importantly, the need for it. </p><p>  Fifth, there is a connection between education and communication.  For optimal results, you need the interaction of people: children, teachers, parents and others.  We need rich interpersonal relationships and a favorable psychological atmosphere in the environment of the child. </p><p>  The discipline "Pedagogy" has several branches.  Each of them has its own <span>conceptual apparatus</span> and methodological base.  In more detail in this article we will consider the main categories of social pedagogy. </p><ul><li>  Socialization, which includes the assimilation of the norms, rules and principles of a given society. </li><li>  Parenting.  It is understood as the formation of skills necessary for life in society. </li><li>  <span>Socio-pedagogical process.</span>  It is considered not only from the point of view of pedagogy, but also social psychology. </li><li>  <span>Social adaptation</span> and maladaptation processes.  This branch of pedagogy pays great attention to their study when it comes to the transition of the child to new conditions of training and education. </li><li>  Social correction and re-education are important when it is necessary to correct stereotypes and habits of behavior that are considered incorrect from the point of view of social norms and principles. </li></ul>
