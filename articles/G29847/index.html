  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best 40-inch TVs: description, specifications, rating and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Customers <span>rated the best</span> 40-inch <span>TVs from</span> Samsung and Panasonic, Vizio, Hisense, and TCL.  Before buying a TV, it is important to understand what a good 40-inch screen is.  Does the buyer need a smart TV or smart TV with Wi-Fi to watch streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix and YouTube?  Is there a sufficient number of HDMI ports in the package that corresponds to the number of devices that need to be connected in the house?  To take everything into account, you need to familiarize yourself with the selection of the best 40-inch TVs. </p><h2>  What do you need to know beforehand? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.hdtvtest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Purchase what you need to know beforehand" class="if uuid-2663995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2663995.jpg"></div><p>  There are several key points to keep in mind when deciding which 40-inch TV is best.  The user will not feel the benefits of 2160p resolutions if he watches TV from a long distance.  To get the effect, you may have to rearrange the furniture and move the sofa a little closer.  The lack of a large physical size inevitably affects the sound, so choosing a powerful soundbar will bring dividends to the buyer as sound. </p><p>  It is believed that in this category of TV users do not see the difference between Full HD and Ultra HD.  This is a common misconception.  If the customer looks at the <span>High Dynamic Range</span> picture <span>,</span> he will see the difference.  Experienced sellers recommend choosing the best 40-inch TVs with 4K Ultra-HD and HDR.  They are not standard for this screen size due to the increased cost, but if you are serious about video, 4K is vital, although the choice is up to the buyer. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When choosing a TV, the first parameter that everyone pays attention to is the diagonal of the screen.  A large TV looks great in the living room, but you should also pay attention to other functions of the device.  In this case, big does not mean good.  A number of solutions and additional functions offered by manufacturers may make the user dizzy from an excess of information.  What options should you choose when buying a 40-inch TV? </p><h2>  Software platform </h2><div class="photo" data-original="worldtechpedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Software platform" class="if uuid-2664015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2664015.jpg"></div><p>  After the buyer has decided what content he will watch, it is time to choose a software platform that should provide smart TV.  Manufacturers such as Samsung, LG, and Panasonic use proprietary smart TV software.  Sony mainly endorses Google‚Äôs Android TV, and TCL's low-end brand relies on Roku software. </p><p>  However, the platform should not really be the main factor in the choice.  All smart TV platforms offer similar features, including access to large applications such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube.  40-inch TVs in the past have not always come with a smart TV operating system.  These stupid televisions were incredibly cheap, and so it was easy to buy.  But a problem arose as Netflix and YouTube became more and more popular, people wanted to get their services on their TV without resorting to streaming video devices such as Roku, Amazon Fire TV or Chromecast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  These days, it's pretty easy to find a good smart TV among the best 40-inch TVs.  But ideally, the buyer is looking for a well-supported operating system such as Roku TV, LG's webOS or Samsung Tizen operating system.  If you use an exclusive operating system for a specific TV, then in the future such a TV may have serious problems. </p><p>  When it comes to connectivity, many people do not pay attention to this fact, but it may turn out to be important in the future.  It will be very inconvenient if the new TV has only one HDMI port.  Having more of these ports, including RCA connectors and an optical audio output option, can help connect more devices in the home and make TV more fully utilized.  It will not be very good when the user has to constantly switch between cables every time if you need to change the input of the receiver. </p><h2>  Optimal resolution </h2><p>  Just like for a laptop or smartphone, the resolution of the TV refers to the number of dots or pixels that make up the screen.  The more pixels, the sharper the screen.  Screen size also affects sharpness, because the same number of pixels on a large display will not look so clear.  In 2018, the vast majority of sets have a resolution of 3840 by 2160 pixels, a size better known as 4K. </p><p>  Some companies use the term Ultra HD instead, but this is essentially the same.  If you purchase a small TV, say, less than 40 inches, then you should not invest in 4K resolution, because this simply will not be noticeable.  However, for something more, 4K is the current gold standard.  While 8K is only "on the way" to the buyer and will not be soon on the market.  Therefore, the best 40-inch TVs with 4K resolution will please the user for many years to come. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display technology </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.4ktvcomparison.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Display technology" class="if uuid-2664003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2664003.jpg"></div><p>  Today‚Äôs television screens rely on two competing technologies: the ubiquitous LED LCD and the more expensive OLED.  Trying to say which one is best can be challenging, especially because manufacturers add their own settings and proprietary technologies on top of each platform.  In addition, as both technologies continue to evolve, they improve their strengths and minimize weaknesses.  Both types of screens use LEDs for lighting, but in different ways. </p><p>  An LED LCD, white LED, or LED pixels are used as backlight to form an image through a liquid crystal display or LCD filter.  LEDs usually cover the entire screen, but cheaper sets sometimes limit them to just the edges of the display.  LED LCDs are generally sharper than OLEDs, and they also provide more natural control of the light on the screen. </p><p>  On the other hand, an organic LED or OLED screens let in the backlight and instead individual pixels light up one by one using electric current.  This allows the screen to respond faster to input changes.  In addition, since the black pixel is turned off completely and not obscured, OLED displays tend to have better contrast than LED LCDs.  Finally, they are more expensive to manufacture, which usually leads to higher costs for the best 40 and 43 inch televisions. </p><p>  Sometimes the common attributes of LED LCDs and OLED screens can provide additional innovation from TV manufacturers in the form of paired technology.  Samsung‚Äôs Quantum Dot technology, for example, makes LED LCD screens clean, just like OLED displays.  Thanks to these changes, the best LED LCD panels and the best OLED devices stand the same.  To really feel the difference between the screens, it is better to make a trip to the nearest electronics store and test them with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Sound and Wireless </h2><p>  Speakers are the main victim of thin TVs.  <span>The best</span> 40-inch <span>budget televisions</span> come with two 10 W (RMS) loudspeakers, which typically consume more than 70% of the power.  If you need high-quality sound, it is recommended to invest in a home theater or a separate speaker system.  Before that, you need to check whether the TV has an optical or SPDIF / coaxial audio output, ideal for multi-channel connection.  If a TV with these ports is not affordable for the buyer, you can use the more common 3.5 mm audio jack (headphones), to which most models connect. </p><p>  Connecting to the Internet on a TV has several advantages: you can access multimedia content, save a tab on your social networks, and in some cases even make video calls.  First, you will need to check whether the TV has built-in Wi-Fi or supports external USB keys for connection.  This will allow you to connect your home Wi-Fi network and streaming audio / video content on the TV.  Most smart TVs come with DLNA or Miracast support, which allows you to stream video from your smartphone / tablet directly to the TV. </p><h2>  Matrix type </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.edn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Matrix type" class="if uuid-2664051" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2664051.jpg"></div><p>  An important aspect when choosing the technical characteristics of the best televisions 40 and 43 inches is the type of matrix.  In LCD TVs, you can find two types of matrices: VA and IPS.  The first of them - the VA matrix - is characterized by a higher contrast, a little deeper than black, and a shorter reaction time compared to the IPS solution.  The disadvantage of this technology is the attenuation of colors when viewed at an angle.  When it comes to IPS technology, there are deeper colors and wider viewing angles.  The disadvantages of the IPS solution are generally relatively less contrast compared to VA. </p><p>  Manufacturers rarely provide publicly available detailed specifications in which we can only find the type of matrix used.  On LG TVs, we usually find the IPS solutions mentioned above.  The company is the largest manufacturer.  VA matrices are most often found in Samsung devices.  When choosing a specific TV model, you also need to pay attention to a number of additional functions. </p><p>  Currently, the most interesting solution that extends the capabilities of the device is the Smart TV function, thanks to which the TV will be transformed into a kind of multimedia center that provides the ability to browse websites, use e-mail and social networks.  Another aspect is the energy efficiency of the device.  Currently, the basis of energy is the energy class A +.  It is worth paying attention to this parameter, especially when the TV works for many hours a day. </p><p>  In accordance with these indicators, the models won the highest customer loyalty rating of 2018 <em>.</em> </p><h2>  The leader of the rating - Samsung UE40MU6120 </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fortsa.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Series" class="if uuid-2664076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73564/2664076.jpg"></div><p>  The best 40-inch smart TVs - the Samsung UE40MU6120 6-Series with 4K display - offer everything you need for an inexpensive receiver.  It has a resolution of 2160p, has all the key television services that the user wants to receive, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube.

HDR10 and HLG, EX700 uses Bright Panel technology to improve contrast and color saturation.  A vibrant HDR amplifier is available to add dynamic pizzazz.  A metal frame with adjustable legs, which can be located in the middle or along the edges, is installed in the kit. </p><p>  The device has three 4K-ready HDMI, three USB devices and an old AV input for connecting Sega Dreamcast.  The smart platform is Panasonic‚Äôs My Home Screen 2.0, which combines a deceptively simple user interface with all key streaming services, including Netflix, Amazon Video, and YouTube in 4K.

Sony has brought HDR compatibility to the world of 1080p TV to help gamers.
