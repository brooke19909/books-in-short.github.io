    <h2>  Background of the Chechen wars </h2><p>  The Caucasus has always been a very difficult region for Russia.  Questions of nationality, religion, culture have always been raised very sharply and resolved in far from peaceful ways. </p><p>  After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the influence of the separatists increased in the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic due to national and religious hostility, as a result of which the Republic of Ichkeria was self-proclaimed.  She entered into a confrontation with Russia. </p><p>  In November 1991, Boris Yeltsin, then president of Russia, issued a decree "On the imposition of a state of emergency on the territory of the Chechen-Ingush Republic."  But this decree was not supported by the Supreme Council of Russia, in view of the fact that the majority of the seats there were occupied by opponents of Yeltsin. </p><p>  In 1992, on March 3, Dzhokhar Dudaev announced that he would negotiate only when Chechnya gained full independence.  A few days later, on the twelfth, the Chechen parliament adopted a new constitution, self-proclaiming the country a secular independent state. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Almost immediately, all government buildings, all military bases, all strategically important facilities were seized.  The territory of Chechnya has completely come under the control of the separatists.  From that moment, legal centralized power ceased to exist.  The situation got out of control: arms and human trafficking flourished, drug trafficking took place on the territory, bandits robbed the population (especially Slavic). </p><p>  In June 1993, soldiers from the personal guard of Dudaev seized the parliament building in Grozny, and Dudaev himself proclaimed the emergence of "sovereign Ichkeria" - a state that he completely controlled. </p><p>  A year later, the First Chechen (1994-1996) will begin, which will usher in a series of wars and conflicts, which have become perhaps the most bloody and cruel in the entire territory of the former Soviet Union. </p>

    <h2>  First Chechen: beginning </h2><p>  In 1994, on the eleventh of December, Russian troops entered three territories in Chechnya.  One came from the west, through North Ossetia, another one - through Mozdok, and the third group - from the territory of Dagestan.  Initially, the command was entrusted to Eduard Vorobiev, but he refused and resigned, referring to the complete unpreparedness of this operation.  Later, the operation in Chechnya will be led by Anatoly Kvashnin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of the three groups, only the "Mozdok" group was able to successfully exit to Grozny on December 12th - the remaining two were blocked in different parts of Chechnya by local residents and partisan militant groups.  A few days later, and the remaining two groups of Russian troops approached Grozny and blocked it from all sides, with the exception of the southern direction.  Until the beginning of the assault from this side, access to the city will be free for militants, this later influenced the siege of Grozny with federal waxes. </p><h2>  The storming of Grozny </h2><p>  On December 31, 1994, the assault began, which claimed many lives of Russian soldiers and remained one of the most tragic episodes in Russian history.  About three hundred units of armored vehicles entered Grozny from three sides, which was almost powerless in the conditions of street battles.  There was a poor connection between the companies, which prevented the coordination of joint actions. </p><p>  Russian troops got stuck in the streets of the city, constantly falling under the crossfire of militants.  The battalion of the Maikop brigade, which advanced farthest to the city center, was surrounded and was almost completely destroyed along with its commander, Colonel Savin.  According to the results of two days of fighting, the battalion of the Petrakuvsk motorized rifle regiment, which went to the Maykopers to the rescue, totaled about thirty percent of the initial squad. </p><p>  By early February, the number of storming was increased to seventy thousand people, but the assault on the city continued.  Only on February 3rd was Grozny blocked from the south and taken into the ring. </p><p>  On March sixth, part of the last detachments of the Chechen separatists was killed, another left the city.  Grozny remained under the control of Russian troops.  In fact, little was left of the city - both sides actively used artillery and armored vehicles, so Grozny was almost in ruins. </p><p>  In the rest of <span>Chechnya,</span> local battles between Russian troops and militant units continued uninterruptedly.  In addition, the militants prepared and carried out a number of <span>attacks: in Budennovsk</span> (June 1995), in Kizlyar (January 1996).  In March 1996, militants attempted to recapture Grozny, but the assault was repelled by Russian soldiers.  And <span>on April 21,</span> Dudaev was eliminated. </p><p>  In August, the militants repeated their attempt to take Grozny, this time she succeeded.  Many important objects in the city were blocked by separatists, Russian troops suffered very large losses.  Together with Grozny, the militants took Gudermes and Argun.  The Khasavyurt agreement was signed on August 31, 1996 - The first Chechen war ended with huge losses for Russia. </p>

    <h2>  Human casualties in the First Chechen war </h2><p>  The data, depending on which side is counting, varies.  Actually, this is not surprising and always has been.  Therefore, all options are provided below. </p><p>  Losses in the Chechen war (table No. 1 according to the headquarters of the Russian troops): </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Russian side </td><td>  Chechen separatists </td></tr><tr><td>  Killed </td><td>  4103 or 5042 </td><td>  17391 </td></tr><tr><td>  Injured </td><td>  19794 or 16098 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Gone </td><td>  1231 or 510 </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Two figures in each column, which indicate the loss of Russian troops - these are two headquarters investigations that were conducted with a difference of a year. </p><p>  According to the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers, the consequences of the Chechen war are completely different.  About fourteen thousand people are called there killed. </p><p>  Losses in the Chechen war (table No. 2) of militants according to Ichkeria and a human rights organization: </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  According to the headquarters of the Chechen units </td><td>  Human Rights Organization "Memorial" </td></tr><tr><td>  3800 or 2870 </td><td>  no more than 2700 fighters </td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Among the civilian population, Memorial put forward a figure of 30-40 thousand people, and Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation A. I. Lebed - 80 000. </p><h2>  The second Chechen: main events </h2><p>  Even after the signing of peace agreements, calmer in Chechnya did not.  The militants were all in charge, there was a brisk trade in drugs and weapons, people were kidnapped and killed.  On the border between Dagestan and Chechnya, it was alarming. </p><p>  After a series of abductions of large businessmen, officers, and journalists, it became clear that the continuation of the conflict in a more acute phase is simply inevitable.  Moreover, since April <span>1999,</span> small groups of militants began to probe the weak spots of the defense of the Russian troops, preparing for the invasion of Dagestan.  The invasion operation was led by Basayev and Khattab.  The place where the militants planned to strike was in the mountainous zone of Dagestan.  It combined the small number of Russian troops with the inconvenient location of roads along which you can‚Äôt transfer reinforcements very quickly.  On August 7, 1999, militants crossed the border. </p><p>  The main striking force of the bandits was mercenaries and Islamists from al-Qaeda.  For almost a month, fighting continued with varying success, but finally the militants were thrown back to Chechnya.  Along with this, the bandits carried out a number of terrorist attacks in various cities of Russia, including Moscow. </p><p>  As a retaliatory measure, a powerful shelling of Grozny began on September 23, and a week later Russian troops entered Chechnya. </p>

    <h2>  Human casualties in the Second Chechen war among Russian troops </h2><p>  The situation changed, and the Russian troops now dominated.  But many mothers did not wait for their sons. </p><p>  Losses in the Chechen war (table No. 3): </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Official data for September 2008 (for the Second Chechen) </td><td>  New investigation of the Headquarters of the RF Armed Forces and data for April 2010 (for the Second Chechen) </td></tr><tr><td>  Slain </td><td>  4572 </td><td>  more than 6000 </td></tr><tr><td>  The wounded </td><td>  15549 </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  In June 2010, the Commander-in-Chief of the Ministry of Internal Affairs <span>Nikolai Rogozhkin</span> cited the following figures: 2,984 dead and about 9,000 wounded. </p><h2>  Militant losses </h2><p>  Losses in the Chechen war (table No. 4): </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  According to Russia </td><td>  According to fighters </td></tr><tr><td>  Slain </td><td>  13517 or more 15000 </td><td>  3600 </td></tr><tr><td>  The wounded </td><td>  about 7000 </td><td>  1500 (as of April 2000) </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Civilian casualties </h2><p>  According to officially confirmed data, in February 2001 over a thousand civilians died.  In the book of S. V. Ryazantsev, ‚ÄúDemographic and Migration Portrait of the North Caucasus,‚Äù the losses of the parties to the Chechen war of five thousand people are mentioned, although this is already about 2003. </p><p>  Judging by the assessment of Amnesty International, which calls itself non-governmental and objective, the death toll among the civilian population was about twenty-five thousand people.  They can count for a long time and diligently, only to the question: "How many actually died in the Chechen war?"  - hardly anyone will give an intelligible answer. </p>

    <h2>  The outcome of the war: peace conditions, the restoration of Chechnya </h2><p>  While the Chechen war was going on, we did not even consider the loss of equipment, enterprises, land, any resources and everything else, because people always remain the main ones.  But the war ended, Chechnya remained part of Russia, and the need arose to restore the republic from virtually ruins. </p><p>  Huge money was allocated to the <span>capital of the republic</span> - Grozny.  After several assaults, whole buildings were almost gone, and at the moment it is a large and beautiful city. </p><p>  The economy of the republic was also raised artificially - it was necessary to give time for the population to get used to the new realities, for new factories and farms to be rebuilt.  They needed roads, communication lines, electricity.  Today we can say that the republic has almost completely overcome the crisis. </p><h2>  Chechen wars: reflected in films, books </h2><p>  Dozens of films were shot on the events that took place in Chechnya.  Many books have been released.  It is now impossible to understand where the fictions are, and where the real horrors of the war are.  The Chechen war (as well as the war in Afghanistan) claimed too many lives and went on a skating rink for a whole generation, therefore simply could not remain unnoticed.  Russia's losses in the Chechen wars are colossal, and, according to some researchers, the losses are even greater than in the ten years of the war in Afghanistan.  Below is a list of films that show us most deeply the tragic events of the Chechen campaigns. </p><ul><li>  a documentary from the five episodes of the Chechen Trap; </li><li>  "Purgatory"; </li><li>  "Cursed and forgotten"; </li><li>  "Prisoner of the Caucasus". </li></ul><p>  Many fiction and journalistic books describe events in Chechnya.  As part of the Russian forces, for example, the famous writer Zakhar Prilepin, who wrote the novel Pathology, specifically about this war, fought.  The writer and publicist Konstantin Semenov published a series of stories "Grozny Tales" (about the storming of the city) and the novel "Our Motherland Betrayed Us".  The storming of Grozny is dedicated to the novel by Vyacheslav Mironov "I was in this war." </p><p>  The videos that were made in Chechnya by rock musician Yuri Shevchuk are widely known.  He and his DDT group performed in Chechnya more than once in front of Russian soldiers in Grozny and at military bases. </p>
