    <p>  Not so long ago, sports bracelets appeared on the international market.  A stylish accessory may well become your incentive for playing sports.  Garmin Vivofit products, which I would like to review, are especially popular. </p><h2>  Bracelet design </h2><p>  This model can be used as a bracelet or as a watch.  Girls most often choose devices of bright shades, for example blue, purple or green, and men prefer gray or <span>black.</span>  The original device looks very simple and resembles an <span>electronic clock</span> that was relevant even in school times. </p><p>  The Garmin Vivofit strap is made of high quality and one-piece rubber.  Its coating is made in such a way that the product is protected from fingerprints or other contaminants.  Cleaning the product will not cause inconvenience.  Two straps are included in the kit, one of which is designed for a man, and the second for a woman. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The device block is removable and easy to remove if necessary, but the design of the product allows you to securely lock it before use, so you can‚Äôt lose the bracelet during sports.  The unit has one button for installation.  The strap lock is made of plastic as a separate part. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Garmin Vivofit Review" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21909/476660.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Convenience </h2><p>  The male strap is longer than the female, in which even the holes have their origin a little earlier.  Garmin Vivofit bracelet gives a lot of pleasant sensations during use.  It should be borne in mind that convenience is an individual moment, depending on the width of the hand.  Sometimes it happens that the strap does not fit the potential owner.  If you conduct a social survey regarding Garmin Vivofit, reviews most often affect the weight of the device, because 25 grams is imperceptible.  Users forget that they wear a bracelet.  Due to the number of holes, the device can be adjusted based on the size of the hand. </p><h2>  Device block </h2><p>  When considering a Garmin Vivofit, a block review should be done first.  The item has a miniature size.  The display occupies the bulk of the outside.  The most interesting thing is that the small device has a sufficiently large <span>screen, the dimensions of</span> which are 25 by 10 millimeters.  The LCD does not have a built-in backlight on the reflective substrate, otherwise more energy would be required.  The mirror substrate contributes to the smooth reading of information regardless of the time of day, only a minimal amount of light is enough.  Garmin Vivofit data can be taken at any time, and two batteries (CR1632) are replaced once a year.  On the back there are 4 small cogs.  Despite the fact that such a replacement is considered frequent compared to a regular watch, it should be remembered that the Garmin Vivofit is a training computer that supports Bluetooth Smart technology.  The device consumes a small amount of energy, therefore it can work for a year even with active daily use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Synchronization </h2><p>  There are no interface ports in the Garmin Vivofit Bundle, so sharing it with other equipment is possible in one of the following ways: </p><p>  1. With a computer or laptop using the Garmin ANT + device, which comes with the device. </p><p>  2. With smartphones or tablet using Bluetooth Smart.  Unfortunately, only some Apple products support this feature, for example, the iPhone (from the 4S model) and the Samsung brand <span>(Galaxy S3, S4</span> and Note 2 or 3). </p><p>  There is an opportunity to buy Garmin Vivofit complete with a monitor where the heart rate is displayed.  Thus, another function will appear - the heart rate monitor.  In this case, the device collects information continuously, and not by request.  The monitor is connected to the Garmin Vivofit using ANT +, without any configuration required. </p>

    <h2>  Multifunctional use </h2><p>  Moisture protection is another advantage of this model.  This quality of the device allows you to use it at a depth of 50 meters.  Even heavy rain is not able to harm the Garmin Vivofit.  This all expands the scope of the device.  Swimmers do not take it off their hands while swimming, divers use it while exploring <span>the seabed,</span> and ordinary users can take a shower without having to remove the bracelet.  You can use the device while practicing all kinds of sports, which makes it popular. </p><h2>  Device features </h2><p>  On the Garmin Vivofit screen, there is one button that you need to switch information.  A miniature indicator instantly indicates the data that is currently being displayed.  The device will accurately show the number of steps you have completed in the last day.  You can independently set the desired amount and see how much is left to the desired goal.  If you enter your exact height, age, and weight into your device, Garmin Connect software calculates the number of steps you need to complete in a day. </p>

    <p>  The user can do the same, using kilometers as a measure of the length of the distance. </p><p>  By purchasing Garmin Vivofit, you eliminate the need to calculate how many calories are spent on your own.  Now the device will do everything for you. <br>  Many people use the device as a watch, since the display shows the exact time. </p><h2>  A few nuances </h2><p>  You need to talk about the degree of accuracy of the bracelet.  Immediately worth mentioning the accuracy of Garmin Vivofit calculations.  Expert reviews suggest that the countdown of the steps is delayed.  This is all due to the fact that the device must process the received information and summarize.  Keep in mind that the device user does not always stand still, he can run, jump, walk, swim, etc.  The question immediately arises: how to calculate steps from all actions?  Only programmers can answer this question. </p><p>  If you keep your hands in your pockets while walking, the bracelet does not move in space in the same way as with regular walking or running.  In this case, the device does not always correctly indicate the number of steps.  The nuance is considered to be inaccurate work while riding on a swing, since the device perceives this process as a walk. </p><h2>  Device service </h2><p>  Once you had to download a program for your bracelet, then analyze personal activity.  Today, cloud services relate to all technologies, including Garmin Vivofit.  You must bind the device to a personal computer or several.  Now all product data is stored on a service called Garmin Connect. </p>
