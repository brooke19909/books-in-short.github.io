Anyone interested in this prospect?  Of course!  This mainly applies to those people who are not able to buy or rent more decent housing.  For example, over the past ten years, a type of real estate such as a family hostel in Moscow has been in demand.  It is home to people who came to see the capital, temporarily reside in the city because of work or received similar housing from the government. </p><h2>  Dormitory at the Komsomolskaya station </h2><p>  The family hostel in Moscow, located at the Komsomolskaya metro station, is an excellent option for families with small children.  The first advantage is clean air and the presence of a large number of natural sources, which is not so easy to find in Moscow.  The positive quality of this place is the presence of playgrounds and cafes within walking distance. </p><p>  The snow-white two-story building offers several options for rooms that can accommodate from two to eight people.  Each of the "apartments" is equipped with a TV, refrigerator, necessary furniture.  Separately, you can use the services of washing and drying clothes. </p><p>  <span>This</span> family-type <span>hostel</span> in Moscow is located in a fenced, enclosed area and operates in access mode, that is, guests can be calm - no strangers will get into their room.  Wet cleaning of each room is carried out daily. </p><p>  The cost of living is about 250 rubles per day, but the longer a person lives here, the more convenient the payment system becomes for him.  For example, for one month he will pay only 20 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dormitory at the Kursk Station </h2><p>  If a family needs to rent a hostel in Moscow for a short time, for example, in order to enjoy the beauties of the city, go to a concert or a football match, it is best to check into a guest house located at the Kurskaya metro station.  The first advantage of this place is a short distance to three stations.  That is, a nonresident person who is new to the capital will find it difficult to get lost.  The second plus is the nearby metro station. </p>

It offers modern appliances and <span>classic furniture.</span>  A distinctive feature is its rather low price.  For such a cozy room you have to pay only 7 thousand rubles a month, and this is practically insignificant amount for the capital! </p><h2>  Dormitory at the "Paveletskaya" station </h2>

    <p>  Are there any other guest houses, in particular family houses?  <span>The apartment-type hostel</span> in Moscow, located at the Paveletskaya metro station, is also considered a good option.  Each room located in the house is an imitation of a small apartment.  It has everything for a full stay: wardrobes, a sanitary area, a TV, a refrigerator, a microwave and much more.  It is worth noting the amazing home design of each room.  The minimum cost of renting a room in this hostel is 500 rubles. </p><h2>  Dormitory at the station "Dubrovka" </h2>

    <p>  There are also youth hostel rooms in Moscow, which are designed to accommodate couples without children.  This may include a building located at the <span>metro station "Dubrovka".</span>  Life is always in full swing here.  Bars, clubs, restaurants, cinemas and shopping centers located nearby will not leave anyone indifferent.  This place is for those people who are used to always be in the thick of things. </p><p>  A big plus is that there is a block system of accommodation with a separate shower, kitchen and sanitary area.  There are no water shutdown schedules - you can take a shower at any convenient time.  The approximate cost of renting a room is about 270 rubles per day per person. </p><p>  A family hostel in Moscow is a place that gives new opportunities to guests of the capital!  Now it is not necessary to have relatives in the city in order to come to enjoy the beauties of the city, go to university or get a job.  You can rent quite comfortable housing at an affordable price. </p>
