Causes and solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With smartphones, various kinds of breakdowns often occur.  Not everyone can figure out what is the reason, so immediately contact the service center.  Perhaps this decision will be the most correct. </p><p>  But some system crashes can be fixed with the click of a button.  Therefore, it is better to try to figure out on your own what to do if the sound is lost.  Sometimes just changing the settings is enough. </p><h2>  Sound problem </h2><p>  Sound has disappeared, what should I do?  It should be noted right away that this is not the most common problem with smartphones.  It happens extremely rarely and in general for critical reasons.  For example, the user, the poor-quality assembly of the device, or system errors may be to blame. </p><p>  The problem itself can also be different.  The user may not hear the other person at all.  Noises and creaks may also occur.  Sometimes the sound can change, and the volume is independently adjusted.  Therefore, it is important to understand why the sound disappeared and what to do. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.technobezz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The speakers broke" class="if uuid-2807655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807655.jpg"></div><h2>  Reason for sound loss </h2><p>  In fact, there can be a huge number of reasons.  And some may be very unexpected.  It will be easy to cope with others, but some will be unresolvable.  Among the main reasons can be identified: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  malfunctioning speakers; </li><li>  faulty audio jack; </li><li>  problems with the gain board; </li><li>  system errors. </li></ul><p>  In addition to these, you can still find problems caused by careless operation.  For example, you drop your phone on the floor or in water.  In this case, the speakers will definitely fail.  There may also be a problem caused by poor-quality assembly of the manufacturer. </p><h2>  Check </h2><p>  If there is no sound, what should I do?  First, you can try to reboot the device.  Of course, this is not a panacea for all problems, but often it helps to restore the correct operation of the device.  Unfortunately, mobile operating systems often fail.  Sometimes it is enough to reboot the device to return it to working capacity. </p><p>  But if this method did not help, then you need to conduct a full check of the device.  Perhaps, for some reason, the settings or user configuration have been reset.  Just click on the volume rocker.  If you notice that the volume bar appears on the screen and it is set to maximum, then there should be sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="What to do if the sound is lost" class="if uuid-2807652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807652.jpg"></div><p>  In this case, you have to listen to the device.  Usually, various kinds of system sounds appear that will help determine the cause of the malfunction.  But they can be disabled.  Therefore, it is better to immediately go to the smartphone settings and find the sound menu. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost any device has a setting of playback modes.  In addition to silent, vibration and loud, you can also set your own configuration.  It happens that system sounds are turned on in it, but the ringer volume is minimal.  Here you have to carefully examine everything to figure it out. </p><p>  If you see that in the sound settings the default mode with the maximum volume is set, but the sound is gone, what should I do in this case?  Have to look for malfunctions. </p><h2>  I can not hear the interlocutor </h2><p>  It may happen that you hear a call, all notifications are also accompanied by sound, but the interlocutor is not heard.  This is a fairly common problem, especially for people who are poorly versed in phones.  Any experienced user will tell you how to deal with this problem. </p><p>  During the next phone call, you will need to press the volume rocker.  Sometimes the interlocutor‚Äôs audibility setting gets confused and it seems that the sound has disappeared.  In fact, it is enough to set the maximum volume during a call. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidheadlines.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound setting" class="if uuid-2807660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807660.jpg"></div><h2>  Speaker issues </h2><p>  But if none of the above helped, and the sound in the speaker disappeared, what to do, you will have to figure it out on your own.  The phone may have broken the speaker.  You should immediately understand that in this case you will have to go to the service center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Firstly, to replace it yourself, you need certain skills, and secondly, it will be very difficult to find a model of the necessary part.  Also, an inexperienced user may encounter the fact that in the hope of finding one speaker under the body, he will detect several at once.  And this further complicates the independent repair of the device. </p><p>  Of course, speaker groups are not a frequent occurrence, but they can also occur by performing certain options.  For example, one works with sound in games and music, the other allows you to hear the interlocutor, the third is responsible for system sounds. </p><h2>  Why does the speaker break? </h2><p>  You should not immediately panic if the sound on the iPhone disappears.  What to do in this case?  In general, the algorithm of actions does not differ in any way from those proposed for other models.  You will immediately have to remember what happened to the smartphone recently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.technobezz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sound problems" class="if uuid-2807663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807663.jpg"></div><p>  Usually incorrect speaker operation is associated with: </p><ul><li>  clogged device; </li><li>  burnout coil or short circuit; </li><li>  a cliff in the coil. </li></ul><p>  Clogging is a common sound module problem.  But in this case, the sound rarely disappears completely.  Most often, some sounds remain audible, but they are muffled.  In this case, you can try to clean the phone yourself.  To do this, it will be enough to take an old toothbrush or cotton swab. </p><p>  But cleaning the speaker is not an easy task.  Previously, the phone was easy to disassemble into all the components.  Now the manufacturer is trying to make monoblocks that only specialists can disassemble. </p><p>  If the coil burns out or a short circuit occurs, the speaker will produce noise or crackles.  Moreover, in this way, the module can still work for a long time, but it is better not to delay the repair.  In this case, you will definitely have to contact the service center. </p><p>  A break in the coil is characterized by the fact that the speaker stops making any sound at all.  In this case, he is destined only for a complete replacement. </p><h2>  Audio Connector Problems </h2><p>  And if there is no sound on the iPhone 5, what to do in this case?  Again, it is worth mentioning that sound problems are universal for any modern smartphone, whether it is a device from Apple or Samsung.  Some recommend checking the sound on the headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.guidingtech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Why did the sound go missing" class="if uuid-2807668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807668.jpg"></div><p>  If the speakers are ‚Äúsilent‚Äù and the headset is making a sound, you can try the following: </p><ul><li>  insert and pull out the plug several times while playing music; </li><li>  connect the headset, hold down the volume up button and remove the plug; </li><li>  blow the audio jack with compressed air; </li><li>  if liquid gets into the case, if possible disassemble the phone and clean it. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes it may happen that the so-called "antennae" is clamped in the connector.  In this case, information is sent to the device that the headset is connected, so the speakers do not produce any sounds.  This problem can only be solved in the service center. </p><h2>  Sound Amplification Board Problems </h2><p>  Of course, sometimes the sound may stop working due to a malfunctioning volume rocker and getting dirt under it.  In this case, fixing the problem will not be difficult.  But the problems with the sound amplification board will definitely force the user to go to the service center. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ubreakifix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Repair speakers" class="if uuid-2807678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807678.jpg"></div><p>  The fact is that it is impossible to independently determine the failure in the board.  Therefore, you have to turn to specialists, and those, in turn, determine one of the reasons why this problem could arise: </p><ul><li>  moisture inside the device; </li><li>  overheating of the device due to resource-intensive programs, etc .; </li><li>  physical damage or unfair assembly. </li></ul><h2>  Software issues </h2><p>  What to do: the sound disappeared on the "iPhone 6".  As practice shows, it is better to immediately go to the service center.  Firstly, official support for Apple devices is always at the highest level, and secondly, an inexperienced user can harm an expensive smartphone model. </p><p>  But if we are talking about software crashes, then you can try to "shaman" with the system yourself.  Sound may be lost if: </p><ul><li>  viruses entered the system; </li><li>  installation of low-quality custom firmware; </li><li>  incorrect reset to factory settings; </li><li>  Download "pirated" applications. </li></ul><p>  Some of these problems can be solved independently.  For example, get rid of installed software, also download an antivirus program and check the system for malware.  If possible, it is better to reset to factory settings. </p><h2>  Reset to factory settings </h2><p>  Sound has disappeared - what to do?  If all the above methods did not help to solve the problem, and you are absolutely sure that the problems are due to a software failure, you can try to reset to factory settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ifixit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Causes of sound breakdown" class="if uuid-2807681" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2807681.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, you need to clear all information from the phone, otherwise it will be deleted permanently.  Further it is advisable to use a backup of the system.  In this case, all account data, configuration, and other settings will be saved, and after a reset, you can restore them. </p><p>  Reset to factory settings can be done from the phone settings menu, as well as a key combination. </p>
