In order for such a useful gadget to bring the greatest benefit at the lowest financial cost, it‚Äôs worth a little understanding of some of the technological subtleties of this device.  There are varieties of these devices that differ in a set of specific features.  In order not to overpay for unnecessary functions, first of all, before choosing the auto registrar correctly, you need to determine which functions will be most in demand for you. </p><p>  If you are on the road for a relatively short period of time, then you should not buy models that are too expensive with many features.  In the opposite case, if the road takes a lot of time, then the acquisition of expensive multifunctional models is justified.  In order not to worry about the many dangers on the road, manufacturers offer car DVRs with one or more video cameras.  Quite often, models equipped with a microphone for <span>recording sound</span> are offered <span>.</span> </p><p>  There are devices that are divided by the type of data storage: either on the hard drive or on a flash drive.  The advantage of a hard disk is its large capacity and data security.  However, the main disadvantage of this type of media is that the hard drive loses its working properties at temperatures below zero.  Flash carriers, in turn, are devoid of such shortcomings and have certain advantages due to the small size of the recorder, low energy consumption, as a result of which it can be safely left to work from the <span>battery.</span>  Also, another undoubted advantage is the simplicity and convenience of transferring data to a computer or PDA.  The disadvantages of this type of media include a limited number of rewrite cycles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before choosing an auto-recorder, you should pay attention to another significant indicator - this is the <span>degree of compression</span> at which the entire process of recording data occurs.  A high compression ratio is necessary if there is a need to use on-line monitoring via GPRS-Internet. <br>  The built-in display is also an important factor, because it is precisely this that will allow viewing the video recording on the spot if there are any disputes.  Another important point is the presence of a video output, which makes it possible to connect an external display.  Such a function will allow you to output a signal from the rear view camera, which quite seriously facilitates reversing and parking. </p><p>  How to choose a car dashcam with a navigator, and why is it needed? </p><p>  A car recorder with a navigator is necessary for those who spend a long time in traffic on the roads.  Such a device allows you to record the speed mode, position, and also the direction of movement of your car in continuous recording mode.  This function will help you restore the exact course of events in various disputed cases.  Thus, you can quite confidently defend your interests, armed with such evidence. </p><p>  The work of the DVR is carried out from the on-board network of the car, in addition, an autonomous power supply is provided, which ensures uninterrupted operation in the event of a main power supply shutdown.  All information is recorded on standard removable memory cards.  If this card is filled in, automatic overwriting to old files begins. </p><p>  Before choosing an auto-recorder and installing it on your car, you should pay special attention to the tips that the operating instructions of the auto-recorder offer. </p>
