    <h2>  Holidays in the Red Sea </h2><p>  Domina Coral Bay Aquamarine Pool 5 is located on the first coastline and is ideal for those who have chosen a beach holiday.  Here, literally all conditions are created for this.  Near the hotel there is a private beach with golden sand and many corals (with a total length of just under 2 kilometers) with a very convenient entrance to the sea.  Umbrellas with sun loungers and mattresses are installed on the shore, which is absolutely free for any vacationer to use.  On a small bridge directly from the beach you can go to a specially equipped 70-meter main pontoon with places for diving, sunbathing and swimming.  It has 2 small pools with a suspended bottom depth of 1.2 and 2.5 meters.  This is very convenient, because the coastal bottom is completely strewn with small corals.  That is why it is advisable to enter the sea in special shoes.  And for those who swim well or prefer a passive rest on the water, it is better to use a pontoon.  In addition, there are two more ‚Äúfloating islands‚Äù of a slightly smaller size.  So there is enough space for everyone. </p>

It is very popular recently in most resorts in Egypt.  Service according to this principle is carried out from 10 am to midnight.  It includes 3 meals a day in the main restaurant.

Other institutions (restaurants and a lobby bar) work on a fee basis.  On the initiative of the hotel management, it has already become a tradition to celebrate the birthday of visitors with a festive cake.  And for regular guests and newlyweds, there are separate privileges and, among other things, a fruit basket in the room.  The organizers of the complex value the opinion of every vacationer. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Distinctive features of the area </h2><p>  For those who have visited the Domina Coral Bay Aquamarine Pool 5 * hotel, Sharm El Sheikh seems to be the best region for relaxing on the coast.  Of course, in Hurghada, prices for almost everything are much lower, and it is located directly on the African continent.  But both of these resorts have a number of fundamental differences.  Firstly, in Sharm, the coastline is completely rugged by coral reefs.  Moreover, to this day they have been preserved in almost perfect condition.  This place is just made for diving, underwater fishing and snorkeling.  From the beach to the depths you can get with the help of pontoons.  It is very convenient and safe.  Secondly, the unusually beautiful Sinai Mountains look picturesque against the backdrop of a desert area.  They keep a centuries-old history, which attracts tourists from various countries.  There are no such beauties on the coast of Hurghada.  Sandy beaches predominate here, and for underwater landscapes, you need to go out into the open sea. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Leaving home, absolutely all hotel guests dream of returning to Domina Coral Bay Aquamarine Pool 5 * again.  Guest reviews are only positive.  Of course, the vast territory of the complex, almost immersed in greenery, cannot but cause admiration.  Cozy, well-furnished rooms are also liked.  Tourists gratefully recall the delicious and always diverse cuisine.  Almost everyone notes the excellent work of the staff.  Tourists from Russia are especially welcome.  Arriving in a foreign country, they meet friendly smiling faces.  The hotel staff is happy to learn Russian, and many of them are already free to maintain a lively conversation.  Far from the homeland it is important and very pleasant.  You can hear a lot of positive things regarding family vacations with children.  In the hotel this question is thought out comprehensively.  There is a playground, 2 separate pools for kids and an entertainment club for children under the age of 12.  The smallest visitors are not forgotten here.  The restaurant and the room have special furniture for them, and if necessary, a paid nanny is always ready to help.  In short, the hotel is ideal for a relaxing and chic pastime. </p>

    <h2>  Tourist network </h2><p>  An excellent choice for a holiday in the vicinity of Sharm El Sheikh can be considered <span>Domina</span> Coral Bay Aquamarine Pool 5 * <span>hotel</span> .  Aquamarine Pool is one of seven hotel-type hotels belonging to a complex called Domina Coral Bay.  Located in a picturesque place, it resembles an oasis in the desert.  From the side, the complex is similar to a city consisting of separate microdistricts, each of which lives according to its own laws.  This is partly true.  The owner of such a paradise is Italian, and this sometimes affects.  Among the pluses are good food, beautiful appearance (both of individual rooms and the entire hotel).  But there are also disadvantages.  These include, to a greater extent, the selective attitude towards guests.  In the hotels of this complex a large number of Italians are resting.  It is they who are always and in everything served at the highest level.  The rest of the tourists have to hope for luck and luck.  There are problems with the settlement, as well as some organizational issues.  But we must pay tribute to the staff.  In any case, hotel workers are trying as soon as possible to find a way out of this situation and offer the best solution. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodations </h2><p>  Very often travel agencies describe the merits of a trip to Egypt on the example of the Domina Coral Bay Aquamarine Pool 5 * hotel (SharmelSheikh).  The reviews of previously rested tourists are used as an advertising tour.  Of course, the appearance of a place for future recreation and the range of services offered - this is important.  But people are usually interested in the conditions in which they will have to be.  What will be a room in such a hotel?  It should be noted right away that all rooms belong to the superior class and are equipped accordingly.  The standard room is a little less than 30 square meters.  This is more than enough to organically arrange the necessary furniture in it.  In each room, as a rule, there are either two single beds or one double bed.  To relax in your free time, there is a soft sofa with a pair of armchairs, and in the evening a cozy atmosphere will be created by a slightly dim light from an elegant floor lamp.  The room has a TV with satellite and cable TV.  There is also a telephone to contact the hotel management or make personal calls anywhere in the world.  An individual safe is provided for storing documents and valuables.  There is a minibar in the room.  In addition, there is everything you need to make coffee (tea) yourself.  In any room there is a bathroom and a spacious bathroom, where for each there is a set of towels, slippers, a bathrobe and a hairdryer for drying hair.  Linen is changed and cleaned daily.  Each room has a spacious terrace (or balcony) with a table and comfortable armchairs.  In general, all conditions have been created for a comfortable and carefree stay. </p>

    <h2>  Tour Operator Tips </h2><p>  Each self-respecting tour operator must organize a holiday at the Domina Coral Bay Aquamarine Pool 5 * hotel.  Photos are usually shown to tourists when choosing a tour so that the client can see with his own eyes the institution where he will have to relax.  Of course, a new place is always interesting.  However, I would like to know in advance what the room, the beach, the dining room, and the view from the window look like.  In addition to photographs of hoteliers, travel agencies staff take their pictures, where you can see every attraction of the complex in great detail.  Sometimes evening entertainment and sporting events are filmed in order to most fully convey to the client the atmosphere prevailing there.  The hotel has a nightclub providing the opportunity to have a wonderful rest, watch an exciting show and listen to live music with pleasure.  A 10-minute drive from the complex for golf lovers is a great 18-hole golf course.  All this will help to make a visit to the hotel unforgettable. </p>
