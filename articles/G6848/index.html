    <p>  If you have a personal car, you will have to cover a distance of 70 km each day.  This is one of the most convenient ways, but not the fastest due to congestion in this direction. </p><p>  We figured out the possibilities to get from Sergiev Posad to the capital.  Now it remains to understand what kind of housing complexes are offered by local developers, how suitable they are for living and what level of comfort they can offer. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Sergiev Posad is a provincial and very small town.  First of all, it is popular and even famous for its huge cultural and historical heritage in the form of the Trinity Lavra, as well as its relative proximity to Moscow, which can be reached by various types of ground transport, on average, in an hour.  That is why apartments here are much more expensive.  But this is a great opportunity to purchase housing in an ecologically clean and developed region, away from the noisy and crowded Moscow, without losing touch with it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Residential complexes</span> here repeat the new buildings in the capital.  They impress with their scope and spaciousness of the territory.  These are not just houses with many apartments, but full-fledged <span>residential complexes</span> with their own developed infrastructure and landscaped area.  Children can enjoy active games without leaving the complex.  And all thanks to modern playgrounds.  Developers also thought about people of a more mature, even elderly age: walking paths, benches were equipped for them, flower beds of bright and fragrant flowers were planted. </p><h2>  LCD "Vladimirsky" </h2><p>  We want to draw the attention of potential buyers to the project of the developer JSC Glavuks.  In this case, new buildings are meant (Sergiev Posad, Vladimirskaya street) of the Vladimirsky residential complex.  The project provides for the construction of a seven-story and two nine-story houses.  The city has enough clinics, kindergartens, schools, shops, so the residents of the complex will have access to them. </p>
