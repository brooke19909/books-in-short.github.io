This is the <span>capital of the Krasnodar Territory, a</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãwith a population of almost one million people.  Many move here to bask in the sun for most of their lives.  Therefore, the construction of residential buildings in the city does not stop.  And one of the most successful new buildings is the "European" LCD (Krasnodar). </p>

    <h2>  A little about Krasnodar </h2><p>  Settled under the hot southern sun, Krasnodar, like a magnet, attracts various people.  Many choose it as their permanent residence, moving from distant northern regions.  Krasnodar accepts everyone, but developers and developers do not get tired of building residential complexes, one more beautiful than the other.  Among them, the LCD ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù took its place of honor.  Krasnodar allocated him perhaps the best place in the city. </p><p>  Krasnodar is the largest industrial city in the south of the country, concentrating almost 70% of the total production of the region.  Part of the city are more than 62 thousand small and medium-sized businesses, which account for approximately 45% of retail sales.  One of the most famous largest companies is the Magnit retail chain, whose headquarters are located in Krasnodar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As for construction, the city occupies one position along the pace of putting new housing into operation on a par with such megacities as Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Numerous new buildings rise like mushrooms after rain.  And among them - the handsome LCD "European".  G. Krasnodar can rightfully be proud of it, since it falls into the category of elite housing erected by the developer. </p><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  The developer of the complex designed it so that the appearance and proposed housing satisfy even the most rigorous aesthetic and architectural taste.  Not every project of developers in Krasnodar combines this in itself.  But the "European" (LCD, Krasnodar) completely coped with this difficult task.  Thus, everything that an elite residential complex should have is present in it: a unique architectural ensemble, no less unique layout of apartments, modern building and finishing materials, a park area and a landscaped courtyard.  For all these advantages, ‚ÄúEvropeisky‚Äù (ZhK, Krasnodar) was awarded the prestigious prize ‚ÄúThe Best Regional Residential Complex‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  What is this complex?  These are three residential buildings built using monolithic-brick technology in the form of trefoils.  Such an architectural design allowed him to fit most harmoniously into the surrounding landscape.  Each central section of the building in each house reaches 24 floors, and the petal sections - 18 floors.  90% of the total number of apartments in the complex overlook the Kuban River. </p><h2>  Favorable difference of a residential complex </h2><p>  LCD "European" (Krasnodar), the photos only confirm this, compares favorably with the rest of the mass of residential buildings in the specified city.  First of all, not every developer provides such a modern infrastructure as that of the "European".  The complex combines nature and urban comfort.  The first is provided by proximity to the embankment of the Kuban River, the second - by a well-developed urban infrastructure.  Also a definite plus, according to residents, are spacious apartments, most of which offer a magnificent view of the Kuban River.  Not every new building can provide its customers with multi-level penthouses with open terraces.  Such penthouses are one of the key points that make it possible to classify apartments in the Evropeisky residential complex (Krasnodar) as elite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  They enter the territory of the complex from Kozhevennaya Street.  Evropeisky (LCD, Krasnodar) also took care of the guests of the complex, they can park their cars in a specially equipped parking lot.  The territory of the complex is very thought out, the project provides free access, for example, fire engines.  The sidewalks are covered with a single layer of asphalt concrete pavement and paving tiles.  But lawns, flower beds - do not count.  And this moment is very pleasing to those living here. </p><h2>  External infrastructure </h2><p>  The residential complex is located almost in the very center of the city, which means the presence of a well-developed infrastructure around.  In walking distance is a secondary school.  Almost opposite there is a kindergarten.  For leisure and entertainment in the area there are numerous cafes and restaurants.  Many branches of banks and supermarkets, such as Magnit, Lenta.  There are polyclinics: children's and adult.  Thus, everything that is necessary for a comfortable life is located almost next to the complex. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  Which of the developers managed to implement the project "European" (residential complex)?  A construction <span>company (Krasnodar, Krasnodar</span> Territory) called Gazprombank-Invest is the developer of this elite complex.  The founder is the joint-stock company Gazprombank.  This is one of the most reliable developers in this region.  The company was created about 14 years ago, taking as its basis the principle of consistently high quality of sold facilities.  A strict adherence to the stated principles once and for all ensures the company an increase in the value of the assets that make up its investment portfolio. </p><p>  The Russian investment company Gazprombank-Invest has been active in real estate, starting from the early stage of construction, investing its capital in the most interesting projects.  In order not to be mistaken in choosing a direction, the company's specialists conduct a deep professional examination and identify the most favorable opportunities for investing capital without risk. </p><p>  The company implements projects not only in the Krasnodar Territory, but also in eight regions of the state.  Currently, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãprojects is more than 2.3 million square meters. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  LCD "European" (Krasnodar) reviews of residents has almost one positive.  But the reliability level of the developer company and its approach to the implementation of its projects speaks for itself.  As for the "European", then everything was done on time, without disruption to the construction schedule.  There are no residents dissatisfied with this aspect. </p><p>  As for communications, internal infrastructure, we can say that over several years some items have worn out or become unusable.  This causes just indignation of people who have chosen the place of residence "European" (LCD, Krasnodar).  But management companies try to replace everything in a timely manner or to repair parts that have become unusable.  Such moments add negative reviews to the piggy bank of the complex, but, fortunately, there are not many of them. </p><p>  Well, and the location of the complex in the most favorable and environmentally friendly area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city with a highly developed infrastructure, close to the promenade, with a closed guarded territory, with excellent layouts of apartments and penthouses - all this, without a doubt, adds only positive feedback from satisfied residents. </p><h2>  Apartments: layout </h2><p>  The residential complex offers for sale many options for apartments.  There are standard: one-room, two-room, three-room.  Also provided are apartments in the "euro" format.  The specified layout assumes the availability of a separate separate room, which can be allocated for the second or third rooms.  This option is suitable for buyers on a budget.  Because it is acquired, for example, ‚ÄúEurodvushka‚Äù at the price of a one-room apartment, but in fact subsequently a full two-room apartment is obtained from it.  That is, you can live in a business class complex, and significantly save on the purchase of residential real estate. </p><p>  The square footage of the apartments in the complex is rather big.  The standard one-room apartment is designed at least 50 square meters.  As for the two-room apartments, they begin with 78 square meters.  This complex also differs from other new buildings in the presence of penthouses.  They occupy an average area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 square meters. </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  The average cost of one square meter of housing in the LCD "European" is approximately 55 thousand rubles.  Thus, a one-room apartment will cost its buyer about 3.5-4.3 million rubles.  Two-room apartments will cost more than 5 million rubles.  And for the penthouse will have to pay more than 7 million rubles. </p><h2>  The advantages and disadvantages of life in the complex </h2><p>  For those who are just thinking about purchasing an apartment in the indicated residential complex, it is worth talking about its advantages and disadvantages.  The biggest pluses are its location in the most promising, ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city with developed infrastructure, in the immediate vicinity of the Kuban River, with panoramic views from its windows.  Also a big plus is good transport accessibility, the availability of social infrastructure. </p>

    <p>  As for the shortcomings, here, even with the greatest desire, there are not many of them.  There are minor complaints of residents regarding the quality of service of the management company.  But there are similar complaints wherever people have been living for some time.  They are all easily solved.  The management company is trying almost immediately to eliminate all identified violations or to pay attention to the complaints of its residents. </p>
