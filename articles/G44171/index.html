  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Political power</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Political power, the essence of which, like other power, lies in the ability and right of some to exercise their will in relation to others (to manage and command them) indirectly or directly affect the formation and development of other systems of society (spiritual, economic and others). </p><p>  This form of management, in comparison with other forms of management, has its own specifics. </p><p>  Among the distinguishing features of this force form, the following should be noted: </p><ol><li>  Supremacy.  This concept characterizes the binding decisions for society as a whole.  In addition, political power is able to limit the influence of other power forms, putting them in a reasonable framework or eliminating them. </li><li>  Publicity (universality).  This characteristic suggests that political power carries out actions on behalf of society and on the basis of law. </li><li>  Legality (legality) is applicable to the use of force and other means within the state. </li><li>  Monocentricity.  In this case, we are talking about the existence of a national system of management bodies (center) of decision-making. </li><li>  Political power is endowed with a wide range of means for retaining, conquering and exercising managerial power. </li></ol><p>  Thus, this form of management is characterized by the capabilities and abilities of those who have it to realize their will in the management and leadership of the whole society (state), having a decisive influence on the behavior of the population using the means at the disposal of the state.  In addition, this structure is able to mobilize large masses of people to achieve the goals and programs set, to regulate the relationships between individual groups of people. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The successful functioning of political power is influenced by many different factors.  Among them, quite a lot of importance is attached to the foundations of this management form, its validity from the point of view of the law, and the recognition of its governing right by society. </p><p>  Political dictators need the help of the masses they rule.  Otherwise, it becomes impossible to preserve and secure sources of political power.  They mainly include: </p><ol><li>  Authority, human confidence in the legality of this form of control power and that the <span>moral duty of</span> people is to obey it. </li><li>  The number and significance of groups and individuals <span>(human resources)</span> subordinate, cooperating or providing assistance to rulers. </li><li>  Knowledge and skills necessary for the implementation of the regime, the implementation of specific actions, transmitted by collaborating groups and individuals. </li><li>  Ideological, psychological (intangible) factors that persuade (force) people to help rulers and obey them. </li><li>  <span>Material resources, the</span> level of access or control of rulers over <span>natural resources,</span> wealth, the economic system, financial resources, transport, communications. </li><li>  Punishments, sanctions, applied or supposed to be applied against those who refuse to cooperate or show disobedience, necessary for the implementation of policies and the implementation of the entire regime of rulers. </li></ol><p>  It should be noted that the presence of the cited sources cannot be guaranteed.  Their presence depends on the adoption of the regime, obedience, subjugation of the masses, the cooperation of many <span>social institutions</span> and people. </p><p>  The formation of this form of management, its development is determined by the vital needs of education and the evolution of society.  That is why political power is endowed with extremely important special functions - the regulation of social relations, the management of all sectors of society. </p>
