This platform was developed on the basis of the Linux OS, where there are more than enough possibilities for penetrating malicious code.  The successor received almost identical security protocols, so a good half of the viruses successfully migrated to the new operating system. </p><p>  Moreover, the malicious code is still dangerous for the owner of mobile gadgets and tablets in particular.  Viruses can not only destroy the key data of the system, but also steal information about your personal and business life: SMS, bank accounts, passwords and logins from accounts and much more. </p><p>  If your gadget suddenly for no reason began to slow down and consume significantly more Internet traffic, you should think about whether it is time to check the tablet for viruses.  One of the simplest, but far from the most reliable option is the installation of special software - antivirus, firewall, etc. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="virus protection for android" class="if uuid-2629797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629797.jpg"></div><p>  But on the Android platform, this is far from a panacea.  In addition, such software is usually demanding on the system resources of the gadget, which is clearly not the best way to affect performance.  Of course, owners of powerful and productive premium devices have nothing to worry about, because in this case, checking the tablet for viruses is not a problem, the whole procedure will take a minimum of time, and the background operation of the utility will be practically invisible.  But not everyone can afford the purchase of an expensive and productive device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As an alternative, many experts advise not to mess with mobile software, but check the tablet for viruses through a computer.  In addition, the desktop utility has significantly greater functionality and is more efficient.  Naturally, here we are talking about products from reputable developers, such as Kaspersky Lab, ESET, "Dr.  Web ‚Äùand others like them. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to check for viruses a tablet with the Android operating system using a personal computer.  Consider the main nuances of this procedure and the effectiveness of tools in a particular case. </p><h2>  Viruses </h2><p>  Before checking the tablet for viruses through a PC, we will examine the malicious code itself and its classification.  This will help to choose the right tool for exposure, as well as get rid of the problem. </p><h2>  Trojans </h2><p>  This is the simplest and at the same time the most common type of thief virus.  The malicious code reads, copies, and then sends your personal data to scammers.  First of all, the accounts of email services and social networks are at risk. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techadvisor.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="trojan in the tablet" class="if uuid-2629794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629794.jpg"></div><p>  Even if you check the tablet for viruses with the simplest special program, then it will detect them without problems.  The same applies to the removal of malicious code.  Almost any antivirus can save you trojans in no time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Banners </h2><p>  Such virus software, as a rule, is aggressive and interferes with the normal operation of the browser and free applications.  They can pop up at the most inopportune moment and obscure the work area until you close them or tap them with the subsequent transition to the advertised resource. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.legge-privacy-dati.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="viruses banners" class="if uuid-2629792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629792.jpg"></div><p>  To get rid of them is a little more difficult than to remove trojans, because the developers of such free products sew code in the application, where after its removal the program starts to crash and does not work correctly. </p><h2>  Beggars </h2><p>  In a good half of cases, your device is blocked by one window, where the requirements of cybercriminals about transferring money to a specified account are painted.  Rebooting does not give any results, and it‚Äôs certainly not worth it to go about scammers to unlock the gadget. </p><p>  There is only one option left - to check the Android tablet for viruses precisely through a computer, because you simply do not have access to the gadget's operating system. </p><h2>  Virus distribution </h2><p>  Such virus spam attempts to withdraw money from your phone or even a bank card account by paying for regular mailings for short messages.  The user sometimes does not even know and does not notice until the last moment that he is subscribed to some paid service. </p><h2>  PC connection </h2><p>  Before you check your tablet for viruses via PC, it is clearly superfluous to make sure that your computer is clean and not a carrier of malicious code.  So a full desktop check is the first thing, and only then the gadget itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting tablet to pc" class="if uuid-2629795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629795.jpg"></div><p>  The first step is to connect your tablet via a USB cable.  In some cases, you will need to enable the "USB Debugging" mode in the device settings.  It is also worth noting that some devices require drivers for the correct operation of the PC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidp1.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="usb debugging" class="if uuid-2629796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629796.jpg"></div><p>  For example, in order to check the Lenovo tablet for viruses, you will need not only drivers, but also branded software of the brand, which is responsible for the correct synchronization of the device with the computer.  Without the first and second, the process will either drag on significantly, or not at all. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tablet sync with pc" class="if uuid-2629793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629793.jpg"></div><p>  But in most cases, there is no need to install any drivers.  For example, to check the Samsung tablet for viruses, just connect the device to the PC, and synchronization will take place automatically.  The fact is that all the necessary software for synergy is already built into the firmware, and there is no need to do extra body movements. </p><h2>  Cleaning your device for viruses </h2><p>  Almost any antivirus application is able to service external hard drives.  After connecting the tablet to the PC, your mobile device is just such an external medium.  To start the procedure, just select the name of the disk (tablet) and start the scan. </p><p>  But there is one caveat.  For full access to system files, as well as their verification, you may need administrator rights.  Not everyone agrees to install root, so in this case, you can use special software, which, so to speak, temporarily gives such rights. </p><p>  Experts and advanced users recommend using the Android Commander app for these purposes.  It works in semi-automatic mode, and all the tools come down to almost one button - turn it on, and it turns it off.  After activating the application, you can safely run the antivirus and wait for the scan results. </p><p>  The Android Commander application especially helps with Lenovo tablets and other Chinese gadgets.  In the case of devices from Samsung, the best option would be to go to the brand‚Äôs official website and get administrator rights to your gadget there. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  On the Web you can find a lot of software aimed at combating malicious code.  But here you need to be extremely careful.  Some programs may themselves become carriers of viruses and further aggravate your situation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitalhm.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kaspersky antivirus" class="if uuid-2629798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2629798.jpg"></div><p>  Experts unanimously advise installing only proven and reliable software from well-known developers.  The latter are not so many, so the choice, in fact, comes down to only three venerable laboratories - Kaspersky, ESET, and Dr.  The Web. " </p><p>  As a comprehensive and reliable solution to combat the above threats, a good half of advanced users recommend using Kaspersky and Internet Security products in particular.  This antivirus at the root will save you from problems and properly clean the tablet from malicious code.  It works slowly, sometimes freezes completely, but it does its job as it should. </p><p>  As for the ESET product, it also does a good job of detecting and eliminating major threats.  But a good half of users brand him paranoid and alarmist.  The antivirus watchman works almost on his own, about and without causing the user to be nervous.  Nevertheless, ESET products, in addition to being good, also quickly cope with the task. </p><p>  Antivirus solutions from ‚ÄúDr.  Web "are also good, but sometimes they skip the banner type of malicious code.  There are no complaints about the detection of other types of threats.  In addition, products from "Dr.  Web "work surprisingly fast and practically do not load the system.  A good half of users note the stability of the system during background scanning, while ESET and Kaspersky load the OS fully and are gluttonous for RAM. </p>
