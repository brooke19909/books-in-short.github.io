Among them we can single out the increase in capital.  There is no such person who would not think about where to invest available funds.  The lack of specific knowledge and skills among the majority of the population popularized such a service as trust money management.  Distinctive features of the direction include low risks and high profitability. </p><h2>  The essence of trust management </h2>

    <p>  Trust money <span>management is financial management</span> in which a <span>private person</span> transfers his funds to another person who is a professional manager.  The activity of the latter is aimed both at the preservation of funds and at their increase.  The process of cooperation is strictly limited by the time frame, and the manager‚Äôs manipulations are paid for by the agreed percentage of net profit.  The financial service does not imply any responsibility on the part of the manager in the event of adverse events. </p><p>  Not only legal entities, but also individuals can transfer their money to management.  In the person of the manager can act as an individual or an entire company.  On the territory of Russia, persons offering remote control must have special documents authorizing activities in this segment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Remote control features, investor reviews </h2>

    <p>  Many people who do not have the skills to work in the financial market and who have no idea about mutual funds and stocks lose their savings in attempts to conduct trading on their own.  Less than 5% of all participants in the global financial market earn.  That is why investors around the world prefer trusting money.  Reviews of companies and individuals who are professionals in this matter are always positive. </p><h2>  Trust management ‚Äúfrom the past to the present‚Äù </h2><p>  More recently, the remote control was available only to rich people.  Companies took funds in the amount of at least $ 1 million for management.  Today, although this trend has continued, there are new opportunities for a wide range of people with different levels of affluence.  Today, depending on the project, you can find a manager who will increase capital during the week.  The new time has brought many new opportunities. </p><h2>  Mutual Funds and Remote Funds </h2>

    <p>  Trust management of money can be carried out in several formats.  Moreover, the profitability of each partnership always exceeds the percentage of deposits with banks.  The only thing: no one ever gives guarantees.  No one promises fixed dividends.  Financial services have some similarities with mutual funds, which over the past 20 years have become very popular.  They are accessible to most people and at the same time a simple direction for investing.  The activity of <span>mutual investment funds is</span> regulated by the state, which can already be attributed to the benefits.  If the fund becomes bankrupt, its participants will have units that can be transferred to the management of another company.  The disadvantages of the direction are limited to a direct relationship between the value of the units and the state of the economy and certain difficulties in buying land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Remote control in the foreign exchange market </h2><p>  Money trust is widespread in the international financial and stock markets.  Funds are transferred to the trader.  If previously finance was given directly to an experienced player directly, which promised certain risks in connection with a person‚Äôs honesty, today the partnership is regulated by brokers.  Companies have created a product like PAMM accounts.  Their modernized version is PAMM 2.0., Where there is a distribution of not only profit, but also losses.  Funds are transferred to the management of the trader, but he does not have direct access to them.  Using them in trade, he will not be able to withdraw to his account.  These are additional guarantees that reduce the risk of capital investors.  Today there are a fairly large number of opportunities for money management.  This is not only trading in currency pairs, but also the manipulation of options, futures and forwards. </p><h2>  Individual approach </h2>

    <p>  An individual approach is another point that distinguishes money trust management.  The partnership agreement defines not only the general aspects of the activity, but also describes the specifics of management.  For example, when the stock market falls, the manager does not have the right, in accordance with the law, to sell shares, to play lower on short transactions.  He can only temporarily drop his position and wait out the crisis.  Loans and lending are prohibited.  The interests of each investor are taken into account, which is excluded in mutual funds with equity participation of many investors.  DU - according to investors - is one of the most popular services, which with minimal time costs and in the complete absence of special knowledge allows you to increase capital <span>exponentially.</span> </p><h2>  Top companies offering remote control </h2>

    <p>  The popularization of financial services and the active demand from investors have made it possible to form a rating among the companies offering assistance.  Trust management offers money to many, but the top three are always unchanged.  It is worth saying about: </p><ul><li>  Alpari  One of the best online trading organizations offering an extensive program of DU PAMM accounts.  Structured products deserve special attention. </li><li>  Instaforex.  This is the best broker in Asia, whose trust management is presented in the format of PAMM accounts.  The company offers interesting incentive and bonus programs to investors. </li><li>  ForexTrend.  Another broker offering trust management not only in the form of PAMM-accounts, but also in the format of PAMM-accounts 2.0, as well as in the form of indices from the group of managers. </li></ul><p>  The companies LifeForex and TeleTRADE, FOREXClub and FINAM, SingForTrade and FxCompany, and some others are holding at a decent level.  Interesting proposals in this matter are made by the DKS company. </p><h2>  Trust management from Sberbank </h2><p>  Not only brokers, but also financial institutions necessarily offer trust money management.  The rating of companies providing this category of services does not do without Sberbank.  The offer is available to both private and <span>corporate clients,</span> insurance companies and even pension funds.  Bankers advise investing at least a year.  Concluding an agreement on trust management of money, Sberbank individually proposes a settlement format between the parties and selects the composition of the securities portfolio with an orientation to the interests of the investor. </p>

    <p>  The entire amount of income following the results of trust management is the property of the bank's client.  A financial institution receives only a pre-agreed percentage of net profit.  The investor has the right, through his own manager, to make changes to the investment declaration.  Even if finances have already been invested by a bank representative in securities, the owner of the funds can at any time withdraw part of the capital from management or increase the amount of investment.  More detailed partnership conditions are specified in the <span>public offer.</span> </p>
