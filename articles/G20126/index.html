But few people think that this activity can be profitable.  Often people are sure that the older the thing, the higher its price.  But in fact, this is not entirely true.  For example, if valuable coins are withdrawn from circulation, their value will be high.  One of the Russian banks even staged a rally.  They paid 5 thousand rubles for coins of two and five rubles face value, issued in 2003.  The only condition is that they must be stamped with the <span>mint of St. Petersburg.</span>  In fact, numismatists for these same specimens were ready to pay much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valuable coins" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10535/235160.jpg" width="311"></div>

    <p>  If you are interested in valuable <span>coins (value), the</span> catalog of numismatics will be very useful for you.  Compose similar benefits professionals.  In it you can find all the necessary information about the coin of interest to you: year and history of the issue, circulation, material from which they are made, design features, etc. It is important that the cost is prescribed for each instance.  So you can independently evaluate your collection.  This will also help determine the honesty of the seller.  Perhaps, under rare instances, he offers you common coins?  Having studied all the details, you can decide whether you want to collect all the coins in a row or stop at a certain category? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But <span>what are</span> valuable coins?  These are not only certain copies issued in honor of this or that event or minted in limited quantities.  Often the cost is determined based on the condition of the goods.  But with extremely rare specimens this does not work, since it is impossible to find them in good condition.  There are cleaning methods, but if you have valuable coins, it is best not to try new methods.  Your experiments may degrade the appearance of the specimen and lower its price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Valuable coins value catalog" class="if" height="245" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10535/235157.jpg" width="364"></div>

    <p>  What year is considered the rarest?  According to numismatists - 2001. There is still debate about the existence of a coin with a face value of 50 cents.  Officially, they are not in circulation, but topics on sale sometimes appear on different forums.  But most often these are fakes.  Two rubles of the same year of release are also highly valued.  But in reality, no one saw them. </p><p>  The following valuable coins date back to 2003.  It was on copies of this period that banks announced special promotions.  According to their conditions, 5 thousand rubles were paid for such coins.  But, according to professional numismatists, this is a very low cost, in fact they are estimated at 10-20 thousand rubles.  To verify the reality of the existence of the mentioned copies, it is enough to familiarize yourself with the information that various auctions offer. </p>

Copies of Soviet times can also have a high cost, not to mention earlier periods (for example, banknotes of the pre-Roman period).  In order to determine which coins were rare, just know the story.  At certain stages of development, the country could not boast of a large release of coins.  For example, during the Great Patriotic War.  Coins minted during the NEP are also of great value.  In general, until 1960 circulations were small.
