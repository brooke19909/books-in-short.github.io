    <h2>  Dining room complex </h2><p>  "Long Lake" (Moscow region) is a recreation center, offering its guests rooms including a boarding house.  The dining room on the territory of the Long Lake complex belongs to the base.  The administration of the center rents it out for receptions and banquets.  On the territory of the base are equipped gazebos with barbecue facilities. </p><h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  The Long Lake base (Moscow region) is oriented towards the usual quiet rest surrounded by nature.  However, some tourists come here in order to heal a bit. </p><p>  Dmitrovsky district is an ecologically clean place.  The air here is not polluted by any industrial emissions or car exhausts.  In the Dolgoy itself, which belongs to the group of glacial lakes, contains a little radon, so swimming in it is very good for health.  A small medical center, of course, operates on the territory of this base. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  The impressions of the guests about the Long Lake complex exist both good and not very good.  Most guests find the rooms quite comfortable.  The furniture in the rooms is comfortable, in good condition, household appliances are working properly.  Of course, there are not very good reviews about rooms in the base buildings.  They are connected primarily with the fact that repairs in some rooms were carried out for a very long time. </p><p>  Not too flattering reviews are sometimes received by the staff of the Long Lake base.  Unfortunately, the employees of the complex sometimes treat their guests not too warmly. </p><p>  The disadvantage of this center, some guests consider the rather high cost of living. </p>
