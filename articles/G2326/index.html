The most popular among tourists and locals in the Kremlin are the Kul Sharif Mosque and the governor's hall.  In total, the historical complex occupies about 1,500 square meters.  m. One of the symbols of the Kazan Kremlin is the Syuyumbike tower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum of Fine Arts Kazan" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22936/564132.jpg" width="600"></div>  However, the cultural reserves of the ensemble are not limited to this.  They also include various history museums, <span>memorial complexes,</span> exhibition galleries and development centers.  It is worth noting that in the collection of the Kazan Kremlin there are dozens of architectural monuments of the 12th-20th centuries. <br><br>  The construction of the complex began in the 10th century.  In those days, the Kremlin acted as an outpost of the border of the Volga Bulgaria.  Closer to the XIII century, the complex became the center of the Khanate of the Golden Horde.  After the capture of the capital by the troops of Ivan the Terrible, the Kremlin was significantly damaged, but soon, by order of the tsar, restoration work began.  At the turn of the XVII-XVIII centuries, the Kazan ensemble became the administrative center of the Volga region.  Since that time, active work has begun to expand the Kremlin. <br><br>  Today, anyone can enter the territory of the historical ensemble, however, it is simply impossible to see all the sights in one day.
