  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Visual teaching methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In pedagogy, there are many teaching methods that differ, in particular, in the role of students in the process of obtaining new knowledge.  Depending on that role, methods can be passive, active, and interactive.  Within each of these groups, subgroups can also be defined.  One of the subgroups of methods, which can be included in any of the aforementioned large groups of methods, are visual <span>teaching methods,</span> including a variety of ways of presenting information. </p><p>  A demonstration is a demonstration of various visual aids, tables, paintings, diagrams, transparencies, as well as objects, experiments and the like.  Especially often this method is used when repeating the generalization of previously studied material, as well as when studying a new one.  Verbal explanations play a major role in the demonstration.  The illustration method is used on all subjects - these are various models, models, movie fragments, fragments of literary and musical works, maps, graphics, and more. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the technical equipment of many educational institutions has increased, it became possible to use projectors, video recorders, televisions, computers and other video equipment in the classroom, the video method has stood out as an independent method from a large group of ‚Äúvisual teaching methods‚Äù.  This also includes working with a book and other printed sources.  The method includes such techniques as taking notes, taking a quote, citing, drawing up a plan, annotating, reviewing, compiling a certificate, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Visualization enlivens the lesson, introduces lively contemplation into it.  Visual teaching methods are very effective, since training is not based on abstract images, but on concrete, understandable to students.  Using similar methods, students can create a concrete idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa subject or event. </p><p>  Any teacher knows the situation when children are uninteresting and bored at lessons.  Why is school life often so different from the bright and colorful world of childhood that accompanies a child in everyday life?  It would seem that it was the school that should captivate the child, leading him along the beautiful road of knowledge to a new beautiful world, but this is not always the case. </p><p>  Just do not make hasty conclusions and say that the school cannot serve as a source of knowledge, which is sometimes already found in the media.  Although sometimes such statements can be quite justified.  The fact is that the school has always been characterized by some degree of conservatism, which did not allow the process of transferring knowledge to the younger generation to keep up with the times. </p><p>  Thus, a kind of contradiction arose between the new fast-paced time, the characteristic feature of which was the comprehensive penetration of modern technology into the everyday life of a person, and the routine of traditional school education, which was little susceptible to any innovations. </p><p>  However, overcoming this contradiction is quite possible.  Outstanding educators of our time have long thought about this and made every effort to overcome this situation. </p><p>  Visual teaching methods are designed to become the very first link in the chain of other methods leading to the goal, which can make learning new for children accessible and exciting, and so that there can be no question of boredom.  In fact, success in training may depend not only on the methods used - you need to remember that there are simply no universal universal methods suitable for all occasions.  Success can directly depend on the personality of the teacher. </p><p>  Using game <span>teaching methods,</span> you can diversify the learning process and make it fun.  In higher and secondary special educational institutions, vocational training methods are also often active and interactive, which allows them to absorb the training material in the best way. </p><p>  The question about the methods remains very relevant, and there is simply no single answer to the question ‚Äúwhat is the best‚Äù. </p>
