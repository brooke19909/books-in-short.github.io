Time passed, and new buildings were not long in coming.  Monuments of the medieval era appear on the streets of this warm country, and after that pompous palaces and baroque estates are built.  For many centuries, the cities of Italy seemed to have collected all these incredible monuments of architecture on their territory, and today everyone can come here to see them with their own eyes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of italy" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271368.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Perhaps we will begin our tour from the north of the country, and Verona will be the first city.  Being not yet in a tropical, but in a temperate climate, far from the sea, this city is interesting both in summer and in winter.  In the cold season there is minus temperature, and even snow falls.  It is actually very fabulous to see a typical Italian landscape under a small layer of white snowflakes.  Like all cities in <span>Italy, Verona</span> combines the spirit of Antiquity and the Middle Ages.  Here the ancient Colosseum, ancient rich cathedrals and chic palaces have been perfectly preserved.  It is worth noting that Verona is one of the most romantic corners of the planet, because it was here that the fictional Romeo and Juliet once lived by Shakespeare. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy cities list" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271367.jpg" width="600"></div>

Perhaps everyone knows very well that instead of streets, countless river channels flow here, through which locals and tourists travel in gondola boats.  There are no noisy freeways and avenues, buses and any other public transport do not go.  As mentioned above, the cities of Italy are famous for their unearthly palaces, and it is Venice that surpasses them in this beauty.  Many tourists who have been here consider this paradise on water the most beautiful corner of the planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="detailed map of Italy with cities" class="if" height="476" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271366.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Undoubtedly, you should definitely see the capital of this sunny country.  Rome is the center of concentration of centuries-old history, architecture and various monuments.  It is considered one of the largest megacities of the country, as well as the center of European culture and religion.  It is important that the central part of the city, which was built back in the era of the Roman Empire, occupies a small area.  Gothic and Romanesque cathedrals adjoin it, and palaces that built prosperous feudal lords and clergy follow for them.  A large area is occupied by the new part of the city, which, incidentally, is also very interesting and beautiful.  It is worth noting that the capital is very different in architecture and culture, so it is not too similar to all other cities in Italy. </p><p>  The list of these wonderful and warm places can be continued for a very long time, and it will not be possible to completely list all the attractions.  In Italy there are many resort places where the sea and sand, as they say, are in paradise, and the sun warms almost all year round.  It is only important to say that a trip to this country will please even the most demanding tourist.  And in order not to get lost, you will need a detailed map of Italy with cities and highways, which will minimize the time spent on the road and effort. </p>
