  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Berel mounds in Kazakhstan - the gateway to the world of the dead</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kazakhstan is a real treasury that preserves archaeological values ‚Äã‚Äãthat represent an invaluable world heritage.  The IV century BC is the era of the early Iron Age, called the "Berel period" (one of the stages in the development of the culture of nomads living in the territory of <span>East Kazakhstan).</span>  And his name is associated with the location in the Katon-Karagai region of the burial ground, consisting of high mounds. </p><h2>  Burial place of the nobility </h2><p>  Berel mounds are located in the valley of the Bukhtarma river, amazing with its grandeur and peace, not far from the village of Berel.  In the reserve, which received the name of ‚ÄúValley of the Kings‚Äù with the light hand of archaeologists, approximately 100 burials have been discovered, some of which have already been discovered by scientists.  They found the remains of rulers and representatives of the clan nobility.  This open-air museum and a kind of sanctuary gradually reveals the secrets of ancient civilization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="silkadv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Berel Mounds" class="if uuid-2592260" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2592260.jpg"></div><h2>  Unique technology </h2><p>  Surprisingly, organic matter was perfectly preserved in the necropolis due to harsh climatic conditions.  Berel mounds contained a ‚Äúfrozen lens‚Äù that people created artificially.  The thing is that at an altitude of about 1000 meters there is no natural phenomenon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who buried their leaders possessed a special technology that allowed them to create artificial permafrost.  This technique is typical only for the Altai mountain system, and similar burials are not found in other places. </p><h2>  A true discovery in the world of science </h2><p>  For the first time, Berel burial mounds with centuries-old history were discovered in the 19th century.  It was at this time that the researchers predicted a corner for secrets that it would become a true discovery in the world. </p><p>  A burial mound with a diameter of at least 20 meters and a depth of up to seven meters was created for burials.  But the clay dense layer of the soil kept cold, and even in the hot summer period the graves did not have time to thaw. </p><div class="photo" data-original="katon-karagay.vko.gov.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Find Berel Mound" class="if uuid-2592246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2592246.jpg"></div><h2>  Ancient necropolis </h2><p>  In 1865, research began on the largest mound at number 11, the richest necropolis for finds.  It was a building in which noble persons of Scythian-Saka tribes found the last shelter.  Almost 100 years later, a new expedition was organized, and in the Bolshoi Berelsky mound burial places of the tsar and the tsarina were discovered, as well as 13 horses.  The jewelry found in the oval grave is made in a special, "animal" style.  The world significance of the ancient necropolis was confirmed by the excellent preservation of the bodies of the dead due to artificial permafrost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="sceloglaux.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sacrificial horses" class="if uuid-2592110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2592110.jpg"></div><p>  However, scientists still found that the burial in the large Berel mound was carried out in 294 BC.  A married couple was lying in a funeral deck made of larch soaked in a special solution.  The bodies, decorated with wooden necklaces and covered with gold foil, surrounded four bronze griffins.  And the horses were dressed in masks. </p><h2>  Burial under a glass sarcophagus </h2><p>  Another curious find of the Berelsky mound is the burial of a woman from the royal dynasty, next to which 7 sacrificial horses rest in harnesses.  This is indeed an impressive sight!  The ruler, who lived in the IV century BC, is dressed in an outfit decorated with gold, and the animals have jewelry in the Scythian style.  It is curious that the main motive is the image of a rooster, which is rare in the culture of nomads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="earth-chronicles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decorated with gold horses" class="if uuid-2592076" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2592076.jpg"></div><p>  This mound was covered with a tempered glass sarcophagus, and everyone can touch the ancient history.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãan amazing building, which has no analogues in the country, is 90 square meters, and its height exceeds 8 meters. </p><p>  According to experts, the material of one small burial opens the veil of secrecy of a highly developed civilization, the mysteries of which worry the scientific world.  The princess, awarded the sacred burial, had equal rights with men and could make important decisions.  Archaeologists have concluded that our ancestors had serious democratic foundations. </p><h2>  New finds </h2><p>  Now work continues in the valley, and scientists again surprised with a sensational find.  In one of the mounds, the remains of a woman who lived in the IV century BC were discovered.  Unfortunately, the burial was looted by jewel hunters, only a few beautiful ornaments and scraps of a fur coat were preserved.  "Saki Amazon" in another world was accompanied by two horses in luxurious harnesses. </p><p>  A dagger was found in the grave, which meant that the woman was a warrior and participated in campaigns along with men. </p><h2>  Masters with unique technology </h2><p>  It is believed that modern culture is very developed, but archaeologists who have encountered graves and found invaluable artifacts admire the skills of nomads who possessed unique technologies more than two thousand years ago. </p><p>  Excavations in a sacred place led to the conclusion that the constantly wandering people could not create stunning works of art.  Other conditions are needed to make jewelry or <span>harness for horses</span> decorated with gold.  Most likely, talented authors who worked in original workshops had their own settlements and dwellings, which archaeologists have yet to find. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stan.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Curious Finds of Berel Mound" class="if uuid-2592146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2592146.jpg"></div><p>  Local authorities are ready to turn the Berel burial mounds into a historical and archaeological museum and allocate the necessary funds for its creation.  The future complex will be a synthesis of tourism and science.  Very soon, a road bridge will appear on the road leading to the sacred place, and thousands of guests will be able to get acquainted with the rich history of Kazakhstan. </p>
