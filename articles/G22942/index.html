    <h2>  4 thousand year history </h2><p>  The formation of culture on the banks of the Nile took a long period and continued throughout the existence of the Ancient Egyptian state, in other words, from the middle of the 4th millennium BC.  e.  and until the 4th century AD  e.  All this huge period of time is usually divided into several periods: the Old (pre-dynastic), Middle, New, and Late Kingdom, and, telling about the cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt, it should be noted that each of them contributed to the common knowledge box.  Therefore, considering the cultural and scientific heritage of this highest civilization for its time, we will talk about the entire period of its history as a whole, without highlighting individual points. </p><h2>  Achievements in Astronomy </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that the main cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt relate to astronomy.  So, the observations made almost 5 thousand years ago helped to make a number of discoveries, to which European science came only many centuries later.  For example, the Egyptians managed to create the world's first zodiac circle, divided into 12 equal segments, each of which was indicated by the name of the constellation in which the Sun abides, making its annual path (the circle diagram is presented below).  In addition, the ancient astronomers with astonishing accuracy calculated the life cycle of Sirius, equal to 1460 years, and found that Venus and Mars have their own specific phases. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The world's first calendar was also created in Ancient Egypt, and in its work, ancient scientists were guided not only by observing the starry sky, but also by the seasonal floods of the Nile, on which the harvest depended.  They accurately determined the number of months in a year and days in each of them.  Subsequently, the Romans tried to appropriate this discovery, in connection with which one of the months ‚îÄ July ‚îÄ was named by them in honor of Emperor Julius Caesar. </p><h2>  Ancient Egyptian mathematicians </h2><p>  Speaking about the cultural achievements of <span>Ancient Egypt,</span> one cannot ignore their contribution to mathematics.  It was established that the decimal system of calculus, which the whole world uses today, was invented by the Egyptians.  They not only knew how to divide and multiply numbers, but could determine the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe figure and the volume of the body.  In addition, ancient mathematicians operated on such a concept as the number "pi", which they laid in the basis of the proportions of the famous Pyramid of Cheops, as well as the tombs of many other pharaohs. </p>

    <h2>  Ancient Egyptian Medicine </h2><p>  The art of treating a wide variety of diseases is also included in the list of cultural and scientific achievements of Ancient Egypt.  Many archaeological finds indicate that even in that ancient era, priests not only were well versed in anatomy, but also performed surgical operations that became available to physicians only in relatively recent times.  These include eye surgery, craniotomy and amputation of the extremities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is curious that in Ancient Egypt, a medication was used, which is the prototype of modern ampicillin.  It was nothing more than a mold that covered bread over time.  They removed it and put it on an inflamed wound, after which it quickly healed.  The scientific justification for this phenomenon was given only in the middle of the 20th century, after a laboratory study of the composition of ampicillin. </p><p>  In addition, the Egyptians were the first to note the positive impact that sport has on human health, and paid great attention to it.  The glory of Egyptian doctors was so wide that they were invited to the palaces of the rulers of neighboring states.  For example, information has been preserved about the famous Egyptian physician, Ujahorresent, who cured the Persian king of a deadly disease. </p>

    <h2>  Papyrus making </h2><p>  An important place among other cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt is occupied by the invention of papyrus ‚îÄ material on which they kept a historical chronicle, as well as scientific and domestic records.  The stalks of the lotus that grew on the banks of the Nile abound in abundance. </p><p>  The technology used by the ancient masters made it possible to produce products of such high quality that even today, after several millennia, some sheets containing invaluable scientific material are in excellent condition.  They not only read the text freely, but also the drawings made by ancient artists are quite distinguishable. </p><h2>  Encyclopedias and geographical maps of antiquity </h2><p>  Among other artifacts obtained during archaeological excavations, it was papyri who brought to us the greatest amount of information relating to all aspects of life, science and cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt.  In addition, the history of a number of states between the rivers between them is displayed more than anywhere else. </p>

    <p>  Separate collections of papyri are a kind of modern encyclopedias and contain informative information.  Geographic maps made on papyrus have also been preserved, thanks to which modern scientists have gained a more complete picture of the location of states adjacent to Egypt. </p><p>  Of particular interest to researchers is a mysterious papyrus, which presents the route of the army of the pharaoh around the entire African continent.  The fact is that there is no other information about such a grand campaign, in addition, it is surprising that the accuracy with which the outlines of Africa are represented on the map is surprising. </p><h2>  The ideology expressed in stone </h2><p>  Extraordinary construction successes at that time were also included in the number of outstanding cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt.  Briefly describing the most famous structures of the time, which, as you know, are the pyramids, it should be concluded that these grandiose buildings were primarily a powerful means of ideological propaganda.  Stone colosses directed to heaven were to inspire the people with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe inviolability and unlimited power of the pharaohs, who are the living embodiment of the gods.  It should be noted that monumentality and pomp, as a proven weapon, to this day have remained in the arsenals of ideologists around the world. </p>

    <h2>  Architectural Monuments of Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  It is interesting to note that the Chefren pyramid on the Giza plateau, which has a height of 144 meters, has long been considered the tallest building in the world, and only the 324-meter Eiffel Tower, built in 1889, took its palm.  Among the unique buildings of that era, it is worth noting the last miracle of the world that has survived to this day, which is the grandiose burial complex of the pharaoh Cheops with the figure of the sphinx rising near it.  You can not pass by and a number of other unique architectural monuments, such as the tombs of the city of Abydos, the temple of Ramses II and the buildings of the ancient capital of Thebes. </p><h2>  Ancient Egyptian writers </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt, we also recall the literary monuments preserved due to the longevity of the papyrus, which was described above.  On them, as well as on the walls of tombs and temples, texts were printed not only of religious content, but often reflecting the realities of everyday life. </p><p>  The range of genres in which ancient Egyptian authors worked is unusually wide.  It includes biographical works, teachings, legends, as well as satire and humor.  As it turned out, a sharp joke was very much appreciated in ancient Egypt.  Many works have been preserved in which the authors angrily and caustically ridiculed the vices of the control system that existed in their time.  The most famous works published in our time are: ‚ÄúConversation of the Disappointed with His Soul,‚Äù ‚ÄúSong of the Harper‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Story of Sinuheth‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  An important place in the written heritage of Ancient Egypt is given to legal treatises that allow us to fully present the features of the legal sphere of ancient society.  A characteristic feature of Egyptian literature is the custom to apply texts of works not only on papyrus, but also on the surface of stone obelisks.  So, after deciphering the hieroglyphs that covered many historical monuments, the scientists discovered pictures of military campaigns, the activities of the pharaohs, as well as the lives of ordinary Egyptians. </p><p>  Having briefly told about the cultural achievements of Ancient Egypt, we could not cover all aspects of the activities of the amazing people who lived on the banks of the Nile for more than four millennia.  Time mercilessly destroyed many monuments and once covered with sand of the desert once blooming cities, but the culture of this country became an invaluable heritage on which the building of the entire world civilization was subsequently erected. </p>
