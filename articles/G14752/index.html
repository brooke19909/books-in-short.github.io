    <h2>  When is the best time to go to the UAE? </h2><p>  The UAE is good in that the tourist season here lasts all year round.  True, there are months when the temperature, due to the desert location of the country, rises to 50-60 degrees Celsius.  Therefore, many are afraid to visit the United Arab Emirates in the summer, especially with children.  However, due to the very dry climate of the country, the heat is not felt so much.  In addition, this is a low season in the UAE.  There are almost no people, and it is natural that all the attention of the hotel staff is concentrated on you and your family.  The sea resembles fresh milk, its temperature rises above thirty, and sometimes you just do not want to get out of it for hours.  High season here is spring and autumn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The weather in the <span>UAE in September,</span> for example, is one of the most comfortable for the year.  In winter it is somewhat cool, the temperature drops to 25 degrees Celsius.  But it was at this time that it was good to go on different excursions, to visit museums and exhibitions.  The spring is a bit hotter, and the temperature of the water and air are almost the same.  We can say that at this time the velvet season begins.  And the weather in the UAE in September will allow you to feel the heat of this summer (but not the same as in July or August), the warm sea and real beach relaxation.  And the prices at this time still remain low.  Because September is a good month for those who want to extend their summer. </p>

    <h2>  Ajman - a small but promising principality </h2><p>  This is one of the most modest and calm emirates in the country.  True, it is just starting to be built, and therefore it is considered not particularly rich.  Many foreign workers come here.  True, the prospects, including with regard to recreation and tourism, are huge.  It is also the smallest emirate that fits between Sharjah and Dubai.  But here there is a beautiful pristine nature, pristine beaches and water in the sea, palm trees everywhere.  The hotel staff is polite and welcoming, and the atmosphere seems to be created for relaxation, coziness and comfort.  Locals often have picnics right on the beach when evening comes.  Privacy and a private beach are the hallmarks of many hotels, especially five-star hotels, such as the Bahi Ajman Palace Hotel 5 * (Ajman).  Opened many restaurants and hookahs with panoramic sea views.  And there is also a port for traditional Arab dhow boats - it is even considered a local attraction. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are walking streets in Ajman: Cornish, Al Khali Road.  This emirate is interesting in that there is no ‚Äúdry law‚Äù that is common for the UAE.  Alcohol can be bought here not only in duty free.  Some stores sell imported drinks without restrictions.  True, they can be drunk only within the emirate, and they cannot be exported.  Ajman has its own good shopping centers, although tourists by inertia still travel to Dubai or Sharjah.  Lovers of antiquities are strongly encouraged to local museum of local lore with an excellent collection of weapons and ancient manuscripts.  And near the city there are mineral springs. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Resort Bahi Ajman Palace Hotel 5 * is located on the shores of the Arabian Gulf.  From any of its points open very picturesque views.  It is located not far from two international hubs - 22 kilometers from Dubai, and 11 from Sharjah.  But if you are flying on a charter flight, then know that they are all transferred to suburban airports, and it takes them much longer to travel to the hotel, about two hours.  And so the transfer from the hotel takes 45-50 minutes, if without traffic jams.  If the groups are large, then the hotel provides a large bus, and if there are few people, then good quality cars.  Near the hotel there is a beautiful promenade.  When walking on it, they say "towards Dubai" or "Sharjah."  The fact is that it really is so located and stretches almost from one emirate to another.  Well, if you move a little from the sea, then there are a lot of shops and supermarkets, including those with high-quality and cheap children's toys.  You can also buy souvenirs and sweets.  If you only have breakfast, then next to the hotel there are fish and Chinese restaurants.  They are inexpensive and with good food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahi Ajman Palace Hotel 5 Restaurant" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2030948.jpg" width="600"></div>
