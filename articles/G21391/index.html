The fact is that the previous modification is still relevant and is in great demand in the European and American markets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D300S" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1000407.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Key differences from its predecessor </h2><p>  The new camera in comparison with the previous modification has several fundamental differences.  In particular, it increased the speed of work.  A device for connecting an external microphone, a button for directly starting video recording, an HDMI slot appeared on the device, as well as two connectors for installing additional memory (CF and SD cards).  In addition, the user has the ability to record videos with a resolution of 1280x720 in HD format with automatic focusing in contrast.  There are some more interesting innovations.  More details about the new product will be discussed later. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The model has a one-piece housing made of magnesium alloy, and therefore light weight and high strength have become characteristic features of the <span>Nikon</span> D300S.  The reviews of the owners of the device indicate that with minor drops it will not suffer.  Another interesting feature of the new items are rather large buttons that are convenient to press even with gloves on.  In other words, the developers provided for the possibility of operation in cold weather conditions, which is very important for our country.  The rubber gasket noticeably decreased and remained only at the site of the influx under the thumb.  Work with two memory cards is carried out as they are filled in the order established by the user.  If you need to store very important frames, they can be automatically saved in different formats on both drives.  Due to the appearance of the Info buttons and the direct start of video recording, the model lost its compartment lock with memory cards.  Be that as it may, its accidental discovery is excluded here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D300S Lenses" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1000408.jpg" width="600"></div>

Lenses from the arsenal of the manufacturer, in turn, allow you to achieve a variety of creative effects. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2><p>  The device is very comfortable in the hands.  Feedback from the owners of the model suggests that even a beginner will not think about which button and where it is located after a few days of using the camera.  Especially easy in terms of ergonomics to get used to the device will be the owners of other mirror models Nikon.  The soft rubber on which the housing is located protects the device from slipping out of hands.  Even with the use of large-sized lenses, working with the camera and transporting it is very convenient, and due to its light weight, your hands do not get tired. </p><h2>  Menu </h2><p>  A large degree of congestion can be called a characteristic feature of the menu of the Nikon D300S.  Parameter settings are very wide.  The user has the ability to save them in the form of profiles and call them full names.  Due to this, the preparation for shooting requires a minimum amount of time.  The HELP key significantly helps to understand the mastery of the menu, because it is able to display a text explanation to any of its items.  This feature will become especially relevant for beginner photographers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D300S settings" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1000409.jpg" width="600"></div>

The viewing angles are about 170 degrees.  Despite the lack of anti-reflective coating, even in sunlight, the information remains readable.  In addition, the device has an additional screen of monochromatic type.  It is highlighted in green and serves to enable the photographer to quickly evaluate the main shooting parameters.  It also displays information on the state of charge of the battery, recording format, the amount of available memory and some other nuances. </p><p>  The <span>Nikon D300S</span> viewfinder boasts one hundred percent frame coverage, as well as vivid and comprehensive shooting information.  It should be noted that for most competitors of the model this feature is not characteristic.  Novice users can be confused by the rather large amount of information displayed here.  As for the display of the viewfinder frame itself, it shows the framing grid and information about how full the memory is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D300S reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1000412.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  At the heart of the camera lies the <span>CMOS matrix, whose</span> effective resolution is 12.3 million pixels.  In combination with the proprietary EXPEED processor, it allows you to create sharp and rich photos, which are characterized by a minimum amount of digital noise and subtle gradation of shades.  Photosensitivity in the standard mode ranges from 200 to 3200 units, and in the advanced mode - from 100 to 6400. The focusing system, consisting of 51 points, has been slightly improved compared to the previous modification.  At the same time, the developers provided the possibility of manual and automatic focusing of the Nikon D300S.  The instructions for the device, in turn, will allow you to easily deal with the virtual electronic level, implemented in this model, designed to facilitate landscape shooting. </p><p>  The camera is equipped with a rechargeable battery with a capacity of 1,500 mAh.  As practice shows, its resource is usually enough to create up to one thousand pictures.  Experts call this figure very impressive, since few cameras can boast of something similar. </p>

    <h2>  Modes </h2><p>  The reviews of experts and owners of the device indicate that the Nikon D300S model has proven itself in all modes.  The only feature in this regard can be called not quite the usual switching.  In particular, instead of the familiar PASM wheel, a special locking button is used here.  It allows you to activate the single-frame (P), low-speed burst (CL), high-speed burst (CH) and silent (Q) shooting modes.  The user has the opportunity to apply tinting and filter effects to his taste.  Among other things, one cannot fail to note other functions with flexibly customizable parameters. </p><h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  As noted above, in comparison with its predecessor, the new product has improved video capabilities, the level of which corresponds to modern cameras.  Be that as it may, its frequency is considered far from the most powerful side of the Nikon D300S.  It is 24 frames per second.  In this case, the so-called floating shutter effect becomes more noticeable.  The device is capable of creating videos in HD format with a maximum resolution of 1280x720.  The length of the video file is limited to twenty minutes.  The developers have also provided for the sighting mode on the LCD screen, during which all shooting information, composition grid and live histogram are reproduced on it.  Filmed in low light or a shallow <span>depth of field, the</span> rollers look just fine.  This is achieved primarily through a good matrix.  In all other respects, the video quality corresponds to most modern similar devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D300S manual" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/1000411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be noted that the Nikon D300 modification was and remains such a cool camera for its price category that it did not require special improvements.  Anyway, Japanese engineers managed to improve the image quality and speed of the Nikon D300S, as well as expand the functionality of the device.  These features in combination with a relatively low cost make the device very popular in the modern market. </p>
