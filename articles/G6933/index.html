To make the process of driving on a car comfortable, safe and confident, the headlights should well illuminate the roadway.  Therefore, the choice of lamps should be approached very responsibly.  Often in many modern cars, <span>H7 bulbs are</span> installed as the head light <span>.</span>  Which is better, try to find out based on the ratings. </p><h2>  <span>H7</span> car <span>lamps:</span> specifications and description </h2><p>  Element H7 is a single filament lamp.  It is intended for installation in four-headlamp optics of head light in cars where there is a separate reflector system for high and low beam.  However, in the vast majority of cases, these lamps are installed only in the near. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h7 bulbs which are better" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1688966.jpg" width="600"></div>  For products of this type, a flange is characteristic.  But the distance from the flange to the spiral is constant and fixed.  This is done so that the glow point is always in focus.

    <p>  Modern industry offers a variety of lamps with an H7 socket in different versions.  All of them are manufactured according to their technologies, have certain parameters that characterize light, as well as power.  Although the standard power for bulbs of this type is 55 watts.  On sale you can find models with higher rates.  But it is recommended to use them only in off-road conditions.  In an ordinary car, which is designed to move around the city, the use of such bulbs will only lead to the on-board electrics being disabled due to overloads. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are three types of lamps on the automotive market.  These are halogen models, xenon and modern LED products.  Let's try to determine the best H7 bulbs based on the data obtained in the tests. </p><h2>  BOSCH Plus 90 </h2><p>  In 2009, the company showed the world a new product from the line of halogen products with enhanced light output characteristics.  The lamps in this series are truly the brightest from this brand.  Light output characteristics are 90% higher than standard lamps. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h7 bulbs which are better for priors" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1688968.jpg" width="600"></div>  Due to the innovations used by the manufacturer, the product creates a longer and wider light cone.  At the same time, the road is illuminated 50% more efficiently.  If you install this lamp in the headlight, the driver will have more time to make a decision.  After all, with such optics, he will notice an obstacle much earlier.

    <p>  The light that the bulbs from this series generate is white when compared with standard models.  The company has applied innovative solutions.  The flask is filled with xenon, the design of the spiral is optimized, the spraying of the flask is partially blue.  Light is close in temperature to daylight.  This makes the eyes less tired and makes moving more comfortable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best h7 bulbs" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1688964.jpg" width="595"></div>  As a result of tests conducted by experts, the light bulb in this series was able to show the best brightness results - 1,500 lumens.  As for the indicators of illumination on the right side of the road, here, too, everything is much better than other representatives.  In general, this lamp showed good results, and its characteristics are several times higher than the requirements.  In addition, the product is completely safe for all surrounding drivers.

    <p>  This halogen bulb turned out to be one of those that have a good value for money.  It is offered at an affordable price (one thousand rubles per set), while it is able to provide high-quality coverage of the roadway and the right shoulder.  The product is safe for oncoming drivers.  These are reliable and affordable H7 bulbs.  Which is better to choose?  Motorists say the Hella is a pretty good option. </p><h2>  Osram Night Breaker Unlimited </h2><p>  The manufacturer claims that these halogen lamps can form a light beam with a range of up to 40 meters or more, when compared with standard products.  In this case, the color temperature will be higher than on the same standard options.  The driver will be able to detect an obstacle in advance and respond in time to it.  The manufacturer uses a special patented coating in this series.  It reduces glare from reflected light. </p><p>  In tests, this lamp proved to be worthy.  Its luminous flux is one of the highest and amounts to 1,500 lm.  Indicators on the level of illumination of the right shoulder are also on top.  Many use these H7 bulbs.  Which is better - Osram or Hella?  Experts assure that the models from the first series are also a good choice. </p><h2>  2nd Generation Osram SilverStar </h2><p>  The manufacturer indicates that this light bulb can generate 60% more light compared to standard ones.  As for the luminous flux, it is longer by as much as 20 meters.  In this case, the manufacturer indicates the service life, which has doubled when compared with past models. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best h7 bulbs" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1688965.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is stated that the operation of these lamps will make driving more safe.  These lamps are an ideal product for headlights with colorless diffusers.  But in real tests, this model proved to be very ambiguous.  With one of the strongest light fluxes of 1,490 lm, the illumination level of the right shoulder turned out to be weak.  According to experts and in numbers, this lamp does not greatly exceed the performance of standard halogen products.

    <h2>  H7 xenon bulbs: which are better </h2><p>  As for xenon, the choice is small.  There is one single representative who takes a place in the ranking.  This is MTF Light H7.  There are other companies, but they often offer frankly low-quality products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h7 bulbs which are better on prior" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1688967.jpg" width="500"></div>  This model best of all meets all the requirements.  There is a high color temperature, the light is as close to natural as possible.  This lamp produces a fairly high brightness - 2800 lm.  Even high brightness <span>halogen lamps</span> are not capable of such a result.  In addition, the happy life.  The manufacturer claims that the product is able to work up to 20,000 hours.  But this is five times more compared to halogen solutions.  And finally, another advantage of this model is the price of 900 rubles per set.

    <h2>  H7 LED bulbs: which are better </h2><p>  Nowadays, LED optics is one of the most promising areas in automotive technology.  This is due to the high indicators of durability, lamp protection from vibration and shock.  Also, diode products are capable of producing a high-quality light beam with a high glow temperature and brightness. </p><h2>  Clearlight h7 </h2><p>  This model meets all modern requirements that apply to optics using LEDs.  The lamp is quite powerful - the brightness is from 2800 or 4300 lm depending on the model and modification.  The service life is also striking in these products - up to 30,000 hours are claimed.  The model is very economical.  Consumption is only 30 watts. </p><h2>  DLED H7 9.5W </h2><p>  This is an example of what a car lamp should not be.  Of course, it gives out light at 4500 K, its price is about 3 thousand rubles.  But the power is only 9.5 watts.  This makes the device economical, but there is no benefit.  The brightness of this model is only 990 lm.  It is too little.  Experts do not recommend purchasing these H7 bulbs.  Which are better for the Priors?  Certainly not these. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="h7 bulbs which shine better" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1688962.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is not enough to purchase and insert such an LED lamp into the connector - the headlight optics should be designed for these lamps.  In the standard optics ‚ÄúPriors‚Äù such products will do the owner more harm than good.

    <h2>  Another rating </h2><p>  The best H7 bulbs among the standard ones are those from the Phillips Vision series.  Among the models with enhanced light flux, Phillips Extreme Vision products can be distinguished.  The best life models are products from the Long Life series and models from Osram - the Ultra Life series.  Among xenon ones, MTF Light products are considered better. </p><h2>  About the choice of lamps </h2><p>  When choosing, the consumer always wants to purchase the best model.  It is recommended to consider factors that are among the most important.  This is brightness, light comfort, lamp durability, price. </p><p>  You should not buy inexpensive models, especially if the product is of dubious quality.  Your safety while driving depends on which lamp will stand in the headlight.  Choosing the right lamp, you need to focus on the reputation of a particular brand.  However, sometimes there are specimens that shine better than models from a well-known manufacturer.  As for the life of the H7 bulb - which shine better, those have a shorter life.  And vice versa, if it is a lamp with an extended service life, then it has an underestimated brightness.  The best lamp is a standard solution, especially if it is installed on a domestic car. </p>
