Now Odessa residents and city guests do not need to go to one of the amusement parks at neighboring resorts.  Waterpark 7km "Odessa" was built near one of the most famous markets of Ukraine, also located on the seventh kilometer of the Ovidiopolsky road. </p><h2>  A beach in the middle of the field - it's possible! </h2><p>  Just look at the selection of photos of the water park, as it becomes clear that the new park is no worse than many foreign analogues.  In fact, this is a whole entertainment complex that will delight you with rides in the form of slides, and pools with hydromassage and waves will replace the spa and the sea.  On the territory there are 6 zones for beach holidays, sand is poured on two beaches, which maximizes the atmosphere of relaxation by the sea.  And let the Odessa water park (7 km) not be built on the shore, this location has its advantages. </p>

    <p>  The entertainment complex is easily accessible by bus, minibus, taxi or your car.  In summer, there are free buses, the route and schedule of which can be found on the official website of the water park.  For guests of the complex provides a fairly large parking for up to 200 cars. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How much is a water park in Odessa? </h2><p>  If you are planning to spend the day on the beaches and slides of the complex, you will need to fork out for a ticket, meals, if you arrive by car, then also to the parking lot.  The water park is open from 10 to 18, you can come all day or for a period from 14 to 18, although the price difference will come out only 40-50 UAH.

Adults will cost 360-400 UAH, depending on the season and excluding discounts.  You can pay for tickets in cash or by credit card. </p><p>  There is no difference between weekdays and weekends, there are discounts for children who are determined not by age, but by height (up to 140 cm).  Children under three years old and those who have reached the age of 18 years on the day of arrival at the Odessa Water Park (7 km) are admitted free of charge.  Prices are quite high, but the proximity to the city, the variety of entertainment and cleanliness justify them. </p><h2>  Luxury Holidays </h2><p>  For lovers of maximum comfort, a VIP sector is provided, the cost of the corresponding tickets is approximately 150 UAH higher than usual.

    <h2>  The main highlight of the park - slides </h2><p>  Someone goes to the Odessa water park (7 km) for the pools and beaches, but the vast majority of guests are interested in the <span>water slides.</span>  For adults, 10 slides are open, divided into two complexes.  The farthest from the entrance consists of Vindigo and the three most extreme slides of the park: Kamikaze, Blue Rocket and Red Rocket.  "Vindigo" consists of six separate closed pipes, which are combined into a common wide slide with dividers.  On it you can arrange races with friends, well dispersed on special rugs.  Most adrenaline can be obtained on the "Red Rocket", flying out of the preparatory capsule at an angle of about 80 degrees, which borders on the feeling of falling.  Before the descent, check on the scales and briefing.  For example, the "Red Rocket" is passed with a weight of 50 to 90 kg. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The second complex will please the “Barrel”, “Funnel”, “Boomerang” and three slides, named for their color: red, orange and green.  “Boomerang” got its name due to alternating ups and downs, “Bochka” will twist in two closed containers and dark pipes, with a total length of 200 m, and “Funnel” will drag into a whirlpool and double the sensation of changing lighting. </p><p>  After the descent, vacationers fall into the arms of the river, slowly enveloping the hills and pools of the park. </p><h2>  The best is for children! </h2><p>  For younger guests, the water park (7 km) “Odessa” will be remembered as “Pirate Island” - a whole complex of slides and other water activities.  The depth of the pool is 40 cm, and for those who are still afraid to drown, racks with vests are installed nearby.  Most of the attractions of the “island” are designed for children up to 120 cm tall, so schoolchildren no longer find the slides interesting when riding with parents at adult complexes.  For kids, competitions and events with animators are often held.  Information about such entertainment can be found on the site of the water park or on its pages in social networks. </p>

    <p>  The children's area is surrounded by one of the beaches with many sun loungers, so it is convenient for parents to look after their children.  Also pleased with the proximity of the restaurant and toilets. </p><h2>  Useful information about the water park (7 km) "Odessa" </h2><p>  It is forbidden to bring drinks and food to the territory, with the exception of baby food.  It is better to eat in advance, since the prices in the restaurants of the water park are high. </p><p>  In addition to bathing suits, do not forget towels.  They can not be taken only to guests of the VIP zone.  Hair dryers are in the locker rooms. </p><p>  The best way to remember for a long time a trip to the water park "Odessa" (7 km) - photo.  You can shoot on your own photo and video equipment, but it’s even better to take the opportunity to record frames shot with numerous cameras of the complex on a flash drive. </p><p>  In the midst of summer, the maximum number of visitors is going to be prepared, be prepared for the fact that standing in line for the most interesting attractions can drag on for an hour or more. </p>
