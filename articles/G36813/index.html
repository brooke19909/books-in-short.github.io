    <h2>  Voronezh: the history of the name of the city </h2><p>  As for the etymology of the toponym ‚ÄúVoronezh‚Äù, today there is not a single more or less clearly reasoned hypothesis, although systematic research in this area has been conducted for more than a century and a half.  In particular, in the 19th century, the Russian linguist-Slavic I. Sreznevsky believed that it came from the name of the bird "Raven".  Somewhat later, this point of view was supported by the German linguist M. Fasmer. </p><p>  In 1947, Leningrad researcher A. Popov suggested that the geographical name ‚ÄúVoronezh‚Äù is associated with the Mordvian word ‚Äúvir‚Äù, which translates as forest.  This hypothesis was controversial, and it found both supporters and opponents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1971, V. Zagorovsky, in a monograph on ancient Voronezh and its history, suggested that the toponym is associated with the name ‚ÄúVoroneg‚Äù that has not yet been identified. </p><p>  An interesting hypothesis was put forward by the local historian Y. Mulkidzhanyan, who suggested a connection between the name of the city and the word "varu", which in Iranian sounds like wide. </p><p>  In 2009, <span>A. Lazarev</span> proposed using the ‚Äúnominalistic method‚Äù of M. M√ºller to determine the mythoepic ‚Äúancestors‚Äù of the hypothetical hero Voronega.  In addition, he was a supporter of the consideration of the etymological relationship of the hydronyms Vranje (Serbia), Crow (Russia), Varna (Bulgaria), Varnov (Germany), etc. from the point of view of their origin from the Indo-European root, meaning "water".  Here is a story of the name of the city of Voronezh. </p><p>  They usually don‚Äôt tell briefly for children, limiting themselves, as a rule, to mentioning the version that Voronezh is a combination of the words ‚Äúgate‚Äù and ‚Äúonezh‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  First written mention </h2><p>  The history of the city of Voronezh, according to some historians, begins long before 1177.  This is evidenced by the chronicle, which mentions the battle of the Vladimir and Ryazan princes, culminating in the escape of Yaropolk Ryazan to the village of Voronezh.  In addition, in the memoirs of the outstanding European medieval traveler the monk Julian, written in 1235, there is a record that a third of the army of Batu Khan stopped against the Don River next to the castle that belonged to the "Principality of Russians".  Researchers, the subject of study of which is the history of the city of Voronezh, believe that we are talking about it.  Another annalistic record of this settlement dates back to 1284.  There, when describing the massacre of the Tatars with the <span>inhabitants of the Kursk</span> principality, "Voronezh forests" are mentioned. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Base </h2><p>  The description and history of the city of Voronezh are of great interest to tourists who want to visit it.  However, there is still no consensus on how many years Voronezh has existed.  The history of the city has been officially calculated since 1585.  The reason is the entry in the discharge order, according to which the  unsubscription of Ryazan side maneuvers ... to the new city of Voronezh ‚Äôshould be made.  Around the same time, the construction of the fortress begins there.  The management of its construction was entrusted to the first Voronezh governor Semen Saburov.  Peasants from the cities of Pereslavl Ryazansky, Dankov, Ryazhsk, as well as carpenters, streltsy and other service people were sent to build a new city. </p><h2>  In the 16th century </h2><p>  In 1590, Voronezh (the history of the city in previous centuries is not well known) was destroyed by the Kanev Circassians.  The reason for its early restoration, historians consider the fact that the village was on a brisk trade route, in the confluence of <span>the Voronezh</span> and Don <span>rivers</span> .  This reason served the further development of the city. </p><p>  In the middle of the 16th century, trade in Voronezh reached large sizes, but soon in the south of Russia the Ostrogog Circassians began to build new cities, vested with the right to duty-free trade and shredding.  Voronezh was deprived of such privileges, so its economic prosperity was in serious jeopardy. </p>

    <h2>  Events of the beginning of the 17th century </h2><p>  The economy of medieval Voronezh was also undermined by the events that took place in the Time of Troubles.  The fact is that the famine caused by the poor grain harvest in the central regions of the Moscow state forced their residents to flee south.  As a result, several thousand people without shelter and without means of subsistence appeared in Voronezh.  This led to a shortage of food in the city, and the so-called tithe service introduced by Boris Godunov became the ‚Äúlast straw in the chalice of patience‚Äù.  As a result, residents supported False Dmitry the First, and then refused to submit to Shuisky.  Some time later, in 1610, Voronezh residents accepted False Dmitry the Second, who was preparing himself a refuge in Voronezh, collecting food and weapons there.  However, he could not use them, since he was killed on December 22. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Until the era of Peter </h2><p>  The further history of the city (Voronezh, the year of foundation - 1585) was marked by numerous uprisings.  So, in 1648, the townspeople unsuccessfully tried to get rid of the power of the governor Vasily Gryaznoy, and in 1670-1671 they took an active part in the Peasant War, which was led by Stepan Razin.  This was facilitated by the fact that the chieftain's uncle lived in the city.  However, the local governors managed to prevent rebellion in the city, and the tsarist troops under the leadership of governor G. Romanovsky were able to finally suppress the rebellion around Voronezh. </p><h2>  At the end of the 17th century </h2><p>  Population statistics and the history of the city of Voronezh began to be more or less accurately tracked and documented from the second half of the 17th century.  In particular, it is known that in 1677 there were more than 300 clerks, townsmen and peasant households, as well as 15 churches, of which 3 were monastic. </p><p>  In 1682, the Voronezh diocese was formed, the first head of which was Bishop Mitrofan.  In addition, it is known that in 1683 the number of the Voronezh Regiment was 1099 soldiers, of which 580 were from the city itself and from the surrounding villages. </p>

    <h2>  Under Peter the Great </h2><p>  In 1696-1725, Voronezh occupied land on the right bank of the river of the same name in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmodern Admiralty Square.  In the years 1696-1722, Peter the Great repeatedly visited the city, having spent there, in total, more than 500 days.  During this period, Voronezh at times became virtually the capital of the Russian state.  In particular, it was there that the most important union treaty with Denmark was signed in 1699. </p><p>  In general, the history of the city of Voronezh could have been completely different if not for Peter the Great, who decided to begin the construction of a navy there.  It was built for operations on the Black and Azov Seas against Turkey.  The work was so large-scale that even new cities appeared at shipyards - Pavlovsk and Tavrov.  In total, about 200 galleys and multi-gun ships were built on them.  A fleet built near Voronezh helped Russia take control of Azov, a powerful Turkish fortress located at the confluence of the Don into the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><p>  In 1711, the city receives the status of a provincial and becomes the administrative center of the territorially vast enough Azov province.  After 14 years, it is renamed Voronezh, however, in 1779, during the course of administrative reforms, its size underwent a sharp reduction. </p><h2>  In the first half of the 19th century </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, the first gymnasiums and public schools were opened in Voronezh, and from 1802 the first professional theater began to work there.  An interesting event was marked by 1804, when candlelight was introduced on 9 main streets.  The peaceful life of the Voronezh people was violated by the invasion of Napoleon.  It is known that during the Patriotic War of 1812 the city was an ambassador to the front of 10 regiments of the militia. </p><p>  In the memory of contemporaries, the first half of the 19th century also remained thanks to miracles associated with the incorrupt relics of St. Mitrofan, which are mentioned in the history of the city (Voronezh).  There were also reasons to consider the Metropolitan holy during his lifetime, but it was in 1830 that a huge number of believers arrived in Voronezh who wanted to ask him for intercession.  The influx of a large number of believers gave impetus to the development of the cholera epidemic. </p><p>  Every day, 300-400 people died from this disease in the city.  Thanks to the efforts of Governor Begichev, cholera was defeated, and a special hospital with 200 beds was built in Voronezh. </p><p>  The history of the city (Voronezh can be described in details for a very long time) also mentions the arrival of Emperor Nicholas I there.  The monarch visited him with the aim of participating in the opening ceremony of the relics of St. Mitrofan. </p>

    <h2>  Voronezh before the Revolution of 1905 </h2><p>  In 1863, a census was conducted.  The history of the city of Voronezh, a brief summary of which from the moment of its foundation until the mid-19th century you already know, gives the following data about this event: a total of 38,672 people were registered, i.e., the population was 12th in the number of inhabitants in Russia. </p><p>  In 1860-1870, railways were laid across the territory of the <span>Voronezh province</span> .  Good transport accessibility led to the appearance of large industrial enterprises there, and in 1881 the operation of the horse railway was started. </p><p>  In anticipation of the new century, the <span>population of Voronezh,</span> according to the census, was 84,100 people.  The urban territory was mainly located on the right bank of the river of the same name and 5 settlements adjoined it. </p><p>  In total, there were over 5,500 houses in the city, of which more than half were stone. </p><h2>  During the period of revolutionary events and during the Civil War </h2><p>  In the fall of 1905, riots began in Voronezh, culminating in the Black Hundred pogrom.  In the same year, a rebellion arose in the disciplinary battalion stationed there, which was soon suppressed.  Later, in December 1905, a political strike took place in the city. </p><p>  No less turbulent events began to occur in Voronezh after it became known there about the overthrow of the Provisional Government in Petrograd.  In particular, already on October 30, 1917 (according to the old style), Soviet power was established there.  In addition, the city of Voronezh (history briefly presented above) was one of the first cities in which a special detachment of the Red Army was formed. </p><h2>  In the pre-war years </h2><p>  <span>The first five-year plans were</span> marked in Voronezh by large-scale work on the improvement of the city and the modernization of its public utilities.  Along with this, in 1926, long-distance telephone communication was conducted in Voronezh, and tram traffic was also opened.  Around the same time, the city, where according to the census data, 120,000 people lived, became the administrative center of the Central Black Earth Region, and several large industrial enterprises were built and commissioned there. </p><p>  This led to the influx into Voronezh of labor from neighboring villages, due to which in 1939 the number of residents exceeded 362,000. </p><h2>  War years </h2><p>  As during the war with Napoleon, Voronezh residents rose as one to fight against fascism.  Already in September 1941, a volunteer regiment went to the front, which became part of the 100th Infantry Division.  Subsequently, this military formation was awarded the title of Guards, and it ended the war, liberating the Austrian capital Vienna, in the spring of 1945.  However, long before this, the city and its inhabitants were in terrible danger, since in the fall the Nazis managed to get close to the walls of Voronezh.  This event did not break the determination of residents to defend their small homeland.  Confirmation of this was the parade on the main city square on November 7, 1941, held at the direction of the rate. </p><p>  When they talk about Voronezh, the history of the city for children usually does not contain a mention of the horrors that residents had to endure after the right-bank areas were occupied by fascists.  At the same time, Soviet troops did not stop trying to drive the enemy out of there.  Thanks to their efforts, Voronezh was released on January 25, 1943. </p><p>  It turned out that about 92% of the total housing stock, as well as almost all public buildings, were destroyed.  Although the restoration of Voronezh began immediately after liberation, only in 1950 the face of the city was able to get rid of the scars received during the fighting. </p>

    <h2>  Recent story </h2><p>  Until perestroika, almost every year new industrial enterprises were opened in the city, including high-tech ones, designed to serve the space industry. </p><p>  Voronezh (the history of the name of the city is already known to you) expanded significantly in the 60s and 70s.  As a result, comfortable microdistricts appeared.  A little later, in 1972, the creation of the <span>Voronezh reservoir was completed.</span>  It has become a favorite vacation spot for citizens.  However, at the same time, the main sights of Voronezh were lost - the buildings of the Admiralty of Peter the Great, the remains of the Church of the Recovery of the Dead and the Admiralty Church. </p><p>  The city found itself in a stalemate in the 90s, but today most of the problems have already been overcome. </p><h2>  Description of the city today </h2><p>  Since the beginning of the new millennium, Voronezh (the history of the city in the street names is reflected quite fully) again began to actively build up.  In particular, modern shopping centers and business centers were founded there.  In recent years, the transport system of the city has been restored and modernized.  There are many new cinemas, restaurants and cafes, as well as other entertainment venues in which both adults and children can organize their leisure time. </p><p>  Modern Voronezh is a city of students, as there are 36 universities.  Among the most famous of them - State University and Medical Academy.  Burdenko.  In addition to residents of the Russian Federation, about 1,500 foreign students study there, most of whom are citizens of far abroad countries. </p><p>  The city of Voronezh is actively landscaping.  In particular, in most yards and parks there are playgrounds, beautiful flowerbeds and flower beds are laid out, and even in the most remote neighborhoods evening lighting is organized, which for many years was considered an insoluble problem. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the city of Voronezh for children" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1462819.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The history of the oldest educational institution in the city of Voronezh </h2><p>  In 1703, a school was opened in Voronezh.  It became the first educational institution in the history of the city and the region to train lower-ranking officers.  Pupils of the school, who were selected from among the dragoons, received from the capital the first alphabets, primers and arithmetic.  The foundation of this educational institution, where only young men and young men could study, was studied by F. M. Apraksin.  Initially, there were 90 students and the emphasis was mainly on their mastery of the basics of arithmetic. </p><p>  The first school of Voronezh was able at the initial stages to provide the young Russian fleet and shipyards with competent specialists in the field of engineering so necessary in those days, and went down in history as one of the children of Peter the Great. </p><p>  Now you know the history of the city of Voronezh.  For children, a summary of the annals of this settlement is interesting to imagine quite easily.  After all, they contain references to events related to the creation of the Russian fleet and the heroic struggle of the inhabitants of Voronezh during the Great Patriotic War. </p>
