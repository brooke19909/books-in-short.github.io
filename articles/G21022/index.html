    <h2>  Award institution </h2><p>  The medal “For Labor Valor” (photos of it are presented in this article) was one of the first awards in the Soviet Union, which appeared in the pre-war years.  In 1938, the Presidium of the <span>Supreme Soviet of the USSR</span> issued a decree establishing a medal and compiled an initial list of those who could claim to be awarded it.  Subsequently, some changes were made to the award regulations. </p><p>  The medal was intended for those who valiantly and selflessly worked.  Potential nominees for the award included collective farm workers, scientific and cultural figures, specialists in the national economy, education, medicine and others.  Also awarded could be those who were not a citizen of the USSR. </p><h2>  Award Basis </h2>

    <h2>  First awards </h2><p>  By affirming the medal “For Labor Valor”, the USSR thereby led the working class to the forefront of socialist construction, which, in fact, strengthened its position among the people.  “Younger” in status was the medal “For Labor Distinction”.  Both medals became prototypes of military analogues - medals “For Courage” and “For Military Merit”. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The medal project was developed by the artist Ivan Dubasov.  The first award took place in January 1939.  The first medal “For Labor Valor” was immediately received by 22 people - workers of the Mikhail Kalinin plant near Moscow.  Factory workers were awarded a high award for the invention of new weapons. </p><p>  Literally two days later, a new decree on awarding was issued.  For the progressive development and development of the method of underground coal gasification, 14 people were noted at the Podzemgaz office in the Donbass.  Rural workers in Uzbekistan in the amount of 87 people were awarded three days later.  A few days later the heroes found the award in Magadan, where 81 people from the Dalstroy road and industrial production enterprise excelled. </p><p>  Before the start of World War II, eight thousand people were awarded in the industrial and agricultural sphere.  At the beginning of 1995, the number of recipients was already more than 1.82 million people. </p><h2>  Modern award </h2>

    <p>  Obviously, after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the insignia and awards of the Soviet state lost their force.  To issue them, of course, also stopped.  The concept of rewarding for labor achievements is a thing of the past, leaving only reminders about itself. </p><p>  However, after some time they decided to return the medal.  In 2000, a similar medal was established by the Russian Ministry of Defense.  The medal "For Labor Valor" of the Ministry of Defense is designed to reward civilians working in the armed forces of the Russian Federation.  Among the merits worthy of this distinction are conscientious and continuous work, professional achievements in the field of scientific and industrial developments, as well as in the field of personnel training. </p><p>  A special order of the military department is issued on the nomination of the applicant for the award.  The medal is personally presented by the Minister of Defense.  As before, it is located on the chest on the left side, after all state distinctions, if any. </p><h2>  The appearance of the new medal </h2>

    <p>  The medal “For Labor Valor” of the Ministry of Defense of Russia is slightly smaller than its Soviet predecessor and is 3.2 centimeters in diameter.  It is made of dark bronze.  In the center on the obverse, <span>a</span> standard of the Ministry of Defense framed by <span>an oak wreath is</span> embossed.  Relief inscriptions - in two lines in the center the name of the award, on the top "Ministry of Defense" and on the bottom of the "Russian Federation" - are located on the back. </p><p>  In 2014, the decree on awarding a medal was amended by a decree of the Minister of Defense, Sergei Shoigu.  In particular, the list of persons who may qualify for this insignia has been significantly expanded.  For example, specialists in the fields of culture, education, art, and health can also receive the Russian medal “For Labor Valor”.  In addition, workers in industry and research, who carry out direct orders of the military department, can also be marked with a medal. </p><h2>  Privilege </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that one of the first awards was precisely the medal “For Labor Valor”, the benefits do not apply to it, at least in monetary terms.  The only thing her cavalier can count on is the right to be awarded the title of Veteran of Labor, as well as the priority in receiving anniversary marks of distinction by the round date from the day the Great Patriotic War ended. </p><p>  If there is a medal “For Labor Valor” in the arsenal, benefits in the form of cash payments or compensations can still be obtained.  To do this, you must apply for recognition as a veteran of labor.  Women can apply for a title upon reaching the age of 55, men - 60 years. </p><p>  At the same time, a Defense Ministry medal received by a civilian already gives more privileges.  The holder of the medal “For Labor Valor” upon reaching retirement age will receive up to 75% of the official salary. </p>
