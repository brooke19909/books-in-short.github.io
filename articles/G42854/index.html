    <p>  One of the advantages of using such a card is that when paying at the store for a product or service, 10 percent of the amount in the check is returned to the card balance, as bonuses from the bank, which can be used to pay for other products in the future.  In addition, the card holder can quickly and easily pay for mobile services with it by sending only an SMS message to a short number.  He can also <span>transfer money to</span> another person, knowing only his phone number, pay for online purchases, and other opportunities will be at the disposal of the user of such a profitable product as the Molodezhnaya card (Sberbank).

    <p>  There is one more "trick" card - this is the ability to choose its design.  Sberbank offers two types of design - standard and individual.  When choosing an individual design of a plastic card, the future owner can upload his photo or choose from the drawings that Sberbank offers.  But it is worth emphasizing that for an individual design you will have to pay an additional 500 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, you have filled out the application.  Now you need to wait for a response from a bank specialist who will check the information that you provided. </p><p>  You can also get a card by contacting any branch of Sberbank, but only in the region in which you have a residence permit.  You must have a document proving your identity with you. </p><p>  You may be interested in <span>how much a Sberbank card is made?</span>  The youth debit card will be ready in 2-3 weeks, you can pick it up in the department that you indicated in the questionnaire.  Do not forget to bring your passport or any other document that can confirm your identity. </p><p>  A Sberbank youth credit card is not issued remotely via the Internet.  You will have to contact the bank branch twice: the first time to provide documents and fill out the questionnaire, and the second time to get a card.  The decision to issue a credit card to a borrower is made by Sberbank for no more than three business days. </p><h2>  Card terms and conditions </h2><p>  <span>A</span> youth <span>debit card</span> ‚ÄúSberbank of Russia‚Äù will cost you 150 rubles a year, and a credit card - 750 rubles.  Credit card conditions provide for a <span>grace period of</span> fifty days, that is, no interest will be charged for this period.  The credit card limit is from three to two hundred thousand rubles, the interest rate on borrowed funds is 24% per annum.  If the borrower needs to withdraw cash from the Molodezhnaya credit card, then the bank will charge a 3% commission for this service. </p>

    <h2>  How to replenish the Youth card? </h2><p>  There are several ways to recharge a card from Sberbank: </p><ol><li>  In a non-cash way using the Mobile Bank, Sberbank-Online service, a special mobile application and SMS service. </li><li>  In cash through ATMs and self-service terminals. </li><li>  At the cash desks of other banking institutions - for this you need to know the details of the card; </li><li>  At the box office of Sberbank branches. </li></ol><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how much is a sberbank youth card" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32473/817773.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Reviews of the Youth card </h2><p>  Users of a product such as the Molodezhnaya card (Sberbank) give different reviews.  Some highlighted the fact that the procedure for obtaining a credit card is not ideal, since there is a more progressive procedure for obtaining it.  So, you can make it possible to remotely apply for a preliminary decision from a bank to issue a credit card.  Another negative point highlighted by Sberbank customers is that the conditions on the credit card are not preferential and do not differ from the conditions on credit cards for other categories of Sberbank customers. </p><p>  But there are still more positive points.  The most basic is the provision of the opportunity for a student to apply for a loan without employment.  Another nice side of this card product is the availability of a bonus program.  So, paying for their purchases with the Molodezhnaya card, young people accumulate bonuses, which they can later spend on the purchase of other goods.  There are many more benefits of this product that make life easier for young people. </p>
