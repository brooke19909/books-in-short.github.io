    <p>  This begs the question: "Poker face" - is this an innate internal state?  Or is it quite realistic, having learned all the subtleties of the game, over time to learn how to bluff so cold-bloodedly?  You can‚Äôt say with absolute certainty that after playing for a year or two, you will cease to be absolutely worried and nervous.  But that your actions will become natural, stiffness will go away - that's for sure. </p><h2>  Tricky Tricks of Professionals </h2><p>  Looking at the poker star as he plays - aggressively and calmly, it is a mistake to think that he is not worried.  "Poker face" is just a mask, a real volcano of emotions and emotions is boiling inside the player.  In order not to betray themselves, experienced players resort to tricky methods.  During the distribution, they completely abstract from others and just look at one point, absolutely not responding to questions and attacks of opponents. </p>

    <p>  It‚Äôs easier to control yourself.  Because your opponent can make every effort to bring you to the response by asking <span>provocative questions,</span> thereby collecting information for yourself about the strength of your combination. </p><p>  Experts believe that everyone can try to develop their poker face abilities.  In addition to constant playing practice, it is recommended to study specialized literature and practice all kinds of techniques. </p><p>  The main thing is not to overdo it and not to overdo it in training.  And then the risk is great, instead of the virtuoso of the game, who knows how to skillfully control facial expressions, to turn into a retarded, monotonously indifferent phlegmatic reacting to all vital stimuli. </p>
