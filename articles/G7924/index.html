Pardubice is a small but very cozy town, which is incredibly popular among tourists from different countries.  The capital of the Pardubice region is world famous for its gingerbread cookies of the most bizarre forms and delicious beer.  And thanks to the abundance of architectural monuments, many of which became his hallmark, the city received the status of a reserve. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Pardubice (Czech Republic) was founded in 1340, and its heyday came in the 15th century, when representatives of the Pernstein clan ruled the settlement.  A century later, the glory of the city involved in the war fades, but after the railway was laid in 1845, a sharp rise in industry begins.  New opportunities are opening up for the region, factories and factories are appearing, and the well-being of the economic center is only growing. </p><p>  After the Second World War, as a result of which the whole Czech Republic was badly damaged, Pardubice could not recover for a long time from the bombing that caused irreparable damage to the flowering city.  Only by the end of the 90s of the last century the pearl of the country was able to regain its former appearance and restored all the cultural monuments, attracting an increasing number of foreign visitors every year. </p><h2>  Tourist centre </h2><p>  The picturesque Pardubice, which is located in the very center of the Czech Republic, is located in a valley where two rivers merge - Labe and Chrudimka.  Due to its extremely favorable location (only 140 kilometers from Prague) and the presence of its own airport, the city has become a popular tourist center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It was built in the XVII century and has a religious foundation, because the image of the Virgin Mary was a symbol of salvation.  The plague pillar, decorated with a balustrade with images of the faces of the saints, is a six-meter baroque monument.  It seems to tourists that the stone came to life in the skillful hands of architects and you can even catch the eyes of the patrons of the ancient pearl, which the Czech Republic is rightly proud of.  Pardubice, which has received reserved status, is not the only settlement where monuments of this kind are erected, they are also found in other cities of Europe and erected in memory of the victims of the plague epidemic. </p><h2>  Church of St. Bartholomew </h2><p>  Pardubice is famous all over the world for its shrine, which has been repeatedly reconstructed.  Kostel svat√©ho Bartolomƒõje is a Gothic building that appeared in the 16th century.  Initially, the material for the church was a tree covered with special compounds to protect it from moisture.  For a long time, the building served as a school <span>of the Jesuit Order,</span> later it turned into a venue for luxurious balls for the local nobility. </p>
