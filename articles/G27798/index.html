At the dawn of civilization, the choice of occupations was very limited, and therefore this or that craft was often inherited.  The progress movement was not as rapid as it is today, and the list of the most sought-after professions has not changed for centuries.  Here is some of them. </p>

    <h2>  Nomenclature </h2><p>  People who happened to live in the Soviet period remember well that this name hid a certain social stratum of people who occupied exclusively leading posts in various areas of social life and production.  Moreover, one and the same person could easily head first the house of culture, then a polyclinic, a manufacturing enterprise, a district or city administration, a ministry, etc. In short, he was a professional chief and was ready to carry out leadership even in those areas in which he didn‚Äôt had no idea.  It is easy to imagine what the fruits of his work were. </p><p>  So, even though the nomenklaturists belong to the representatives of one of the most ancient world professions, in the past centuries they were engaged in a completely different kind of activity.  In ancient times, the name was given to slaves, whose duty was to everywhere follow their master and fulfill the functions of his ... notebook. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, if necessary, we take out a smartphone from our pocket and enter the dates and places of the planned meetings, the names, phone numbers and addresses of our acquaintances, as well as all other information we need in our memory.  In the ancient world, the role of such walking gadgets was played by nomenklatura, and since they were supposed to have exceptional memory, they were considered specialists, and in slave markets they were very expensive. </p>

    <h2>  Slave traders </h2><p>  Speaking of people who, although they had a prestigious profession, but who were still slaves, it is appropriate to recall those who were directly related to them ‚îÄ slave traders.  This was one of the oldest <span>professions, which disappeared</span> as states transitioned from a slave system to higher forms of social development. </p><p>  Slave traders, as a rule, traveled to accompany the fighting armies and replenished supplies of live goods at the expense of the losing side.  Not only captured warriors, but also civilians, especially those who were in special demand in slave markets, became their prey.  These included young boys, girls and children, as well as all kinds of artisans who could bring considerable profit to the future owners.  As a rule, people who belonged to this, one of the oldest disappeared professions, made large fortunes, but at the same time were constantly at risk of being killed by slaves who were the subject of their trade. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Barber (barber) </h2><p>  No matter how surprising it may seem, the creation of hairstyles is one of the most ancient world professions.  And once it was fraught with considerable difficulties and even a risk to life.  The fact is that in ancient times, hairdressers were, as a rule, slaves serving the whims of their masters and depending on them in everything. </p>

    <p>  It is known that at all times women tried to keep up with fashion.  What was it like to a home hairdresser when his fair-haired, and even balding, mistress declared that she wanted to become a burning brunette?  Now for this there is a wide selection of dyes, and then dark hair color was achieved using a mixture of bile, ink and rotten leeches. </p><p>  If, at the whim of fashion, it was necessary to turn a natural brunette into a blonde, and hydrogen peroxides were not known at that time, then her locks were densely greased with dove droppings mixed with ash, which caused their discoloration.  In case of success, the hairdresser received a reward, but if the client lost her last hair from such ‚Äúchemicals‚Äù, then he could pay for it with his life ‚îÄ a slave after all. </p><h2>  Wig makers </h2><p>  Close to hairdressing is another lesson, also one of the most ancient world professions, ‚îÄ manufacturer of wigs.  True, at the dawn of civilization they were made in a very original way.  To do this, the master went to the slave market and looked out for slaves and slaves, who, unfortunately, had long and beautiful hair. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This gift of nature was, in essence, a death sentence for them, since their owner was immediately bought, and then they simply removed the scalp from it, which, when dried and processed, became a wig.  Since the former owner of the hair was just a slave, the fashionistas were not at all embarrassed that their elegance was bought at the cost of his life. </p>

    <h2>  Vestals </h2><p>  The service of the ancient Roman goddess of the Veste family also belongs to the most ancient world professions.  It was not the prerogative of some closed caste, and any girl who met strictly certain requirements could devote herself to this occupation.  First of all, she had to be very young and not be the daughter of slaves.  In addition, the vestal was to be a virgin and have whole arms and legs.  Mental abilities were not specified. </p><p>  By choosing this profession, each of them took an oath not to interrupt the ministry for 30 years.  The only duty of the vestal women, who were highly regarded among the Romans, was to maintain the sacred fire in the Temple of the goddess Vesta.  They received good maintenance for their work, but at the same time, great responsibility was imposed on them.  If due to negligence any of the girls extinguished the fire, then the culprit was mercilessly flogged. </p><p>  An even more serious offense was the loss of virginity.  If the main priest, whose responsibility was to periodically examine the girls for innocence, found this defect, then the poor woman was buried alive, in the literal sense of this expression.  The worst of it was for those of them through whose fault the sacred fire erupted and a fire occurred.  At first they were flogged, and then buried in the ground.  In general, as their contemporary Cicero put it: ‚ÄúOh, times!  Oh manners! ‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  Dentist </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about what is the oldest profession, one cannot ignore dentists, as people have resorted to their help for all ages.  It is hard to say what cave Aesculapius could offer their patients, but their activity in Ancient Rome is known in sufficient detail.  Since in those days people had not yet invented Colgate paste and similar prophylactic agents, there was nothing to brush their teeth, and caries often overshadowed the Romans life.  How could doctors help?  The drill was not yet at their disposal, and the only means of dental treatment was the removal. </p><p>  Before the operation, as a painkiller, the doctor could offer the patient only a cup of wine, after drinking which, he dutifully opened his mouth.  If anesthesia performed in this way was, although ineffective, but a pleasant part of the operation, then a real nightmare awaited the patient.  In order not to cause an infection, the doctor preliminarily heated the tongs on fire.  After this, the wound rarely inflamed, but the patient had to be cast with water. </p><h2>  Tasters </h2><p>  This, perhaps, is not the oldest profession on earth, but also appeared in the era of the ancient world.  As you know, the ancient Romans were sophisticated gourmets, and today it is even hard to imagine the abundance of dishes that decorated their meals.  Gastric delight was raised to the level of art in that era.  But before they embarked on a meal, every treat had to be tasted by a specially-trained employee ‚îÄ a taster. </p>

    <p>  Representatives of this profession lived both in the homes of wealthy citizens and in the imperial palace.  The mission they performed, with all its external attractiveness ‚îÄ well, to eat delicacies every day, was fraught with considerable danger.  The fact is that among the Romans it was customary to eliminate undesirable persons with the help of poisons, and on the taster it was checked whether the food was poisoned.  He remained alive ‚îÄ all bon appetit, died ‚îÄ lunch is canceled. </p><h2>  The predecessors of modern cosmetologists </h2><p>  It is curious that if the scribes were representatives of the most honorable profession in Ancient Egypt (at least it is generally accepted), that is, people who were respected for their literacy, then in subsequent historical periods the emphasis shifted in many respects towards those who created strong of this world the external comfort of their life.  Such people include the predecessors of modern cosmetologists, or, quite simply, ‚Äúpluckers‚Äù of hair. </p><p>  Men resorted to their services, as many of them went in for sports and spent a lot of time in stadiums under the scorching sun.  Even then, it was noticed that hair, especially growing in the armpits, soaked in sweat, becomes a source of unpleasant odor. </p><p>  To avoid this, all of them, both young and old, visited specially trained "pluckers" who removed excess vegetation from their bodies.  As for the Roman ladies, the fashion for depilation of the bikini zone that arose in that old era also forced them to resort to the services of these specialists. </p>

    <h2>  Scammers </h2><p>  And, finally, summing up the conversation about what is the oldest profession in the world, it is regrettable to note that it may turn out to be a denunciation, which has become for many people the main source of income.  This vile occupation is so ancient that the mention of it is found in the earliest historical documents. </p><p>  It is established, for example, that even in the Sumerian kingdom dating back to the III millennium BC.  e., there were persons whose professional duty was to inform the authorities of their neighbors.  For this they were paid a reward.  However, representatives of this, apparently, one of the most ancient professions always constituted a risk group and rarely died of their own. </p>
