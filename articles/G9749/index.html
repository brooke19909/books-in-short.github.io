    <h2>  The history of the formation of the bourgeoisie </h2><p>  In capitalist society, this is the ruling class, which receives income from property: patents, land, money, factories and other property.  Bourgeois - these are people with private property, respecting the right to personal inviolability, freedom of religion, speech, assembly.  They respect the law, because if they do not comply, then others will not, and their property may suffer. </p><p>  In the heyday of feudalism, the bourgeoisie began to flourish.  Wealthy city dwellers belonged to this class: merchants, ordinary workers, artisans, who managed to break out into people thanks to their own labor.  The fact that the bourgeoisie is a progressively thinking estate was discussed after the <span>Dutch revolution.</span>  It was this class that initiated the overthrow of feudal slavery.  Over time, the big and small bourgeoisie began to develop separately, they had completely different political interests and outlooks on life, so a split broke out between them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main types </h2><p>  The class is divided into types, depending on what the bourgeoisie did.  It could be trade (then the people involved in it belonged to the commercial bourgeoisie), banking, agriculture, industry.  Almost every area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman activity in the XVII-XIX centuries.  developed precisely thanks to this estate.  Depending on the size of the income received, the bourgeoisie was divided into large, medium and small.  The former used hired labor, the latter hired workers, but they did a lot themselves, the third earned a living only by their labor.  The petty bourgeoisie mainly lived in villages or in the cities owned a small shop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bourgeoisie and the proletariat" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/412784.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  Who are the proletarians? </h2><p>  In the age of the bourgeoisie, all people were divided into two classes: owners of private property and wage workers who survived by selling their workforce to the capitalists.  The proletarians did not have property.  They earned a living by hiring large and medium-sized bourgeois.  The working class in capitalist society did not have any privileges; the rich ruled everything.  The capitalists created political parties, adopted laws favorable to them, while no one cared about the proletariat.  For this reason, protests began to brew in society.  The socialist revolution destroyed the bourgeoisie, the proletariat also ceased to exist, since it was renamed the socialist working class. </p><h2>  What characterizes the period of the bourgeoisie? </h2><p>  At the very beginning of the formation of capitalist society, wealthy people who earned wealth through their own labor evoked respect.  Over time, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat began to move more and more apart from each other, until a gulf was formed between the two classes, full of hostility, hostility and misunderstanding.  The owners of the feeling of nobility faded into the background, while the desire to possess huge capital and to hold power in the hands came first. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="century of the bourgeoisie" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/412785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Over the years, the bourgeoisie flourished more and more, and the proletariat existed on the brink of survival.  For a long period of time, the owners of huge fortunes were the ruling class, they had their own political party, privileges.  The bourgeois more and more exploited the working people.  It is clear that this could not last long.  First, the proletarians advanced socialism as a political force, then they began to openly fight for their rights.  Therefore, the fact that at the beginning of the twentieth century the working class seized power in their hands is not surprising. </p>
