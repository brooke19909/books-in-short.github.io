  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Saddlery skin. What is it? Products from it</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It was widely used in the tailoring of products of increased strength, such as bracelets, cases, wardrobe trunks, scabbard, tablets, bags, belts, saddlery leather.  Saddles, harness, horse harness are made from it, as well as all kinds of elements of equipment and protection, medical and technical products. </p><h2>  The properties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="horse saddle" class="if uuid-2935354" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2935354.jpg"></div><p>  Saddlery-leather is characterized by high strength, large thickness, high resistance to deformation, abrasion and exposure to all kinds of liquids.  It also has the ability to maintain its properties over a long period of operation. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Heavy weights, high-quality raw materials go to the production of saddlery skin.  Cattle skins, pork, horse and camel skins are classified as heavy by weight.  Without tanning, such material can be produced, or it can be combined or plant-based, during which coarse thick skin with a dense structure of internal fibers becomes sufficiently flexible, unsurpassedly strong and acquires the specified performance characteristics.  Ready saddlery-skin is most often found in the form of half-skin, whole skin, shabra, coat, belt floor and collar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cheprak </h2><p>  The properties, purpose and characteristics of saddlery-leather are determined primarily on the basis of the method of cutting and belonging of the pieces to certain areas of the skin.  By the totality of indicators of strength, quality and durability, the most valuable area is shabrack.  He emerges from the dorsal part of the skin of cattle.  It is shabrack, regardless of the dressing, that has the smoothest, densest and evenest structure and the best strength characteristics.  Saddlery shabrack is used for the manufacture of leather products with increased wear resistance and is often chosen by craftsmen for tailoring highly specialized and very durable things. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbangearclub.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather bag" class="if uuid-2935356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2935356.jpg"></div><p>  Saddlery-saddle skin according to the generally accepted classification is usually divided into soft and hard.  The saddle yuft, from which the horse harness and various elements of human equipment are made, belongs to the hard type, and to the raw type. </p><h2>  Hard skin </h2><p>  Has four types of saddlery leather hard: </p><ul><li>  type "L" - leather for bags and belts used as accessories; </li><li>  type "K" - leather for saddles and horse belts; </li><li>  type "KS" - leather for seats and wings of saddles; </li><li>  type "P" - leather for trimmer or girdle belts. </li></ul><p>  In the manufacture of saddles and horse harnesses, saddlery yuft was widely used.  It is also great for making covers, holsters for weapons, scabbards and semi-rigid wardrobe trunks.  Such varieties of yuft are distinguished: smooth or rifled.  It can also be painted or have a natural shade. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Soft skin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.gitara.in.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="female belt" class="if uuid-2935359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2935359.jpg"></div><p>  Softer - raw.  It is extremely resistant to stretching and does not undergo tanning during the dressing process.  It is one of the varieties of very durable genuine leather.  Its distinctive feature is increased ductility, due to which raw materials are indispensable in situations where a certain profile must be given in advance to the belt.  Such a process is called "landing." </p><p>  In addition to belts with the highest tensile strength, wristbands and wear-resistant bags are made from rawhide, in which heavy objects can be carried.  Six to seven kgf / mm <sup>2</sup> is the ultimate tensile strength of its strength.  Raw material is divided into horse-drawn, belt, cross-linking. </p><h2>  Technical leather </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.tatosmallets.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="leather saddle" class="if uuid-2935358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2935358.jpg"></div><p>  This is a separate subclass of saddlery leather; such leather is intended for the production of running and drive belts, seals and gaskets, leather cuffs, as well as for parts of various machines, industrial mechanisms and assemblies. </p><p>  It has various properties depending on the purpose.  For drive belts, for example, the skin must be very elastic, dense, uniform in thickness, and have great tensile strength. </p><p>  Technical leather in the medical industry is used in orthopedics, corsets, bandages and plating of prostheses are made from it.  Such skin is hard or flexible, but at the same time quite durable material, which is obtained by means of combined specific tanning of thick cattle skin. </p><p>  At certain industrial enterprises, specialized products for labor protection are manufactured from technical leather.  These products include all kinds of aprons, mittens, gloves, protection elements for vital organs and the head. </p><p>  So, from the article it became clear what saddlery skin is.  It has the following characteristics: strength, wear resistance and durability.  Therefore, for sewing bracelets, exclusive belts, dog collars, backpacks, cases, tablets, briefcases and bags, saddlery leather is often chosen by craftsmen. </p>
