    <p>  What you need to know if you are going to go hiking in Altai? </p><h2>  Recommended Season </h2><p>  First of all, you need to determine the date of travel.  The best time for a hiking trip in Altai is August and September, when there are fewer ticks in the thickets and when there is the least water on the roads and in the gorges. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Of course, you can travel around this region year-round, especially recently, when many recreation centers appeared on the foothills for every taste and budget.  First of all, these are the villages of Chemal and Teletskoye, in which small tourist hotels are located, quite convenient and comfortable even for fastidious guests.  You can get here on the way or by public transport. </p><p>  But still it‚Äôs no secret that the most interesting and most beautiful places in Altai are those where buses do not reach and where you can be reached only on foot.  These picturesque hinterlands (more precisely, one of them - Lake Darashkol) will be discussed below. </p><h2>  What to see </h2><p>  The mountains of the <span>Altai Territory</span> are rich in exotic colorful places where it is pleasant to spend time, it is convenient to relax both in soul and body, and to escape from life's worries and hardships. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First of all, this: </p><ul><li>  Sophia Glacier Gorge (located near the village of Beltir); </li><li>  Kyzyl-Chin gorge (located beyond the village of Chagan-Uzun); </li><li>  repeater (located behind the village of Aktash, the view from the very top is simply breathtaking); </li><li>  Teletskoye Lake (especially at night, you can reach the reservoir through the village of Artybash or through the valley of the Chulyshman River); </li><li>  pass Katu-Yaryk; </li><li>  Lake Darashkol. </li></ul><p>  We‚Äôll talk about the last picturesque place in more detail. </p><h2>  Where is Darashkol </h2><p>  According to the administrative-territorial division, this reservoir is located in the Ust-Koksinsky district, the center of which is the village of Ust-Koksa (translated from the Altai language - ‚Äúblue water‚Äù). </p>

    <p>  The lake is eight hundred and ninety meters long and three hundred and thirty meters wide. </p><p>  The pond is very inaccessible to travelers, but this does not detract from its attractiveness.  Numerous tourists from different countries spend a lot of time and effort to get to this wonderful corner of nature and fully enjoy its virginity and beauty. </p><p>  How to get to this lake?  A detailed route will be given below. </p><h2>  Note to traveler </h2><p>  First of all, you should know that the lake can only be reached on foot.  Where to start? </p><p>  If you take the city of Biysk, known to all Altai tourists, as a starting point, you should take the direction to the M-52 highway and keep the path to the village of Ust-Sema.  At this interval, the road is asphalt, very convenient and comfortable for any type of road transport. </p><p>  In the village you should drive through the old bridge and climb to Semensky Pass, which can also be easily overcome by personal car at any time of the year.  After the descent, the travelers will be met by a fork, where it will be necessary to choose a direction to the villages of Ust-Koks and Ust-Kan. </p><p>  Thus, having traveled two hundred kilometers, tourists get to the beginning of the Uyman steppe, beyond which, if you drive another sixty kilometers, the village of Tyungur will be. </p><h2>  Tourist centre </h2><p>  This village is the starting point in our route.  There are many tour operators and organizations offering their services for delivering travelers to the lake.  You can offer walking tours, which on average last about six to seven days, or horseback riding lasting four days or more. </p><p>  What you need to know when going on a similar tour? </p><h2>  Recommendations and Tips </h2><p>  First of all, if you have never been to a lake, do not rush to go there yourself.  This is best done with a guide and instructor, as well as with several fellow travelers. </p><p>  If you want to get to Lake Darashkol comfortably, then choose a horse ride.  You can ride a horse quite comfortably (if you don‚Äôt know how to do this, then you will certainly be taught this at the camp site).  Moreover, the advantage of horse riding lies in the fact that you can put the load on the animal, and go on foot yourself, admiring the beautiful views. </p><p>  On such tours it is best to take warm clothes, as it is cold in the mountains, especially at night and even in the summer. </p><p>  The duration of the walking route is about a hundred kilometers, so you should have the necessary physical and moral stamina to go on such a trip.  Children under twelve years old are better not to take.  Most likely, none of the guides and guides will dare to take children of primary and secondary school age into their group. </p><p>  Going on such an interesting and unforgettable trip, it should be remembered that during the trip there will be no mobile connection.  This should be prepared mentally and psychologically.  But nothing can distract you from the contemplation of the natural beauties and virgin depths of the Altai Territory. </p><p>  You should also be prepared for the fact that cooking does not lie on the shoulders of the instructor or guide, but the traveler himself.  It is unlikely that you will meet a restaurant or at least a dining room along the way.  Therefore, it is worth stocking up on food in advance so that you can maintain your strength on this difficult but beautiful path. </p><p>  Moreover, during the trek you will need to listen to the tips and recommendations of a guide who will tell you how to wade a river with a strong current, cross gently sloping rocks and climb steep peaks. </p>
