    <p>  The price includes meals, the process takes place on an all-inclusive basis.  On the territory there are several cozy restaurants, a bar where you can taste delicious cocktails, and a coffee shop where coffee and cinnamon aromas reign. </p><p>  More details will help to tell about the hotel Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * guest reviews. </p><h2>  Tourists comments on accommodation </h2><p>  When checking in, guests will need to fill out questionnaires.  Then they will be given bracelets.  The hotel greets each client with a welcome cocktail.  The hotel complex Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * is very popular among tourists, so you need to be prepared for the hotel to be filled to capacity and check-in even in a pre-booked room will not happen immediately.  If necessary, administrators can offer guests more comfortable rooms, based on the composition of residents.  For example, if there is a teenager among the guests, then you can count on a room with an extra bed or sofa.  In any case, guests who have arrived in the morning will have to wait until their room is free and they prepare it for check-in.  This time can be spent on the beach.  Around noon, clean beach towels are brought from the laundry, you can ask for them at the reception and go to sunbathe.  Baggage can be left in the lobby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The main criterion for evaluating the work of the staff of the Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * hotel is the guest reviews about the service. </p><p>  Unfortunately, women do almost all the work at the hotel, so you will have to carry luggage to the room on your own.  Surprisingly, the same people perform a huge range of work.  For example, the girls working in the bar are forced to clean the beach area, arrange sunbeds and umbrellas.  Workers at the lobby bar do the same work by the pool.  Men can only be found in the restaurant's kitchen. </p><p>  The staff is very welcoming to all hotel guests, regardless of nationality.  Most employees understand Russian well, but few can speak it. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  The most popular among tourists are double rooms with extra beds.  The windows of the second floor overlook the pool and the surrounding area.  In the rooms everything is working properly.  There is a TV, a bathroom instead of a shower, a balcony with a table and chairs and a clothes dryer.  You can choose a room with an extra bed or sofa.  Also in the room there is a small table, a chair, a spacious wardrobe with many hangers and shelves.  Of the minor flaws can be noted poor quality curtains in the bathroom. </p><p>  An in-room safe is available for free.  The door opens with a key.  In other complexes of a similar level, the card system operates. </p><h2>  Room Service </h2><p>  Towels are changed daily.  Bed linen is changed every three days.  The rooms are cleaned qualitatively, but they are not cleaned on the balcony.  This should be reminded or cleaned by ourselves, which is not very pleasant, because, in addition to sand, here you can also find traces of the life of birds. </p><p>  A significant drawback is the air conditioning of the hotel.  The room has a split system that generates a lot of noise.  Good thing the air conditioning is not near the beds.  In bars, air conditioning systems generally do not work because of the savings.  Therefore, it is better to choose places in the open. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The food at the hotel is very good.  The food is always fresh, quality cooked and very tasty.  Variety is not particularly observed, but it is difficult to stay hungry.  During the day, you can enjoy ice cream, which is presented in assortment.  Also, there are always fruits, sweets and hot drinks, which are rare for Greek hotels. </p><p>  For lovers of local cuisine there is a special table with traditional Crete dishes.  The restaurant is almost completely self-service.  Waiters just clean and set the tables.  When the hotel is full of tourists, there are no food queues. </p><p>  From 11.00 to 15.00 there is a snack bar near the pool where you can have a bite to eat pizza, hamburgers, fruits, vegetables.  From 16.00 to 17.00 a sweet table is served there, and in the evening it all turns into a restaurant where you can taste Greek dishes.  It is interesting that you can‚Äôt make a choice here, the waiters bring everything that is available, but even the most hungry tourist can‚Äôt just overpower such a volume of food.  You can order dinner in this restaurant every day, but you must pre-request at the reception. </p>

    <p>  Those who lack variety can head to the bars for dinner.  Here is a huge selection of all kinds of cocktails, beer, wine and other drinks.  Spending time in the lobby bar is not very comfortable, because due to the winds the windows are constantly closed, the air conditioners do not work, therefore it is very stuffy. </p><p>  The Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * hotel has an all-inclusive system.  Until 24.00, guests can enjoy free drinks and snacks. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>

    <p>  Near the beach there is a large swimming pool with sea water.  The beach itself is clean and well maintained.  For convenient entry into the sea, a path has been cleared.  You can see stones and plates in the sea, but they are clearly visible, since the water is crystal clear.  You can watch colorful fish and crabs.  In Crete, winds often blow, because of this the water can be slightly cool.  These days it is better to spend time in the pool. </p><p>  Beach towels are changed at the reception once every 3 days.  Sunbeds on the beach and near the pool are best occupied in advance, especially when the hotel is full of guests. </p><p>  In early September, guests begin to disperse.  This is an ideal time for those who want to relax.  The contingent of the hotel is mainly Europeans and Russians.  Problems with new acquaintances and communication will definitely not arise. </p><p>  When choosing a <span>vacation in Crete,</span> you need to prepare for the fact that you have to endure the pranks of nature.  Winds here are a frequent occurrence.  Sometimes even the windows in the room cannot be kept open, blowing everything off the table. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  The hotel has 5 animators.  In the afternoon, guests are entertained with a standard program.  In the evening, a show is held.  There is no live music and visiting artists in the complex.  In the evenings, the hotel is bored, so it is better to go for a walk outside it or spend time in the restaurant for a wonderful dinner. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Hotel guides offer trips to Ierapetra and other nearby cities.  To diversify your leisure, you can rent a car.  Guides will help you choose the best route, tell you about all the interesting places and beaches.  On the north coast of the island, water in the sea is much warmer.  Therefore, when winds rage in the south, you can safely go on vacation to the northern part and splash around in warm water. </p><p>  For those who attend excursions and do not have the opportunity to have lunch and dinner at the hotel, lunch boxes with sandwiches, fruits and vegetables are provided.  The set is very modest, so you have to have a snack in other places or buy products in the store. </p><h2>  General impressions </h2><p>  According to guests, a fairly comfortable atmosphere prevails at the Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * hotel.  The photo of the apartments suggests that the rest here can be called comfortable. </p>

    <p>  The location of the hotel is not the best.  Strong winds often blow here.  Resting with children is not recommended. </p><p>  The food is good and tasty. </p><p>  The main advantages are comfortable rooms, friendly Russian-speaking staff and good food. </p><p>  Disadvantages - cool water in the sea, lack of entertainment, not very fresh repairs, a large number of guests, windy weather. </p><p>  In general, the hotel is suitable for measured relaxation in the family or a large company.  If you wish, you can go on excursions in the surrounding area, thereby brighten up boring evenings. </p><p>  A car in Greece is a necessary thing, so you should not save on rent.  Unfortunately, the hotel does not provide car rental services, but this can be done in neighboring complexes. </p><p>  Despite all the possible shortcomings, the Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * hotel is very popular among European tourists.  "Booking" is a resource that allows you to book rooms in advance, because otherwise there might simply not be any free places on the planned date. </p><p>  The staff of the Dessole Blue Star Crete 4 * hotel is always glad to new guests. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel complex located? </h2><p>  The hotel can be found at: Greece, Crete, Ierapetra, 72200. The road from the airport will take more than an hour, but the journey will not seem so tiring, because the windows of the comfortable bus offer tourists a picturesque view of the amazing nature of the island of Crete. </p>
