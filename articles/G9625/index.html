This country will amaze everyone with its beauty and originality.  Beautiful beaches, warm sea, magnificent tropical flora will not disappoint.  There are many hotels in Thailand that are ready to receive guests and provide them with comfortable living conditions.  Karon Princess Hotel is very popular.  Here for a fairly low cost you can spend your holidays excitingly. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  One of the most picturesque regions of Thailand is Phuket.  This is where the Karon Princess Hotel is located.  It is located on the coast of the <span>Andaman Sea.</span>  The distance from the airport is 61 km.  Guests can reach their accommodation by public transport.  If you plan to transfer, then you need to book it, otherwise the service is not provided.  The hotel does not have an equipped check-in for buses, so arriving guests are disembarked at a public transport stop.  The distance is small, but walking with suitcases is not very convenient. </p>

    <p>  The sea is just a few meters from Karon Princess Hotel 3 * <span>(Thailand, Phuket).</span>  Karon is a very beautiful beach where guests can relax.  Patong Beach is 11 km away and offers a variety of entertainment programs. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of the hotel </h2><p>  Karon Princess Hotel has a very small territory at its disposal, so you can‚Äôt enjoy the tropical greenery here.  But still in the courtyard there is an excellent pool with a jacuzzi.  Here guests are provided with free sunbeds and umbrellas.  The pool is decorated with fountains in the form <span>of seahorses,</span> which looks very beautiful.  Another pool is located on the roof of one of the buildings. </p>

    <p>  Despite the small area, the territory will delight guests with cleanliness.  The staff does not forget about cleaning, so there is absolutely no rubbish anywhere. </p><h2>  Infrastructure Features </h2><p>  At Karon Princess Hotel 3 * you can contact the reception 24 hours a day.  But it should be borne in mind that the staff practically does not speak Russian, so before the trip it will be useful to study the most common phrases in English or <span>Thai.</span>  All hotel employees are very attentive and friendly to guests, although you should not expect a very quick reaction to emerging problems. </p>

    <p>  In the lobby of the hotel there is a left-luggage office where you can take oversized items if you wish.  There are also currency exchange points.  As tourists note, here you can exchange rubles for local currency at a very good rate.  There is also a tour desk in the lobby, where vacationers will be offered to visit a lot of fascinating places. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel has its own laundry and dry cleaning services.  Clothes there are tidied up only for an additional fee.  If necessary, vacationers are given an iron and ironing board. </p><p>  The hotel offers beauty services.  They provide the opportunity to enjoy Thai massage.  There is also a hairdresser.  The salon provides all services for money. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Visitors to the hotel Karon Princess Hotel 3 * can offer 86 rooms.  Vacationers can choose standard or superior apartments.  Guestrooms have garden or sea views.  Guest rooms that overlook the garden do not respond very well.  Of these, you can see only the territory of a neighboring hotel.  Even worse is the situation with tourists who got rooms on the ground floor.  Of these, you can observe only the fence of the hotel, which cannot be very pleasing. </p><p>  The rooms themselves are quite spacious and comfortable.  Furniture, although not new, but has a pretty decent look.  Almost all rooms include balconies or terraces, which you can comfortably sit during your relaxation on prudently set chairs. </p>

You can only use drinks from it for an additional fee. </p><p>  The rooms have kitchenettes.  Here you can make yourself coffee or tea.  Ingredients for drinks are always present.  There are special places for drying clothes.

A hairdryer and toiletries are always present.  Guests staying in superior rooms are also provided with bathrobes and slippers. </p><p>  Tourists leave quite conflicting reviews regarding housekeeping.  Some argue that it is carried out normally, while others find it somewhat superficial.  Towels are changed daily. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  At the Karon Princess Hotel (Phuket) you can choose one of three food systems: </p><ul><li>  RO - no free meals provided. </li><li>  BB - Hotel guests can enjoy free breakfast in the restaurant. </li><li>  HB - Breakfast and dinner are served for guests. </li></ul><p>  The guests speak very well of the local cuisine.

    <p>  You can eat in the restaurant or on the terrace.  In sunny weather, there are enough places for all guests.  But when it rains in the yard or winds blow, then the hall becomes cramped and queues appear.  Meals can be ordered in rooms.  They deliver it at any time, because the hotel provides a 24-hour free Room Service. </p><p>  Around the hotel there are many different bars and restaurants, where at an affordable cost you can order various dishes.  The menu here often consists of traditional Thai dishes, which are full of various spices.  If you are not an admirer of spicy food, then it is worth notifying the waiters.  Then they will put less seasoning in the food you ordered.  Meals can also be enjoyed in the hotel bar. </p><h2>  Features of a beach holiday </h2><p>  Tourists who are lucky to relax on Karon Beach speak very warmly about this beautiful place.  It is here that guests of the Karon Princess Hotel 3 * (Phuket, Karon) can enjoy swimming in very clean and warm sea water.  Only here is there white sand, which, when walking, makes a peculiar creak.  This is crazy for kids. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the beach is urban, there is always enough free space.  You can sit on the sunbeds, which are issued only for an additional fee.  You can hide from the burning rays of the sun under umbrellas, for the use of which you will also have to pay extra, or hide in the shade of growing palm trees. </p><p>  The water in the sea is clean.  Sometimes there are big waves, because of which it will be problematic for older people or children to swim.  But such a situation is not observed very often. </p><p>  The beach is kept in perfect cleanliness.  They always clean well.  Sometimes tourists can be annoyed by local merchants.  They also offer vacationers a variety of food.  According to people who have been here, it is better to refuse such offers, since the quality of the food offered is rather doubtful, and a light snack can turn into food poisoning. </p><h2>  How are hotel guests having fun? </h2><p>  The hotel does not have facilities for entertainment.  To have fun, tourists book various excursions, which are offered here in large numbers.  Tours to Patong Beach are very popular, where you can find entertainment at any time of the day.  During the day, shopping enthusiasts can visit many shops here, and partygoers will enjoy the nightlife in the area.  There is also a "Singing Fountain Show". </p><p>  Excursions to various nearby islands are very popular.  There is a very beautiful nature, in the sea you can meet a huge number of different fish.  The only minus of such excursions is the huge number of tourists.  An excursion to the city of Phuket, where you can visit many different temples, will not disappoint.  Tourists are offered other excursions. </p><p>  Hotel guests who love water sports can easily have fun on the beach.  There are companies that can enjoy water skiing, catamarans, surfing or other water sports. </p><h2>  Children's holiday </h2><p>  The Karon Princess Hotel is suitable for families.  Here the youngest travelers can have fun.  Parents need to be asked in advance to equip the room with a cot, which is available at no extra charge.  A children's menu is not provided in the hotel restaurant, but, according to the guests, the young guests will not go hungry here, because from the varied menu it is easy to find suitable dishes that will appeal to the kids. </p><p>  Children can spend time near the specially equipped pool.  They will certainly enjoy the creaking sand on the beach.  If desired, parents can use the services of a nanny, which will need to be paid. </p><h2>  Karon Princess Hotel Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Many people who have already managed to get to know the hotel often leave positive reviews about their holidays.  Most tourists liked the spacious and well-furnished rooms.  <span>Meals at the hotel</span> will not make you disappointed <span>,</span> and relaxing on the beach and swimming in the sea can only cause delight. </p>

    <p>  The hotel has moments that somewhat disappoint tourists.  Sometimes it is difficult to communicate with staff who do not speak Russian.  Does not contribute to a pleasant pastime and lack of soundproofing in the rooms.  According to vacationers, the hotel has very noisy plumbing, as well as the air conditioning system. </p><h2>  How much does a hotel stay? </h2><p>  Accommodation at the Karon Princess Hotel 3 * (Phuket) is not very expensive.  For a weekly tour, everyone will have to pay about 68,000 rubles per person.  A 7-night tour for a couple will cost about 109,000 rubles.  If you correlate the cost of living with the quality of service, you can understand that the hotel offers very good conditions for spending holidays. </p>
