    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  And finally, it is worth talking about what the hotel receives Memory Boutique Hotel 4 * reviews.  The vast majority of guests claim: if you want to spend an unforgettable vacation in a cozy and comfortable hotel, it is worth going here. </p><p>  Very polite and friendly people work in the hotel: upon arrival, they immediately explain what is and where they are, give a password for Wi-Fi and talk about the meal plan.  In general, the staff provides a warm welcome at home. </p><p>  The beach is literally a minute's walk from the hotel.  The sea is clean, transparent - especially at the beginning or end of the season.  By the way, guests are advised to go here at this time.  Especially if you want more privacy.  On the beaches there are sun loungers (5 euros per person).  Friendly people also go there who offer various services for relaxation: from serving ashtrays and cocktails to basins for washing feet after the sea. </p><p>  Special attention is also given to room service.  Daily cleaning, even if everything looks clean inside, and the guest generally left somewhere for a day.  The restaurant is well fed: there are vegetables, fruits, watermelons, oranges, meat, side dishes, omelets, pancakes.  Everything is fresh and of high quality.  In general, dishes for every taste.  Alcohol is also good, quality, not diluted. </p><p>  There are some minor disadvantages too, but these are moments that are insignificant - you can put up with them.  For example, a not very spacious shower.  Some have not liked the water in the cooler yet - but this is also very individual.  Better yet, book rooms with improved noise isolation, as parties and discos are organized at night near the hotel ‚Äî music can interfere with relaxation.  In extreme cases, you can not open the door to the balcony.  After all, the rooms have good air conditioning. </p><p>  We can say that this hotel is an ideal option for people who want to check into a comfortable hotel, but pay a small amount for it. </p>
