  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Khazar Haganate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Khazar state (650–969) was a major medieval power.  It was formed by a union of tribes in southeastern Europe.  The Khazar Khaganate was considered the most dangerous Jewish state in history.  He controlled the territory of the Middle and Lower Volga region, the North Caucasus, the Sea of ​​Azov, the present north-western part of Kazakhstan, the northern region of Crimea, as well as the <span>forest-steppe and steppes of</span> all Eastern Europe to the Dnieper. </p><p>  Khazar Khaganate.  History </p><p>  This tribal union stood out from the West Turkic association.  Initially, the core of the Khazar state was located in the northern region of present Dagestan.  Subsequently, it moved (under the pressure of the Arabs) to the lower Volga.  The political dominance of the Khazars at one time extended to some <span>East Slavic tribes.</span> </p><p>  It should be noted that the origin of the people themselves is not fully understood.  It is believed that after the adoption of Judaism, the Khazars themselves perceived as descendants of Kozar, who was the son of Togarmahe.  According to the Bible, the latter was the son of Yaphet. </p><p>  According to some historians, the Khazar Khaganate has some connection with the lost Israeli tribes.  At the same time, most researchers are inclined to believe that the nation still has Turkic roots. </p><p>  The rise of the Khazar people is associated with the development of the <span>Turkic Kaganate,</span> with the rulers of which the first (presumably) had <span>family ties.</span>  In 552, a huge empire was formed by the Altai Turks.  Soon it was divided into two parts. </p><p>  By the second half of the 6th century, the Turks extended their power to the Caspian-Black Sea steppes.  During the Iran-Byzantine war (602-628), the first evidence of the existence of the Khazars appeared.  Then they were the main part of the army. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 626, the Khazars invaded the territory of modern Azerbaijan.  Having plundered Caucasian Alania and united with the Byzantines, they stormed Tbilisi. </p><p>  By the end of the 7th century, most of the Crimea, the North Caucasus and the Sea of ​​Azov were under the control of the Khazars.  There is no exact information about how far their power extended east of the Volga.  However, it is undoubted that the Khazar Khaganate, spreading its influence, stopped the flow of nomads who traveled to Europe from Asia.  This, in turn, created favorable conditions for the development of settled Slavic peoples and Western European countries. </p><p>  The Khazar Khaganate controlled the territory on which quite a lot of Jewish communities lived.  Around 740, Bulan (one of the princes) converted to Judaism.  Apparently, this contributed to the strengthening of his clan.  At the same time, the ruling pagan dynasty of the Khazars began to lose credibility. </p><p>  The descendant of Prince Bulan - Obadiy - at the beginning of the ninth century took the second post in the empire, concentrating real power in his hands.  From that moment, a system of dual government was formed.  Nominally in the country the main representatives of the royal family remained the main, however, in reality, the Beks of the Bulanids clan exercised their rule. </p><p>  After the establishment of a new managerial order, the Khazar Kaganate began to develop international transit trade, reorienting itself from aggressive campaigns. </p><p>  In the 9th century, in connection with a new wave of the <span>Great Migration of Peoples, the</span> Volga began to cross new nomadic tribes. </p><p>  The Old Russian state became the new enemy of the Khazars.  Varangian squads, who came to Eastern Europe, began to successfully challenge power over the Slavs.  Thus, radimichi in 885, northerners in 884 and glade in 864 were freed from Khazar domination. </p><p>  In the period from the end of the 9th to the first half of the 10th century, the Khazaria weakened, but continued to be a very influential empire.  To a greater extent this was made possible thanks to skillful diplomacy and a well-trained army. </p><p>  The decisive role in the death of the Khazar Khaganate belongs to the Old Russian state.  Svyatoslav in 964 freed the Vyatichi (the last dependent tribe).  The following year, the prince defeated the Khazar army.  A few years later (in 968–969), the prince defeated Semender and Itil (the capital of the Khazar empire in different periods).  This moment is considered the official end of the independent Khazaria. </p>
