Pesaro is a city located in the central part of the Apennine Peninsula, on the <span>Adriatic coast.</span>  Despite the hot climate characteristic of this region, it is always fresh here.  Clean air, calm sea, wide beaches - this is an ideal place for any type of vacation.  That is why both tourists from different countries and Italians who live away from the natural beauties and sea waves constantly come here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="italy pesaro" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271600.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <p>  Ancient cathedrals and chic palaces - this is not all that Italy is famous for.  Pesaro is a tourist attraction of this country, and its main feature is the beaches, which stretch for a distance of 8 kilometers along the Adriatic coast.  Wide recreation areas, covered with snow-white sand, a gently sloping and warm sea, and a rich plant world have <span>peace of mind</span> and a kind of estrangement from this world.  It is worth noting that in the city are municipal beaches, which have umbrellas and coastal cafes where you can order lunch or a cocktail.  In the suburban areas are more deserted areas and <span>wild beaches</span> are often found <span>.</span>  Many people believe that such a phenomenon is not typical for a country like Italy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Pesaro is also characterized by the presence of the same type of hotels, which are located along the embankments of the city.  Prices for accommodation and food here are not too high, while the level of service is very decent.  Therefore, almost every average person can afford to spend the summer in this quiet corner of the world.  Also on the territory of the city there are ancient museums and cathedrals, which Italy is famous for. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pesaro italy photo" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271599.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Pesaro, it is worth noting, is the hometown of the famous composer J. Rossini.  In his works, he spoke with incredible feeling and warmth about the homeland, describing its clean streets, large and quiet squares and ancient buildings.  For a couple of hundred years, this city has not changed too much, so everyone can see with their own eyes what Rossini spoke about. </p><p>  Perhaps the most important event in this region is La Stradomenica, which takes place here every three weeks, on Sunday.  These days, city residents and guests gather for local excursions, visit museums, and shop.  Also on these holidays, restaurants offer their guests discounts on the most delicious and delicious dishes, and transport can be used almost for free.  You must admit that only Italy can boast of such celebrations, which are supported by all residents. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="italy city pesaro" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271598.jpg" width="600"></div>
