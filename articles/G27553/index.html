This includes buildings, neighborhoods, natural wonders and even cities.  Naturally, one visit to the country does not see them all.  The article will be interesting to travelers who dream of visiting the most interesting places in this mysterious country.  Here are briefly described the most attractive memorial, historical and architectural places of the Czech Republic. </p><h2>  The old city of the capital </h2><p>  The sights of the Czech Republic can be considered one at a time, or you can just go to Prague and find yourself in the Old Town.  This is a large area where the historical atmosphere of past eras is most accurately preserved.  More than ten of the oldest and most architecturally original buildings are located here.  This list includes the <span>Old Town Hall, the</span> Jewish Quarter, the Pinkasov Synagogue, as well as the world-famous Astronomical Clock.  The Old Town is just the place where you can just walk along the streets, see the magnificent buildings and immerse yourself in the history of the Czech Republic.  Even after several round trips, every traveler will find something new for himself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.touropia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech sights" class="if uuid-2350570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350570.jpg"></div><h2>  Two magnificent buildings </h2><p>  In the Old Town, many Czech attractions are concentrated, but two of them are worth paying special attention to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first is Charles Bridge, which is loved by tourists and locals.  It was erected to cross the Vltava River and soon became a symbol of the whole city.  This status has been preserved to this day.  And every traveler seeks to see an authentic building, which perfectly conveys the spirit of the Middle Ages.  Its length is slightly more than five hundred meters, its height is thirteen, and each visitor here is guaranteed a beautiful view of the river and Prague itself. </p><p>  If tourists have a desire to look at the capital from a height, then you should go to the Powder Tower.  It was erected at the very end of the fifteenth century on the site of the old city gate, but the building did not fulfill the defensive function.  Due to unfinished construction work, a powder warehouse was made in it.  The total height of this tower is 65 meters, and tourists are allowed only on the floor, located 44 meters from the ground.  This is where the observation deck is located, which attracts the opportunity to take great selfies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Republic Attractions Photos" class="if uuid-2350573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350573.jpg"></div><h2>  Exploring Prague Castles </h2><p>  If you look at the sights of the Czech Republic in the photo with the name and description, then they will not cause vivid emotions.  But this is easy to fix.  You just need to come and inspect the majestic castles of the state‚Äôs capital with your own eyes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Prague Castle alone, by its size, can make you feel too small.  This is the largest <span>Czech fortress,</span> which attracts a huge number of tourists every year.  It was built in the ninth century, and for hundreds of years it was considered the center of cultural and political life. </p><p>  Zbirog Castle is less magnificent in size, but this is more than compensated by its interesting architecture.  It is known that Czech kings loved to arrange large parties for close people in this place. </p><p>  Another interesting architectural ensemble is the <span>Tyn Church.</span>  This is not a fortress, but not a single traveler will be able to get around it.  The building is visible from almost all points of the city, and its two sharp spiers have become a symbol of the capital.  Among the sights of the Czech Republic in Prague, this building can not be avoided without spending several tens of minutes to inspect. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveltipy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Brno Czech Republic attractions" class="if uuid-2350575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350575.jpg"></div><h2>  Modern capital </h2><p>  Prague is indeed a unique city where entire historical areas harmoniously intertwine with modernity.  But not only this can boast of the capital.  Among the attractions of the Czech Republic there is something for lovers of modern culture to see.  One Dancing House is worth it!  This unique building is a striking example of the style of deconstructivism, and was erected in honor of two dance masters.  The need for such a solution during the construction was discussed for a long time by critics, but over time the building was included in the list of symbols of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If a married couple with children came to rest, then you can wander around the local zoo and have fun at the water park.  Such entertainment will appeal to people of any age.  After that, it is worth visiting the Zizkov TV Tower.  Its height is 216 meters.  The mere fact that there is no building higher in the Czech Republic can serve as a reason for visiting this country and several mandatory selfies in a family album. </p><h2>  Nature and architecture of Brno </h2><p>  The sights of the Czech Republic in Brno are inferior to Prague in quantity, but some of them are much higher.  The best way to spend time in the city is to visit magnificent castles. </p><p>  The first, called Shpilberg, is located in the city center and it was around it that it grew to the form that appears today to tourists.  It was built in the thirteenth century as a royal residence. </p><p>  Pernstein Fortress is known not only for its original architecture, but also for the White Lady.  According to legend, the ghost lives here, and any guide will complement the impression of visiting the castle with a romantic story about an incorporeal lady. </p><p>  Perhaps a little less impressive is the Veverzhi Castle, which is located twenty kilometers from the city itself.  Once it was an ordinary hunting lodge, founded in the thirteenth century, but later its purpose changed. </p><p>  If architecture does not attract Brno, then you can go to a place called <span>Moravian Krasus.</span>  Four caves are open for travel here, and the natural wonders in them can surprise the most cold-blooded person. </p><p>  In Brno, you can also walk the Freedom Square and simply along the beautiful, cozy streets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="theculturetrip.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="czech republic sights" class="if uuid-2350578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350578.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel to Karlovy Vary </h2><p>  Most descriptions of Czech attractions in Karlovy Vary will tell you about wellness and a relaxing holiday.  This place is known for its resorts, among which the Mill Colonnade is one of the most popular.  Art lovers will conquer the city theater with its large arches, as well as the art gallery. </p><p>  Sources here are located throughout the city and many of them are called colonnades.  The most visited places include Zamkovaya, Geysernaya and Rynochnaya - these places for tourists to stay idle are a must-see. </p><p>  It is easy to plunge into the historical past in the city.  All thanks to the Goethe Tower, which is the oldest observation platform, as well as several castles.  Among them stands Becov nad Teplou - a whole complex, which includes a fortress and an artsy castle. </p><p>  Also, experienced tourists are advised to definitely visit the Loket fortress, the Old Castle and a number of museums inside the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insidermonkey.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kutna Gora Czech Republic attractions" class="if uuid-2350580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350580.jpg"></div><h2>  Bohemian region </h2><p>  The collection of photos of Czech attractions should not be limited only to Prague and Karlovy Vary.  If there is enough time, tourists should drive 140 kilometers from the capital to the south of the Bohemian region in order to enjoy the <span>castle of Hlubok√° nad Vltavou.</span>  This original building with a bright style among picturesque nature can capture a person for almost the whole day. </p><p>  A similar story with the castle of Jleba, which is located near the village of Kutna Hora.  Among the attractions of the Czech Republic, the fortress stands out for its massive size, as well as its organic location.  It was built right on the banks of the Dubrava River, which only complements the overall picture. </p><p>  Another magnificent castle is Konopiste, which is located near Prague itself.  A building with beautiful colors and styling is recommended to history buffs.  You can complete a walk around the region in the small village of Karlstejn thirty kilometers from Prague.  Feeling the spirit of this country in full is not difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="czech republic sightseeing" class="if uuid-2350584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350584.jpg"></div><h2>  Industrial centre </h2><p>  Judging by the photos and descriptions, the sights of the Czech Republic in the main industrial center of the country Ostrava are worthy of attention.  Arriving here, any person will immediately understand that there are many interesting places.  The journey begins with the museums Ostravar and Landek Park.  The first is dedicated to the art of brewing beer, and the second to mining.  For those who want to know the history of the region, a local history museum is open. </p><p>  One of the oldest and most attractive buildings is the Silesian-Ostrava Castle, which was built at the confluence of two rivers.  Many tourists come to the town just for it. </p><p>  The second religious building in Ostrava is the Cathedral of the Divine Savior.  This is the largest temple in all of Moravia, which was built at the end of the nineteenth century.  It is located in the very center of the city on Masaryk Square and just a self-respecting traveler will not be able to pass by it.  The building is perfectly preserved, which attracts attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prague-stay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech Republic sights photo and description" class="if uuid-2350586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45323/2350586.jpg"></div><h2>  Kutna Hora </h2><p>  In the former financial center of the country called Kutna Hora (Czech Republic) there are not many attractions, but they are unique in their own way. </p><p>  The first striking example will be the ‚ÄúBone‚Äù, which people from all over the world come to see.  This is a church in which the entire interior design is made using human bones.  This business took about forty thousand copies and the case is really unique. </p><p>  St. Barbara's Cathedral in the city is also famous in tourist circles.  Its feature is a pronounced Gothic style. </p><p>  History buffs should visit the Vla≈°sky Dvor - the palace that once was a haven for Florentine coins who carried out monetary reform here. </p><p>  In the town there is a good silver museum called ‚ÄúHradec‚Äù with its own mine for the extraction of this precious material. </p><p>  The Czech Republic is an unusually rich country for various attractions.  The article presents only the most attractive, from the point of view of most tourists. </p>
