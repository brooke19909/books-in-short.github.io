Recreation centers: photos, reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The focus of our article will be a vacation in Rybakovka.  <span>Recreation facilities,</span> boarding houses and private hotels here are so numerous that even in the peak season everyone can find their own accommodation to their taste.  At least that's what the reviews say.  Although this place is quite isolated, it has been inhabited since time immemorial.  These are lands of mythical Cimmerians, legendary Scythians, Chumak oxen went here for salt.  When the region belonged to Turkey, the settlement - Hasan-Kale was founded.  Later it was renamed Rybakovka, because in the place where the waters of the estuary and the Black Sea merge, there was always a lot of sterlet, flounder, perches and even sturgeon.  The salt lake of Tuzla, which used to supply salt to the whole of Ukraine, was dry.  But his fame did not fade.  Now it has opened healing mud, which has a significant healing effect on bones and joints. </p><p>  In Soviet times, Rybakovka was famous as a children's health resort.  Now the focus of rest has changed a bit.  In Rybakovka, and now there are several children's camps (Albatross, Scarlet Sail, Cosmos, Sea Wave), but the resort has become considered youth.  The absence of large waves and a specific wind rose led to the development of kite and windsurfing in these places.  Every summer there are competitions in this sport.  There is even a kitesurfing school in the village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in fishing recreation" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1006618.jpg" width="600"></div>
