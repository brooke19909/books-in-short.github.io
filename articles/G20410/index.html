  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inexpensive vacation in Sochi. How much will a vacation in Sochi for two</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the summer, lovers of sea holidays, of course, are interested in the question of where you can spend your vacation.  In our article we want to talk about how much an inexpensive vacation in Sochi can cost.  The domestic resort has a developed infrastructure and luxury hotels, accommodation in which is comparable to a trip to one of the resorts in Turkey.  Therefore, not every tourist can afford such a vacation.  Therefore, we want to consider the budget options. </p><h2>  How to get to Sochi? </h2><p>  How to get to Sochi?  The most convenient option to get to the resort is to use the services of one of the airlines.  Of course, in the summer, the cost of tickets increases significantly in comparison with winter and spring prices.  Nevertheless, the most budgetary and convenient transportation is an airplane to Sochi.  The price of tickets starts at 2500 rubles (in both directions).  However, there are not so many offers with such a price; most of the tickets have a higher price.  In general, take care of the flight in advance, for example, back in the spring.  Firstly, during this period there are many offers, and secondly, the cost out of season is much more modest.  With the approach of July and August, ticket prices are increasing every day, despite the fact that there are hundreds of flights to Sochi every day.  At the height of the season, it is sometimes difficult to find tickets for 14 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941368.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  Continuing the conversation on how to get to Sochi, it is worth recalling the trains.  This option should be preferred to those tourists who do not like to fly.  If the flight time takes less than two hours, then you will spend much more time on the train.  By the way, the cost of tickets on the railway is also not cheap.  The most budget option is a reserved seat.  The cost of a ticket in a reserved seat car starts from 2800 rubles.  A trip in a compartment will cost even more - 5000 rubles.  Train tickets are also in demand, so they should be purchased in advance, otherwise at the last moment there is a high probability that they simply will not be at the box office.  They need to be booked as soon as the sale opens (60 days in advance). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another type of transport that can get to the resort is a bus.  However, experienced tourists do not recommend using such vehicles over long distances.  This is perhaps the least comfortable option of all those listed.  Firstly, the trip takes a lot of time, and secondly, it will be incredibly tiring.  But residents of neighboring regions can get there by bus. </p><h2>  Own transport </h2><p>  When planning an inexpensive vacation in Sochi, do not forget about your own transport.  If you have a car, then you can go to the resort on it with the whole family.  It will cost you much less than any other transport.  So, the fare to Sochi will cost about 6,000 rubles, which is 1,500 rubles per family member.  Savings are visible to the naked eye. </p><h2>  Resort Accommodation </h2><p>  How much will you have to pay for housing on vacation in Sochi?  There are a lot of offers of accommodation at the resort.  The choice depends on how much you are willing to spend on living. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941382" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941382.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  Of course, the lowest prices in Sochi for housing can offer hostels.  On average, a bed in them will cost about 400-500 rubles per day.  This type of accommodation is suitable only for single travelers or youth.  Some hostels offer accommodation in double standards, such as, for example, an institution called "Central".  The cost of such apartments ranges from 1200-2000 rubles.  There are very few such budget proposals on the housing market in the resort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another accommodation option is inexpensive guest houses and hotels.  Such institutions in the center of Sochi offer double rooms at 1500-1700 rubles per day.  Most of the apartments cost 2-4 thousand rubles per day. </p><p>  Three-star resort hotels offer rooms, the cost of which starts at 3200 rubles.  In four-star hotels, you can rent apartments from six thousand rubles.  Well, five-star complexes offer rooms, the cost of which starts from 12 thousand rubles. </p><p>  If you are going to the resort with your whole family or a large company, then it makes sense to consider an apartment as accommodation.  Locals offer one-room apartments or studios from 2500 rubles. </p><h2>  Private sector </h2><p>  The private sector in Sochi can be a good alternative to living.  Moreover, apartment prices are more modest than in hotels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941386.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  If you are interested in a vacation in Sochi without intermediaries (inexpensively), then guest houses will be a great option.  The popularity of guesthouses has been growing lately.  As a rule, in such establishments there is a common kitchen or even a courtyard with a common dining room, so tourists have the opportunity to cook their own meals, thus saving on food.  The private sector in Sochi has its advantages.  For example, guesthouses can offer a cozy shady courtyard, barbecue, sauna and other pleasures.  The presence of such additional benefits should be clarified in each case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  More reasonable prices for guest houses are observed outside the city center, and sometimes on the outskirts.  But there are a number of advantages in this - the situation is calmer and quieter, the sea is cleaner, prices are lower, and there are not so many people.  The price for a night for two starts from 1200-1500 rubles.  Such apartments can be found in the Mamaica neighborhood.  Here you will have to go to the sea for about ten minutes, but the journey to the center by minibus takes about twenty minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941390.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  If you still consider exclusively the resort center for accommodation, the private sector offers rental housing for 2000 rubles.  Most of the proposals - 2.5-3 thousand rubles per day. </p><h2>  Apartments by the sea </h2><p>  For a number of reasons, many tourists consider holidays in Sochi by the sea.  Offshore housing has several advantages.  Firstly, there is no need to go far (especially true if the family has small children or elderly people), and secondly, the entire entertainment infrastructure is always nearby.  The apartments and apartments are conveniently accommodated by the whole family or a large company.  There is a kitchen, dishes and other amenities that help to save on vacation.  As a rule, such apartments are designed to accommodate 2-6 people.  In the center of Sochi, the cost of such apartments starts at 3,500 rubles per day.  There are a lot of proposals for 4-6 thousand rubles.  Beautiful studios on Neserbskaya with sea views can be rented for five thousand rubles a day.  In other areas of the city, the cost of living in the private sector is much lower.  And an average of 2200 rubles. </p><h2>  Villas and resort houses </h2><p>  Speaking of holidays in Sochi in the summer, it is worth remembering the rental of villas and houses.  Perhaps this is not the cheapest accommodation option, but it is also worthy of attention.  It is worth emphasizing that it is possible to rent a villa or a house only outside the city, in the Greater Sochi area - Makops, Esto-Sadka, etc. For example, renting a house in Makops without intermediaries with two separate bedrooms can be for six thousand rubles a day (for eight people). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941415.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  But the prices in Esto-Sadka are higher.  A five-bedroom villa with beautiful mountain views can be rented for 35,000 rubles.  A small house in the village of Kraevsko-Armyanskoe (the village is located seven kilometers from Sochi) can be rented for 1500 rubles.  This option is acceptable if you come by your own transport, since cheaper housing is located away from the sea. </p><h2>  Product cost </h2><p>  For those who are considering how much an inexpensive vacation in Sochi can cost, it will be interesting to know how much the products cost at the resort.  As in any other city, it will be more economical to eat in canteens.  A good lunch costs about two hundred rubles.  In budget cafes, one meal will be 400 rubles.  Well, a good dinner in an inexpensive restaurant will cost at least 1000-1500 rubles.  It is worth noting that in coastal institutions prices are much higher than in cafes remote from the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941408.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  For an inexpensive vacation in Sochi, it‚Äôs still worth renting apartments with a kitchen, then you will have the opportunity to cook on your own in order to save the budget.  The resort has a number of stores - Pyaterochka, Magnit, Okay, where you can buy products at affordable prices. </p><p>  Prices in Sochi for products in 20017 are approximately the following: </p><ol><li>  A kilogram of meat - from 300 rubles. </li><li>  A dozen eggs - from 60 rubles. </li><li>  Milk - from 40 rubles. </li><li>  A kilogram of sugar - from 60 rubles. </li><li>  A kilogram of buckwheat - from 80 rubles. </li><li>  Kefir - from 40 rubles. </li><li>  Bread from 25 rub. </li></ol><p>  Experienced tourists recommend buying fresh fruits and vegetables at the market, but it is not worth looking into the stalls on the way to the sea. </p><h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  If you are considering a holiday in Sochi on a package tour, with a flight such a package will cost from 30,000 rubles for five nights with accommodation in a three-star complex.  The cost of the tour for ten nights starts from 43 000 rubles.  These prices are relevant for trips departing from Moscow.  The cost of tours with departure from St. Petersburg is more expensive.  For five nights you will have to pay at least 37,000 rubles, and for ten - more than 50,000 rubles. </p><p>  If you want to organize an all-inclusive vacation in Sochi, you must pay at least 60,000 rubles for a trip to a three-, four-star hotel for six days (for two).  The cost of a trip with departure from St. Petersburg starts from 70 000 rubles.  The price of such tours, as a rule, includes transfer, accommodation, meals and insurance. </p><p>  Of course, if you set a goal, you can find cheaper offers, there are always "last minute deals", prices for which can surprise. </p><h2>  Resort Transport </h2><p>  Based on the fact that each resort has to move around the city, we want to give an approximate cost for transport services.  Traveling in local minibuses and buses will cost 19 rubles.  As for suburban flights, their cost depends on the distance.  So, for example, a train ticket to Krasnodar costs 370 rubles.  The bus ride to Krasnaya Polyana will cost 225 rubles, and to Rosa Khutor more than 260 rubles. </p><p>  In order to navigate well in local transport, it is worth remembering that city buses are numbered 1-99, and suburban buses are from a hundred or more.  Modern tourists are actively using the interactive application Bus23, which allows online tracking of all vehicles along its route. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941425.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  Speaking about the transport of Sochi, it is impossible not to recall a taxi.  Each local service has its own prices, but on average a short trip costs from 150 to 250 rubles.  Taxi drivers charge 60 rubles for landing, and each kilometer costs at least 20 rubles.  The fare from the city center to the airport is 1100 rubles.  In Sochi, you can rent a car so as not to bother traveling by public transport.  The average price fluctuates around two thousand a day.  Having your own vehicle will greatly simplify life, especially if you plan to see the suburbs and all the attractions of the resort. </p><h2>  Sochi beaches </h2><p>  The beaches of the resort - a place of pilgrimage for tourists in the summer.  The largest resort in Russia offers guests 130 beaches.  Each of them has its own merits.  As practice shows, most vacationers prefer the free beaches of Sochi.  There are 30 such at the resort.  All of them are equipped with first-aid posts, garbage cans, rental offices of various equipment and cafes.  Fewer tourists on wild stretches of coast. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941413.jpg?1559117878"></div><p>  The most popular free <span>beach in Sochi</span> is the Riviera.  It is located next to the park of the same name.  The coast in this area is wide and has a mixed coating of pebbles and sand.  In addition to standard amenities, the beach is equipped with attractions and sports fields. </p><p>  A good place to relax is the Mayak water park with a coastal area.  It is worth noting the beach "Primorsky" near the central promenade, "Little Mermaid" in the microdistrict of Mamaika - a popular vacation spot for children with parents.  Against the background of other sites on the coast stands out "Albatross", which also belongs to the municipality.  The beach is covered with gray sand and some pebbles. </p><p>  It is worth visiting the picturesque beach in Lazarevsky.  The local beach "Lazurny" will appeal to vacationers.  On the outskirts of the resort is the Flamingo and the Dolphin. </p><h2>  Wild coast </h2><p>  As for the wild, unequipped sections of the coast, they are not in Sochi itself.  Wild beaches remained in the Greater Sochi area - from Mamaica to Tuapse.  Here you can relatively calmly soak up the beach, but you should not rely on service and infrastructure. </p><h2>  The cost of entertainment and excursions </h2><p>  It is impossible to imagine a vacation in Sochi without entertainment and excursions, especially if you come with children.  Therefore, we want to bring the cost of visiting some resort facilities: </p><ol><li>  The amusement park Sochi Park, located in Adler - 1350 rubles for adults and 1080 for children. </li><li>  Arboretum - for children from 7 to 14 years old - 120 rubles, and for adults 250. </li><li>  Adler Aquarium "Sochi Discovery World" - 400 - a children's ticket and 600 - an adult. </li><li>  A subscription to visit the rides in the park "Riviera" on average will cost 700-1700 rubles. </li><li>  A visit to the dolphinarium - 700 rubles. </li><li>  Oceanarium "Riviera" - a children's ticket - 200 rubles, an adult - 350. </li></ol><p>  Excursion tours at the resort offer a lot.  Of course, during the high season, prices are rising before our eyes.  The cost of the same trips at different travel agencies may vary, but we give an approximate price level: </p><ol><li>  Boxwood grove - 830 rubles. </li><li>  Riding on a sailing yacht - 1400 rubles. </li><li>  Jeep tour to Psaho Canyon - 1,550 rubles. </li><li>  Visiting the Kƒ±ndƒ±g thermal spring - 2500 rubles. </li><li>  Krasnaya Polyana - 600 rubles. </li><li>  33 waterfalls - 1300 rubles. </li><li>  Tour to Abkhazia - 1550 rubles. </li><li>  Parachute jumping - from 1600 rubles or more. </li></ol><h2>  The cost of rest in Sochi in 2017 </h2><p>  How much does a vacation in Sochi for two?  Based on the prices quoted by us, you can roughly calculate the budget of the trip, depending on your capabilities and preferences.  If you do not take into account visits to all kinds of entertainment events, then the minimum budget for a weekly tour will be: </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1941418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1941418.jpg?1559117878"></div><ol><li>  The flight of two tourists "Moscow-Sochi" - about ten thousand. </li><li>  Stay in a budget hotel - 2 thousand rubles a day. </li><li>  A modest three meals a day in inexpensive canteens and cafes - 1200 rubles for two vacationers (at the rate of 200 rubles per visit). </li><li>  Transportation costs (the minimum is to count on two trips daily) - 76 rubles for two. </li></ol><p>  Adding all the costs, we get the amount - 32932 rubles for two vacationers per week.  However, it is worthwhile to understand that in the calculations we took the most minimal amounts of expenses.  In fact, on-site prices may well be different, so book accommodation is in advance.  Yes, and at the resort you still want to allow yourself some entertainment and sweets, and this will significantly increase costs.  But in general, the figure given gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe amount that you need to have with the most modest vacation. </p>
