The general hysteria about Meizu and their new products did not have time to subside, as the guys from Xiaomi got down to business.  This is not about top-end smartphones like the Mi Mix, but budget devices designed for mass consumption.  And here, no one can keep up with this company.  Xiaomi has firmly settled in the budget segment in the markets of Russia and the CIS countries.  And he‚Äôs not going to leave anywhere.  Why are her products so popular?  Probably because this manufacturer gives its gadgets for a penny, and in terms of performance they are in no way inferior to mid-range devices from industry giants.  The same goes for functionality.  As evidence, we can consider the smartphone Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro 32GB.  His characteristics will not leave anyone indifferent.  But first, some facts about the company. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  The Chinese company Xiaomi was founded in 2010.  Since its birth, the manufacturer was going to engage in mobile technology.  The company immediately started developing its own firmware.  The first smartphone was released in 2011.  However, there were some difficulties with him, since the grandees of the industry saw in him a copy of their products.  However, Xiaomi did not stop production, but released a brand new smartphone and began to sell it for a penny.  This strategy fully paid off and the company's devices began to be sold in minutes.  Interestingly, some of the company's gadgets are produced at the same Foxconn factories as Apple products.  And this means that the quality of the Chinese is all right.  An example is Redmi 4 Pro.  We will examine the characteristics in subsequent chapters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Now the company is actively conquering the budget segment, as it understands that it has not yet reached the top.  But segments of the average price level and budget devices are quite up to them.  But they do not forget about flagships.  And we can say for sure that this manufacturer will achieve its goal.  The smartphones of this company have already gained immense popularity among our compatriots.  Now Xiaomi has to conquer the European market.  But they will somehow cope with this, because their equipment is high-quality, productive and looks good.  In the meantime, we begin the review of Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro.  Features, design, features, reviews - we‚Äôll consider everything. </p><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  So what is the look of Redmi 4 Pro?  To begin with, he almost completely copies the usual Quartet.  And it is true.  In fact, smartphones are identical.  It‚Äôs just that the Pro features a little better.  So, the front panel is almost all occupied by a five-inch screen, which is covered by a protective glass with a 2.5D effect.  True, the effect of this is almost invisible, since all the beautiful bends are covered by protruding faces.  The first thing that catches your eye is the giant frame of the screen.  Was it really impossible to make them smaller in 2017?  The Home, Back, etc. buttons are usually located under the screen, but without backlighting.  Saved on LEDs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Above the screen is a speaker grid, a frotal photo module and sensors.  Everything is standard.  The rear panel also does not please anything special.  The camera‚Äôs eye is located in the usual place, and a fingerprint scanner under it.  And just below - the speaker.  That's basically it.  On the side faces of the device comfortably located volume keys and a slot for SIM cards. </p><p>  Now look at the display of the Xiaomi Redmi 4 Pro.  Characteristics and reviews suggest that it has become much better since the usual Quartet. </p>

    <h2>  Screen specifications </h2><p>  What can be said about the display in this model?  It should be noted right away that here the screen is akin to what is installed in Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Pro.  The characteristics are the same.  Only a smaller size.  So, the device has a five-inch IPS panel with a resolution of Full HD (1920 by 1080 pixels).  Thanks to this resolution, you can forget about what pixels are.  They will be impossible to consider.  The color rendering of the screen is correct, the viewing angles are wide, the contrast is satisfactory.  But at the same time, a certain departure in cold tones is noticeable.  However, this cannot be considered a drawback, since everything is treated with the settings available in the operating system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The display is also equipped with an oleophobic and anti-reflective coating.  That is, he collects fingerprints to a minimum and the screen cannot be used as a mirror.  In general, the display turned out to be quite successful.  It‚Äôs even strange that such a high-quality component is installed in the budget device.  This is usually the prerogative of mid-range devices.  But the guys from Xiaomi are unpredictable. </p>

    <h2>  Hardware platform specifications </h2><p>  Now let's see what is ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù of Redmi 4 Pro.  Specifications and reviews suggest that the smartphone can easily cope with any games.  Is it so?  Yes, it seems.  The device has an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 64-bit processor with a clock frequency of 2 gigahertz.  This charm is complemented by 3 gigabytes of RAM and an advanced graphics chip.  Thanks to this configuration, the smartphone is really capable of launching and successfully pulling games like Worl of Tanks Blitz or Asphalt 8. </p><p>  He also has no problems playing high-definition video.  The amount of memory available to the user is 32 gigabytes.  But it can be expanded with Micro SD memory cards up to 256 gigabytes.  But the device is equipped with a hybrid slot, which allows you to install either two SIM cards, or a SIM card and a USB flash drive.  Here you have to choose.  Other features of the hardware platform include the presence of a rather nimble fingerprint sensor, support for LTE networks, an infrared port for controlling consumer electronics, light and proximity sensors and an additional microphone for noise reduction.  As you can see, the characteristics of the hardware platform in no way correspond to the gadget from the budget segment. </p>

    <h2>  Photomodules (main and front) </h2><p>  Now let's move on to the Redmi 4 Pro cameras.  Their characteristics are almost no different from the usual "four".  Judge for yourself.  The Pro version has a 13-megapixel aperture module.  The lens is wide-angle.  You can‚Äôt expect any miracles from the camera, but it can provide photos of acceptable quality.  In addition, she can write video in Full HD format and has several advanced shooting modes.  The camera does an excellent job of shooting in daylight, but when lighting quality deteriorates, extraneous noise and artifacts in the image immediately come out.  And the zoom here is generally for show.  The front module has 5 megapixels and is also wide-angle.  But this is where its advantages end.  There is an automatic focus, but it does not always work adequately.  Especially in low light conditions.  Whatever it was, but the front camera is quite enough for selfie lovers.  Chatting on Skype can also be quite comfortable. </p>

    <h2>  Software platform and device OS </h2><p>  Now, consider the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 Pro 32GB operating system.  Characteristics allow us to hope that the device works on some fresh ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  In principle, the way it is.  The version of the operating system used is 6.0.1.  But the OS itself is flavored with the MIUI proprietary shell.  Although it will not work to call it a shell, because the developers also changed some properties of the original Android firmware. </p><p>  The new OS looks unusual, fresh.  All items are located reasonably.  It is worth considering that if you purchased a ‚Äúgray‚Äù device with firmware for China, then your system will have a huge amount of unnecessary Chinese software that cannot be removed.  Only change the firmware to international.  If the version was official, for the European market, then everything will be all right there.  And Google services will also be in place.  It is worth noting that Xiaomi supports all of its devices, so the owners of this smartphone may well count on timely updates to the operating system. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the autonomy of Redmi 4 Pro.  Battery characteristics allow the gadget to easily work in mixed mode for two whole days.  And this despite the power of the hardware platform!  Indeed, Chinese engineers know what they are doing.  The smartphone has a non-removable 4100 mAh lithium-ion battery.  This is a lot for a modern smartphone.  Therefore, "4 Pro" is so tenacious.  Let's not forget the optimization of the hardware gadget with the operating system.  Apparently, this is the most autonomous apparatus of all living.  And this fact cannot but be rejoiced. </p>
