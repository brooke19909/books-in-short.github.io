To start a full-fledged game, ten participants are needed.  The host monitors the progress of the game and regulates its stages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mafia rules" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/4107/74136.jpg" width="467"></div>  In order to distribute roles, the leader deals cards face down: each player receives one card.  The deck consists of 10 cards: three black and seven red.  The Reds are civilians, and the Blacks are the mafia.

    <p>  One of the red cards is different from the rest - this is the Sheriff - the leader of the Reds team.  The Blacks, in turn, also have their leader - Don. </p><p>  The game is divided into changing stages of two types: night and day.  The objective of the game: "Blacks" must eliminate the "Reds" and vice versa. </p><p>  <strong>The rules of the game in the "Mafia" more ...</strong> </p><p>  Ten players are invited to the table.  At the very beginning of the game, the host announces that “night” has come and all players, without exception, must close their eyes with masks.  Then each player, in turn, removes the mask, draws out a card, examines and remembers it, the presenter hides the card, and the player puts on the mask back. </p><p>  Players in blindfolds must tilt their heads down so that the revitalization of neighbors or rustles do not become a source of any additional information for them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

This is an exceptional night when the whole mafia opens its eyes.  It was provided to them in order to, without the help of words, agree on a procedure for the liquidation of the Reds.  The “contract” should be carried out very, very quietly, as the “red” participants sitting in the immediate vicinity can feel any movement.  When the facilitator says that the “mafia is falling asleep,” the “black” participants put back on the blindfolds.

    <p>  The host announces: "Don wakes up."  The host meets Don.  In the following nights, Don will open his eyes to find the Sheriff’s game.  When the host announces that “Don is falling asleep,” Don puts on a bandage. </p><p>  Then the Sheriff wakes up.  This player opens his eyes and meets the Leader.  He will regularly wake up and look for "Blacks."  The sheriff is falling asleep. </p><p>  After meeting the Lead and the Sheriff, the morning comes when all the players remove their bandages. </p><p>  So, the first day comes.  In the afternoon there is a discussion.  <span>Professional rules of the</span> game “Mafia” say that each player has a minute to express his thoughts, ideas and suspicions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The "Reds" need to identify the "Black" players and eliminate them by voting.  And the Blacks, in turn, must secure an iron alibi and eliminate a sufficient number of Reds.  “Blacks” know “who is who”, therefore they are in a better position. </p>

During the daytime discussion, participants can nominate players (each player no more than one) in order to remove them from the game.  At the end of the discussion, a vote is taken.  The candidate who won the most votes leaves the game.

    <p>  In the game, a term such as "Car Crash."  This is the name of the situation in which several players scored the same number of votes.  In this case, voters are entitled to remain in the game for thirty seconds.  They must justify themselves, convince the players that they are not related to the mafia.  Voting occurs.  Since the fun is very popular and there are many varieties of the game "Mafia", the rules of the game may not include such situations. </p><p>  Then night falls back.  The host, after the words “The Mafia begins the hunt”, calls the numbers of the players one by one, and when the whole mafia shoots at a certain number, the player is amazed.  The rules of the game in the "Mafia" are such that if someone from the mafia "shoots" in another number, or does not make a "shot" at all, the Host determines the miss.  "Shooting" occurs by simulating a shot.  The host announces again: "The Mafia is falling asleep."  Players put on masks. </p><p>  The Host then “wakes up” Don, who opens his eyes and tries to identify the Sheriff.  He shows on the fingers a number to the Leader, under which, according to his assumptions, the Sheriff is hiding.  With a nod of the head, the Host either confirms his version or refutes it.  Don falls asleep and waking up comes the Sheriff's turn. </p><p>  The Sheriff wakes up, who also has the full right to night checks.  He is trying to find the Black players.  After the Leader’s response, the Sheriff falls asleep, and then the Leader announces the start of the second day. </p><p>  This and all subsequent circles are repeated, as on the first day.  Days and nights will alternate until the victory of a team.  It is the victory of one of the teams that the Mafia game ends, the rules of which are very simple if you follow them. </p>
