How pleasant it is to sit with relatives and friends at the common table, listen to the sound of chimes on the Spasskaya Tower under the clink of glasses, and receive small but very pleasant gifts from relatives. </p><p>  Children awaiting the arrival of Santa Claus make greeting cards for grandmothers and beloved grandfathers, depicting snowflakes, snowmen, winter landscapes and, of course, a beautiful Christmas tree on crafts.  With your own hands you can make flat and voluminous postcards. </p><p>  Many adults also like to make bright and original crafts, trying in every possible way to transform a room or a private house for the New Year holiday.  In the article we‚Äôll talk about how you can make a Christmas tree of various materials with your own hands.  In the selected photos you can see how the described work looks after manufacturing.  A step-by-step instruction will help to reproduce the same spectacular crafts at home. </p><h2>  New Year cards </h2><p>  <span>DIY paper Christmas tree</span> can be made in many ways.  Consider the two simplest.  Such crafts can even be done by preschool children.  The paper is selected quite thick and always double-sided.  It is desirable to take color green, any shade. </p><p>  In the photo on the left, the postcard is made of folded "accordion" paper.  For manufacturing, you need to roll a large sheet of A4, bending it back and forth so that the strips are the same thickness.  Then, in the center, the workpiece is folded in half.  Thick PVA glue is applied to the inner bend, then the second part of the bent sheet is attached. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can decorate a paper Christmas tree with your own hands with any toys, for example, cut stars, as in the example in the article, or create circles from different colors.  It is better to take a thin cardboard, it will hold its shape well at the sharp corners of the Christmas tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cards with paper christmas trees" class="if uuid-2420294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420294.jpg"></div><h2>  Craft from a triangle </h2><p>  The next Christmas tree is made from a carved isosceles triangle.  Its sides should be longer than the base.  Then, starting from the top, the part is folded in the same way as in the previous description.  Using a sharp awl, a round hole is made in the center line of the workpiece, where a wooden stick or twisting from a sheet of brown paper is subsequently inserted. </p><p>  A bright shiny star made of silver or golden cardboard is attached to the top of the rod.  If desired, the work can be supplemented by gluing Christmas tree decorations, assembled both from colored paper and from tinsel, then a handmade tree will be more elegant and festive. </p><h2>  We use the quilling technique </h2><p>  Many manual lovers love the ready-made quilling strips available on the market.  You can create a voluminous Christmas tree from paper with your own hands, having the most basic ideas about this type of art.  Often, beginners, when twisting the strips, use improvised tools as a rod, for example, a toothpick or a paste from a ballpoint pen. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quilling tree" class="if uuid-2420261" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420261.jpg"></div><p>  Paper is wound around it to the required mug size.  Do it freely, as in the photo above, but dense hanks will also look beautiful.  To create the trunk of a volumetric Christmas tree, do it yourself using brown color, the size can be taken thinner, then the tree itself will look more voluminous. </p><p>  The role of Christmas-tree decorations is performed by red ones or you can take multi-colored stripes, folded in small segments.  When sticking on a sheet of cardboard or on the cover page of a postcard, the triangular shape of the Christmas tree is observed, however, light green and dark green elements alternate with each other.  The top is assembled from a bright orange strip, you can collect it from a twist of another shape, for example, by pressing the opposite sides so that a drop or a square turns out.  Color may also be different - yellow or red. </p><h2>  How to make do-it-yourself Christmas tree cone crafts </h2><p>  A do-it-yourself Christmas tree on a cardboard cone will look spectacular on a festive feast.  The following components will be required: </p><ul><li>  a large sheet of thick paper or cardboard; </li><li>  paper clips; </li><li>  stapler; </li><li>  corrugated or cigarette tissue paper in bright colors; </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cardboard christmas tree" class="if uuid-2420213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420213.jpg"></div><p>  The first step is to roll a sheet of paper in the shape of a cone.  The base is leveled with scissors so that the craft is even on the surface of the table.  The edges are assembled with staples and staples.  Then corrugated paper is cut into thin strips and one of the sides is cut with ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù.  After that, a cone is glued in a spiral, starting from the top of the figure. </p><p>  The base is completely filled, and each turn is overlapped.  The cone should not be visible at all.  The top of the original Christmas tree made of cardboard with your own hands can be made from any means at hand, for example, by attaching a star cut out of cardboard.  Instead of Christmas decorations, glued half beads or bright pompons will look beautiful. </p><h2>  Surprise tree </h2><p>  I will like such a handmade tree (photo below in the article) not only for children, but also for adult sweet-toes, because a cardboard cone made according to the method described above is decorated not only with tinsel and garland segments.  One of the layers of decoration is candy.  A prerequisite for their placement will be the presence of a candy wrapper, which has a twist of a ponytail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweets on a small Christmas tree" class="if uuid-2420192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420192.jpg"></div><p>  It is preferable to take a garland of green color, and candy wrappers of candies can be multi-colored.  Craft elements are attached to transparent thin tape, then sweets can be easily removed from the base of the New Year‚Äôs beauty.  You can put such a sweet craft on the children's holiday table, explaining to the kids how to take out the sweets so as not to damage the base. </p><h2>  Stripe cone </h2><p>  One of the options for decorating a Christmas tree with your own hands will be gluing paper strips of the same size onto a conical cardboard base.  You can, of course, take advantage of the wide quilling stripes commercially available, but cutting them according to the template yourself will also not be difficult.  The strips are cut approximately 8-10 cm long and folded in half to make a loop.  You can view a sample of this type of crafts on the main photo in the article. </p><p>  On how to make a Christmas tree with your own hands + step-by-step instructions - further.  The loops are cut at the request of either the same color or different.  Yes, and the elements themselves can be placed as stripes, and alternate in colors in each layer.  Stitching is done from bottom to top.  After circular gluing of one row, the next is performed with an offset of 1-2 cm higher than the previous one. </p><p>  When the whole cone is covered with multi-colored "twigs", you can decorate the tree.  A variety of objects are used: pieces of napkins or corrugated paper twisted into balls, beads and pebbles, even stickers with cartoon characters.  An asterisk can be glued to the top. </p><p>  In the manufacture of strips for crafts often use not only paper.  Satin ribbons or cut pieces from felt sheets will look beautiful.  In this way, you can collect the crafts from pieces of organza, instead of strips, cut squares and attach to the center point, get lush bows.  One can dream endlessly while decorating a cardboard cone. </p><h2>  Corrugated paper craft </h2><p>  As can be seen in the photograph of the sample below, such a voluminous, but rather simple in execution Christmas tree consists of several pieces of the same width cut.  They are different in length.  Each subsequent piece of paper is shorter than the previous one by 1-1.5 cm. Work on the attachment is performed sequentially from the bottom up. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper tree" class="if uuid-2420189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420189.jpg"></div><p>  You can make such a huge tree and place it on the wall on a piece of paper, on the door of a classroom in a school or kindergarten.  Each strip on the top line is smeared with PVA glue and picked up at the time of attachment.  The next part is taken in a smaller size.  The very top of the Christmas tree is made from the smallest element.  An asterisk is glued on top.  You can glue the branches in small circles, collect them from confetti crackers. </p><h2>  Spectacular Christmas tree made of thick paper </h2><p>  How to make a Christmas tree with your own hands, so that it turns out to be original, we will tell further in the article.  However, you need to understand that the work ahead is laborious and meticulous.  First, with a compass, circles of different sizes are drawn on green thick paper.  Then each element needs to be delineated by sector.  To do this, the ruler draws diameters in a circle.  The number of sectors depends on the size of the circle.  Then, in the center, a smaller circle is indicated by a compass.  This is a place for fastening parts to each other.  Prior to the internal marking, sectors are drawn along the drawn lines. </p><div class="photo" data-original="the-about.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree from circles" class="if uuid-2421366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2421366.jpg"></div><p>  The edges of each sector are twisted into small cones and glued together.  When everything is done, the part is turned over and a nylon thread with a volume knot tied at the end is threaded into the hole from the compass needle.  The next work is done in a similar way, only the circle is selected with a smaller diameter. </p><p>  The more components in the craft, the higher and more voluminous it looks.  The top is made of a sheet twisted by a cone.  Each twig can be decorated with sparkles or confetti circles. </p><h2>  You can sew a Christmas tree </h2><p>  In many countries, there is a tradition for the New Year not only to decorate the interior of a room or house, but also to hang New Year's crafts on the front doors.  It can be a wreath of spruce or pine branches.  We offer you to preserve nature and decorate the decoration with the help of fabric, small toys and a magnificent bow, assembled from bright satin ribbons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Christmas tree crafts" class="if uuid-2420208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420208.jpg"></div><p>  It is advisable to take the fabric inexpensive, absolutely any delicate matter can be used, only the color should be green.  It is cut into squares.  Their size depends on the amount of crafts.  Using a thread, a small ball is sewn into the center of each.  For such work, inexpensive Chinese plastic Christmas decorations are quite suitable.  You can not mount them on every element.  The photo above shows that some squares are sewn in the middle without a toy, and in others they have made the lights of a garland. </p><p>  From layer to layer, the number of square flaps sewn in the middle is reduced.  At the top there are only a few.  From above, all the edges are joined and sewn together at one point, on which a lush bow is subsequently worn.  It is most convenient to use a fabric or cardboard base to fasten all the elements in the correct sequence.  However, it should not be completely visible. </p><h2>  Christmas tree made of felt </h2><p>  With your own hands, you can also create a small Christmas tree made of felt to decorate the forest beauty.  For sewing, you need to take two sheets of green felt, you can use different shades.  You will also need a small piece of brown and orange for the stars at the top. </p><p>  You can choose a piece of synthetic winterizer or cotton wool with the internal filler.  The Christmas tree is stitched from stencil-cut blanks with mouline thread of the desired shade.  Although contrasting threads can also look beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="felt christmas beauty" class="if uuid-2420276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420276.jpg"></div><p>  Decorate a Christmas toy with multi-colored buttons or a garland of beads worn on a thread.  The craft is easy to sew, since felt is a convenient material in work.  Sheets of this material can be of different shades, but they all have bright and saturated colors. </p><p>  Do not forget to attach a loop of thin rope to the top of the craft so that the Christmas tree decoration can be hung on a branch. </p><h2>  Topiary </h2><p>  Now the fashion trend has become the production of topiary.  They are made in different shapes.  For the New Year, it is natural to use an elongated foam cone as a basis.  For work you will need: </p><ul><li>  green sisal; </li><li>  plastic garland of small decorative elements of red color; </li><li>  wide ribbon for a bow; </li><li>  two thick wooden sticks (branches), you can use tight newspaper tubes; </li><li>  white tape or strip of paper for gluing sticks; </li><li>  grounds for the topiary in the form of children's shoes; </li><li>  gypsum powder; </li><li>  plastic cups; </li><li>  twigs of live pine for decoration; </li><li>  a bowl for mixing gypsum; </li><li>  glue gun and PVA glue. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree topiary" class="if uuid-2420206" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2420206.jpg"></div><p>  Start work on the craft with the design of the Christmas tree itself.  For this, the cone is smeared with PVA glue, sisal is wound abundantly on it.  The base should not be visible.  The top is placed above the cone and bends to the side.  To keep it in this position, you can attach a Christmas tree toy of any shape to it.  Using a glue gun, a garland is attached, tied in a spiral around the cone, and a bow with a pebble in the center is glued. </p><p>  The "legs" for the Christmas tree are made of sticks.  First, they are wrapped with a white cloth or paper, then inserted into the foam, spreading the upper parts with a glue gun.  It remains to strengthen the base so that our Christmas tree stands firmly on the table.  This is done as usual for the production of topiary method, namely, a gypsum mixture is made by mixing the powder with water in a separate bowl.  The consistency of thick sour cream is needed.  Then it is poured into plastic cups and, until the mixture has frozen, sticks are inserted.  You can temporarily lean the craft against the wall until the gypsum hardens.  Then the cups are inserted into children's shoes and decorated with sprigs of pine or spruce. </p><p>  The article gives just a few options for making decorative Christmas trees.  Try to do any for the holiday.  Engage in the creation of crafts for children and family members.  It will unite everyone and entertain before the holiday. </p>
