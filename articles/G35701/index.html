Location  What is worth a visit? </h2><p>  Seashore Pattaya Resort 3 * is located on Central Pattaya Road.  The beach is located just 350 meters from the hotel, but be careful, because from April to September, jellyfish appear off the coast. </p>

Alcazar Cabaret is 100 meters away and there are many other bars, cubes, massage parlors and restaurants.

    <p>  It is also worth noting the presence of a menu in Russian at almost all food outlets.  Nearby (somewhere in one kilometer) is the Central Festival Pattaya Beach shopping center, where you can buy branded clothes and souvenirs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 15 minutes you can reach the famous Walking Street with its nightclubs and other entertainment venues.  We also recommend visiting <span>the Pattaya</span> Water <span>Park</span> and the Artin Paradise Museum, located 10 minutes from the hotel.  By visiting it, you will plunge into the world of contemporary art and get a lot of vivid photographs. </p><p>  It is recommended that you rent a vehicle for the rest, so that you can easily get to the places described above and, if you wish, just arrange a discreet trip to Pattaya.  But more accurately, Thais on the street - this is a great demonstration of <span>Brownian movement</span> in real life. </p><p>  Please note that the hotel building has a free parking zone. </p><h2>  About the hotel.  Benefits </h2><p>  Wi-Fi is free throughout.  Each air-conditioned room has a seating area with great views of the large outdoor pool with built-in fountain or the picturesque garden for walks. </p><p>  You will enjoy the hotel's terrace, as well as many entertainment programs and a children's pool.  Seashore Pattaya Resort 3 * also provides such amenities in rooms as air conditioning, hairdryer, TV with 4 Russian channels, a safe where you can put money and documents, an electric kettle, a coffee maker and a refrigerator, so that you do not have to go down to the reception to have tea or coffee (free bottled water is also included).  Believe me, you will not encounter the problem that you have nowhere to clean, for example, recently bought yogurt. </p>

Rooms are cleaned daily.  Bathrooms, of course, include towels and all the necessary toiletries and cosmetics.  There is also a balcony where you can go out and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere of Seashore Pattaya Resort 3 *.  You can always book a massage or play table tennis or billiards.

Here, in an informal setting, guests will be offered an abundance of Thai and international dishes, breakfast, lunch and dinner are provided, if desired with room service.  As mentioned earlier, to other food outlets and shops from the resort hotel Seashore Pattaya Resort 3 * is only five minutes walk. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Alas, you cannot keep pets at the hotel, so you will have to part with your pets for the rest. </p><p>  The beaches in Pattaya are public, so you can‚Äôt note their cleanliness, Jomtien Beach will provide you a relaxing holiday, Pattaya Beach is the busiest beach.  Nearby are almost all the resort's attractions, and the quietest and cleanest beach is Naklua Beach.  But you don‚Äôt need to worry, you can swim on the nearby islands, there you will not be confused by a large number of vacationers. </p>

And do not try to use tap water, this is not Switzerland for you!

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do visitors say about Seashore Pattaya Resort 3 *?  Reviews diverge, we will not hide it.  Opinions are divided 50/50.  Someone complains about a dirty beach, there is a problem, but we will analyze it at the end of the article, because  We believe that this should not apply to the assessment of the hotel. </p><p>  Someone scolds old furniture, but these are trifles, you will not sit and look at cabinets and cabinets in the room all day, right?  Many say that this is because of the city itself, because they think that such a situation in each of its buildings, maybe they are right, or maybe not. </p><p>  And who is guilty of these conclusions?  Seashore <span>Pattaya Resort 3 *?</span>  <span>Pattaya?</span>  Reviews, good or bad, are written on emotions, and we need an objective assessment, right?  Therefore, the culprit is not the city itself, its culture or hotel owners, but too picky guests. </p>

    <p>  There are no special complaints to the rest - televisions, air conditioners, kettles, etc. are in perfect order.  The room electronics are working properly, the staff is responsive, the food is good. </p><h2>  Visitors </h2><p>  Tourists come to Pattaya from almost the entire globe, so you can not only find a company in the form of bored compatriots, but also make friends who speak another language. </p><h2>  A little about Pattaya </h2><p>  Pattaya is an ideal place for relaxing young couples, because it is famous for the most active and fiery nightlife in the world.  And to visit this city is not only entertaining, but also for educational purposes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Let's go back to the allegedly main problem of the Seashore Pattaya Resort 3 *.  Reviews that spoil everyone's opinion about the hotel tell us that the beaches are dirty.  Let‚Äôs ask a question that can at least somehow protect her reputation. </p><p>  Since when does the state of the beach relate to the assessment of the hotel, when is it not responsible for this beach?  And let's not forget that this is a 3-star hotel, and raising the bar of expectations is at least illogical. </p>
