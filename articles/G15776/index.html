It will take a lot of time to fully explore this settlement, where history haunts travelers literally at every step.  Therefore, it is worth starting your acquaintance with Rouen with a tour of the most outstanding sights. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  Rouen is a city in France, on the territory of which many examples of medieval architecture are concentrated.  Travelers who find themselves here must certainly see the famous Notre Dame Cathedral, created in the <span>Gothic style.</span>  Its construction was carried out for more than three centuries, it was begun in the 12th century and completed in the 16th.  It is known that the cathedral was considered the tallest building on the planet until it lost this title in 1880.  Its height is 151 meters. </p>

    <p>  Once the famous artist Monet dedicated a whole series of landscapes to the facade of the cathedral.  The famous impressionist was fascinated by the play of shadow and light on an impeccable openwork facade, was ready for days and weeks to capture the building from different angles, constantly noting new details. </p><h2>  Rouen (France): Gothic churches </h2><p>  Of course, Notre Dame Cathedral is not the only famous building that has survived from the dark Middle Ages.  Equally majestic and beautiful is the church of Saint-Ouen, built in the 14th century by the Benedictines.  The tourists‚Äôs most worthy of attention is the church tower, on top of which there is a pointed tower, which earned the nickname "Crown of Normandy."  One cannot fail to note the splendor of 80 stained-glass windows, which were created so that the church would always be bright.  Finally, interest should be shown in the famous organ of Cavallier-Coll. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Of course, there are other Gothic buildings that Rouen (France) deserves to be proud of.  For example, one cannot fail to see the church of Saint-Macloux, the construction of which was completed in the 15th century.  The history of this place cannot be called rosy, in the 14th century the church cemetery served as a burial place for thousands of plague victims.  Everyone can visit the cemetery, who are not afraid of the ancient tombstones with carved bones and skulls. </p><h2>  Palace of Justice </h2><p>  Rouen (France) has other attractions that can impress connoisseurs of Gothic architecture.  The Palace of Justice is one of the most monumental buildings in the world, made in the Gothic style.  The left wing is the oldest part of it, erected in 1499.  Completely construction was completed only in the 19th century.  Once upon a time, the Jewish quarter was located on the site of this building, the inhabitants of which were expelled by William the Conqueror in 1306. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, during World War II, this example of Gothic architecture was severely damaged.  The greatest damage was done to him in 1944, the walls preserved traces of shells.  It is believed that the inhabitants of the city deliberately do not carry out restoration work to emphasize their dissatisfaction with the way the allies liberated this settlement from the Nazi troops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Art Museum </h2><p>  What other interesting places is famous for Rouen (France)?
