    <h2>  Strategy </h2><p>  Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale international financial group completed the consolidation process in July 2011, which allowed it to raise the rating of Rosbank.  At the same time, assets were also added to this group by Bank Societe Generale Vostok, also Russian. </p><p>  From the moment it was founded in 1993, Rosbank existed in various organizational and legal forms: AKB, AOZT, TOO, ZAO, until its acquisition in 1998 by Potanin (Inteross Holding Company), after which the financial organization ZAO Joint-Stock Commercial Bank Rosbank appeared. </p><p>  The strategy of the new financial education was still aimed at reaching leadership positions and the quality of customer service.  Since then, business growth has been steadily increasing; Rosbank's rating has been upgraded, which was due to increased interaction between all divisions.  Profitability due to obtaining a new legal form of an open joint-stock company in 1999 reached a stable position. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Achievements </h2><p>  In 2003, the network of Rosbank branches expanded significantly.  The rating became even higher after the purchase of the HVAC financial group for two hundred million dollars, and already in 2005 Rosbank received the Golden Lion laureate award, becoming a leader in consumer lending.  However, it was difficult to achieve the set goals without support from abroad, and therefore, in 2006, ten percent stakes ($ 317 million each) were bought by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, a banking group from France. </p><p>  In addition, this group received the option necessary to acquire another thirty percent and two Rosbank shares ($ 1.7 billion).  The purchase was completed in February 2008. </p><p>  In 2012, cooperation began with Alfa Bank, which is still ongoing.  The ATM network of these banks is integrated.  Clients of Alfa-Bank and Rosbank use the devices without additional deductions.  The rating of these financial organizations surprises many today.  For many years, enterprises were among the twenty <span>best banks in the</span> country. </p><p>  At the same time, Rosbank sold its Belarusian branch (BelRosBank) to Alfa Bank to expand its partner‚Äôs position in the Republic of Belarus.  Two years earlier, the inclusion of the most profitable state energy financing program in its activities significantly strengthened the positions that Rosbank managed to take.  His rating was steadily growing. </p>

    <h2>  More higher </h2><p>  Then, in 2010, rebranding took place - a whole range of different activities within the framework of the marketing strategy, which ended with a change in the brand, manufactured goods, slogan and even positioning.  The merger of Rosbank with BSGV (Bank Societe Generale Vostok) prompted such steps. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Joint plans for the consolidation of Russian assets of Rusfinansbank, Deltacredit Bank, Bank Societe Generale Vostok and Rosbank were announced.  In total, experts estimated the volume of assets at 656 billion rubles.  When the merger was completed, the rating of PJSC Rosbank surprised everyone: it became the third in the country according to estimates among private banks.  Only Alfa Bank and their principal competitor, Unicreditbank, were ahead. </p><h2>  Rebranding </h2><p>  At the same time, in 2010, Rosbank and Bank Societe Generale Vostok united their ATMs into a single network so that holders of BSGV cards could operate at Rosbank ATMs without additional fees.  The following year, Rosbank took possession of all one hundred percent of the shares of Deltacredit Bank and Rusfinansbank. </p><p>  In 2011, another reorganization took place, joining BSGV CJSC to Rosbank under the already adopted Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale logo: a black and red square with a white stripe, a new font and information about Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale's affiliation. </p><p>  By the end of 2011, there were significantly more partner banks, which means that there are also terminals and ATMs.  Thanks to this policy, customers could very quickly make various banking operations.  The rating of Rosbank among other banks in such conditions simply could not grow. </p>

    <h2>  New strategy </h2><p>  In 2014, a new business development strategy was developed, aimed at increasing primarily transactional services.  And this is settlement and cash services, and trade finance, and money transfers, and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All work processes were automated, which increased the speed and quality of service.  Remote service via the Internet has also expanded.  Mobile banking has appeared. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the ATM network covered not only the whole country, but was also present in foreign countries.  The efficiency of the network has improved; the entire structure in the Rosbank system has been optimized. </p><p>  This organization occupied a different place in the <span>rating of banks</span> , which was due precisely to the factors of reorganization.  Nevertheless, this bank was not just ‚Äúafloat‚Äù, it was adamantly and stubbornly moving towards real success. </p>

    <h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  Rosbank is among the <span>most reliable banks,</span> according to Forbes magazine, and in this capacity occupied the first place among Russian financial organizations, which we discussed above.  Coordinates the activities of all divisions formed over the years of its existence, a multi-level management system with a head office in Moscow and seven branches. </p><p>  Rosbank is represented in Vladivostok, Krasnoyarsk, Rostov-on-Don, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, St. Petersburg and Moscow.  There are additional offices, as well as operational offices and cash desks.  Already in 2015 there were about six hundred of them in 332 cities and towns of Russia. </p><h2>  suggestions </h2><p>  The reliability rating of Rosbank is now very high.  With this bank, investing in the global economy is real, where all kinds of guarantees are provided.  The Bank has also introduced new investment programs in life insurance (in rubles and US dollars): five-year insurance guarantees 300,000 rubles or $ 5,000, and the three-year Premier Invest program (only in rubles) - the same 300,000 in St. Petersburg and Moscow and 100,000 in other regions. </p><p>  Three strategies operate here: Global Economy, Equity Portfolio and Multifund.  In accordance with personal preferences for profitability and risk, the client can choose: the world market, the US market, shares of successful pharmaceutical companies, Eurobonds and the like.  Now all Rosbank customers have the opportunity to invest with a guarantee of the return of one hundred percent of the invested funds in the global economy, even if the dynamics of the financial market is negative, as it is now. </p>

    <h2>  How it works </h2><p>  This is a comprehensive financial solution.  It combines almost unlimited income from such investments.  It always guarantees the return at the end of the program of all one hundred percent of the invested funds.  In addition, there is a long series of benefits offered to the client.  For example, insurance cover for the entire duration of the contract, legal preferences. </p><p>  All invested funds will be distributed between different instruments: conservative (deposits, federal bonds) and investment, where there is a higher level of risk (other bonds, shares, derivative financial instruments).  This insurance contribution for the entire period of validity of the contract is protected from confiscation, seizure and division of property, income tax in the event of an insured event is also not subject to tax.  That is why so many entrepreneurs and businessmen choose Rosbank. </p><h2>  Credit rating </h2><p>  Moody's international rating agency, which has been operating since 1900 and is very authoritative among financial institutions, published the following independent opinion on the rating of Rosbank in 2017: long-term rating of Ba 2, and short-term rating of NP.  The last designation is liquidity on a speculative scale, which reflects Moody's opinion on the possibilities of internal resources that can generate funds, given the possibility of attracting external sources to cover monetary obligations for a period of 12 months.  Here the short-term rating is Not Prime. </p><p>  Another rating agency - Fitch Ratings - has been known to the world since 1923.  Assessing the creditworthiness of participants in credit markets, it provides analytical studies regarding the prospects of a bank.  In 2017, with the letters AAA, Rosbank got only the national rating line, with respect to sustainability rating - bb +.  This is a good result against the backdrop of the crisis and a sharp fall in the ruble.  The credit rating of Rosbank from the Analytical Credit Rating Agency is AAA (RU). </p><h2>  Rosbank and CFT </h2><p>  Rosbank and the Center for Financial Technologies have successfully completed a project to introduce CFT applications in the IT infrastructure, which are necessary for interaction with the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).  As a result, this cooperation helped bring the business processes of PJSC Rosbank to a new and higher level. </p><p>  CFT applications installed in the bank automate the entire process of interaction with the DIA on the organization of insurance payments to those bank depositors who have an insured event.  From the acceptance of the registers of these investors who are entitled to insurance compensation, to the direct issuance of indemnities and the sending of a report to the DIA. </p><p>  The need for high functionality and readiness for positive integration into the existing landscape of information technologies have determined this choice.  By decision of the CFT, a field of activity is opened for Rosbank, which is ready at any time to act as an insurance payment agent when the DIA contest is announced, and also allows you to quickly organize and without delay make payments to investors, ensuring the quality of service.  This project and its successful implementation once again emphasized the high reliability of Rosbank. </p>
