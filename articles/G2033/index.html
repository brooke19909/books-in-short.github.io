As this area developed, security systems became more compact, and their filling more efficient.  Unlike wired devices, such a complex has autonomous power supply, which also increases its reliability.  But similar equipment has its own nuances.  First of all, this is a high cost, because the technical components have a complicated design and internal structure.  In addition, wireless alarm systems can be quite a hassle to set up.  For example, nowadays popular GSM-type kits need to be filled with information with contacts for sending alarm messages.  Similar principles apply to classic wired models, but the configuration of their settings is simpler and more familiar to the average user. </p><h2>  What are the criteria for choosing a model? </h2>

    <p>  On the market you can find special kits designed for work in the house, apartment, cottage, etc. The functionality of such devices was originally designed for the specifics of the protected object.  Nevertheless, each case is individual, and some parameters should be separately compared with the requirements.  So, for starters, the ability of the device to work without connecting to the mains is determined.  For this, the wireless alarm is supplied with a battery, the capacity of which will determine the duration of the autonomous operation of the system.  Next, a set of functions is determined - in particular, it can be the inclusion of a siren, <span>control of</span> water <span>leaks</span> and sending alarm messages to the host's mobile phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth approaching the choice of alarm sensors.  A modern GSM system can interact with motion sensors, glass breaking, door openings, etc. The number of such devices depends on the efficiency that a wireless alarm can provide in specific operating conditions.  For example, in a small apartment, you can limit yourself to one motion detector installed in front of the door.  However, in a large private house will have to provide control over all areas of potential penetration.  Now it is worth considering in more detail what the best manufacturers in this segment offer. </p>

    <p>  This time, Ginzzu and, in particular, its HS-K series, represent the low-cost model category.  The set includes not only elements for wireless notification of the owner of the protected object, but also a set of IP cameras.  In total for 8 thousand rubles.  the user receives a control panel with a 1.3 MP video camera and motion sensors designed for installation in windows and doors.  I must say that Ginzzu wireless alarm systems organically combine a technological approach to security and ease of use.  This complex provides the ability to individually configure several zones in different modes - from partial monitoring to round-the-clock.  If we talk about the use of new technological solutions, the developers offer system control through smartphone applications or through web services. </p><h2>  Model Falcon Eye FE </h2><p>  An even more advanced security system is Falcon's Eye FE.  This set of GSM alarms provides the ability to install 32 sensors, which can also be controlled wirelessly.  In addition to this kit, a siren and a remote control are included.  Communication with the user is carried out on all modern channels from a phone call and SMS to sending an electronic message. </p><p>  The model is equipped with a built-in microphone, which transmits an audio signal from the observation site.  Despite the wide functionality, working with the Eye FE complex is not so difficult.  The control panel, which is equipped with GSM-alarm, includes an ergonomic LCD screen and a built-in keyboard. </p><h2>  Alarm from Alexor </h2>

    <p>  Alexor company presents on the market an expensive, but one of the most effective developments in the class of wireless alarms.  This is a complex of the KIT495-4EUH2 series, which includes a multifunctional DSC panel, a control panel, an infrared detector, an opening sensor and a battery with a transformer.  This is the optimal wireless <span>alarm system for the home,</span> for the safety of which increased demands are placed on it.  The fact is that the developers have provided a two-way radio channel to increase the reliability of communication with the owner.  As for functionality, the owner will have access to control over 32 zones with the ability to connect 4 sirens. </p><p>  The main advantage of this complex is the implementation of program changes to the main panel via Ethernet or GPRS from a remote computer.  In addition, the system has special protection against false alarms.  For example, a known problem is when animals accidentally activate motion sensors.  In turn, the Alexor wireless alarm system allows you to minimize this disadvantage due to the finer settings of the sensors. </p><h2>  Installation and configuration guidelines </h2>

    <p>  First of all, the design of the system is carried out with the designation of the points of installation of wireless sensors.  An analysis should be made of the most vulnerable areas and the possibilities for providing them with control elements.  Using the latches included in the kit, an alarm is installed, the basis of which is <span>the control panel.</span>  It will also interact with the detectors through wireless channels. </p><p>  Next, you need to configure all the work items and, most importantly, conduct its test.  Setup is done through the panel interface.  Some models also provide the ability to connect a computer to this process.  Depending on where the installation of the alarm was made, additional settings may also be required in terms of the delivery of the facility for monitoring - for example, with keyless access by timer. </p><h2>  Wireless Alarm Reviews </h2><p>  The effectiveness of the basic functions of most users is not satisfactory.  It is noted not only that the GSM-alarm is clearly triggered during moments of activity in the room, but also that gas leakages, water overflows, etc. are properly monitored. At the same time, GSM wireless security is not without flaws that users also note.  For example, budget models still take criticism of false positives.  But high-tech expensive models are not ideal.  They are criticized for the complexity of management and the demanding maintenance. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Still, it cannot be said that wireless systems completely replaced traditional security systems, including cable connections in the infrastructure.  Oddly enough, the advantages and disadvantages of both systems do not have fundamental contradictions.  For example, a wireless-type GSM alarm kit is only convenient in the installation process.  Many manufacturers note that the lack of a physical connection increases the reliability of the system, but in practice, wire trimming by criminals is extremely rare.  In any case, until this moment the alarm manages to work.  Perhaps the main advantage that pushed wireless systems forward is nevertheless an expanded communication capability with convenient connection to the Internet and mobile devices. </p>
