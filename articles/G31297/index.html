    <h2>  A few words about the manufacturer </h2><p>  Liebherr is a German brand that produces premium class refrigerators and freezers. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the company appeared in the postwar period and was founded by Hans Liebherr in 1949.  To date, the company is still managed by descendants, but the headquarters moved to Switzerland. </p><p>  It is surprising that the manufacturer was initially engaged in the production of equipment for construction, and only five years after active work did the company present its first refrigerator to the public. </p><p>  Since the goods began to enjoy considerable demand, it was decided to develop a line of high-quality refrigerators.  Today, Liebherr is a huge holding company, which has about 130 companies involved in: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Development and production of construction equipment (hoists, cranes). </li><li>  Equipment and necessary components in the aviation sector. </li><li>  The release of refrigerators and freezers. </li></ol><h2>  Liebherr CES 4023: model history </h2><p>  And although the main activity of the company was initially the design and production of construction equipment and only after the company launched the production of refrigeration units, the first devices were much different from those that are currently on store shelves.  The first models had a small capacity, and also needed constant defrosting. </p><p>  Desiring to improve the quality and functionality of their appliances, Liebherr tried various freezing options.  For example, each section was cooled separately by a vertical evaporator.  The system has received quite a lot of application and has acquired a separate name FrostSaFe.  In the early 70s, the first electronically controlled refrigerator appeared, which was a major breakthrough in this area. </p><p>  Some models were equipped with special sound signals that were triggered as a result of an increase in temperature in the freezer or the danger of defrosting.  In addition, it really saved oblivious owners who often did not close the doors tightly.  However, today all refrigerators of this manufacturer are produced in accordance with the latest technologies, so they have gained wide popularity in the consumer market. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fridge liebherr ces 4023" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/1837290.jpg"></div>

The Liebherr CES 4023 two-compartment refrigerator is silver in color and has dimensions: 60 x 63 x 198 cm. </p><p>  Thanks to the hi-tech design, we can confidently say that it will harmoniously complement any original solution. </p><p>  The Liebherr CES 4023 is equipped with an LED display that complements the modern electronic control system.  It makes it easy to set and control the temperature in both chambers.  Thanks to the intuitive configuration with control, any user will quickly understand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="two-compartment refrigerator liebherr ces 4023" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/1837779.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The total capacity is about 372 liters.  Analyzing consumer reviews, it can be noted that due to the economical consumption of electricity (A +), you can not worry about the increase in numbers in the receipt. </p><p>  The freezer also deserves special attention, because it works not only efficiently, but also efficiently.  It can freeze about 15 kg per day.  The total capacity of the freezer is 91 liters.  The consumer has the opportunity to freeze products of completely different types.  The ‚Äúsuper freeze‚Äù function is very useful when loading a large number of fresh products into the freezer.  To prevent a temperature increase, this option must be activated in 24 hours. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the refrigerator, all shelves are made of shockproof glass.  In addition, this material is hygienic, scratch resistant, and can withstand heavy loads.  According to the housewives, such shelves are quite easy to wash.  The volume of the refrigerating chamber is 281 liters.  It is equipped with comfortable and fairly spacious drawers for storing fruits and vegetables.  There is a special shelf for storing foods such as butter or chilled meat.  The door is equipped with large pockets for bottles.  Unsharp lighting does not irritate the eye. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the Liebherr CES 4023 (24001) refrigerator has quite good power, it works silently (the indicator does not exceed 41 dB).  Even when using the autonomous mode for a long time, it is able to maintain a favorable temperature both in the refrigerator and in the freezer.  This model is designed primarily for practical and functional use, and therefore enjoys considerable popularity among consumers. </p><h2>  Advantages of the bottom location of the freezer </h2><p>  Coming to the store, many consumers have difficulty deciding which refrigerator to choose, with an upper or lower freezer.  It is important to note that the second option has a freezer, larger in volume, respectively, will be beneficial to those who purchase products in advance and freeze them for a long period of time.  It is relevant to use for freezing vegetables, berries or mushrooms.  In addition, opening the freezer, which is located at the bottom of the refrigerator, a person immediately sees what he needs to get and nothing is distracting.  All products are in sight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liebherr ces 4023 24001" class="if" height="436" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/1837780.jpg" width="598"></div>

    <h2>  Who could be uncomfortable with such a model? </h2><p>  If we talk about a significant drawback, this arrangement will be inconvenient for people who suffer from a disease of the musculoskeletal system or bone disease.  It will be very difficult for them to bend down and get the necessary products.  In addition, it also brings inconvenience to older people. </p><h2>  Defrost system </h2><p>  In the early 90s, no one would have believed that in the future there would be such refrigerators that would not have to be thawed every month to get rid of the ice "coat".  The two-chamber Liebherr CES 4023 refrigerator also has a modern defrosting system. User reviews indicate its convenience.  The drip defrosting system of the refrigerator prevents the appearance of an ice "coat" on the walls and creates a natural microclimate that helps to keep food fresh for much longer.  The freezer is thawed manually, but in it, unlike old refrigerators, ice forms much more slowly.  Forced defrosting is required once every 6-12 months, depending on the intensity of operation of the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liebherr ces 4023 model history" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/1837777.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <h2>  The advantages of a drip defrost system </h2><p>  In the refrigerator Liebherr CES 4023 (24 001) this is exactly the defrosting system.  Its main advantage is the long-term preservation of products in excellent quality. </p><p>  Today, No Frost systems, which are referred to as "automatic defrosting", are quite popular.  However, in refrigerators with such systems, the products are very weathered.  So that vegetables or fruits do not dry, you have to store them in unopened bags. </p><p>  In refrigerators with a drip defrosting system, food is cooled in the shortest possible time, and when the door is opened, the temperature does not have time to rise much, so it does not spoil the quality of the food already stored there. </p><p>  Another plus is emergency operation.  In the event of a power outage, the products will remain chilled for another 25 hours. </p><p>  Also, in comparison with the automatic defrosting system, the drip consumes significantly less energy and works much quieter, even during the activation of the ‚Äúsuperfrost‚Äù function. </p><p>  Even in the absence of an ice coat, in order to prolong the life of the refrigerator, it is recommended to use the manual defrosting mechanism at least once a year and rinse it as a preventive measure. </p><h2>  The presence or absence of the ability to change the location of the shelves </h2><p>  In many reviews, you can find information that refrigerators, in which you can independently change the position of the shelves, live a little longer.  Each person most often at an unconscious level seeks to distribute the entire load evenly.  In addition, if it is not possible to change the fixation of shelves, voluminous pans and pans may not fit into the refrigerator, which often brings great discomfort.  In the Lebherr CES 4023 refrigerator this problem is solved.  In addition, if necessary, the doors can be re-hung. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liebherr ces 4023 24 001" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/54286/1837292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Model benefits </h2><p>  The main advantages of the Liebherr CES 4023 model, according to customers, is the use of high-quality materials, assembly at the highest level.  User reviews confirm the manufacturer's specifications.  With such a refrigerator, the owner can forget about minor breakdowns or the need to look for a replacement for any parts for repair.  Many consumers note its quiet operation, almost in silent mode.  It is impossible not to mention the qualitative performance of the main functions: storage in the refrigerator and deep freezing.  Products remain fresh for a long time and do not dry.  In the event of an emergency power outage, you should not worry about the quality of the products, because for some time the refrigerator will be able to cope with this problem on its own. </p>

    <h2>  Model flaws </h2><p>  The disadvantage of Liebherr CES 4023 for some consumers is the high cost.  But this aspect is inherent in all technology of this manufacturer.  However, it is worth noting that at all times, quality things or equipment were expensive and always justified their value.  Therefore, there is nothing surprising in this.  In addition, Liebherr refrigerators have not a Chinese, but a Belarusian assembly, which is manifested in its high quality.  Accessories are also of European quality. </p>
