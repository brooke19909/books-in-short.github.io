It was then, during the period of devastation, that <span>organized criminal</span> groups began to appear (abbreviated as organized crime groups).  One of the leaders of such a team was Vitaly Demochka.  The biography of many people now known contains dark spots that appeared precisely in the "dashing 90s."  The so-called thieves in law had special weight and authority.  The gang leaders and their “sixes” already obeyed them. </p><h2>  Childhood and youth </h2><p>  On the snowy expanses of the Ussuri Territory, near the city of Vladivostok, on December 5, 1970, Vitaly Demochka was born.  The biography of this boy before studying at the school did not differ from the biography of his one-year-old.  Then absenteeism followed, smoking hemp - and he was expelled.  At the same time, Vitaly’s grades in subjects were very good.  He was known as a smoothie and romantic.  For months and weeks, a young man could achieve a girl he liked. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vitaly demo biography" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10494/318169.jpg" width="512"></div></h2><h2>  The first criminal steps and the first imprisonment </h2><p>  Those students who studied well received a scholarship - 72 rubles.  After the deduction, the young man began to “come to visit” the excellent students, and they “shared” half of the money with him.  Instead, he left them with even teeth and whole bones. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Then Vitaly Demochka, whose biography was only gaining a criminal turn, put together a gang and, together with his subordinates, guarded (read “protected”) small traders of “boiled” jeans and popcorn.  At the same time, the process of conquering the territory, according to authority, was quite intelligent.  There was no weapon as such.  There was not even a <span>bit of baseball</span> .  If it happened to get knives - they tried not to kill anyone.  He was imprisoned for robbery and extortion for the first time when he was 18 years old.  In total, the authority sat four times: robbery, extortion, drugs and murder. </p><h2>  Attempt No. 2: "divorce" on the roads </h2><p>  Vitaly Demochka was released in 1991.  Then, to solve the "delicate" problems began to use firearms.  At the same time, one of the groups in Ussuriysk gained a new leader.  It was Vitaliy Demochka who gained authority.  His biography was replenished with two new names - Bandera and Cooper.  So began to call in certain circles the leader of the organized criminal group. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, his gang took firm positions in the criminal world of Ussuriysk.  At that time, cars drove cars for sale through the hometown of authority straight from Japan.  The organized crime group led by Vitaly created an accident that was magnificent in design, thus extorting a lot of money from the stunned drivers-distillers for repairs.  Everything went smoothly until one day a judge appeared at the wheel of a car, who instead of money “gave” Cooper a term. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The series "Special": the realities of the criminal world of Russia </h2><p>  However, at the moment, the public is not interested in the authority (albeit the former) of Vitaliy Demochka, but in the director of the series “Special,” of which Bandera is.  Seven exciting episodes from the life of a criminal group went on the Internet and Primorsky television in 2005.  At the same time, the main roles in the masterpiece were played by Cooper's close associates and the authority itself.  A feature of this tape is the absence of any dummies and special effects.  Bullets, blood, gunfights are just real.  At the same time, the real debtors of Bandera sometimes acted as people affected by the outrage of the gang.  For several episodes with beatings and blood, he wrote off the amount. </p><p>  Filming lasted more than two years, because in addition to acting career, it was necessary to conduct "business".  Representatives of foreign television channels came to shoot the tape.  Real shots and blood - what else is needed to impress foreigners accustomed to props? </p>

    <p>  During the filming, most of the characters in the tape were planted, some were killed.  The quality of the released film left much to be desired and was not accepted on Central Television.  However, the Moscow comrades helped Bandera to record the series on CDs.  They worked hard to rid the market of fake products.  The series about the real events of the “dashing 90s” was swept away from the shelves, like hot cakes. </p><h2>  Writing career </h2><p>  Many are interested in the question of where is Vitaliy Demochka now?  Despite the unenviable and high-profile past, he lives in Moscow and works with a publishing house that has already published several of his books.  It is easy to guess what topic they describe - the real situation in Russia from the 80s to 90s.  Now, not only in the criminal environment, but also in literature they know this name - Vitaly Demochka.  His biography already includes a page with five <span>books</span> published <span>, the first</span> of which has a name similar to the series - "Special." </p>
