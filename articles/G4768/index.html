  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Integration: definition, types, stages</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Politics and economics are two interrelated lines that determine the vital activity of the state.  In the modern era of integration, the formation of <span>international economic</span> and political, monetary and monetary unions is becoming especially acute. </p><p>  "Integration <strong>"</strong> is a definition, more precisely, a concept that is considered in politics, sociology, political science, philosophy.  In each of the sciences, it is defined as unity, rapprochement, fusion of any phenomena, concepts, actions, systems, etc. Traditionally, it is customary to talk about international economic or political integration. </p><p>  Political integration is a series of measures taken to bring several political entities (states, parties) closer together for cooperation, which is equally beneficial to all parties.  In other words, this is the formation of a kind of complex <span>political system</span> at the inter-party or international level.  Such integration requires the creation of formal and informal bodies, institutions in order to jointly resolve and resolve various issues.  A distinctive feature of states that have embarked on the path of political integration is the presence of not only common interests, but also values. </p><p>  If the states negotiating integration not only experience mutual expectations, but also satisfy them in the <span>process of political</span> rapprochement, this process will be fruitful, promising and long-term.  Otherwise, political integration between certain states will exhaust itself. </p><p>  Although ‚Äúintegration <strong>‚Äù</strong> is a definition, that is, a term that emphasizes the voluntary nature of the unification of states on the most favorable conditions for them, it requires careful and thorough preparation.  And the work of such a union requires quality control and management.  Naturally, all this is not a matter of one day, month or year.  The stages of integration include a number of measures and decisions, ranging from the economic level to the political. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Integration stages</strong> : </p><ol><li>  The beginning of any integration at the interstate level is considered trade agreements.  Countries interested in rapprochement provide each other with more favorable conditions for the market of services and goods than other states. </li><li>  The next stage of rapprochement is the <span>free trade</span> zone <span>,</span> which begins to operate between the partner states.  Customs tariffs are canceled, a common trading strategy is being developed.  All this is controlled and coordinated by a specially created body of representatives of the allied countries. </li><li>  The Customs Union is another link in the overall integration chain; its introduction implies a higher level of relations between partner countries.  Considering that the term ‚Äúintegration‚Äù is the definition of union relations, at this stage the process of establishing duty-free trade relations, canceling the national customs tariff of each member state of the union, creating a common system of non-tariff trade with other countries is ongoing.  In addition, the customs union is characterized by the free movement of services and goods within integrating states. </li><li>  After the formation of the customs union, a common market is created for the participating countries.  And this is not only a <span>market for services</span> and goods, but also capital, which moves freely at the interstate level, as well as the free movement of labor.  Thus, the participating countries create a common economic policy and their governing and coordination bodies.  In the EU, the European Council, which includes the <span>heads of state</span> and government, the Council of Ministers of the EU, and the EU Secretariat, addresses these issues. </li><li>  An even higher level of integration is the coordination of economic policies of states at the macro level, at the budget, currency, and money supply levels.  Domestic laws are adapting to these new requirements, and the economic policies of each individual participating country are increasingly being built taking into account the interests and needs of other integrating parties.  This is reflected in the legislative and managerial bodies of the international level. </li><li>  The highest level of integration is considered to be the formation of political unions, or political integration.  Thus, the term ‚Äúintegration‚Äù is a definition that gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa gradual, step-by-step process of rapprochement of states based on mutually beneficial interests. </li></ol>
