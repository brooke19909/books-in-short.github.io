Its difference from the rest of Limassol is silence, a relaxed atmosphere and the presence of a large number of cozy cafeterias.  Due to these advantages, the hotel is popular among couples who come to rest in Greece. </p><p>  This hotel is also good for its close proximity to the beach.  You can reach it in just a minute.  The hotel also has a rather favorable location in terms of transport links.  The airports of Paphos, Larnaca and Nicosia can be reached in approximately the same amount of time. </p><p>  By the way, the hotel is immediately visible.  She is distinguished by a unique style.  This is the first boutique hotel in Cyprus, which Italian architects performed in a traditional island style. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
