Such a creation will be a great gift for any occasion for your second half or loved one.  It will be especially important to make a gift in the shape of a heart on February 14 or a wedding anniversary. </p><h2>  How to make a box - a heart of paper? </h2><p>  If you want to make a box for a gift with your own hands, then this is easily feasible.  The Internet is full of ready-made templates for boxes of various shapes.  You don‚Äôt have to rack your brains on how to make a box out of paper ‚Äî a heart, if you just print a template on a printer, cut it out, transfer it to thick cardboard and glue it on all sides.  Then the box must be decorated to your liking.  If it is made of plain paper, then the decor can be made more vivid and voluminous, but if the cardboard from which the box is made is bright with flowers or other ornaments, then it is worth giving preference to a minimalist design. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtoinstructions.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heart box" class="if uuid-2376156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2376156.jpg"></div><p>  Another way to make a heart out of paper is to draw all the details on a thick cardboard yourself, cut them out and glue them with a glue gun.  This way is more difficult, but the box will look smoother and more perfect.  All parts are best made from cardboard.  In order for it to bend in the shape of a heart, on one of its sides it is necessary to make notches from edge to edge vertically at a distance of about a centimeter from each other.  To keep the form, it is better to fix it inside and out with paper tape.  Next, you need to paste over the box with wrapping paper and add decorative elements.  Artificial flowers, beads, buttons, ribbons will look great on the lid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Origami Heart </h2><p>  Origami - the technique of folding a square sheet of paper into figures of various shapes without the use of glue and scissors.

In their place will be the fold lines. </li><li>  It is necessary to bend the corners of the triangle with sharp edges to the fold line, to its very beginning.  It should turn out triangular "ears". </li><li>  Under the so-called ears, corners have formed that need to be raised, bent and hidden under the upper triangles. </li><li>  After these simple manipulations, a pentagon with sharp corners should turn out.  So that these corners do not spoil the soft outlines of the heart, they need to be pressed a little with your fingers. </li><li>  It is necessary to turn the craft over and inflate it through the hole obtained from below. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper origami heart" class="if uuid-2377740" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2377740.jpg"></div><p>  With such voluminous hearts, if they are small, you can fill a box with a gift for Valentine's Day, and by hanging a thread to them, - decorate the room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Paper heart panel made of butterflies </h2><p>  A panel in the shape of a heart will look very interesting.
