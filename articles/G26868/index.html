    <p>  The word has rather old roots and came from the old Russian "estate", that is, a land allotment issued for service.  At first, it was not inherited, it only began in the 17th century.  It was then that a special layer of society stood out.  Thus, the landowner is a nobleman who owns the land, owns it, and also has an estate.  This social stratum of society was quite large and encompassed completely different people, from small proprietors in the provinces to wealthy nobles in large cities, especially in the capital. </p><h2>  Gen. nobleman in the 18-19 centuries </h2><p>  In the specified time period, the landowner is a person who belonged to the military estate, the nobles.  They lived both in provincial cities and in the capital.  From time immemorial, military people, even after the permission of Peter 3 not to serve in the army, continued to write their sons, still cradling, in the guard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The estates and estates of the small and medium nobility were mostly built of wood, much less often of stone.  Life was very simple.  Life went on peacefully and rather sadly, with the exception of rare trips to neighbors and a few recreational activities. </p><p>  Things were completely different in the capital, where wealthy nobles lived.  The Catherine landowner is a wealthy man, ambitious.  These were people, as a rule, who held high posts, spent time at balls and carried away with palace intrigues.  The huge stone mansions that once belonged to them still stand today. </p>

    <h2>  Wild landowner </h2><p>  This phrase does not mean any particular estate, it is just an expression that to some extent became a household word after the publication of the fairy tale of the same name M.E.  Saltykov-Shchedrin.  It is about a rather stupid and short-sighted landowner. </p><p>  Suffering from idleness and boredom, he suddenly came to the conclusion that there were too many peasants in the world, and began to complain to God about it.  As a result, he decided to get rid of the people annoying him.  According to the plot of the tale "Wild Landowner" as a result, the main character is left alone.  However, the long-awaited silence and lack of ordinary people turns out to be completely different from what he wanted.  There was no normal food in his house, there was no one to take care of him, which gradually led to his complete degradation. </p><p>  The allegorical image of the landowner is a criticism of the whole social structure of that time, sharply reflecting the problem of the exploiter and the exploited. </p>
