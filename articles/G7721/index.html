The device‚Äôs functionality allows you to determine the location of devices used by the traffic police and aimed at fixing the speed at which vehicles move.  The characteristics of the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector make it possible to detect all models of devices used by traffic police, including laser equipment.  The gadget works in the ranges of K, X, Ultra K. </p><h2>  Radar Detector Features </h2><ul><li>  High sensitivity. </li><li>  Intuitive interface and easy operation. </li><li>  Two operating modes. </li><li>  Light and sound alerts. </li><li>  Compact size. </li><li>  Attractive appearance. </li><li>  Reliable and durable mount. </li><li>  Bright contrast display. </li><li>  Convenient volume key. </li></ul><h2>  Features of a modern radar detector </h2><p>  Sho-Me STR 535 is one of the most popular and affordable gadgets sold in Russia and the CIS countries.  It was created on the basis of the previous model - Sho-Me 530, which was no less in demand.  The 535th model differs from its predecessor in a more informative and improved display and a bright digital scale on which all data is displayed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me str 535 instruction" class="if uuid-2251762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2251762.jpg"></div><p>  One of the features that users note in reviews of the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector is a compact ergonomic design that does not limit the view.  The connection of the radar detector is carried out independently by the driver using a cord, thanks to which the gadget can work from the cigarette lighter.  When the battery is discharged, the driver is notified accordingly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Antiradar Functions </h2><p>  The body of the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector is made of high-gloss shiny plastic, which ensures its resistance to deformation and damage.  Buying a radar detector allows you to comply with the high-speed mode through the timely fixation of measuring instruments. </p><p>  Unlike similar devices presented on the market of automotive accessories, Sho-Me STR 35 has qualitatively implemented basic functions.  In reviews of the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector, users note that the gadget is adapted for use in Russia and is allowed at the legislative level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me str 535 reviews" class="if uuid-2251761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2251761.jpg"></div><h2>  High level protection </h2><p>  The Sho-Me radar detector works in all ranges used by fixation cameras and traffic police radars: Ka, K, Ku and X. </p><p>  The main advantage noted in the reviews and features of the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector is its reliability and ease of use.  A wide range of perceived frequencies allows the gadget to fix measuring devices on time and notify the driver, so that he can slow down and avoid fines. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the radar detector can simultaneously perceive such a large number of ranges, not all users like it.  The flip side of the coin is too much interference during operation and false alarms, as a result of which a warning about the presence of radars on the track may be lost. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order to avoid such problems, the instructions for the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector indicate how to disable irrelevant ranges.  Such measures can reduce the number of false positives, which makes the operation of the radar detector more convenient and comfortable. </p><h2>  Stationary Radar Detection </h2><p>  One of the most complex complexes in terms of detecting is Strelka, which is most often installed on tracks and detects speed violations.  For quite some time, such radars were considered non-fixed, since most detectors either noticed them too late or did not notice at all.  Unlike its counterparts, the Sho-Me STR 535 detects Strelka complexes at a great distance and warns the driver in a timely manner. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me str 535 repair" class="if uuid-2251767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2251767.jpg"></div><h2>  Subtle settings </h2><p>  Another advantage of the Sho-Me STR 535 radar detector is ease of use and flexible settings.  The gadget works in two modes - "City" and "Track".  The ability to switch modes allows you to avoid a large number of false positives in the city, caused by various electronic devices. </p><p>  Each signal received in the "City" mode passes through a verification system that cuts off most of the false positives, so that the driver is not distracted from the busy traffic of the village for frequent alerts.  The anti-radar only works if there are really fixing devices nearby, and not any other electronics. </p><h2>  Radar screen </h2><p>  The Sho-Me STR 535 is equipped with an LED display, which allowed the manufacturer to set an affordable cost on products.  All information is displayed on the screen in symbolic form: the system is carefully verified and understandable, so that the driver can quickly receive data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="club.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me str 535 specifications" class="if uuid-2251764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2251764.jpg"></div><h2>  Volume and Screen Settings </h2><p>  <span>Alert volume level is</span> regulated by a separate key.  The display brightness is set in the same way: in the daytime it can be increased, so that the indication is easily distinguishable in sunlight, at night it can be reduced so that the glow does not distract from the road and does not irritate the eye. </p><p>  The settings of the radar detector are simple and intuitive, which allows even a novice to understand them without the experience of operating such devices. </p><p>  All changes made to the settings are saved in the radar memory.  In the case of turning off the device or turning off the power, the user does not have to re-enter all the settings, which many budget counterparts of the Sho-Me STR 535 often sin. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><ol><li>  Maintaining operability in a wide temperature range - from -20 ¬∞ C to +70 ¬∞ C.  Given the harsh Russian climate, this characteristic is important: a radar detector will not let the user down in the summer heat or in the winter cold. </li><li>  Laser detectors have a wide viewing range - 360 degrees, respectively, Sho-Me STR 535 will fix all measuring instruments, regardless of their location - on the sides, front or rear. </li><li>  The compact dimensions of the radar detector are another of its advantages: the size of the gadget is 33 x 71 x 112 millimeters and weighs 128 grams.  Due to this, the device does not interfere and does not fall into the field of view, even if it is attached to the windshield using the suction cup included in the kit. </li><li>  Affordable cost.  The high quality of the radar detector is contrary to the affordable price: you can buy a gadget on average for 4 thousand rubles.  Depending on the store and the region, the cost of the radar detector can vary from 3890 to 5250 rubles. </li></ol><h2>  Benefits </h2><div class="photo" data-original="club.dns-shop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me str 535" class="if uuid-2251769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2251769.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Good detection range. </li><li>  Two operating modes. </li><li>  Detection of modern stationary and mobile radar systems. </li><li>  The ability to repair the radar detector Sho-Me STR 535. </li></ul><h2>  Disadvantages of Radar Detector </h2><p>  There are practically none.  The only significant feature often noted by users is a small backlash of the plate with suction cups in connection with the device body. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="radar detector sho me str 535 specifications reviews" class="if uuid-2251768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2251768.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Sho-Me STR 535 is a stably working radar detector without flaws and operational failures.  It quickly and accurately detects radars on the track, in most cases it leaves enough time for the driver‚Äôs reaction and speed reduction to the maximum permissible.  The detection range on highways and highways is increasing, and the number of false alarms in the city limits is reduced due to the presence of two operating modes - ‚ÄúTrack‚Äù and ‚ÄúCity‚Äù.  The device does a good job of basic functions and protects the family budget from speeding tickets.  It features a pleasant build quality and an affordable price that sets it apart from similar automotive gadgets. </p>
