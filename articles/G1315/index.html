However, at birth this man bore a completely different name.  The biography of Osip Mikhailovich Deribas, his activities and role in the history of Russia will be described in this essay. </p><h2>  Birth and youth </h2><p>  Osip Mikhailovich Deribas, whose photo is placed in the article, is known in Russia under this name.  However, at birth, his name was different - Jose de Ribas.  He belonged to a noble Catalan family.  His father, Miguel de Ribas, was a marshal in the Kingdom of Naples, and his mother came from a noble Irish family. </p><p>  The exact date of birth of Osip Mikhailovich Deribas has not been established.  Scientists talk about the period between 1749 and 1754.  Some researchers claim that he was born on June 6, 1749.  According to the latest version, based on the documents of the de Ribas family, one group of scientists says that Osip Mikhailovich was born on September 13 in 1751.  It should be noted that today there is no single date that could be considered Deribas's birthday. </p><p>  Osip (Jose) received an excellent education, spoke six languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Latin).  In his youth, he was enrolled by his father in the Neapolitan Guard.  He entered the Samnite Infantry Regiment and received the rank of second lieutenant. </p><h2>  The beginning of service in Russia </h2><p>  In 1769, Osip Mikhailovich Deribas met Count A. Orlov, who commanded the Archipelago expedition of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea.  Count Orlov, who was involved in resolving issues of manning and supplying Russian crews in Livorno, suggested Deribas to enter the service of the Russian Empire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="real-vin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of Deribas" class="if uuid-3152867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3152867.jpg"></div><p>  The latter gave his consent and became a naval volunteer.  It is assumed that it was during this period that Osip added several years to his age, which is why there is currently a heated debate about the date of his birth.  It should be noted that only a year later he participated in the famous Chesme battle in the Mediterranean Sea.  Deribas was a member of the team at one of the firewalls with which the Turkish fleet was burned. </p><h2>  Career development </h2><p>  After a glorious victory, Count Orlov gave Osip various instructions that favored the establishment of relations with the Kingdom of Naples.  In 1771 he received the rank of major and in the same year he first visited St. Petersburg on behalf of Count Alexei Orlov. </p><div class="photo" data-original="odessa-memory.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to O.M. Deribas" class="if uuid-3152863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3152863.jpg"></div><p>  After some time, he returned to Livorno, however, already with an assignment for the count himself from the Russian Empress Catherine the Great.  She ordered Count Orlov to return from Leipzig the ten-year-old A. Bobrinsky - her illegitimate son.  The Count, in turn, entrusted this matter to Osip Mikhailovich Deribas. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He brought the boy first to Livorno, and in 1774 brought him to St. Petersburg.  Over this period of time, Deribas made friends with A. Bobrinsky and further maintained good relations with him.  According to the researchers, this fact clearly played a major role in the career of Osip Mikhailovich. </p><h2>  The foundation of Odessa </h2><p>  After participating in the Russian-Turkish war, from 1787 to 1792, Deribas was sent to guard the new border with the Turks, which was passing along the Dniester River.  It was decided to build the Dniester defense line.  For the construction of the Hadzhibey fortress, the future defensive outpost, a place was chosen that had previously been won from the Turks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tourleader.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The city of Odessa, founded by Deribas" class="if uuid-3152888" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3152888.jpg"></div><p>  The fortress was built, the port was gradually erected and equipped for both warships and merchant ships.  In 1792, Deribas received the rank of vice admiral, and was also appointed head of the new city.  In 1795, the equipped fortress and the area around it were renamed Odessa.  So Osip Mikhailovich Deribas and became the founder of the famous city.  Currently, the main city street is named after him.  In 1793, Deribas was appointed commander of the Black Sea Fleet. </p><h2>  A family </h2><p>  Osip Mikhailovich Deribas had three brothers and two sisters.  The brothers, like himself, moved to Russia and devoted their lives to serving it.  The sisters remained in Naples and lived there until the end of their days. </p><p>  One of the brothers of Deribas - Emmanuel, fought with him in the Turkish campaign in 1788-1791.  During the capture of the fortress of Ishmael, he died from numerous wounds.  Felix settled in Odessa after its foundation, giving the city a large plot of land in which a large garden was built, which has been preserved to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="runivers.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capture of the fortress &quot;Ochakov&quot;" class="if uuid-3152875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3152875.jpg"></div><p>  The personal life of Osip Mikhailovich Deribas has developed successfully.  He married A.I. Sokolova, daughter of I.I. Betsky, secretary of Catherine II.  Two daughters were born in their marriage - Sofia and Catherine.  The latter married I.S. Gorgoli - Privy Councilor and Oberpolicemeister of St. Petersburg.  The godmother was Empress Catherine the Great. </p><p>  The daughter of Osip Mikhailovich - Sofia, married Prince M. M. Dolgorukov.  An interesting fact is that the great-granddaughter of Deribas, E. Dolgorukov, entered into an organic marriage with Emperor Alexander II.  It is also known that Osip Mikhailovich had an illegitimate son - I.I. Sabir, who rose to the rank of major general. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Osip Mikhailovich Deribas died at the beginning of December 1800, at the age of 51 years (according to another version - at 46 years old).  His death was a complete surprise for family and loved ones.  The year before she received the rank of admiral, and in 1797 he was removed from the post of commander of the Black Sea Fleet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ruspekh.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tomb of Deribas" class="if uuid-3152892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3152892.jpg"></div><p>  Such career changes were commonplace after Paul I ascended the throne. All the former favorites of Catherine the Great lost their posts.  Before his death, Deribas was engaged in acquiring supplies for the fleet, and he was very successful in saving significant sums for the treasury, making purchases directly from suppliers, and not from resellers.  He also worked in the forest department, responsible for logging for the needs of the navy. </p><p>  The name of Osip Mikhailovich Deribas entered the history of Russia not only as the name of the founder of the beautiful city of Odessa, but also as a wonderful naval officer.  He won numerous victories in naval battles, with his participation several Turkish fortresses were captured, for example, Ochakov and Ishmael, and he also served faithfully in Russia. </p><p>  Grateful descendants in Odessa in 2004 - at the place where the street dedicated to Osip Mikhailovich Deribas begins, opened a monument to him, which is currently one of the visiting cards of the city and its popular attraction. </p>
