Such double hybrids have become quite common in the modern market.  However, there are more advanced options.  In addition to navigators and DVRs, they also include radar detectors.  But such a combination of devices is still quite rare.  The fact is that the task of manufacturers in this case is very complicated. </p>

    <p>  Indeed, it is very difficult for leading companies to produce such a device of compact size and optimal price.  That is why triple models are produced by only a few companies and have a limited lineup.  In this regard, choosing the best radar detector with GPS and a DVR is not an easy task. </p><h2>  Hybrid selection </h2><p>  What is he, the best GPS radar detector and DVR?  It is difficult to choose a suitable model due to the fact that: </p><ul><li>  it is necessary to focus on the characteristics of all built-in devices at once, some of which may be close to ideal, while others, on the contrary, differ sharply from it; </li><li>  hybrid gadgets combine many functions due to the loss of quality of work of individual devices. </li></ul><p>  Given these problems, it is worthwhile to understand that the best radar detector with GPS and a DVR cannot be ideal in all respects.  The most picky drivers are advised to buy three devices separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Key selection criteria </h2><p>  By what parameters should you choose the best radar detector with GPS and a DVR?  You will need to pay attention to the <span>navigation systems of</span> devices.  Among them, there are those that are by far the best.  Their list includes such systems as Navitel and Autosputnik, TomTom and Garmin, PocketGPS Pro and IGO, as well as Navteo. </p><p>  A good radar detector with a DVR and GPS should have enough RAM.  It should be chosen at the level of 64 MB.  But this volume can be large.  With an increase in the level of RAM, the gadget is approaching the ideal. </p>

    <p>  Also, a good <span>radar detector with a DVR</span> and GPS will record normally if it has a two- or three-megapixel camera.  However, hybrid devices, as a rule, are equipped with simpler cameras - single-pixel ones, with which you can conduct a general recording of the terrain.  As for the various details, they will not be visible on the video of your device due to its low resolution. </p><p>  <span>The best radar detector</span> with GPS and a DVR should have a display, the optimal value of which is 5 inches.  Only in this case, the device will give the opportunity to view the video without affecting the view of the road.  Moreover, a higher resolution display will bring the gadget closer to ideal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's move on to the characteristics of the navigator.  For this device, an important role is played by the time of its hot, as well as warm and cold start.  The first of them is carried out at startup 2-3 seconds after turning off the device.  A warm start time means that the device can start after a few minutes.  And the third indicator indicates the possibility of the gadget working after a long shutdown (30 minutes or more).  The best radar detector with GPS and a DVR, these gaps are minimal. </p><p>  There is another characteristic by which drivers can select a three-component device.  These are the frequency ranges over which the radar detector operates.  A quality 3 in 1 gadget perceives them in a wide range.  However, it is worth remembering that according to this characteristic, even the best radar detector with GPS and a DVR will be inferior to a specialized device. </p><p>  Despite its small distribution in the market, hybrid gadgets are included in a certain popularity rating.  Each item in this list includes a device that has one or more outstanding capabilities that differ from other analogues.  Such a rating will help the driver to navigate when choosing a model. </p><h2>  TeXet TN-833 RDVR HD </h2><p>  This model is the best GPS radar detector, as it has optimally large display sizes.  Thanks to the impressive screen, the driver can monitor the navigator without any eye strain, and also watch the video on the device itself.  This best GPS radar detector has an affordable price (around $ 100).  When buying, it will cost much cheaper than purchasing each of the three components separately.  Attractive for motorists is the presence in the device of two operating systems (CityGid and Navitel).  The person who is driving has the opportunity to choose the most convenient for him to use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  However, despite the fact that this model is the best GPS radar detector, it also has some disadvantages.  These include weak mounting and low quality shooting.  However, according to customer reviews, the TeXet TN-833 RDVR HD model has an excellent quality-price ratio. </p><h2>  Subini GR4 </h2><p>  What is the best radar detector on the market today for such devices?  Another worthy model is the <span>Subini GR4,</span> equipped with a good-quality LCD.  It is distinguished from other similar devices by high frost resistance.  Without loss of quality, it is able to withstand temperatures up to minus forty degrees. </p>

    <p>  <span>The best radar detector</span> is configured against Strelka (the system used by the traffic police).  In addition, he is able to detect the Sokol and Vizir, Iskra and Arena, Radis and Binar radars.  Moreover, in the considered model of the gadget there is the possibility of selective inclusion of various ranges.  Drivers are happy with the device.  This is confirmed by their numerous reviews.  However, this model has some problems with updating the navigation programs in its memory. </p><h2>  Arena PRO-8000 </h2><p>  This model is mounted on a rear view mirror, acting as a navigator, radar detector and DVR.  The gadget is equipped with two cameras that simultaneously shoot in different directions (front and rear of the car). </p>

    <p>  For this function, such a video recorder, radar detector is the best.  In addition, the installation of the device allows for night shooting at an extreme distance of 5 kilometers.  User reviews of this gadget indicate its compactness, but at the same time indicate the mediocre quality of the records made. </p><h2>  Arena PRO-8500 </h2><p>  This model, like all previous hybrid devices, allows you to place three devices in the car at once, without cluttering the windshield.  However, the Arena PRO-8500 is not mounted on a mirror.  She herself plays his role, serving in one person as a radar detector, navigator and DVR, shooting simultaneously on two cameras. </p><p>  Unlike its counterparts, the model has a wonderful function for triggering voice prompts only at a high speed exceeding the set value.  For example, this setting can only work if the car moves no faster than sixty kilometers per hour.  As noted in the reviews, the disadvantage of this gadget is the poor quality of the recording and the lack of detailed instructions for the device. </p><h2>  Subini GR4 STR </h2><p>  Little information has been gathered about this model.  However, its main characteristics coincide with those of the Subini GR4.  This is a good radar detector.  User reviews also suggest that, unlike the model already considered, the Subini GR4 STR is configured for a larger frequency catch range.  In addition, its recorder has improved shooting quality. </p><h2>  TeXet-8 HD RDVR </h2><p>  This model is distinguished by a strong case, low weight and small dimensions.  It is also the best radar detector with a video recorder, which is capable of supporting sound alerts and displaying the speed meters it detects in a separate window.  At the same time, the navigation device of this device gives a loading plan with a mark of the radars located on the ground. </p>

    <p>  This function allows you not to use voice alerts about upcoming traffic police posts once again.  The feedback of users who installed this model in their car confirms the high quality of the DVR, and at the same time they speak negatively about the fragile and unreliable fastening of the device and its short cord. </p><h2>  Congueror GR-H8 + </h2><p>  This model is also popular as a DVR, radar detector.  The best device is equipped with a camera equipped with a G-sensor.  This device automatically activates emergency recording in case of sudden movements near the car, impacts on its body, as well as during braking and acceleration of movement. </p><p>  In the navigator of this model there is a loading of all maps not only of Russia, but also of the countries of the former CIS.  And here are the instructions of all road speed cameras.  As for the detector, it has the ability to selectively operate in different frequency ranges, as well as the ability to point to the Strelka system, which is elusive for most radar detectors.  The DVR of the model in question is shooting good quality, including in the dark.  According to user reviews, the only drawback of this gadget is the manufacturer‚Äôs ill-conceived mounting system, which quickly falls off and does not protect the device during shaking. </p><h2>  Eplutus GR-706 </h2><p>  From other devices, this model compares favorably with the built-in battery, which is not found in many hybrids of this type.  In addition, the device is equipped with the function of an FM modulator, which allows you to catch waves without any unnecessary noise.  Users appreciate the quality of the camera's performance.  She records so cleanly that car numbers can be seen even up to 15 meters away.  For 3 in 1 devices, such a range is a rarity.  However, it should be borne in mind that sellers often install unlicensed software on the Epllutus GR-706 model, which is subsequently detected when the Navitel system is updated.  That is why, when purchasing this gadget, buyers should be especially careful. </p><h2>  xDevice 3 in 1 </h2><p>  It is also one of the few models to have a built-in battery.  The display also shows a charging indicator.  This device makes it possible to switch the gadget on time from power from the battery to power from the vehicle‚Äôs power supply. </p><p>  This model on the market can be found infrequently.  Its low popularity is due to the uncompetitive ratio of quality, price and having a range of capabilities. </p><h2>  Arena PRO-7500 </h2><p>  A characteristic feature of this model is the ability to turn off voice alerts while driving at a speed below the limit set by the driver himself. </p><p>  The Arena PRO-7500 navigator has built-in maps of the entire territory of Russia, as well as most of the countries of the former CIS.  The negative sides of the gadget that users note are low frost resistance (up to minus twenty degrees), as well as a small screen resolution.  At the same time, drivers praised the convenience of fastening the device using a suction cup. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Anyone who decides to purchase a convenient and practical hybrid should keep in mind that the market for these gadgets is not yet developed.  In this regard, before buying, it is important to carefully consider the model you like and evaluate all its advantages and the existing negative characteristics. </p><p>  It will be necessary to study the existing line of models on the official websites of the manufacturers of these devices.  This will not succumb to the tricks of scammers.  For example, the Arena PRO 9000 model advertised by some sellers is nothing more than a myth, through which money is drawn from car enthusiasts who prefer new products.  Under the guise of a supposedly advanced gadget, they are selling a fake, the real value of which is much lower than the requested amount.  Going to the official website of the company, you can see that such a model has not yet been released. </p>

    <p>  In general, according to motorists, combined devices in terms of quality characteristics are significantly inferior to individual DVRs, radars and navigators.  However, buyers have already managed to appreciate the compactness of the device, and do not mind saving on the price.  With a preliminary study of the positive and negative sides of each of the models and the conscious choice of a gadget, it will become an indispensable tool for every car enthusiast and a very worthy purchase. </p>
