This project has already been implemented for several years jointly with the Payment Center Center.  We‚Äôll tell you about the conditions, as well as about tariffs, find out all the nuances with the features of the card, its advantages and disadvantages.  Among other things, we‚Äôll figure out whether it is worth making Beeline plastic.  Reviews about the map will be presented at the end of the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bankstoday.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beeline banking card reviews and conditions" class="if uuid-3211002" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211002.jpg"></div><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  The type of this card is either MasterCard Standart or World, there is 3D Secure support for making secure purchases on the Internet.  Issue along with reissue and annual maintenance is free.  SMS informing does not require a cash deposit either.  The interest on the plastic account balance is from three to seven monthly.  Reviews on Beeline Mastercard card are mostly positive. </p><p>  It is worth mentioning the withdrawal of own funds.  If the transaction amount exceeds five thousand rubles, the action takes place free of charge, and when it is less, one hundred forty-nine rubles is taken for the operation.  No commission can be withdrawn per month no more than fifty thousand rubles, and if this limit is exceeded, then this will be two percent of the amount debited.  Bonus accrual implies one percent of all purchases that the customer receives in any case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Transfers between Beeline cards are free of charge.  As part of interbank transfers, up to one hundred thousand per month can be transferred without commission, more than this amount - 0.5% (minimum twenty, maximum one thousand rubles).  According to reviews, the Beeline credit card is very convenient to use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shorelinecards.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline credit card reviews" class="if uuid-3210998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210998.jpg"></div><h2>  pros </h2><p>  Among the advantages of the card are the following: </p><ul><li>  Availability of free service. </li><li>  Providing customers with the opportunity to receive cashback in their favorite places (the category is set in your account and application) up to five percent. </li><li>  One percent cashback on any purchase. </li><li>  Performing free reporting of operations via SMS. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  In order for a Beeline debit card to be profitable, a number of certain requirements must be observed.  Do I need to open it?  Perhaps, it is only active customers of the provider who need to draw it up, then it will be possible to use the operator‚Äôs services almost for no reason, at the expense of return cashbacks. </p><p>  Is it wise to open it to the rest?  Free service along with SMS-informing make this product quite attractive.  It is better to familiarize yourself with reviews on Beeline debit cards and credit cards in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are more profitable similar products on the market with similar options.  Beeline plastic has relatively low interest on the balance, along with a limited cashback and conditionally uncommissioned cash withdrawals.  It is not advisable to open it for these options.  The rest is completely branded plastic, especially interesting for regular Beeline customers.  Credit card reviews are plentiful. </p><h2>  bonus program </h2><p>  Now let's talk in detail about the most interesting, namely the Beeline bonus program.  As noted above, for each purchase the client receives points, which can be easily cashed out in the future, turning them into discounts for themselves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dfi.wa.gov" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline card banking reviews" class="if uuid-3210995" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210995.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I accumulate bonuses on a Beeline card? </h2><p>  Keep in mind the following: </p><ul><li>  Clients always receive one percent on condition that they pay with this card (including on the Internet). </li><li>  Increased bonus point in your favorite category.  Each owner of plastic in his personal account is independently able to choose no more than three categories, where he wants to receive as much as five percent of ‚Äúcashback‚Äù.  The following options are currently available for selection: restaurants along with cosmetics and perfumes, sporting goods, pets, Duty Free, public transport and parking, beauty salons, entertainment and taxis.  As you can see, the list is extensive and at the same time interesting.  Everyone can choose a frequently used category for themselves and quickly earn bonuses for their purchases. </li><li>  Special points.  In addition to standard and advanced, you can also get special bonuses from partners plastic.  Among them are ‚ÄúPharmacy.RU‚Äù with shops ‚ÄúCrossroads‚Äù and many others. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="tech2.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline debit card reviews" class="if uuid-3211000" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211000.jpg"></div><h2>  How can I spend bonus points? </h2><p>  If a customer has accumulated bonuses for their purchases, then it's time to start spending them.  There are several ways to accomplish this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  As part of the personal account of the card, accumulated bonuses can be withdrawn to mobile communications. </li><li>  If a person often makes purchases in the salons of this operator, then he can turn bonus points into a discount as part of the purchase of a phone or accessory.  While paying for services, bonuses cannot be used. </li><li>  Shopping from partners.  Bonus points can also be paid from card partners in Litres online stores, the KARI shoe chain, and so on. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline card user reviews" class="if uuid-3210996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210996.jpg"></div><h2>  Beeline card bonus program and its features </h2><p>  The following nuances can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  It will be possible to redeem points for mobile communications in the amount of not more than ninety percent of the average monthly expense for mobile communications over the past six months.  Suppose a person spends three hundred rubles a month, then in a month he can cash out no more than two hundred and seventy bonuses. </li><li>  Also, as part of the payment, partners and in the salons have a similar restriction.  You can pay with points only ninety percent of the amount of the check. </li><li>  During the transfer of funds from the card for utilities, communications, bonus points are not awarded.  Reviews of Beeline payment cards confirm this. </li></ul><h2>  Credit card </h2><p>  Any Beeline payment instrument can become a credit card with a grace period of up to fifty five days.  To connect the limit for plastic, you must leave a request on the website or contact one of the offices.  Previously, credit limits could be obtained from two partner organizations, namely, Alfa-Bank and Tinkoff.  And at present, only Tinkoff Bank has remained available. </p><h2>  Credit limits from Tinkoff Bank </h2><p>  The conditions are as follows: </p><ul><li>  Age must be between eighteen and seventy years. </li><li>  The limit amount is up to three hundred thousand rubles, and the commission for its execution is five hundred. </li><li>  The grace period is usually up to fifty-five days. </li><li>  The interest rate is set individually from twenty percent. </li><li>  The commission for withdrawing funds is five percent plus five hundred rubles. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.nsb.lk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beeline mastercard reviews" class="if uuid-3210997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3210997.jpg"></div><p>  As part of drawing up a limit on a Beeline card from Tinkoff Bank, it must be borne in mind that, having issued it, a person will not be able to receive plastic from this financial institution in the future, since there is a rule in it: one loan product for each client. </p><p>  In this regard, you need to think about whether you need a Beeline credit card, or whether it would be better to issue ordinary plastic at Tinkoff.  Most, according to reviews of Beeline cards with a credit limit, prefer to use the second option, according to which you can get a larger limit and bonus points will be more interesting. </p><h2>  Interest on the remainder or Beeline plastic piggy bank </h2><p>  The payment tool, which many customers call Beeline bank card, can be used not only as a credit plastic for payments, but also as an opportunity to store cash.  The fact is that it is possible to connect a service called ‚ÄúInterest on the balance‚Äù, which in turn allows you to receive benefits for storing your own money.  This service is paid and costs ninety-nine rubles a month.  There are conditions, compliance with which allows you to use absolutely free service PNO: </p><ul><li>  In the first two months immediately after issuing the card. </li><li>  On the map lies a constantly minimum balance of at least three thousand rubles. </li><li>  Within one month, the client replenishes the card for the same amount. </li><li>  Clients spend from three thousand rubles for one whole month. </li></ul><p>  By the way, the interest rate credited to the balance depends on the amount that the client stores on the card: </p><ul><li>  From fifteen rubles to one hundred thousand - three percent per annum. </li><li>  From one hundred to three hundred - four per year. </li><li>  From three hundred thousand to one million - six and a half percent per annum. </li><li>  Over a million rubles - seven. </li></ul><p>  In the event that the amount stored on plastic is less than fifteen thousand rubles, then interest is almost not charged (since 0.01% per year). </p><h2>  Beeline personalized payment card </h2><p>  Any holder of payment plastic will be able to order a Beeline registered card for themselves, equipped with contactless payment technology and the presence of a chip.  Servicing is also free.  The only thing that will have to be paid for is the delivery by Russian Post, which usually costs two hundred rubles. </p><h2>  Competitor Analogs </h2><p>  The competitors of Beeline cards today are: </p><ul><li>  "Benefit" from "Home Credit".  On it you can make a profit on your own funds, withdraw cash at any ATM and a bonus point for purchases of up to fifteen percent.  You can issue it by the action and get the first twelve months of free service. </li><li>  Tinkoff plastic is also one of the best and worthy competitors of Beeline cards.  On the Tinkoff payment instrument, you can store large sums of money, as well as transfer salaries.  Here you can choose the category of increased cashbacks. </li><li>  Card from "Rocketbank".  It allows you to store profitable cash, as well as earn cashbacks for purchases in some stores.  Every month you can choose three favorite stores where you can get cashback up to ten percent.  And this despite the fact that plastic is free.  It is recommended by many for clearance, and it is delivered by a courier. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="qcostarica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="credit card beeline card reviews" class="if uuid-3211001" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3211001.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews about Beeline cards </h2><p>  Thus, having become acquainted with all the existing conditions and features of plastic, absolutely everyone can determine for themselves how much it is profitable and useful.  In the reviews about the Beeline card, some people write that they are satisfied with this payment tool, while he does not like others. </p><p>  It is worth noting that earlier, when the card just appeared, it was, one might say, a ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù for lovers of collecting cashbacks and other goodies, but every year, unfortunately, it becomes less interesting.  User reviews on the Beeline card confirm this. </p><p>  This, as a rule, is facilitated by the fact that annually various restrictions with limits are set for the plastic under consideration, for people they come up with uncomfortable conditions in the context of obtaining a percentage or cashback.  And all this is done in the conditions of fierce competition, when other banks try to make their products as simple and convenient as possible. </p><p>  Many people in their reviews of the Beeline bank card note that they issued this payment instrument five years ago, and now they simply have it on the shelf.  For most customers, it is not interesting, since they prefer to use more convenient and serious competitor counterparts. </p><p>  Thus, it is rare when a Beeline Mastercard is recommended to be issued in reviews.  But, if a person does not have the opportunity to order Tinkoff plastic, then you can try this option.  In any case, it will be more profitable at present than, for example, Sberbank or VTB cards. </p><p>  We reviewed the Beeline reviews and bank card terms. </p>
