Having been here once, I want to come here constantly.  This is not surprising, because in Abkhazia the unique virgin nature of the subtropics, where against the backdrop of powerful green mountains with white snowy peaks and crystal clear water in mountain streams and turquoise lakes, there are <span>pensions, hotels</span> and rest houses.  The hotel "Raida 3 *" is no exception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Raida Abkhazia" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1294696.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Abkhazia annually receives thousands of tourists from all over the world, but most of them are our compatriots who like not only the relatively low prices and proximity to the city of Sochi.  This is another opportunity to visit several resorts at once. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  And since analysts this year predict a large influx of tourists on the Black Sea coast, tourists should decide on a place to stay in advance.  A good option would be the Raida Hotel.  Abkhazia, prices at which are reasonably acceptable for ordinary Russians, thirty years ago was not so affordable.  Not everyone could afford to buy a ticket.  Today in the season, the cost of living per person, depending on the category of room, starts from three and a half thousand rubles per person.  The amount also includes meals.  The most expensive apartments in August will cost about nine thousand for each. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, today the region, although it has lost its former glory, as before, attracts vacationers who buy tours to hotels or come on their own.  Many combine swimming at sea with sightseeing of local attractions, of which there are many.  You can stay both in the private sector, in guest houses, and in numerous hotels and pensions, for example, in the Raida Hotel.  Abkhazia is a place where everyone will find rest to their taste and affluence.  In addition, you can come here all year round. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Raida Abkhazia" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35697/1295869.jpg" width="600"></div>
