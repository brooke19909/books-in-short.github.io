Not everyone knows that a similar attraction exists in Russia.  The Russian "Big Ben" is located in Krasnoyarsk.  The watch tower got its popular name for its noticeable resemblance to the original building.  What is the history of Krasnoyarsk “Big Ben”, and in what year was it built? </p><h2>  Dolgostroy, which has become the main city attraction </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.idrenome.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clock tower" class="if uuid-2940726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2940726.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of a large clock tower in Krasnoyarsk was started back in the 70s of the last century.  For several reasons, the work was stopped and for several decades, residents and guests of the city “admired” the frozen construction site instead of a new attraction.  The Big Ben existing in Krasnoyarsk was completed and solemnly opened only in 2001.  The chief architect of the project Areg Demirkhanov personally emphasizes the similarity of his creation with the famous tower in London.  The building blends in perfectly with the surrounding urban environment and today is a recognized symbol of the city.  I didn’t even have to come up with a name, the popular “Big Ben” really took root.  Krasnoyarsk today is popular with tourists from other countries, many of them seek to personally see and photograph this particular attraction. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Krasnoyarsk "Big Ben" in figures and facts </h2><div class="photo" data-original="loveopium.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Big Ben in Krasnoyarsk" class="if uuid-2940733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2940733.jpg"></div><p>  In the rating of watch <span>towers in Russia, the</span> Krasnoyarsk tourist attraction takes an honorable second place.  Only the Spasskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin is superior to the Russian Big Ben.  The Krasnoyarsk clock tower boasts a dial with a diameter of 6.5 meters.  The weight of the clockwork is 1.5 tons.  Residents and guests of Krasnoyarsk can safely check the time on the main city clock.  You can hear local chimes twice an hour when the minute hand reaches 30 minutes and 1 hour.  At the end of 2017, Krasnoyarsk residents first heard the new Big Ben tune.  In honor of the New Year holidays (from December 20, 2017 to January 14, 2018), instead of the usual fight, the clock tower pleased passers-by with a fragment from the ballet The Nutcracker by P. I. Tchaikovsky.  Such musical accompaniment was chosen to create a festive mood among the population and is likely to become a new urban tradition. </p><h2>  How to get to the main hours of Krasnoyarsk? </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.0093712" data-lng="92.87153039999998" data-type="hybrid" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/1/0/7/11107.png"></div><p>  Where is the Russian Big Ben?  Krasnoyarsk, Weinbaum Street, 94 k - the exact address of the tower.  Find this attraction is not difficult, because it is located in the immediate vicinity of the city administration building.  Within walking distance are the local history museum and the opera and ballet theater.  Thanks to this arrangement, it is very convenient for tourists to combine a visit to Big Ben and other interesting places in Krasnoyarsk.  The nearest public transport stop is called the Opera and Ballet Theater. </p><h2>  Reviews on the local Big Bene </h2><div class="photo" data-original="svinoyrsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tower Krasnoyarsk Big Ben" class="if uuid-2940716" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/2940716.jpg"></div><p>  The majestic clock tower fits perfectly into the architectural ensemble of the center of Krasnoyarsk.  This building looks spectacular at any time of the day, with the onset of darkness, the backlight turns on.  The Krasnoyarsk Big Ben Tower is one of the main symbols of the city.  This monumental building is liked by a resident of Krasnoyarsk and is popular with tourists.  Like the original, the Russian Big Ben has only four dials.  Thanks to what you can admire watches, photograph them and check time from any direction.  Today, near the "Big Ben" appoint romantic dates and business meetings.  It is simply impossible to imagine the modern look of the city without this attraction, according to many Krasnoyarsk residents. </p>
