The cultural and economic center, occupying the territory of the lands of Bavaria, is located on the banks of the River Main.  Wurzburg, hosting hundreds of tourists, is known worldwide for the music festivals of Mozart and Bach. </p><h2>  Ancient Spiritual Center </h2><p>  A village with that name existed back in 450, and two hundred years later a small town turned into a city where the spread of Christianity began.  Gradually, W√ºrzburg, the sights of which attract the keen interest of everyone who comes on excursions, turns into a religious and spiritual center without dividing it into Orthodox and Catholics.  And he remained so until the XIX century, when during the reign of Napoleon passed to the possessions of Bavaria. </p><h2>  Lost masterpieces that have been restored </h2><p>  Unfortunately, World War II did not spare the city, turning the architectural sights of W√ºrzburg into ruins.  More than 80 percent of the magnificent buildings were lost forever, but gradually the city rose from the dust, preserving its color and charm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of the best attractions in w√ºrzburg" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1380366.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  That settlement, which appears before the eyes of amazed tourists, was built several centuries.  And the most famous and talented architects took part in this.  Locals pay tribute to Baltazar Neumann, the great German architect who did a lot to make the city one of the most beautiful in Europe. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  City Business Card </h2><p>  Little W√ºrzburg, whose sights are becoming the subject of admiration for all vacationers, is full of architectural monuments - real masterpieces of world art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Wurzburg Germany Attractions" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1380353.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Marienburg Fortress</span> is considered the hallmark of the city, and it is not for nothing that its colorful photographs appear in all guidebooks.  The residence of the archbishop, erected at the beginning of the 13th century, protecting the servant of God from peasant riots, is located on a mountain of the same name.  The fortress, visible from anywhere in the tourist center, fits perfectly into the urban landscape. </p><h2>  Residence palace </h2><p>  It was here that an ancient settlement arose, from which the glorious city of W√ºrzburg (Germany) grew.  The sights of the German tourist center with a population of approximately 140 thousand people are difficult to describe in one article.  But it is impossible not to mention the most beautiful baroque palace.  This is the main work of B. Neumann, who created many architectural masterpieces.  The W√ºrzburg residence is a real monument of world culture, which is put on a par with the magnificent Versailles, and Napoleon considered the palace the most beautiful in Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wurzburg attractions" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1380351.jpg" width="600"></div>

No wonder the majestic monument was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  In the grand palace, which has about 340 halls with interiors that delight visitors, there is a museum for city guests.  Experienced guides will tell the detailed history of the creation of the residence and pay attention to the main points of salvation of the main attractions of W√ºrzburg. </p><h2>  Chapel of the virgin mary </h2><p>  Attracting the attention of every tourist, the white and red building of the chapel of the Virgin Mary delights with unusual beauty.  It is noteworthy that the construction of a religious monument is associated with the tragic events that took place in the XIV century.  An epidemic of plague came to the city, which took thousands of lives, and the authorities accused the Jews of terrible grief.  No one knows for sure whether the Jews committed suicide or were burnt by the townspeople, but the fact remains that the Jewish quarter was demolished and a market appeared in its place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of wurzburg" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1380364.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building that suffered from the bombing was long restored, but the architects managed to convey the style of the 16th century.  This is a truly unique monument with bas-reliefs telling about the immaculate conception of Mary, of which the many-faced W√ºrzburg is proud.  The sights are of interest to the relics of St. Macarius, which are stored in a casket of pure silver, and a statue of Our Lady. </p><h2>  The special atmosphere of the city </h2><p>  When visiting the fertile <span>lands of Bavaria,</span> do not forget about the wonderful city, full of many architectural masterpieces, closely connected with the ancient history of the tourist center.  Charming W√ºrzburg, whose sights have united the heritage of different eras, is waiting for new guests who know for sure that Germany is famous not only for beer and sausages. </p><p>  Historical monuments, reborn from the ashes, like the Phoenix bird, are saturated with a special atmosphere, and it is simply impossible not to feel this aura. </p>
