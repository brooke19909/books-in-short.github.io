    <h2>  "Professor's Corner" </h2><p>  This is the territory of Alushta, as if created specifically for walking, relaxing and creating a good mood, and the best in this regard, even on the scale of the entire southern coast of Crimea.  Visitors here once certainly become regulars, coming here every year - it is impossible not to fall in love with this land.  Back in the eighties of the nineteenth century, mansions and summer residences of famous people began to appear here, and, as a rule, most of them are representatives of science, and this is where the name comes from. </p><p>  There are still magnificent old-timers of the resort, palaces of scientists who, coming on vacation, enjoyed studying the geology, history, fauna and flora of the Crimea.  Here we can mention the professor of geology N. A. Golovkinsky, who stood at the origins of creating such a paradise as the "Professor's Corner", which only the best resorts in Switzerland and Italy can compare with.  Wild cliffs covered with subtropical vegetation at the very blue water of the vast Black Sea cannot but cause delight. </p>

    <h2>  "Work Area" </h2><p>  Alushta after the revolution began to change rapidly, like the whole country.  The spirit of the time dictated new conditions of freedom, equality and fraternity.  In 1923, near the Mount Kastel was built in peak of the "Professor" rest house "Work Area".  Alushta now received vacationers not only from among well-off people, but also from ordinary steelmakers, miners, miners, farmers, teachers from all over the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Both the local and the visitors liked the new name so much that it took root quickly.  Moreover, the whole area adjacent to the holiday home began to be called so.  Gradually, the entire western outskirts of the city began to be called that way.  Truly unforgettable impressions await everyone who has chosen Crimea for holidays.  "Professor's Corner" is the most picturesque part of it.  The seven-kilometer beautifully designed promenade with the <span>Almond Grove water park,</span> with Kastel night club soaring into the sky like a spaceship on take-off (where visitors can enjoy a bowling alley, an excellent dance floor, cafes, bars and European cuisine). </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  The infrastructure of this region is comprehensively developed.  Small beaches stretched along the embankment, the small pebbles of which are considered very useful.  All of them belong to health camps, <span>boarding houses, sanatoriums.</span>  On the right is a long city beach with fine sand.  You can compare the beaches that Crimea offers.  "Professor's Corner" will certainly be in the lead of any rating.  They are all well equipped: a wide assortment of rentals, mandatory cabins and showers.

    <h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  It was in the "Professor's Corner" that methods for treating a whole complex of diseases were developed and involved.  The health resorts of the ‚ÄúWork Corner‚Äù, together with the specialists of Sechenov Research Institute, have proved that the conditions of coastal air give a person more than two grams of sea salts per day, which contain almost the entire arsenal of chemicals used as medications.  Bathed in the ultraviolet of ionized air, which is saturated with volatile plants of seaweed and tropical plants, the guest of Crimea does not just relax.  He is simultaneously treated, restoring his immunity. </p><p>  In addition, a lot of types of treatment are offered by medical centers, which Alushta is so famous for.  Pension "Dubna" in 2016 offered very affordable prices, and most of the sanatoriums of the city too.  That is why in the season Crimea and takes such an incredible number of vacationers.  Housing prices, in principle, can afford everyone.  It all depends on the category chosen and the distance from the beach.  The presence of additional services also slightly increases prices, but they still are not prohibitive, despite the fact that this paradise is comparable to the most expensive resorts on the planet.  In Dubna, for example, food is not included in the price, but still it is much cheaper than lunch on the side. </p>

    <h2>  Wellness </h2><p>  The price of accommodation is far from all hotels and resorts include a health course, physiotherapy exercises and oxygen foam, but all this gives the boarding house "Dubna" 1 *.  Alushta itself is a place of healing, even if nothing but local food and air is taken, all kinds of medical procedures (mineral water, mud, etc.) will be appreciated by any organism with gratitude. </p><p>  Local clinicians and climatotherapists with the involvement of physicists and then architects have created premises in the ‚ÄúWork Corner‚Äù where round-the-clock aerotherapy is carried out.  Aerarias of the latest designs welcome their visitors.  They differ in that they exclude heat rays, the body does not overheat, gets a great chocolate tan.  They rest in the "Professor's Corner" individually and in groups, but the most frequent guests come with the whole family and with children of different ages. </p>
