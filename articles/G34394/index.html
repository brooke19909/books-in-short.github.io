If earlier flowers of silk adorned the hairpin of geishas, ‚Äã‚Äãnow you can see magnificent crafts made of fabric on paintings and caskets, on clothes and pendants on a bag.  Masters create not only flowers, but also wonderful insects, bows and baskets, Easter eggs and even New Year's toys. </p><p>  "Tsumami" from Japanese translates as "pinch."  This characterizes the main way of performing each element by pinching.  For these purposes, use tweezers and candle fire.  Each petal or leaf is made separately, and then they are combined into a flower or other figure.  Instead of the silk traditional for Japan, modern kanzashi tsumami is made from other fabrics.  Most often, satin or crepe ribbons are taken to work, sometimes they use nylon or satin, lurex or organza.  Connect the parts into a single unit either with hot glue, or sew together with threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flores-flowers-diy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="candle flashing" class="if uuid-3113280" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113280.jpg"></div><p>  In the article, we will consider a master class by tsumi kanzashi, we will figure out in detail how to fold and solder pieces of fabric correctly to get a beautiful petal.  Step-by-step descriptions of the work will help you independently repeat the samples shown in the photographs.  The tsumami kanzashi technique is a bit like oriental origami art, but instead of paper, masters use shreds of fabric. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Triple leaf </h2><p>  In order to make such a multi-layer leaf: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to prepare 3 identical pieces of a thin green satin ribbon, a candle, tweezers and a pin for temporary fastening. </li><li>  Fold the blanks in a flat pile and bend the entire bundle of fabric in half. </li><li>  Holding the tweezers, bring the fold line close to the candle and melt the edges of the fabric with fire. </li><li>  The photo below clearly shows how to straighten the ribbons to get an effective leaf. <div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful ribbon leaf" class="if uuid-3113305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113305.jpg"></div></li><li>  Connect the lower ends of each segment together and temporarily fix with a pin. </li><li>  It remains to melt with a candle and this detail of the craft. </li><li>  Put the finished leaf aside.  It will be needed to join a <span>bouquet of flowers.</span> </li></ol><p>  And then we will consider how to make kanzashi a tsumi of petals. </p><h2>  Complex petal of three ribbons </h2><p>  This craft is assembled from two thin ribbons of burgundy and pink and one wider - lilac.  Start manufacturing with a central part.  A short piece of pink ribbon in the center turns into a lilac folded in half.  All 4 ends of the fabric are connected at one point and tweezers are made with tweezers, collecting ribbons in folds.  Temporarily fasten the bundle with a pin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="flores-flowers-diy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make petals" class="if uuid-3113276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113276.jpg"></div><p>  The burgundy ribbon should be longer to wrap the first two loosely.  Fuse it in the center, folding it in half.  Then unfold the fabric so that the tape ‚Äúhugs‚Äù the first part on both sides, and attach the other side to the ends connected with a pin.  Lock all the strips with fire.  The kanzashi tsumami petal is ready! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Light flower of five petals </h2><p>  From the satin ribbon, cut the same five squares.  Further work is carried out alternately on the manufacture of each petal.  A square piece of fabric folds in half diagonally.  It turns out a triangle, the extreme corners of which are also connected to each other.  Turn the workpiece toward you with the long side, and grab the opposite with tweezers and scorch the candle along the entire length.  You get a petal like in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oops-cache.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsumami Kansashi Flower" class="if uuid-3113271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113271.jpg"></div><p>  When all 5 elements are ready, you need to turn the blanks on the other side so that traces of the candle remain on the back of the petal.  It will remain the threads selected in the tone of the fabric to sew all the details together to make a beautiful flower. </p><h2>  Rounded petal </h2><p>  For masters new in the tsumami kanzashi technique, a step-by-step photograph of the work is presented.  Start manufacturing with cutting square billets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a kanzashi flower" class="if uuid-3113313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113313.jpg"></div><p>  Next, you need to fold the segment as shown above in the photo.  Fasten the folded material with a pin or tweezers and scorch the edges of all layers of fabric with a candle.  When 6 petals are made, sew them together with threads. </p><h2>  Christmas angels </h2><p>  Good looking Christmas toys tsumi kanzashi.  Let's look at how an angel is made.  How to add such pointed parts, you already understand.  Collect the crafts together with hot glue.  The function of the head and chest of an angel is performed by beads or pebbles.  The lower hem of the robe is made of a large square.  It must be folded in half and connect all the corners of the part together, gently straightening the fabric.  Secure the mount with fire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kanzashi angel" class="if uuid-3113316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113316.jpg"></div><p>  The upper wings are complemented by silver inner petals.  Through the bead of the head, thread the thread and make a loop so that the figure can be hung on a spruce branch.  Such a Christmas toy looks wonderful on a dark wood background. </p><h2>  Gorgeous snowflake </h2><p>  Such a beautiful craft will decorate any holiday.  Making a beautiful snowflake is easy, especially since you already know how to fold a satin ribbon fabric for each element.  As you can see, a large number of parts will have to be assembled, and of different sizes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kanzashi snowflake" class="if uuid-3113318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113318.jpg"></div><p>  The central part of the craft resembles a flower with six two-tone petals and a spectacular pebble in a frame in the center.  Already around these large details, small snowflake elements will be attached.  The assembly of the crafts takes place with a glue gun.  Rays of snowflakes begin in the holes between the large petals of the central flower and diverge in all directions. </p><p>  Glue the petals in pairs.  The connection point is covered with a strass.  The beam ends with a single blue petal.  You can complement the work by hanging shiny stars on silver thin threads. </p><h2>  Christmas tree on a cone </h2><p>  A beautiful Christmas tree decoration will be the Christmas tree made in this technique of Japanese masters.  You will need a plain satin or crepe ribbon.  We took a white strip in our sample, you can make a green or red tree.  You will also need a cardboard base for gluing small parts in the shape of a cone.  It can be done using PVA glue or fix the ends of the paper with a stapler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="herringbone of kansashi petals" class="if uuid-3113320" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3113320.jpg"></div><p>  They took bright golden, red and purple strips of fabric as a decor, decorating the top and bottom of the Christmas tree with interesting elements. </p><p>  Each petal is made by folding a square piece of fabric twice: diagonally and vertically.  Right triangles are obtained, one leg of which has tissue joints.  With tweezers you need to fix them together and melt the edge with a candle.  The last stage of work will be gluing the surface of the cone in a circle, starting from the lower level.  Bright beads on the "branches" serve as Christmas toys and are attached with a glue gun. </p><p>  You can also meet MK Tsumami Kansashi from the video below. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="00h0iSI0bjk" data-url="https://youtu.be/00h0iSI0bjk" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/0/8/4/15084.jpg"></div><p>  All elements of the technique are fastened by pinching and fusing the edges.  This saves a lot of time spent on making crafts, and keeps the fabric better than any seam.  Try it, please yourself and loved ones with beautiful crafts! </p>
