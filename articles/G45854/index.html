Boathouses by the sea: overview</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The heroine of one of the famous films said a phrase that became popular: in Sochi, everyone had a rest at least once in their life.  And it's true - this southern city is incredibly popular among those who can not imagine a vacation without the sea, sun and fun entertainment.  Those who come to rest in Sochi often have their favorite places in this city.  One such corner is Loo. </p><h2>  Village Features </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the village is not very large, a vacation in Loo is never boring.  The main entertainment facility is AquaLoo.  This is a water park that operates all year round.  But the main pride of the village are beaches with small pebbles mixed with sand - it is pleasant to walk on such a surface.  A wide beach strip is equipped with various water activities, including <span>water skiing,</span> diving, jet skiing. </p>

    <p>  Since the settlement is small, within walking distance are various objects, without which rest in Loo is almost impossible: </p><ol><li>  Lots of canteens. </li><li>  The shops. </li><li>  Cafe. </li><li>  Restaurant establishments. </li><li>  Bars </li></ol><h2>  Choosing a place to live </h2><p>  Going to spend a vacation outside the house, everyone plans ahead where to spend their vacation, and tries to book a hotel room.  But if you plan to relax in Loo, then besides hotels there are many other options for settlement - the private sector provides a lot of different types of housing, ranging from economy rooms to living rooms, equivalent to standard hotel rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another of the options for accommodation in Loo - boathouses by the sea.  So called comfortable, cozy cottages, where you can live both together, and the whole company, spending time in a pleasant, warm, almost homely atmosphere. </p><h2>  Boathouses: features and differences </h2><p>  Earlier in Loo, part of the coast was built up with boat garages intended for storing catamarans, boats, and boats.  But when the number of tourists and vacationers far exceeded the number of places in hotels and private houses of the village, the garages were demolished and boathouses were built in their place. </p>

    <p>  Cool morning sunrises, picturesque burgundy sunsets, fresh air and wonderful views from windows, terraces, balconies are an ideal accommodation option.  That's why among those who want to settle in Loo, the slipways by the sea immediately began to enjoy increased popularity.  It contributes to the popularity of the fact that the main tourist infrastructure is concentrated around the boathouses. </p><p>  Due to the fact that in each of the institutions there are rooms of different capacities and categories, on which the price of accommodation depends, people of any income can live here, who wanted to spend time relaxing at the water's edge.  In addition, almost every cottage has its own beach, playground, summer terrace, pool, water transport, terrace with tables.  Therefore, to diversify the rest, it is not at all necessary to spend time searching for everything you need somewhere outside the institution. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Albatross" </h2><p>  In Loo, boathouses by the sea are in high demand precisely because of the location - not only the beach is very close, but also the necessary infrastructure.
