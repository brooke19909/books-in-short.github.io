    <h2>  All for all </h2><p>  Liberty - insurance for travelers abroad, motorists, as well as programs to protect life, property, and health.  Quite a few options are presented, there are additional conditions that can be included in the program or saved by abandoning them.  The company has reasonable price offers for everything.  For example, the Liberty Insurance Casco insurance program is almost two times cheaper than its competitors.  And insurance for tourists among the organization‚Äôs offers is significantly different from the largest insurers.  This is largely why Liberty Insurance has become so popular and successful, and its reviews are mostly positive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About 61% of transactions are transport insurance programs, of which 14% of customers apply for compulsory motor liability insurance.  Up to 23% of clients need personal insurance programs.  Participation in it is a voluntary initiative.  About 12% of clients need property insurance programs (not including cars).  The addresses of the insurance company and information on tariffs are presented in detail on the organization‚Äôs website. </p><h2>  Milestones </h2><p>  The company first entered the insurance market in 1993.  At that time, Liberty Insurance did not yet exist; the services were initially provided under the name of IC Klass.  Quite large changes in the structure of the organization occurred in 1999 during the merger with Lenstroymaterialy.  After another nine years, all shares were repurchased from this legal entity.  And the organization came under the control of KIT Finance.  Feedback on insurance companies that Liberty managed to visit over the long years of its existence differs dramatically - there are users who are satisfied with the quality of services, but there were also those who claimed that the organization was a bunch of charlatans. </p>

    <p>  Under the management of an investment bank, the company changed its name again - now it has become known as KIT Finance Insurance.  It was then that the reviews about the insurance company began to prevail positive.  Representatives of the board already announced plans to invest in direct insurance.  The situation did not develop in the best way - the global economic crisis came, putting the bank on the brink of ruin.  So the <span>insurance company</span> once again changed its big bosses, but kept afloat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New story </h2><p>  Nowadays, the abundance of addresses of <span>insurance companies</span> evokes thoughts that this business is extremely promising and profitable.  But in 2008 this was not so obvious, therefore, the shares of the bank, which included the future Liberty, were sold only at a hundred rubles apiece.  Almost half - 45% - were bought by Russian Railways, ALROS. </p><p>  After some time, these same individuals gained control of insurance business.  Kovalchuk soon acquired another 9% of the firm's securities.  And in 2012, almost all shares (99.99%) came under the control of Liberty Mutual.  ‚ÄúLiberty‚Äù - insurance for people traveling abroad, property, health, life, implemented in compliance with international standards, since the organization is currently part of an international corporation. </p><h2>  Common parameters </h2><p>  Casco reviews for Liberty Insurance are mostly positive.  However, the company was positively evaluated not only by customers, but also by large experts on the market.  In particular, the official credit rating for 2017 is AA ++.  Experts predict that the company will be stable in the foreseeable future. </p>

    <p>  The insurer's creditworthiness is considered high, therefore the company is financially reliable and stable.  This positively distinguishes it from the background of many insurance organizations that provide services in the Russian Federation.  This means that reviews on Liberty Insurance in the future will not be worse than now.  In general, the organization is close in level to companies rated in AAA.  Many analysts predict that in the future the company will be able to achieve this new level of reliability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Liberty Insurance: Moving Forward </h2><p>  The hull reviews for Liberty Insurance are positive, the organization has a large client base and is actively developing it.  Of the innovations designed to attract new participants and keep the old ones, the following proposal turned out to be the most attractive to the public: the company is ready to extend the comprehensive insurance policy without the payer's personal appearance in the office.  You can increase the duration of insurance services by calling the toll-free number or through your personal account on the company's website on the Internet. </p>

    <p>  From the reviews of Liberty Insurance it is clear that customers receive paid policies almost instantly: they are sent to them by mail.  If the user has lost the letter - it does not matter.  The site has a personal account in which the document is available at any time.  The policy is signed strictly by law - an electronic signature that has undergone enhanced encryption, which protects against fakes.  Documents are valid upon presentation at any instance. </p><h2>  For motorists: protection for all occasions </h2><p>  Feedback on Liberty Insurance among motorists suggests that customers are satisfied with both the program itself and its cost, as well as with the company's fulfillment of its obligations. </p><p>  The Casco program allows you to protect yourself from the unpleasant consequences of theft, car theft, damage resulting from an accident.  There are conditions in a situation where a motorist collides with a parked vehicle or runs into an object or even an animal.  Theft insurance is provided for certain parts of the mechanism. </p><h2>  Advanced features for those who fear troubles </h2><p>  If desired, the program can be supplemented with protection against the risk of damage, loss of additional equipment.  You can insure against an accident or request additional options. </p><p>  The most popular special features requested by motorists from an insurance company: </p><ul><li>  insurance coverage abroad, especially in the Schengen territory; </li><li>  protection against loss, theft, damage in a wheel accident; </li><li>  payment of value in the event of an insured event in full, excluding depreciation. </li></ul>

    <p>  If the policy is issued at the office, a specialist of the company will notify you of all these options and offer the most relevant for a particular client.  But if the policyholder purchases the program via the Internet, then it‚Äôs enough to simply check the boxes next to the desired service and it will be included in the price.  Incidentally, it will immediately become apparent what kind of increase in price one or another opportunity gives. </p><h2>  Obligatory reinsurance </h2><p>  This program was available several years ago, but subsequently ceased.  Not so long ago, an insurance company announced that the service is being provided again.  Customers can purchase it on their property.  It is supposed to cover the fire portfolio, as well as installation and construction projects.  You can insure your liability to other legal entities and individuals.  If necessary, the program allows you to organize protection against a variety of engineering risks. </p><p>  The location of the arrangement is the Western reinsurance market.  The lead is Gen Re.  Net line - 30 million US dollars.  Capacity is set automatically at 15 million.  At present, the authorized capital of the insurance company itself is 480.76 million. </p><h2>  Travel Insurance Reviews </h2><p>  One of the main activities of the <span>insurance organization</span> (except for working with car owners) is the provision of tourist insurance services.  Equally profitable programs apply to those traveling in Russia, and to people traveling abroad.  A comparative analysis of prices shows that the company offers almost the most favorable tariffs in the country. </p>

    <p>  As for reviews of Liberty Insurance among tourists, the information available to the general public allows us to create a positive image of the company.  Of course, on a tourist trip (and having insurance is a prerequisite for many visas), situations that are subject to the conditions of the program are not often found, but if such things happen, as people who find themselves in them report, the company successfully cope with the fulfillment of its obligations.  However, it is worth noting - during the crisis, when the company changed its owners about a decade ago, the quality of services was at a much lower level. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Liberty Insurance is one of those few insurance companies that offer their customers worldwide support, which is available for more than reasonable money.  Despite the fact that the company is part of an international corporation, it is focused on Russian clients of various levels.  There are good offers for tourists, car owners and those who wish to insure their health and property.  It is also beneficial to work with organizations and enterprises of various sizes. </p>

    <p>  If you believe the reviews on the organization‚Äôs work, presented abundantly on the World Wide Web, Liberty Insurance supports clients who find themselves in a difficult situation.  Despite the fact that insurance is one of the most controversial types of business, where the client is almost always sure that the organization serving him is cheating, Liberty practically had no conflict situations.  This clearly demonstrates that the organization is worthy of trust, which means that entrusting it with its money is a reasonable decision.  The annual turnover of the company shows that many people have already come to this conclusion. </p>
