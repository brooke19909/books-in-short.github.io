It is the subject of our national pride and the source of many political problems.  We can safely say that this is the best Black Sea resort in Russia.  There is nothing nicer than a cold summer to go from Rostov to Simferopol and other cities located further away.  You do not need to visit the capital of the peninsula at all, but go directly to the southern coast of Crimea. </p>

    <h2>  Difficult situation </h2><p>  It so happened that Crimea is a contested territory.  Convenient and familiar to us routes through the lands of Ukraine are no longer available.  Not everyone will decide to go this way now.  The new route along Russian territory is somewhat longer and requires the obligatory use of a ferry.  The road from Rostov to Simferopol is a difficult path for the driver.  You can not predict in advance the occurrence of possible troubles near the <span>ferry.</span> </p><p>  The reality is that the only way to avoid the Kerch crossing is by plane.  Any other vehicle involves a path through the sea.  It is most convenient to travel by car, less conveniently by bus, and the hardest and longest journey will be for those who decide to take the train. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Until the bridge across the strait is completed and put into operation, the difficult situation with the transport accessibility of the peninsula will remain as sharp. </p>

    <h2>  The difficulties of a single ticket </h2><p>  Everyone who decided to travel by train from Rostov to Simferopol gets into an unpleasant situation connected with the need to purchase a single ticket.  The fact is that the trains do not cross the crossing.  In 2015, there were attempts to use ferries with rail on board, but they were ineffective. </p><p>  By train, you can either get to Krasnodar, or to Anapa, and then you will have to use buses on a single ticket.  Do not forget that the buses will be different: before and after the crossing.  In 2017, the control of free riders was tightened.  The acquisition of a single travel document has become a necessity.  Despite the fact that these buses pass without a queue, crossing can take about an hour.  On the other side you should expect a bus to Simferopol.  Passengers have the opportunity to be in a special building with air conditioning, but there are always a lot of people.  However, the worst part is that the visitors to the premises will be the last to leave, because the most savvy people gather on the street and take the bus first. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is no single Rostov-Simferopol bus on this section of the route.  The seats are not indicated on the tickets, which is why conflicts arise.  Everyone wants to occupy the most convenient place, especially after several hours of waiting in the scorching sunlight in a 40-degree heat.  Such a ticket is inexpensive, but the trip from the port to Simferopol will take about 13 hours, which is a very long time. </p><h2>  Bus tour </h2><p>  Knowing the difficulties with a single ticket, many prefer bus tours.  Questions about how to get from Rostov to Simferopol no longer arise.  The bus does not need to be changed.  It will be comfortable and convenient.  However, the most important thing is that it will spend much less time on a trip.  Depending on the tour, from 10 to 15 hours will be spent on the road.  This is a little if you recall that a trip on a single ticket from Krasnodar to Simferopol will take from 16 hours. </p>

    <p>  In bus tours there are no problems at the crossing.  All seats are pre-allocated according to the tickets.  There are no strangers on the bus, and the organization is at a high level.  In a word, this is an ideal option for those who want to save money, time and nerves. </p><h2>  Bus Tour Routes </h2><p>  The most popular bus route "Rostov - Simferopol" is the shortest.  It passes Krasnodar, through Slavyansk to the Kuban, the coast of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, the Kerch ferry crossing and ends right in the capital of the peninsula - Simferopol.  All other routes will be longer.  Some of them go through Krasnodar, and there are those that go through Anapa.  They can not be called neither picturesque nor fast, but they can be cheaper. </p><p>  Most tourists recommend it is the first route.  Especially if it is nightly.  Any trip during the day is unpleasant - the sun bakes, even with the air conditioner running.  Have to use the curtains. </p><h2>  By car </h2><p>  Why is it worth going by your own car?  Because it will take about 8-9 hours, and at best 5. The car travels much faster than any bus or train, including along Kerch.  By car you can overcome all this difficult journey in a night.  A trip during the day will also not cause difficulties, because air conditioners in modern cars are much better than in buses. </p>
