  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Iron for hair: what to look for when choosing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Iron for hair, it is also a straightener and iron, it is a useful device for <span>styling hair at home.</span>  It is especially effective in the case of naughty curls, curly and long.  He has long been a reliable assistant for women in everyday hair styling, but the variety of models before the next purchase of a new device makes you think about what to choose.  What to give your preference?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><table align="left" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Remington s6600 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hair iron" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/28865.jpg" width="500"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  First of all, pay attention to the size and coating of the plates.  Most of the models have not very wide plates, and this is good, because the hair will have less negative impact.  But their size plays a role: the smaller the plates in length, the less hair they will capture.  This is especially important in the case of thick and long curls. </p><p>  Iron for hair should be as safe as possible.  That is why manufacturers are trying to produce their models with ceramic plates.  Metal ones are the most harmful for hair, although they are much cheaper.  Rectifiers with anodic oxidant plates can also be found on sale, but so far they are not very popular because of the high cost.  Thus, ironing with ceramic plates is the best option. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Philips HP4686 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hair Iron Professional" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/28868.jpg" width="600"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Now let's see if the <span>hair straightening iron</span> needs to be temperature controlled.  Such a function will prove to be very useful, because everyone has different curls, and for their styling you may need your own temperature.  So, thin and weakened hair should be styled at a minimum temperature.  For thicker and thicker, a higher temperature regime should be selected.  In any case, you can already determine what your hair needs, directly during the use of the device. </p><p>  On sale you can find both professional models and household ones.  Which one to <span>choose?</span>  <span>A</span> hair <span>iron</span> professional, no doubt, will be more effective.  Its power is usually higher, but it weighs more, so its everyday use can be inconvenient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hair straightening iron" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/28864.jpg" width="250"></div>  For hair styling at home, a household straightener is quite suitable.  It is lighter, has a slightly lower power, but also copes well with the main function - straightening.  The difference between professional and household irons is also in price: the first ones are more expensive.

    <p>  Summing up, let's note that the important criterion for the purchase is the material of the plates and their sizes.  Further we pay attention to the presence of several temperature conditions, to additional nozzles, etc. Trust your purchase only to a well-known manufacturer.  And let you see a very inexpensive model that you have never heard of, there is no guarantee that it will serve you faithfully for a long time. </p><p>  Consider whether you need additional nozzles, for example, in order to make a <span>corrugation.</span>  <span>An iron</span> for hair with nozzles will cost more, but its capabilities are somewhat wider.  It all depends on your preferences: there is no point in overpaying for additional options if you are not going to use them. </p>
