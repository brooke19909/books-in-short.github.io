But to this day, many tourists come to Bulgaria, not only from the countries of the former USSR, but also from Europe.  Indeed, at the moment it is a European state, and tourism here is also developed at a high level.  If Bulgaria becomes your choice for a vacation, Primorsko is a city that is certainly worth a visit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria Primorsko" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/463462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Some reasons to relax in Bulgaria </h2><p>  Still, some people do not consider it necessary to go on vacation somewhere outside the borders of their native country.  They prefer to go to the Crimea, in Sochi or consider the best vacation time spent on the river, near the lake in a tent, by the fire.  But there are factors that help to convince a person that you should choose Bulgaria as a resort. </p><p>  There is almost no language barrier, because adults have studied Russian before.  In resorts, most staff also communicate freely with our tourists.  If you rest, as they say, "savages", then problems should also not arise.  Bulgarian and Russian languages ‚Äã‚Äãare very similar, so there will be no problems with translation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you do not like a long way to a vacation destination, then you can fly to Bulgaria in just a couple of hours.  Well, then you will go to the hotel where you booked the room. </p><p>  It is very easy to get a visa to enter Bulgaria.  The state is a member of the European Union, but the Schengen agreement does not apply to tourists who want to visit Bulgaria. </p><p>  The country has a great warm climate.  On the Black Sea coast there is a very gentle sun and not too salty water.  So, the weather in Primorsko (Bulgaria) is very warm, but at the same time there is no stuffiness and tiring heat. </p><p>  There is an opportunity to have a good rest with any budget.  You can stay in a hostel or in a chic hotel ‚ÄúGrand Hotel Varna‚Äù, buy souvenirs for any amount, as many branded items are sold at a decent discount.  And what a tourist will leave Bulgaria without perfumes or a small ceramic trinket! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in seaside bulgaria" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/463460.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  One of the best resorts </h2><p>  Such a recreational area as the resort of Primorsko, Bulgaria can really be proud of.  On the territory is the largest youth center in Europe.  Thanks to him, this place is becoming increasingly popular every year.  Primorsko is a city located in southeastern Bulgaria, on the Black Sea.  Tourists will be able to find a lot of entertainment in this place, relax on their own, with a group of friends or together with young children.  Favorable environmental conditions are observed both in all of Bulgaria and in Primorsko.  All this has a family holiday. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Geography of the spa town </h2><p>  On the rocky peninsula of Kyupriya, near the Strandzha mountains, the city of Primorsko is located.  Bulgaria is famous for other resort places.  Primorsko is surrounded by two bays: Stampolo and Devil.  The city is easily accessible from Burgas Airport.  This is very convenient for those who do not like the long road to the resort and back home.  Since the flight is short-lived, the nearby location of the airport can only please any tourist.  This is the main advantage of Primorsko over other <span>Bulgarian resorts.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seaside resort bulgaria" class="if" height="432" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/463461.jpg" width="584"></div>

    <p>  The distance to the town of Tsarev is only 15 kilometers.  You can reach him by car in just half an hour.  Therefore, you can not worry that the whole vacation will have to be in a small city.  The population in it is small.  The number of its inhabitants is approximately 4000 people.  But Primorsko can receive 70,000 guests per year from different parts of the world. </p><h2>  History of Primorsko </h2><p>  The country of Bulgaria has a very ancient history.  Primorsko is no exception.  Not far from the city is Masleniy cape.  More recently, scientists have found here an old solar calendar, which was supposedly made by the Thracians Beglik-Tash.  They worshiped the sun.  This calendar consists of two stone circles with holes into which the sun's rays penetrated on the days of the solstice and equinox.  Archaeologists still argue about the age of this find.  Some believe that the calendar was made in the 14th century BC.  Other scholars disagree with this figure.  But the fact that the calendar is at least 7000 years old is clear to everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also, archaeologists found household items, thanks to which it became clear that there was a connection between the present Primorsko, Greece and Crete.  Scientists have discovered the remains of the ancient city of Ranule, which was a large port settlement. </p><p>  During the existence of the Ottoman Empire, the village of Chengen was located in the resort.  Later she was given the name Kyupriya, and then - her real name.  Previously, no one could get into the resort, because it was in this area that the residence of the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Bulgaria Todor Zhivkov was located.  It was called "Pearl."  Now any tourist can come to the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria Mr. Primorsko" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/463463.jpg" width="537"></div>

    <h2>  The beauty of the land in Primorsko </h2><p>  The nature in the city is very beautiful, and it can be admired for ages.  This is probably why Bulgaria recognized Primorsko as a protected area.  Here you can find exotic and rare plants that will certainly interest any tourist.  There are pine forests, familiar, probably, to every Russian tourist.  And unique rock formations will attract the eye and surprise any person.  Even the people working in this resort town sometimes cannot take their eyes off such natural beauty. </p><h2>  Ecology of the resort area </h2><p>  Primorsko has very clean mountain air, which is why it is not in vain that people come here not only to swim in the waters of the Black Sea, but also to improve their health.  This resort is visited with children very often.  Indeed, in many places where we live permanently, so often there is not enough oxygen, the air is saturated with the exhaust gases of cars. </p><p>  The reserve, which is located in the Primorsko area, is called "Ropotamo".  It attracts tourists by the presence of unique rock formations on its territory - the Snake House, as well as the Lion's Head. </p><p>  Also, guests who were attracted to Bulgaria, Primorsko can please the beauty of two water streams: the Devil's River and Ropotamo flowing near it.  Guests of the resort really like them.  On the surface of Ropotamo you can see rare <span>water lilies that</span> have been listed in the Red Book and are protected by law.  This river flows into the Black Sea, which has a very clean coast.  For this achievement, the resort received a special Blue Flag award back in 1994.  Since then, in spite of the past years, the sea strip has remained clean. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Primorsko Bulgaria" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18627/463464.jpg" width="419"></div>

The average air temperature in July is about 27 degrees Celsius, but sometimes it rises to 33. The weather in the city is mostly sunny, so you can sunbathe with pleasure, and warm days last from April to September. </p><p>  Thanks to the mountain air, even for a week of vacation, a <span>vacation in Primorsko</span> will bring health benefits <span>.</span>  Bulgaria offers to combine a pleasant pastime with healthy air and sea baths.
