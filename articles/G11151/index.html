Skeptics claim that the Second World War went around the city like an iron, completely depriving it of its old buildings.  But many masterpieces of architecture have been painstakingly restored, and it's worth a look.  Le Havre, unlike the dull and unremarkable industrial ports of Eastern Europe, amazes the traveler with the gloss of the resort.  There are beaches, beautiful boardwalks.  In addition, Le Havre is a great launching pad for exploration with the aim of a beach holiday on the Norman coast.  Legendary resorts such as Deauville, Fecamp and Honfleur are located near the main city of the Seine-Seine department of the Upper Normandy region.  Another reason to visit Le Havre is to see firsthand the canvases of <span>Claude Monet.</span>  After all, the city is considered the unspoken capital of Impressionism.  About when and how to visit Le Havre, what to see and what to try, read in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le Havre France" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  brief information </h2><p>  The name of the city - Le Havre - is of Dutch origin.  Haven means: 1) harbor and 2) port.  Thus, Le Havre was destined to become the center of shipbuilding from birth.  Yes, and it was founded in 1517 by King Francis I as a military port.  It was fortified in the 17th century.  And in the XIX century it was converted into a trading port.  Now Le Havre (France) has the largest container terminal in the country.  The city is located on the right bank <span>of the Seine River.</span>  On the left is the famous resort of Honfleur.  Since both cities are located at the mouth of the Seine, Le Havre from the north and west has access to the sea, more precisely, to the Strait of Pas de Calais.  To the south of the city, the Norman Bridge crosses the river and is two kilometers long.  The population of Le Havre is 174 thousand people.  The capital of France, Paris, is 180 kilometers southeast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le Havre France Attractions" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039471.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Le Havre </h2><p>  There are no direct flights between Russia and this north-French city.  We have to fly with transfers - through Paris (Charles de Gaulle).  Le Havre Airport (France) is called Octeville.  This air harbor is located just seven kilometers from the city center.  If you aim to relax in the resorts of Normandy, you can land right away at Deauville Saint-Gatien Airport.  From it to Le Havre - 20 kilometers.  But an airplane from Paris is not the only mode of transport that can get to the city in the Seaside Seine.  From the capital station Saint-Lazare from 06:53 to 21:20 to Le Havre, numerous trains leave.  In two hours you will arrive at the Gare du Havre.  By the way, the station is one of the few buildings in Le Havre that the war did not touch.  And it is located almost in the center.  It‚Äôs about fifteen minutes to the St. Joseph‚Äôs church, and 800 meters from the Notre Dame Cathedral of Le Havre.  Buses from numerous carriers follow from Paris to the city.  The average travel time is three hours, and the approximate ticket price is 9 euros.  You can pay for tickets online at Ouibus, FlixBus or Eurolines. </p><h2>  How to make the trip long and enjoyable </h2><p>  Do not forget that Le Havre (France) is a seaport.  And there go chic cruise liners.  Their passengers inspect Le Havre in one day and continue on.  But if you decide to stay in this city for a more detailed acquaintance, then you can arrive on one of the many ferries from the UK.  Moscow - London - Portsmouth - Le Havre is no less popular route than a trip through Paris.  And this journey by sea promises to be enjoyable.  After all, ferries are very comfortable and look like cruise ships.  Brittany Ferries will deliver you to Le Havre in six to eight hours and 55 euros per person.  Many travelers call the route through London cheaper than via Paris. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le Havre city france" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039467.jpg" width="600"></div>

But there are low and high tourist seasons in it.  The first is the period from November to February.  Winters are not too harsh.  There are almost no frosts, but because of the dampness and winds, cold is felt more.  The lion's share of rainfall also falls in the winter months.  But the cost of housing is 25 euros against 35-40 in the high season.  In spring, the weather in Le Havre (France) continues to be rainy.  The sea which has cooled down during the winter is catching clouds on the mainland.  The thermometer column is in no hurry to crawl up.  If the average winter temperature is +8, then March is +10, April is ‚Äì12, and May is ‚Äì15.  The Atlantic climate of Normandy does not allow to establish heat in the summer.  The temperature rarely rises above +20 even in July.  But the amount of rainfall in summer is reduced significantly.  So, the high tourist season is coming.  If you are interested in a purely beach holiday in France, Le Havre may disappoint you.  The sea here is not so warm as on C√¥te d'Azur.  Nevertheless, the beaches of Le Havre and the surrounding coastal resorts are crammed with vacationers.  In order not to be bothered by the wind, special basket-tents are given for rent.  The first half of fall in Normandy is also dry.  This is a good time to tour the city and its surroundings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le Havre France Photos" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039466.jpg" width="600"></div>

Where to stay </h2><p>  According to the photo of Le Havre (France), taken from the sea, it is clear that this settlement is clearly divided into two parts.  The lower city is somewhat similar to Venice because of the abundance of canals, harbors (here they are called pools) and bridges.  Most tourist attractions are also located here.  The upper city is piled on rocks.  Mostly prosperous people live in it.  Hotels and apartments there are also expensive.  But in the Upper Town there are many parks.  Both parts of Le Havre are connected (except the streets) by a funicular.  The fare on it is 50 euro cents.  The historic city center is located at the mouth of the river.  After all, Le Havre appeared on the map of Europe, primarily as a port.  When choosing housing, tourists recommend focusing on the Lower City.  Le Havre is hardly a budget tourist destination.  The simplest hotel room without any stars will cost 20 euros in low season.  Tourists recommend booking apartments for several months.  Then it is possible to rent a decent apartment or studio for 30 euros per night. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le havre france reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039468.jpg" width="571"></div>

    <h2>  How to get around the city </h2><p>  The city of Le Havre (France) is very compact.  And if you live in its lower part, you will not need to spend money on public transport.  A taxi and a car are generally unnecessary things in the historical center, since many streets are pedestrian and parking lots are crazy money.  All the main attractions of Le Havre are concentrated within a radius of a kilometer, so you can get around them all in a few hours.  If your legs do not go, you can rent a bike.  His rent will cost 8 euros per day (plus a deposit of 200 –Ñ).  As in all major cities, Le Havre has buses and trams.  Public transport runs mail around the clock.  There are night flights.  One bus or tram ticket costs 1.8 euros.  Therefore, tourists recommend buying a book of ten coupons.  It costs 13 euros.  If you plan to travel around the city frequently throughout the day, it is better to purchase a daily subscription for 5 –Ñ.  Travel for a week will cost 15 euros.  The cable car helps tourists and residents alike.  Its lower station is located on Thiers Square, and the upper one is located on Felix Faure Street.  But, complaining, the funicular does not work on Sundays. </p><h2>  Le Havre (France): Attractions </h2><p>  There are actually a lot of them, but there are only five top ones.  What is a Mast Si traveler in Le Havre?  If you plan to see the city in one day, start your journey from the train station.  From it you can already see the main attraction of Le Havre - the church of San Joseph.  The hundred-meter bell tower of this temple served as a beacon for ships.  Inside the church impresses with its decoration, which is in harmony with the strict style of the Gothic Revival.  The temple was erected in the twentieth century.  And just 800 meters from this "new building" is a really old cathedral - Notre Dame.  It is not as big as Notre Dame, and you will have enough hours to inspect it.  The cathedral is located on the street of Paris - the main boulevard of Le Havre.  If you go up it, you will reach the City Hall (Hotel de Ville).  There is a small museum of the city‚Äôs history in the lobby of this office building.  The house of the shipbuilder (18th century) seems unremarkable.  But inside, he keeps a rich collection of antique furniture, ship models, personal belongings of family members, who for centuries owned this building.  In addition, the shipbuilder‚Äôs house is located on the promenade de l'√éle, in that part of the Le Havre port, where ferries from Portsmouth arrive.  And finally, the last iconic landmark of the city is the Andr√© Malraux Gallery (2 Clemenceau Boulevard).  It contains canvases by French impressionists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le Havre France Beach" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2039621.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Parks </h2><p>  Le Havre (France) is an industrial city.  Therefore, it was important to make it landscaped.  Between the town hall and the church of St. Joseph is St. Roch.  These are light cities.  Alleys, lawns, curtains and flower beds occupy a significant area.  Want to travel from Nomandia to Asia?  To do this, go to the Japanese Garden, which is located near the train station and Vauban Avenue.  In this small but lovely place you will find fish ponds and Buddha statues that were brought here from Japan. </p><h2>  Abbey Graville-Saint-Honorine </h2><p>  This monastery in Le Havre (France) somehow miraculously survived the Second World War, and therefore UNESCO adopted historical buildings under its auspices.  Now the abbey functions as a museum, a ticket to which costs five euros.  Finding a former monastery is easy.  It is located near the train station, through Picasso Avenue and is located on Esalle de l'Abb√©. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Le Havre port in France" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2039477.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Le Havre (France): Beach </h2><p>  In the urban area there is a two-kilometer stretch of shore allocated for sun and sea baths.  Northern nature gives these pleasures not many opportunities.  Although the English Channel in this place is surprisingly calm (in summer).  But the French, both local Normans and visitors, do not make a problem out of cold weather.  They perceive the beach as a place where you can sit by the sea, breathe iodine dissolved in the air, listen to the cries of seagulls.  A promenade is laid along the coast, where the concentration of fish taverns is simply huge.  In inclement weather, it‚Äôs good to sit here, taste mussel soup and drink it with cider or something stronger, for example, calvados.  The best beaches of Normandy are located in the resorts of Deauville, Honfleur and the like.  Admire the sheer cliffs is best in Etretat, which is 30 kilometers from Le Havre. </p><h2>  Souvenirs </h2><p>  The city of Le Havre (France) is called the homeland of apple cider and the product of its distillation, Calvados.  Visiting Normandy and not tasting these drinks is a crime.  And if you have tasted them, you will certainly want to buy a bottle or two - as a souvenir and for your friends.  Norman cheese, such as Neuchatel, Pont Levec, Livaro or Camembert, will also be a good gastronomic souvenir. </p>
