    <h2>  MC Beach Park Resort 5 * - reviews, advantages </h2><p>  Choosing a hotel, sometimes, is one of the most important points that determines the quality of rest.  You will not lose if you stop at such an option as the MC Beach Park Resort 5 * hotel.  Based on the reviews of travelers, we can conclude the following positive moments of relaxation in this resort: </p><ul><li>  incredibly tasty food, and also it is worth noting a huge number of various dishes; </li><li>  immediately upon arrival (regardless of whether you are already checked into the room or not), a bracelet will be put on you and you can use the All Inclusive system; </li><li>  excellent quality of wireless Internet (you can use it even on the beach); </li><li>  housekeeping is pretty good, but if you want perfect cleanliness and towels swans, then you have to leave a tip; </li><li>  a rather large and beautiful area with many walking spots; </li><li>  there are two large playgrounds for children on the territory, equipped with inflatable trampolines; </li><li>  there is a small improvised zoo with rabbits that you can pet and feed; </li><li>  every Tuesday themed Turkish dinners are held with a huge selection of traditional dishes; </li><li>  a lot of green spaces in the hotel; </li><li>  there are a lot of sun loungers and umbrellas on the beach, which eliminates the need to take places in the morning; </li><li>  the rooms located in the old building are very quiet and calm due to the remoteness of restaurants, bars and dance floors; </li><li>  daily replacement of towels, as well as replenishment of a cosmetic set (even if the available funds have not yet run out); </li><li>  very comfortable orthopedic mattresses on beds; </li><li>  a large selection of meat and fish dishes in the dining room; </li><li>  the sea is very close (literally, a few steps away). </li></ul><h2>  MC Beach Park Resort 5 * - reviews, shortcomings </h2><p>  Unfortunately, like any other resort hotel, MC Beach Park Resort Hotel 5 * is not immune from flaws.  Reviews demonstrate the following list of disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  despite the fact that the beach is sandy, going into the sea, you will constantly come across sharp stones; </li><li>  ice cream is given only 2 hours a day, and the administration does not inform guests about the place where this happens, and therefore you will have to find out everything yourself; </li><li>  prices for excursions at the hotel guide are very high (it is much cheaper to buy tours from agents working on the waterfront); </li><li>  There is a limit on the free use of wireless Internet, over which you will have to pay an additional fee; </li><li>  elevators work very slowly (in addition, sometimes they often break); </li><li>  due to constant voltage drops in the rooms, bulbs often burn out; </li><li>  only one small bottle of drinking water is provided per day, which is very small for the Turkish heat; </li><li>  maids do not pay attention to the Do Not Disturb sign and break into the door with cleaning; </li><li>  ordinary cooler water is poured in the coolers in the dining room (this can be understood by the pungent smell of bleach); </li><li>  very dirty sand on the beach; </li><li>  old furniture and appliances in the rooms; </li><li>  in the dining room, large lines gathered near the racks with meat dishes; </li><li>  drinks in the restaurant are served in plastic cups; </li><li>  very long registration and check-in procedure; </li><li>  when checking in the rooms, guests' requests for a double bed are not taken into account; </li><li>  the rooms need redecorating; </li><li>  very small balconies, where there is enough space just to dry clothes. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is the territory of the MC Beach Park Resort 5 * resort.  The description in the brochures and on specialized sites is fully consistent with the real picture.  It is worth noting several huge blue pools, as well as a large amount of greenery.  The territory makes a good impression.  There is a lot of space for walking and relaxing.  And if we talk about the sea, then it is literally a couple of steps from the hotel buildings.  But unlike the yard, the coast is practically not looked after.  This is a huge minus, because most tourists spend almost the whole day at sea, and they are not very pleased to contemplate the dirty sand. </p><p>  Food at the MC Beach Park Resort 5 * hotel (Alanya) is beyond praise.  Particularly pleased with the huge selection of fish dishes.  Various grilled meats are also served daily.  The only drawback is that quite often on the buffet you can see stale vegetables that have remained from past meals.  Nevertheless, this cannot spoil the overall positive picture of nutrition.  But traditional Turkish evenings can give you the most vivid impressions.  This applies not only to cuisine, but also to culture, because in the dining room you can listen to folk instrumental music and songs. </p><p>  If we talk about the number of rooms, then it is, of course, a little outdated.  However, they look pretty decent.  In addition, despite the fact that the beds are quite old, they have completely new orthopedic mattresses that will provide you with a good sleep and rest.  Another drawback, in addition to outdated repairs, can be considered that everything in the hotel works strictly on schedule.  A visit to the spa is available for a couple of hours a day, ice cream is given out for a couple of hours, and so with all other infrastructure facilities.  Sometimes it is very inconvenient to adapt to the established mode. </p>
