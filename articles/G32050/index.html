    <h2>  Difficult choice </h2><p>  Over the past few years, the market for mobile devices has been actively captured by smartphones that allow their owners to carry almost a real computer in their pocket, only in a smaller version.  If you conduct a little analysis, you can identify the simplest difference between all gadgets.  These are the prices.  According to their level, all mobile devices can be divided into three groups.  The first includes devices without a number of additional functions, with simplified technical characteristics, rather poor quality displays, cameras, and other specifications.  The price for them is low - in the range of 5-6 thousand rubles.  For the child the most suitable option.  The next sector is the middle price category.  Smartphones of this class have, as a rule, a decent technical base, a high-quality screen and other indicators are also at a fairly high level.  The price is 10-20 thousand rubles.  Premium devices have high technical and hardware characteristics.  The price for them starts from 20 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 5 or Samsung 4" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17528/329769.jpg" width="575"></div></h2><h2>  How to decide on a purchase </h2><p>  Which is better: Samsung or iPhone?  The question is rhetorical and does not have a clear answer.  Both brands have their own apologists and antagonists.  But it‚Äôs important when choosing a gadget to start with the functionality and the options you need.  If you compare the "iPhone 5" and "Samsung-4", then you can identify a number of differences, quite serious for the user.  Both devices belong to the top class, therefore, they have excellent technical performance.  The first significant discrepancy in the two gadgets is their size.  Samsung is far superior to the Cupertino company‚Äôs product, its parameters are great for surfing the Internet, watching videos, movies, photos.  However, ergonomic indicators leave much to be desired.  The sheer size of the phone creates some inconvenience for the owner.  An ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù with a screen size of 4 inches is very comfortable in the hand, you can navigate with one hand without fear of dropping the smartphone.  What to choose: iPhone 5 or Samsung 4 is a completely personal decision.  In addition, the body of the "apple" device is made of a single piece of aluminum, which gives it a certain noble status.  Samsung is made of plastic, which somewhat simplifies it in the eyes of users. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Compare iPhone5 and Samsung" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/330562.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Which OS to choose </h2><p>  For many potential buyers, the issue of the operating system that controls the smartphone is significant.  There are also significant differences between the models of Korean and American manufacturers.  Which is better: Samsung or iPhone?  One is based on Android, the second is based on iOS, respectively.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù has many complaints, but as many positive reviews.  It is safe to say that this operating system is simple, relatively reliable, has many applications, but it often freezes when processing a large array of information, and incorrectly displays data loading parameters.  The iOS installed in Apple products runs smoothly, behaves confidently when processing large files, and the phone‚Äôs high-speed performance.  However, there are a number of restrictions, which reduces the popularity of the system among smartphone users.  The sound, the quality of the picture, the camera and the hardware component in both devices are of high quality and do not have significant differences for the average person in the parameters.  Therefore, which is better: ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù or ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù - you and only you decide. </p>
