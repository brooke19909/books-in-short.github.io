Non-payment of it is a crime, which means that the taxpayer, in order to avoid legal liability, is obliged to know all the details of his tax obligations and to strictly observe them. </p><p>  One of the state fees in the Russian Federation is the transport tax, which serves as the basic source of state revenue, the basis for financing the repair and construction of roads in particular.  And since in fact no organization today can do without the use of vehicles, the question of what is the procedure and <span>deadline for paying transport tax by</span> legal entities becomes very relevant. </p>

    <h2>  Transport tax concept </h2><p>  In the Russian Federation, <span>individuals and legal entities</span> are subject to various types of taxes and state fees, one of which is the transport tax (TN).  This type of state tax is established by the Tax Code of the Russian Federation and decisions of regional authorities of the Russian Federation.

As for the reporting period, the <span>Tax Code of the Russian Federation (Article</span> 360) sets the following period for organizations of transport tax payers: first, second, third quarter.

    <h2>  Tax Calculation Rules </h2><p>  Transport tax is charged to organizations according to the <span>Tax Code of the Russian Federation (Article 362).</span>  Based on this source, enterprises calculate the TN independently, in contrast to the taxpayers of individuals. </p><p>  The calculation of the transport tax by legal entities is carried out for each vehicle separately by multiplying the tax rate and the tax base.  Organizations deduct the amount of advance payments made earlier from this result. </p><p>  These estimates are made with an increased coefficient in relation to: </p><ul><li>  passenger cars, the average price of which is 3-5 million rubles, and 2-3 years have passed since the year of their release (coefficient 1.1); </li><li>  cars, the average price of which is 3-5 million rubles, and 1-2 years have passed since the year of their release (coefficient 1.3); </li><li>  passenger cars, the average price of which is 3-5 million rubles, and less than a year has passed since the year of their release (coefficient 1.5); </li><li>  cars, the average price of which is from 5 to 10 million rubles, and less than 5 years have passed since the year of their production (coefficient 2); </li><li>  cars, the average price of which is from 5 to 10 million rubles, and less than 10 years have passed since the year of their production (coefficient 3); </li><li>  passenger cars, the average price of which is from 15 million rubles, and less than 20 years have passed since the year of their manufacture (coefficient 3). </li></ul><p>  Moreover, the average cost of a car is calculated by the state.  Lists of such vehicles are published annually no later than March 1 on the official Internet portal of the federal executive body, which carries out the functions of developing state policy and legal regulation in the field of trade. </p><h2>  The procedure for calculating advance payments </h2><p>  If the region provides for the possibility of advance payments for the state fee for transport, taxpayers-organizations calculate those at the end of each reporting period in the amount of 1/4 of the multiplication of the corresponding tax base and tax rate, taking into account the increasing coefficient, if necessary. </p><p>  In situations when the car was registered or deregistered during one tax or reporting period, the calculation of the invoice and advance payments is made taking into account the coefficient, which is defined as the ratio of the whole months during which the vehicle in question was registered with the tax payer to the quantity months included in the tax (reporting) period.  In this case, the month in which the vehicle was registered, and the one in which it was deregistered, are taken as full months. </p><p>  The subjects of power of the Russian Federation have the right to approve those categories of taxpayers who will be able to not calculate and not pay advance payments for the considered state fee. </p>

    <h2>  Terms and payment procedure </h2><p>  Tax is paid to the budget at the location of the vehicle.  The procedure and deadline for payment of transport tax by legal entities differs from the rules established for individuals. </p><p>  Organizations must pay TN after the tax period.  Those.  The transport tax for the year is calculated and paid to the budget.  The deadline for payment may vary depending on the laws of the subjects of the country, but cannot be set earlier than the deadline set by the code for filing a declaration. </p><p>  For example, in the Krasnodar Territory, organizations must pay the tax no later than March 1st, which follows the tax period that has ended.  And advance payments - no later than the 5th day of the second month, which follows the reporting period.  In the Ryazan Region, tax must be paid before February 1 of the year that follows the tax period that has ended.  And advance payments - until the last day of the month, respectively, following the expired reporting period. </p><p>  The laws of the regions can also spell out the ways in which the transport tax should be paid.  An example is the Sverdlovsk region, where TN organizations are required to contribute to the budget only in non-cash form, with the exception of cases provided for by the Russian legislation on taxes and fees. </p><p>  Benefits for enterprises are also established in the legislative acts of the regions.  So, in the Krasnodar Territory, residents of the special economic zone, which is created on the territory of this region, are completely exempted from TN.  For this, a legal entity must be provided with a tax agreement, an extract from the register of foreign legal entities and a migration card.  Also in this region, <span>public associations of</span> fire protection open for participation in the implementation of activities in the field of fire safety and emergency rescue operations are beneficiaries.  The basis for obtaining benefits by these enterprises is the Charter of the organization and the TCP provided to the corresponding service. </p><p>  In case of non-payment of the transport tax to the appropriate budget at the indicated time, the organizations are subject to the liability prescribed in the Tax Code.  <span>Article 199 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation</span> indicates that an enterprise that did not submit a tax return on time or provided deliberately false information in it in order to hide data is punished in such situations with a fine of 100-300 thousand rubles, forced labor for up to 2 years or deprivation freedom up to 2 years with deprivation of the right to engage in certain activities for a period of up to 3 years or without it. </p><p>  The same offense committed by a group of persons by conspiracy or on an especially large scale entails the imposition of a fine of 200 to 500 thousand rubles, forced labor up to 5 years or imprisonment up to 6 years with the deprivation of the right to engage in certain types activities for a period of up to 3 years or without it. </p><h2>  Tax return </h2><p>  To pay the transport tax, organizations, having calculated it themselves, fill out a payment order.  Transport tax is paid according to the declaration at the location of the vehicle.  At the same time, the tax return on TN by organizations should be submitted to the appropriate tax authority no later than February 1 of the year that follows the tax period that has ended. </p><p>  If the organization, according to Art.  83 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, recognized as a major taxpayer, a payment order must be submitted to the tax authority at the place of registration of the largest tax payers. </p>
