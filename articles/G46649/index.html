Even despite the difficult situation in the country, you can revise your family‚Äôs budget in such a way as to start saving money, thus forming a financial airbag.  Soon, the question inevitably arises of where to invest money at a high percentage, because experts do not get tired of repeating that finances should work, and not lie dead weight somewhere in the closet. </p>

    <h2>  Deposit as an accumulation tool </h2><p>  Bank deposit is the most common and easiest way to save money.  Unfortunately, only conservation, not multiplication.  However, if your savings are still small, then you can use bank deposit programs as a tool to accumulate an amount sufficient to invest in other projects.  At the same time, there is often a desire to invest money at a high percentage, because you want to get the maximum benefit.  However, a simple rule applies in the banking market: young and little-known banks offer the highest interest, while old and trusted organizations that have survived the previous crisis hold a more moderate interest rate.  Is it worth the risk trusting your still little money to a one-day bank? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of all the banks operating in our country, Sberbank of Russia enjoys the global support and confidence of depositors.  It is this bank that opens the largest number of deposit accounts, accepting deposits from the population.  The maximum interest rate on ruble deposits is 9.07% per annum on a deposit without the possibility of replenishment and partial withdrawal.  Is it possible to invest at a high interest rate in Sberbank?  Of course you can.  At the same time, forecast inflation should be taken into account for the entire term of the deposit.  Get rich on deposit accounts will not work, but you can save and accumulate money for subsequent investments.  In addition, the habit of putting aside part of its profits disciplines, sets up the accumulation of capital. </p>

    <h2>  Where to invest at a high percentage: choose the type of investment </h2><p>  A deposit account with a reliable bank is considered one of the most risk-free, while the income is minimal.  For many, peace is more expensive than probable profit, although this cannot be called a progressive point of view.  This is largely due to insecurity in their own abilities or due to a lack of relevant knowledge and skills.  Where else can you invest money at a high interest rate to significantly increase your capital? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In most cases, specialists offer the following investment areas: </p><ul><li>  real estate and <span>precious metals</span> ; </li><li>  securities (stocks and bonds); </li><li>  all kinds of mutual funds, PAMM accounts, playing on the Forex currency exchange; </li><li>  own business; </li><li>  other types of investment. </li></ul><p>  Each of these areas is good in its own way, carries its own risks and offers a different degree of profit.

    <h2>  Investments in real estate and precious metals </h2><p>  There are short and long term investments.  Real estate and <span>precious metals</span> are just a long-term investment and are able to bring really good returns.  You can invest at a high interest by buying a certain amount of bank gold.  The ingot must be stored in special conditions, since its unsatisfactory condition (scratches, dents) can reduce the cost of the sale.  It will be possible to say that invested capital has substantially increased in ten to twenty years, or even more. </p><p>  In approximately the same way, the situation is with real estate, however, there are some nuances.  The real estate market is fluctuating, falling prices below the purchase - this is a clear loss.  It is also possible that the acquired property is located on a plot that will be rebuilt.  Nobody wants his investment to be demolished, this is an additional hassle and possible losses. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Investments in stocks</span> and bonds </h2><p>  Securities have high liquidity, especially if you are fortunate enough to invest money in a bank at a high percentage in reliable shares of a promising company or in profitable bonds.  In order to calculate the reliability and profitability of such an investment, one must either understand the securities market well enough or find a good investment advisor. </p><p>  Of course, they do not pay fixed interest on shares, however, as a shareholder in a profitable enterprise, you have the right to rely on your share of the profit.  Dividends can be compared with high interest rates, in the end it is also the profit received as a result of investing.  In addition, a promising company shares quickly and stably grow in price. </p><h2>  "Forex", PAMM and mutual fund </h2><p>  Trading on the Forex currency exchange can be more than profitable, and this is dizzying for many novice traders.  Advertising on the Internet assures that practically nothing is required - you need a computer, some money to start bidding, and you will become a millionaire.  You can profitably invest money at interest received as profit after the sale of more expensive currency.  In practice, most of the novice traders go broke, not having time to really understand the rules of the game.  The likelihood of large profits is next to high risks. </p><p>  PAMM accounts also belong to the Forex market, but at the same time you entrust your money to the management of a more experienced trader, counting on part of the profit. <br>  The PAMM account is much calmer, the manager makes all decisions, but the risks from this do not decrease.  This is where the human factor comes into effect, the manager may make a mistake with the deal, and your contribution will be lost. </p><p>  Mutual Fund is a <span>mutual investment fund.</span>  You can invest money as a share through a bank, and you will also need a manager or manager who will conduct all investment business.  The risks here are slightly less than in the Forex market, but the success of investments in this case is also very unpredictable. </p>

    <h2>  Own business </h2><p>  You can look for ways to invest at a high interest per month and hope that the bank will not be revoked the license, and inflation will remain in some decent framework.  However, there is a more dynamic option - to open your own profitable business.  Depending on the chosen line of work, profitability can reach 300%, not a single bank will give such an increase in wealth. </p><p>  Of course, you will first need to study the issue, invest money and wait for the first time, while the business will go on self-sufficiency.  If a return on investment and self-sufficiency can be achieved within a year, this is a great start, but a longer period, from three to five years, is not considered a disaster, subject to stable development and a positive forecast. </p>
