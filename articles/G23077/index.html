It is famous for the fact that at its peak in the Middle Ages was the now destroyed Greek monastery of St. Elijah, and down the slope you can see a unique natural monument - the Temple of the Sun.  To help tourists, hiking trails of varying complexity are laid there, among which are accessible to people without special physical training. </p>

    <h2>  Cliffs of Tyshlar </h2><p>  The <span>Crimean Tatars</span> gave this <span>name</span> to seven rocks of different heights, forming a circle in the form of a round bowl with a flat stone in the middle, when looking at which there are associations with the English Stonehenge. </p><p>  Legends were composed about their origin and they came up with various names, including poetic ones.  For example, some call the cliffs of Tyshlar Stone or Sun Flower. </p><p>  There are people who are trying to explain the appearance of these stone cones of irregular shape by the intervention of extraterrestrial civilizations.  As an argument, the outward similarity of the rock complex to a locator is given.  There are more “mundane” explanations.  So, some scientists believe that in its place the waves of the Ancient Ocean once splashed, and Tyshlar’s ​​huge “teeth” are the remains of reefs.  There is also a version that it’s just a <span>karst funnel</span> destroyed over millions of years <span>,</span> which was formed on the slope of Mount Ilyas-Kaya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Temple of the sun </h2><p>  Stone, which is located in the center of the Tyshlar rock bowl, has been sacred since ancient times.  He is called the altar of the Temple of the Sun and, climbing on it, preferably barefoot, you can make a wish.  There is even a special recess in which people leave their notes asking for higher powers, coins, apples, cookies, etc. Some even write the names of their beloved young people or girls on the rocks.  True, it is not known how Cosmos relates to such acts of vandalism, and whether they can cause a completely opposite effect. </p><h2>  Ilyas Kaya </h2><p>  From this peak, whose height is 681 meters, one of the most beautiful views of the Laspin Valley opens.  You can get on it from the northern or eastern slope, as paths are laid along them, and they are more gentle, which makes it easier to climb.  But from the south and west side, Mount Ilyas-Kaya is stormed with great difficulty, and only professional climbers can take such routes. </p><p>  Usually they climb to the top not only to admire the surroundings, but also to visit the place where in the Middle Ages there was the church of St. Elijah, by whose name the mountain is named. </p><p>  By the way, Crimeans have a custom according to which the newlyweds, in the hope of receiving a blessing for a long happy life, are photographed against the background of the Christian stronghold - Mount Ilyas-Kaya. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  In the place where many centuries ago there was a famous Orthodox shrine that attracted hundreds of pilgrims, today you can see only the ruins of the church of St.  Elijah.  Unfortunately, nothing remained of the fortified monastery, which has a three-stage architecture.  Once in the church there was a stone bench and a structure in the form of an arch, under which there were 11 burials.  Judging by the surviving fragments, the archosolium was painted with Byzantine frescoes, and the vaulted ceiling rested on arches with a wide opening.  Some time ago, attempts were made to restore the structure.  Of the found blocks of limestone, only 3 semicircular arches were restored, designed to maintain arches from tuff.  You can also see the angular stones, which were designed window and doorways.  By the way, some skeptics believe that the structure, which is considered the temple of St.  Elijah, in fact, is a building related to the Maritime Department.  However, even they recognize that it is made up of stones that really date back to the 13-14th centuries. </p>

    <h2>  Legends </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there is an opinion that the Temple of the Sun is one of the most powerful energy places on the peninsula.  In support of this information is provided to the public after opening access to the secret archives of the NKVD and the KGB of the USSR.  According to her, during the Second World War, a special unit of the German Wehrmacht "Anenerbe" conducted classified experiments in these places.  According to Nazi scientists, the energy of the Temple of the Sun was able to influence events in the world.  However, their research did not lead to anything, and they could not find a way to use it.  According to legend, the Anenerbe group disappeared without a trace, as did the Soviet intelligence and scientists sent there, who were supposed to interfere with the Nazis. </p><h2>  Orchids </h2><p>  Crimean nature is fraught with many surprises, which few know about.  In particular, most tourists are surprised when they find out that orchids are growing on the peninsula.  At the same time, Laspi cliffs are exactly the place where you can see 20 species of these magnificent flowers, including the famous Komperia, which is considered the rarest representative of the Crimean fauna.  So those who choose walking routes along the slopes of Ilyas Kaya may be lucky enough to see some beautiful orchid that does not grow anywhere else on the planet. </p><h2>  Road to the sea </h2><p>  There are various walking routes for descent from Ilyas-Kaya (Crimea).  If you are not very tired, then it is best to take the opportunity to go to the southernmost point of the Crimean peninsula - to Cape Sarych.  To do this, you need to go along a narrow stony path.  To find it, move south from the Temple of the Sun.  Then you need to go down to a spring with clean drinking water, where you can quench your thirst and continue on to the beach with huge stone boulders.  There you will find bathing in the waves of the gentle sea and the rest necessary to make it easier to overcome the path to the hotel or to the boarding house. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To see all the wonders of Crimea described above, you need to get off at the Laspi stop, after using the fixed-route taxis that follow from the Sevastopol bus station to Yalta or Foros.  Next to it is a path that ascends a mountain, along which you need to follow to the tract Yalyn-Chur, where there is a spring with drinking water, which is very useful when climbing.  Next, you need to get to the “heroes”, carved from the trunks of dried trees, and turn right.  After 200 m, you will find yourself next to Ilyas-Kaya, and rising a little higher between the rocks, you will see the remains of the wall and admire magnificent views.  If you choose a path leading to the left, you will soon find yourself at the Temple of the Sun. </p><p>  You can also get on an SUV on a dirt road. </p><h2>  Tourist routes of Crimea </h2><p>  In a relatively small area of ​​Tauris, there are a huge number of cultural, historical and natural attractions, as well as religious shrines of different peoples.  That is why everyone can choose a route that will be most interesting to him.  For example, fans of hiking can recommend the following options: </p><ul><li>  from Yalta to Temiar waterfalls; </li><li>  from the Snake beam to Alimova; </li><li>  from Kuybyshevo to <span>Syuyrensky fortress,</span> with the passage through the Great Garden to Tank; </li><li>  Campaign Yalta - Glade of Fairy Tales - Taraktash - Ai-Petri; </li><li>  Falcon - The Grand Canyon. </li></ul>
