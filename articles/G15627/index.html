    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, the hotel is located not in Heraklion itself, but in the resort village not far from it.  And it is called Stalis.  Or, as they say, Stalis.  People who want to see more than one place, but the whole of Crete, are sent here to Cactus Village 4 *.  Or at least a few cities.  The right choice, since from Stalis you can quickly get to Hersonissos, Heraklion and Malia - the most popular resorts here.  By the way, it takes 30-40 minutes to get to the airport from here. </p><p>  Cactus Village Hotel &amp; Bungalows (full hotel name) is located on the seafront.  A private beach area can be reached in less than a minute.  At 200 meters from the hotel you can see a bus stop.  From there you can get anywhere.  By the way, there are several interesting sights nearby.  To go - 5-7 minutes.  These are the Crete Golf Club, the Aqua World Aquarium, and the Lychnostatis Folk Museum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
