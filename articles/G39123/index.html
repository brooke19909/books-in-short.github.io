However, most prefer to reach heights in any one direction. </p><p>  Those girls and women who chose crochet were the most fortunate, because with this tool you can create almost any product.  Designers offer a variety of patterns: from the classic "grandmother's square" to such delicacies as Aran and crochet braids.  The schemes may seem complicated, but this is only a first impression.  In practice, they are performed quite easily. </p><h2>  Three ways to form a braid using a hook </h2><p>  For many centuries, during which mankind has been engaged in knitting, a huge number of ornaments and patterns have been invented and improved.  This article will talk about how to make braids crochet.  The diagrams and description will illustrate three options for their creation: </p><ol><li>  Classic braid. </li><li>  A tourniquet woven from fragments of an openwork cloth. </li><li>  A spit formed from shells. </li></ol><p>  Each of these methods has its own specifics and allows you to get a fairly characteristic ornament. </p><p>  It should be noted that these methods also differ in difficulty levels.  That is, the craftswoman must compare the instruction with her abilities, before learning how to crochet braids (patterns will help you orient). </p><h2>  The easiest way to get a cloth with braids </h2><p>  The first method is far from new, it has been successfully used for several decades.  However, this fact does not detract from the merits of this simple development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To crochet such braids, no schemes are required.  Here one picture is enough, illustrating three stages: </p><ul><li>  Production of web with transverse slots. </li><li>  Interweaving strands. </li><li>  Ready braid. </li></ul><p>  The manufacture of canvas with slots is not difficult.  It is necessary to calculate the width of the main section, as well as the number of single crochet columns (RLS) for each strand.  The calculations will be true only if the craftswoman performs a control sample in advance. </p><p>  Next, you need to dial such a number of air loops (VP) that will form the entire part: the section of the canvas to the braid + length of the strand + fragment after the braid. </p><p>  At the next stage, the craftswoman should knit several rows with single crochet (4-6, depending on the thickness of the yarn). </p><h2>  Braiding and braiding </h2><p>  To get the hole of the right size, you should first knit the number of scs that makes up the section of the fabric to the braid.  Then collect as many VPs as are allotted for one strand, skip the same number of RLS in the previous row and start working with the web section after the braid (knit RLS).  In the next row from each VP, one RLS should be connected.  Thus, the desired hole will be obtained, and the number of RLS in the canvas will remain the same. </p><p>  The described sequence must be continued until the planned part is ready. </p><p>  <span>The crochet knitting scheme</span> consists in the fact that, using a large tool (for example, No. 6), the knitter grabs one strand and drags it under another.  In the resulting loop, she throws the next strand and so on until the end of the part. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern braids" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454078.jpg" width="327"></div>

True, <span>knitting braids</span> based on the ‚Äúshell‚Äù pattern has one advantage - making loop calculation much easier. </p><p>  To form braids with a hook (the schemes are proposed below in the form of photographs), you need to dial such a number of VPs that will be the width of the part without any gaps or allowances. </p><p>  The first row is knitted with crochets.  In the second, they begin work on the pattern: </p><ul><li>  Perform the site to the scythe. </li><li>  Knit 12-16 VP (depending on the thickness of the yarn). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet braids with patterns" class="if" height="249" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454033.jpg" width="421"></div></li><li>  Form a loop by turning the canvas.

    <p>  To get a convex CCH, you need to pass the hook not in the loop of the previous row, but directly under the CCH.  In this case, the tool is in front of the blade.  A recessed CCH is obtained when the hook is wound behind the CCH of the previous row (tool behind the blade). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting embossed column" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454040.jpg"></div>  Understanding the principles of manufacturing embossed columns and their use makes it possible to knit different volume patterns. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="braids crochet patterns" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454029.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  The combination of these techniques with partial knitting also allows you to form braids with a hook (the schemes demonstrate the described sequence).  B </p><h2>  How to tie a braid of three strands </h2><p>  Looking at the figure below, you may not notice that the pattern is crocheted.  These Arana mimics so accurately the plaits made on knitting needles that are suitable even for the most demanding knitters. </p><p>  In the literature, such an ornament is often called a ‚Äúscythe with a crochet shadow‚Äù.  The scheme gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it is formed. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet braids diagrams and description" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To work, you need yarn of medium thickness, otherwise the tourniquet will be too coarse.  Given the considerable volume of the braid, as well as the fact that crochet cloth always requires more yarn than knitting needles.  The average consumption of yarn in this case should be multiplied by two. </p><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  Working with any braids, you can not underestimate the importance of the preparatory phase.  The calculation of the loops must be very careful, otherwise you may find that the part is significantly wider or narrower than required. </p><p>  A control sample with a scythe in natural width will show a clear picture and will not make mistakes.  Its height must be at least 10 cm so that the measurements are accurate.  In addition, the finished sample must be washed and steamed so that the yarn shrinks (if it is peculiar to it). </p><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><p>  The craftswoman should pay close attention to the formation of the first row: here you need to add columns for future braids.  Six to ten CCHs (305 each) are added to two of the three strands.  As a result of such an operation, the lower edge of the part will remain flat and will not look like ruffles. </p><p>  The second row is knitted evenly, making sure that all new columns are knitted.  In the front rows, those sections of the canvas that serve as the background are ‚Äúrecessed‚Äù with embossed columns (at work), and the braids and other decorative elements are convex (before work). </p><p>  When the back row is formed, the picture changes: the background is knitted with convex columns, and the braid is recessed. </p><h2>  What is "partial knitting" </h2><p>  Unlike harnesses that are done on knitting needles, crochet braiding cannot be done in one row.  This is due to the fact that the fabric with knitting needles is more elastic, it can stretch and wrinkle.  <span>Crochet braid</span> pattern <span>(patterns</span> confirm this) requires the use of partial knitting techniques: </p><ol><li>  In the third row, the formation of additional paintings for weaving strands begins.  When the site will be ready before the scythe, perform the first row of the first strand (in the diagram it consists of six CCHs). </li><li>  Then do three VPs and turn the knitting. </li><li>  Again knit six CCH, do 3 VP lifting and turn the canvas. </li><li>  The last time they knit six CCH and connecting columns move to the base of the strand. </li><li>  Knit six CCH - the first row of the second strand.  Next, repeat the above algorithm. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="back side of the canvas" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454041.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  The third strand is performed by convex CCH (in this section of the braid it consists of one row). </p><p>  In the fourth (wrong) row, we need to interweave those fragments that were connected in the third.  This is done with the help of "recessed" embossed columns: the locks are interchanged.  4th row knitting sequence: </p><ul><li>  Plot to the spit. </li><li>  Third strand. </li><li>  The first strand. </li><li>  Second strand. </li><li>  Plot after the braid. </li></ul><p>  The process can be seen more clearly in the figure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="three strand braid" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454042.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The second part of rapport </h2><p>  When the interweaving of the first two strands is ready, the braid should be completed.  To cross the second and third strands, you need to repeat the algorithm for them that describes partial knitting.  That is, the first part of the braid is knitted simply by convex relief columns and consists of one row, and the second and third should be formed of three rows. </p><p>  In the sixth row, the craftswoman should cross the protruding strands and knit them accordingly. </p><h2>  Adaptation of the pattern of "braids" crochet for knitting openwork cloths </h2><p>  Knowing the principles and features of the formation of braids with a hook, the knitter can even make thin sheets of cotton or linen. </p><p>  The figure below offers interesting variations on the theme ‚Äúcrochet braid pattern‚Äù, diagrams and description are given here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet braids" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1454079.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The specificity of all three schemes is that instead of ‚Äúrecessed‚Äù embossed columns, a grid is used as a background.  The mesh cells are CCH and VP.  Strands of braids consist of two embossed columns with two crochets.  Light indicates strands that should remain at work, and dark - those that will be on the front side of the canvas. </p><p>  Compared to the ornament, for which knitting it was necessary to use partial knitting, these patterns are a bit simpler. </p><p>  Craftswomen should perceive the proposed patterns as separate rapports.  If it will be necessary to tie a wide web of several rapports, the binding must be excluded from the scheme (5 VP and 3SSN at the beginning and at the end). </p><p>  Using such patterns, you can create almost any item of clothing or decoration for the interior.  The advantage of all braids (and those that are knitted, and those that are crocheted) is that they give the canvas thickness and rigidity.  For this reason, braids are great for making warm hats, classic scarves and snoods, cardigans and coats, as well as other similar things. </p><p>  Also, these patterns will be indispensable for craftswomen working on bedspreads, pillows, carpets and other interior items. </p>
