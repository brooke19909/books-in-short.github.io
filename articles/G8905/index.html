They have a fairly extensive network that covers all cities of the country, connecting the center with remote corners of the country.  Almost 50 railway stations and stations are equipped here.  There are 4 stations in Tel Aviv, and Haifa has 6. Thanks to this, you can get to the station from almost any corner of the city. </p>

    <p>  The country's railway lines run both freight trains and modern trains designed to carry passengers.  They consist of single-deck and <span>double-deck cars.</span>  <span>Passenger trains</span> depart 2-3 times per hour at peak times, and at off-peak times 1 time per hour.  Trains run from Nahariya to Haifa, Tel Aviv and Ben Gurion Airport at night, stopping at Hof ha Carmel Station in Haifa and Tel Aviv Merkaz.  All other stations in these cities are closed after midnight. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction history </h2><p>  Israeli railways have a long history.  Their construction began when the country was ruled by Turkish and British authorities.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a railway was first voiced by Moses Montefiore, a British Jewish financier.  And 1892 was the year of the construction of the railway for Israel.  At this time, the first single-track branch 82 km long was laid.  She connected the city of Jaffa (now it is a district of Tel Aviv) and Jerusalem.  This distance could be covered in 4 hours.  In Jerusalem, the railway line was opened in 1892.  In the city of Jaffa, a station has recently been preserved, which was recently reconstructed, and the building was given for a museum and an entertainment center. </p><p>  The Turks, owning the Middle East, in 1900 developed a project for the construction of a railway track in Palestine.  It was supposed to lie between Istanbul and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.  The project was developed under the leadership of the Turkish Sultan Abdullah Hamid II, and the German engineers were engaged in the technical part.  As a result, a line was built connecting Istanbul and Medina.  But the British who came to power did not allow the Turks to use it.  There was another attempt to build a railway between Palestine and Egypt, but it was not yet completed. </p><p>  The cities of Haifa and Beit Shean were connected by a branch in 1904, and the next year, in 1905, a line was built connecting Haifa and Damascus.  The Turkish military railway line between Afula, Beer Sheva and the <span>Sinai desert was</span> opened in 1915. </p><p>  After the country gained independence in 1950, a new branch of Haifa - Tel Aviv - Jerusalem was opened in Israel.  And for the first time after a long war, regular rail links were established here.  In 1954, the opening of the railway station took place in Tel Aviv.  In 1965, a line was built and opened between Beer Sheva and Dimona to transport goods. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Modern development </h2><p>  The railways of Israel continue to intensively develop and modernize.  An order was opened for a branch that opened in 1991 before Rehovot for several new diesel-powered locomotives.  Israeli lines in 1992 were replenished with modern IC3 - Diesel.  Spain in 1997 sent comfortable passenger cars to the country.  And in 1998, new diesel locomotives were received from Spain. </p>

    <p>  Israel's railways are becoming more comfortable.  Using their services, it became convenient to move around the country. </p><h2>  Israeli Railways today </h2><p>  To date, almost 410 trains are operated every day for the transport of passengers on nine railway lines.  Each train consists of six cars, there are trains of 12 cars.  Trains in certain sections of the road can reach speeds of about 160 km / h.  But at the same time there is no unnecessary noise, nor a feeling of shaking. </p><p>  Inside the cars on both sides are seats, between them are tables.  Near each seat you can see plastic garbage bags.  Each carriage is equipped with climate control air conditioning and soft fluorescent lighting.  Each structure has a toilet, you can see a map of the movement.  The structure includes traveling light snacks, which includes water and sandwiches.  Wi-Fi is free here.  Throughout the journey, each station name is accompanied by a sound and visual announcement. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ticket purchase and train schedules </h2><p>  The level of service in Israel corresponds to the European one, where each passenger is guaranteed to travel in comfortable conditions with pleasant service. </p>

    <p>  To purchase tickets, you can use the machines or buy them directly at the box office.  Moreover, tickets are not bought for a specific trip, but from one point to another.  A transfer in a paid direction can be done an unlimited number of times.  Tickets are in the form of a plastic card with a built-in magnetic strip.  They can be bought both for one trip, and for several, both in one direction and in the opposite direction.  Purchased one-time tickets can be used only during the day when the ticket is purchased, and reusable tickets during the month. </p><p>  At the entrance and exit of the station are equipped with turnstiles.  Baggage is not paid separately.  It can be moved independently or with the help of the person on duty, using a special gate. </p><p>  It‚Äôs practically impossible to travel for free on an Israeli train, since almost every train has controllers, and the fines for trying to travel for free are pretty high. </p><p>  To find out the train schedule, you can go to the website of the railway of Israel.  Also here you can find out any changes made to the schedule. </p><h2>  Management Company </h2><p>  Today, the state-owned company of the Israeli Railways, Rakevet Israel, is engaged in all passenger and freight transportation on the railway.  It was organized in 2003 under the leadership of the Minister of Transport of the country. </p>

    <p>  Considering the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country and how densely populated its center and north, it can be argued that Israel Railways is considered the leading operator in passenger and freight transportation.  This <span>type of transport is</span> especially in demand among the local population. </p><p>  Passenger and freight trains run both in the suburbs and between the cities of the country.  But the railway is not connected with other states. </p><p>  Tourist destinations are especially popular, especially Ashkelon - Tel Aviv.  This is the busiest route. </p>

    <h2>  Freight transportation </h2><p>  The main means of transporting goods in Israel are freight trains.  Using them, bulk substances are transported - these are minerals found in <span>the Negev desert</span> and in the Dead Sea region.  Container transportation also occupies a significant place.  But freight compared to passenger is small. </p>

    <h2>  Shabbat holiday in the country </h2><p>  The most important Jewish holiday is the Shabbat in Israel every week.  It starts on Friday, in the evening, after sunset.  It lasts until Saturday evening. </p><p>  At this time, all transport stops working, and trains, unlike buses, stop working a couple of hours earlier.  In winter, this happens around 15:00, and in the summer - at 16-17 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages of railway transport </h2><p>  Israel's rail service, in particular passenger traffic, has several advantages.  Compared to bus transport, trains move faster and strictly on a schedule, since traffic jams, traffic lights, and the speed limit that exists for cars do not affect their movement.  The fare for traveling by rail is higher compared to the cost of traveling by bus.  But the train ride will be more comfortable and safer. </p><p>  One of the drawbacks is that the trains make a small number of stops, and they are distant from the city center.  Also, trains do not go to the northernmost regions of the country. </p>
