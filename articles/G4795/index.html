The best time for feminine dresses from thin, flying fabrics with bright prints, delicate lace and puffy skirts.  Sundress with straps - one of the most beloved outfits of girls.  It can be strict, playful, or it can even pass for an evening outfit - it all depends on the fabric and cut. </p><p>  <span>You</span> can <span>sew a sundress</span> on the straps yourself, and at the same time you can save a decent amount of money, because such things cost a lot in stores.  This garment is very simple to use.  Therefore, this is the best way for beginner craftswomen to practice their sewing skills. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spaghetti strap" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1017776.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Sketch creation </h2><p>  First of all, before proceeding with the choice of fabric and the work itself, you need to come up with the image of the product.  Sundress on the straps can be completely different, so you should draw a few sketches and choose the one that will be most to your taste. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Naturally, you need to choose a fabric based on the intended style.  If this is an everyday sundress with straps, then it is better to give preference to natural linen, for example, such as a cambric, staple, linen and thin cotton.  For a more elegant option, crepe chiffon, micro-oil, all kinds of silk fabrics are perfect.  You can also use regular cotton knitwear for straight <span>sundress models</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress on the straps pattern" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1020348.jpg" width="402"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the choice of fabrics in sewing accessories stores is so great that the range is able to satisfy the wishes of even the most capricious fashionistas. </p><h2>  Preparatory work </h2><p>  What does a sewing pattern look like for a product such as a sundress on straps?  The base pattern is a fitted silhouette of the product without a top with tucks on the front and back panels.  It‚Äôs easy to build. </p><p>  First of all, it is necessary to take measurements from the figure: girth of the chest, waist, hips, chest height, width of the back, length from shoulder to waist (front, through the center of the chest and behind), a solution of breast protrusions.  Further, all values ‚Äã‚Äãshould be transferred to the basis of the template.  For this purpose, a plastic film that is used in construction is best suited.  Such a pattern is not afraid of intensive use, which means that it can be used repeatedly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself sundress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1017779.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Building patterns </h2><p>  The pattern of the shelves is built inside the rectangle, its height is the length of the product, and the width is equal to the half-girth of the measure of the volume of the chest + a few centimeters for free fitting (usually take from 0.5 to 6 cm).  Work with the drawing can be divided into several simple steps: </p><ol><li>  Building the upper part of the base pattern is the most difficult part, but since you need a template for a sundress on the straps, many points can simply be omitted. </li><li>  The construction of the middle part - from the chest line to the waist line. </li><li>  The construction of the lower part - from the waist line to the bottom of the product. </li></ol><h2>  The construction of the first part of the pattern </h2><p>  So, you should first designate the horizontal.  This is the chest line, which is located in accordance with the measurement value "chest height" on the side of the rectangle, equal to the length of the product.  Further work is done on this horizontal.  First of all, a back zone equal to the width of the back is distinguished, followed by an armhole zone.  Calculate it this way: measure the chest girth is divided by 4 and add 2 cm. The resulting value is marked with a dot in the drawing.  All that remains on the line is the width of the front.  Since this is a summer sundress on the straps, here the back and armhole on its side can be left as high as it is.  But before you have to work.  The armhole zone should be divided in half and from this point gradually rise to the desired height of the sundress over the chest.  Next, highlight the tuck of the chest.  To do this, half the measure ‚Äútuck solution‚Äù recedes from the middle of the front and draws the line up at right angles to the chest line.  The second strip of the tuck is drawn according to the necessary pinch.  Usually it is 1.5-2 cm. Work with the upper part of the tuck can be considered finished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet sundress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1017778.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The construction of the second part of the pattern </h2><p>  Next, auxiliary verticals should be drawn, one of which will be a side seam, and the other two will be used to build tack tucks.  It should be noted that all the complex work has already been completed and only a little remains! </p><p>  So, the side line is lowered parallel to the sides of the rectangle, retreating a couple of centimeters from the midpoint of the armhole on the chest line.  The other two are located exactly in the middle of the front and rear halves of the shelves.  Next, calculations are made aimed at determining the difference between the measurement of the waist and chest, the resulting values ‚Äã‚Äãare divided into three and draw out tucks, nullifying their tops at the horizontal lines of the hips (not reaching 4 cm) and the chest. </p><h2>  The construction of the third part of the pattern </h2><p>  Further work consists in correctly forming the side seam along the hips.  There should not be any difficulties here either.  First, you should divide the measure of the circumference of the hips in half, and then postpone this value from the middle to the side seam along the hips and put a point.  And from the middle of the front shelf identical.  Ideally, it should turn out that the points are offset from the side seam by about 2 cm. Next, all that needs to be done is to connect the point with the unfinished line of the side seam with a smooth line and extend this line to the bottom of the product, expanding the parts by about 2-3 cm . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress on the straps photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1017777.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  From this pattern, you can take only the upper part and, instead of a straight silhouette, make a magnificent bottom.  For example, sew a sun skirt to the waist line or make a hem in a crease.  Today, models of sundresses with a knitted top and a multilayer chiffon skirt are very popular.  Also, based on this template, you can sew a <span>sundress on the floor</span> with a slightly <span>flared skirt</span> and a high cut to the side.  Or an evening version - with a tight silhouette.  You can also experiment with the top of the product by moving the tuck into the armpit area or by designing embossed seams with contrasting inserts.  There are just a ton of design options, you just need to turn on a flight of fancy - and an exciting lesson will bring results in the form of a chic summer wardrobe. </p><h2>  Machining Cut Details </h2><p>  It‚Äôs easy to sew a sundress on the straps with your own hands!  When the template is ready, all that remains is to transfer it to the fabric, cut it out with allowance for seams and assemble the parts into the product.  The sewing sequence is as follows: </p><ol><li>  Tucks on all parts close. </li><li>  Stitch the side seams. </li><li>  Sew a zipper into the middle back seam or sew a back with a thread-elastic band, slightly not reaching the waist line. </li><li>  Process the top cut with a grinder or inlay. </li><li>  Sew straps. </li><li>  Process the bottom of the product. </li></ol><p>  Everything, a sundress on the straps, the photo of which is presented in the article, is ready! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer sundress with straps" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/1017807.jpg" width="596"></div>

    <h2>  Knitted sundress </h2><p>  Often people who knit say that they are not at all friends with sewing.  But the whole paradox is that in order to make a <span>knitted sundress</span> on the straps, it will be crocheted or knitting, anyway a pattern will be required.  And the assembly stage, at which the parts are connected, as a rule, with a standard manual seam ‚Äúbehind the needle‚Äù, cannot be avoided.  Therefore, the construction of the template described above will be useful to all the craftswomen. </p><p>  For the manufacture of a knitted <span>summer sundress,</span> it is better to choose thin yarn with natural fiber.  Products with an openwork pattern of silk threads with a lining sewn according to the proposed pattern from <span>micro-oil fabric</span> will look original <span>.</span>  By the way, the knitted details themselves must correspond to the pattern, because only in this case it will be possible to achieve an ideal fit. </p>
