    <h2>  Aquazone </h2><p>  Many guests in their reviews of the Ayaz Aqua Hotel speak of a large-scale swimming area, which is never crowded.  The main pool is filled with fresh water and does not have a heating system.  Its area is 650 square meters.  Nearby there is a children's pool, sunbeds and umbrellas.  An integral part of staying in this zone is training in water aerobics, conducted by professional trainers. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The proximity to its own beach allows vacationers not to spend much time on the road.  The infrastructure of this territory is quite developed.  It contains sun loungers with umbrellas for sunbathing and air bathing.  The towel dispenser operates on a deposit basis. </p><p>  The beach is sandy, the entrance to the water is gentle.  Gradually, an increase in depth and the presence of shallow water allows the kids to frolic, play and dive aground.  There is a lifeguard service that tirelessly watches over the order and safety of vacationers. </p>
