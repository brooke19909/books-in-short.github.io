They decorate the interiors of houses, clothes, various hats.  Flowers from ribbons can be seen on children's hair clips and hair bands, on handbags and dresses, because little fashionistas like them so much. </p><p>  Brilliant, sparkling in the sun, satin, shimmering and eye-catching, in itself is very beautiful.  Tapes can be selected in any color, from pale and delicate to the brightest and most saturated.  And your flowers from ribbons will blossom in all shades of the rainbow, decorating and giving a unique uniqueness.  Ready-made flowers can be additionally decorated.  For example, sticking rhinestones or small pebbles, they will create a feeling of droplets of morning dew.  In the manufacture of the upper edges of the petals can be sprinkled with golden or silver sequins, this will give the finished flower a luxurious look.  Design options can be quite a lot.  And flowers from ribbons, the schemes of which we find in many magazines, can be very diverse. </p><p>  There are a lot of ways to make such decorations as flowers from ribbons.  These are chamomiles, and dahlias, and chrysanthemums, bells and violets, proud poppies and little forget-me-nots, and, of course, the queens of nature - roses.  Many believe that if the flower is inanimate, then it will not be elegant, but this is not so.  Rather, even the opposite.  After all, living plants so quickly lose their freshness.  At the same time, flowers from a satin ribbon are really unfading beauty that will delight for a long time. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, let's try to make a decorative rose for your home.  Its creation does not take much time and does not require any special experience and skills.  And also does not require special, expensive materials.  Everything that is needed for this is almost always at hand for every needlewoman.  What should we prepare for work?  First of all, this is of course a <span>satin ribbon.</span>  It should be of medium width.  If you want a large rose, then the width of the tape should be 5-7 centimeters.  Its length will depend on how magnificent you want to make your flower.  For a medium-sized rose, a ribbon of 70 cm in length is needed. </p><p>  The choice of shade depends entirely on your desire, but it is better that the flowers from the ribbons are bright.  We also need very sharp scissors, threads matching the selected ribbon, a sharp medium-sized needle and two buttons.  One of them should be flat, medium in size - this will be the base of the rose.  And the second - a small, contrasting color, convex, similar to a dewdrop - the core of the future flower.  If desired, it can be replaced with a bead.  But you can do without buttons. </p><p>  Now that we have prepared everything we need, let's try to make the simplest version of a rose.  Cut a piece of thread slightly longer than the length of the ribbon you have.  A knot does not need to be done.  Take the tape and sew along the bottom edge to the very end with a seam for assembling the ruff, while alternating small, medium and large stitches, which should not go along the edge, but three millimeters from the edge.  Next, pull the tape and make a fairly dense quilling.  If his waves are uneven, do not worry!  This is not at all scary.  And this so-called "artistic mess" will make the finished flower even more natural. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fasten the edges of the thread so that the resulting quilling does not open.  This can be done with a few small knots, or with a regular stitch of several stitches.  Now we just have to create a miracle - to collect a flower.  Take a needle with a small thread, make a knot at its end.  It is better not to take a long thread, because it will just get confused and interfere with work.  Take a quilling and start to lay it gently in a spiral, securing each turn of it with small stitches.  You can do all this overhang, or you can put it on the table - to whom it is more convenient.  When laying the ruffles, slightly shift it down.  Do it smoothly, without sudden changes, so that the finished flower does not turn out to be elongated, and the middle - strongly protruding.  The rose should turn round. </p><p>  When your creation acquires the necessary volume and shape, tighten the last turn of the ruff and tighten the buttons.  A small droplet or bead is in the center of the flower, and a flat one is at its base.  Spread the petals so that the illusion of a popping bud is created.  The flower itself is ready.  You can sew leaflets of green ribbon to it and use it to decorate clothes or hair.  And you can make a decoration of your interior.  To do this, take a <span>copper wire of</span> medium thickness.  Its length should be 2.5 times greater than the length of the desired stem.  Carefully thread the wire into the button at the base of the flower.  Fold it in half so that the button turns out in a loop, and tightly twist along the entire length, firmly fixing the flower. </p><p>  The resulting stem can be sheathed or simply wrapped tightly with a thin green ribbon.  After that, sew leaflets in random order and make a small perianth at the base to hide the stem attachment.  Now it remains only to put it in a vase and, if desired, make a few more flowers to collect a bouquet.  Let your life be beautiful and bright! </p>
