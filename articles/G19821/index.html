    <h2>  Overload </h2><p>  Mobile communication is a mystery that makes many people panic at the slightest glitches.  Why do not you receive SMS (MTS) on the phone?  The reasons for this may be a huge amount.  And the first one is network congestion. </p><p>  Usually this phenomenon is observed during the holidays.  Overloading the operator‚Äôs network does not allow calls and does not allow sending / receiving messages.  As a rule, you will not need anything to solve the problem.  Just wait a bit.  When the telephone connection is unloaded a little, letters will again be sent and received by you.  This is only one of the reasons why SMS do not come to the phone (MTS). </p><h2>  Crash </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that this is just the beginning.  Any network is not immune from a variety of failures and malfunctions.  During such periods, problems with calls and SMS messages from operators are usually observed.  Most often, no one can predict when the next failure will occur. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In other words, if you do not receive SMS (MTS) on your phone, especially when it comes to incoming letters from different operators, you can only complain about this reason.  Just wait a while.  When the problem is fixed, everything will return to normal. </p><p>  Take note: network outages are most often observed in adverse weather conditions.  For example, in heat or severe frosts.  Try not to panic if you notice a problem with the telephone connection of the MTS operator.  This company is considered one of the most stable.  Therefore, her problems do not happen too often.  And if this happens, then they try to fix all the problems as soon as possible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why sms do not come on a pay phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1317700.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Crash </h2><p>  I wonder <span>why SMS do not come to the</span> MTS <span>phone</span> ?  The cause of this phenomenon may be a banal accident that occurred at the station.  Also a fairly common reason, which is impossible to predict. </p><p>  To find out exactly what happened, call the MTS office or personally go to the nearest mobile phone salon of this operator.  Ask why you are having problems receiving SMS messages.  If the reason is precisely what happened on the line of the accident, you will be informed about this.  In this situation, you will not need anything.  Just sit and wait for the accident to be fixed and connected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Innovation and Testing </h2><p>  But the next reason can still be predicted.  Do not receive SMS on the MTS phone?  Having problems making calls on your mobile device?  Be sure to contact your mobile operator in some way.  He will help you understand the causes of what is happening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS do not come on the pay phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1317699.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, a new service is being tested or some innovations are being conducted.  In this case, the network usually fails.  But MTS is always trying to convey to its subscribers all the news about the planned work or about testing services.  Typically, the operator or publishes such news on the official website, or simply sends you a warning in advance about possible malfunctions in cellular communications in a given period.  It is necessary to wait until the end of testing or scheduled work.  Then the calls will again be carried out without problems, and you can receive messages. </p><h2>  Virus </h2><p>  Another common scenario is the infection of the phone with viruses.  Did you suddenly stop receiving SMS messages on your MTS phone, although you didn‚Äôt perform any special actions with your mobile device?  Then it's time to complain about the virus.  Especially if you have recently entered your phone number somewhere on the Internet. </p><p>  To learn about the presence of the virus, either special mobile anti-virus programs or the details of operations from your operator will help.  Typically, the phone "infection" simply pumps money from a SIM card, and also blocks access to the network.  Tracking the virus is not as easy as it sounds.  It is recommended that you take the phone to a service center, express your suspicions there, and then wait for the diagnosis to complete.  Usually in such organizations help to "cure" the gadget immediately.  After the operation, all functions begin to work in full force.  And you can receive and send messages without problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="SMS do not come on the telephone MTS Russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1317698.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Lock </h2><p>  Do not receive SMS on the MTS phone (Russia)?  As you can see, there are a lot of scenarios.  And to predict what kind of problem you have is almost impossible.  If all of the above situations do not work, try checking the balance of the SIM card that is having problems. </p><p>  Sometimes it turns out that a person simply does not have money on the balance sheet.  Moreover, there is a lot of debt.  If it is about 300 rubles, the number is blocked.  MTS usually notifies about this by message.  It will say that on a certain day (the date is indicated) your number will be blocked if you do not replenish the balance. </p><p>  Due to blocking, you lose the ability to make and receive calls, as well as send messages.  Their receipt is also included here.  The only solution to the problem is to replenish the balance.  As soon as the number is unlocked, all the capabilities of the cellular network will return to you. </p><h2>  Mobile device issues </h2><p>  You do not receive SMS on the MTS phone?  Then try to insert another SIM card into your mobile device.  You can even from the same operator.  Check if communication is working properly.  Not? </p><p>  Then the reason for the inability to receive messages is a malfunction of the phone.  How to proceed?  Either take the mobile phone for repair, or buy a new one.  All problems will disappear when the malfunctions are resolved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stopped sending sms to pay phone" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1317697.jpg" width="552"></div>

    <p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear why you do not receive SMS (MTS) on the phone.  There are many reasons, but do not panic.  First of all, if you find problems with the network or messages, immediately call the operator.  In most cases, they can explain to you why a particular failure occurred. </p>
