If you go on a trip hoping to discover something interesting for yourself in this country, it means that you are definitely moving in the right direction.  The whole world comes to see the main sights of Japan, because there is something unusual and calm in this balanced culture. </p><p>  Do not forget the fact that the Japanese are among the leaders in the creation of modern technologies, which surprise with their unusualness thousands of Europeans.  Megacities of Japan are the whole labyrinths with graceful and overnight modern architecture.  In one country, the highest skyscrapers and magnificent temples intertwine, beautiful nature and terrifying volcanoes that captivate with their beauty and grandeur. </p><p>  Let us begin to gradually get acquainted with the main attractions of Japan with names that give rise to many tourists a wild interest in this country. </p><h2>  Fuji </h2><p>  Traditionally, the story of Japan should begin with a great and terrible representative - the volcano of Fuji.  Today it is an active stratovolcano located on the island of Honshu near Tokyo and is a kind of visiting card of this country.  All Japanese consider Fuji a sacred place, and for tourists this is one of the main attractions of Japan.  Climbing the volcano is done exclusively in the summer using modern technology, but you can find the most amazing view in winter or early spring.  What is characteristic of a volcano is its symmetrical cone.  Also on its territory there are immediately five volcanic lakes, which no less attract the eye of a tourist. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="english.cheerup.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volcano of fuji" class="if uuid-2306751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306751.jpg"></div><h2>  Todai-ji </h2><p>  Having decided to visit this wonderful country, get ready for a rather uncharacteristic pronunciation of many attractions for us.  Here is one of the contenders - Todai-ji Temple.  This is the most sacred place in the entire Japanese state.  Sadly, the temple suffered several fires, which subsequently led to a decrease in its size, but nevertheless Todai-ji is still the largest wooden structure in the world.  About three million visitors come here every year.  The temple was built in 745, inside it is a huge Buddha statue that personifies the symbol of divine power.  On the territory of the temple you can also meet deer and even see them close. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Todai-ji in Japan" class="if uuid-2306755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306755.jpg"></div><h2>  Bamboo alley </h2><p>  The <span>bamboo grove of</span> Arashiyama, which has become almost the most popular <span>Kyoto attraction</span> in Japan, is spread out in the vastness of this beautiful state.  The grove was created by the hands of a monk named Muso Soseki.  Today, the bamboo alley means a full-fledged mini-park, which can be circumvented in 15 minutes.  But it doesn‚Äôt matter what territory the grove occupies; what matters is that you want to walk here for hours.  No wonder they say that here you can know the meaning of life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arashiyama Bamboo Grove" class="if uuid-2306759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306759.jpg"></div><h2>  Himeji Castle </h2><p>  Surely most of the audience of our readers know firsthand the Castle of the White Heron.  Yes, you're right, this is the second name of Himeji, as its snow-white walls and graceful outlines resemble a bird.  Surprising is the fact that not a single person managed to fire the building or simply inflict any damage on it.  Perhaps this factor can be explained by the presence of endless labyrinths in the form of gardens and rooms.  The Himeji complex consists of 83 structures, beautiful sakura blossoms on its territory, giving the castle a certain charm and charm.  By the way, the <span>White</span> Heron <span>Castle</span> has repeatedly appeared in many films and since 1993 has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.airtrip.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Himeji Castle" class="if uuid-2306763" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306763.jpg"></div><h2>  Mount Goyang-san </h2><p>  Mount Goyang-san is one of the most important sights of Japan, the description of which is not amenable to ordinary words.  There are many temples and Buddhist schools in Singon.  The very first temple, which originated on the territory of Mount Goyang-San, was built in 819.  At the moment, the entrance to the temples is open for ordinary tourists, it is also a very picturesque place where you can experience the charm of monastic life.  In addition to all of the above, there is a beautiful cemetery on the mountain, which is highlighted at night.  You can climb Goyang-san by tram. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.club-world.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Koya-san in Japan" class="if uuid-2306764" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306764.jpg"></div><h2>  Kumano Nati Taisha </h2><p>  One of the Kumano shrines, located a few kilometers from the Katsuura thermal spring.  It is truly picturesque nature and beautiful views.  Numerous paths lead to the temple, buried in the foliage of magnificent trees, 600 meters long.  The highest waterfall in Japan, of religious significance, deserves special attention.  Its height is about 113 meters.  No traveler will be disappointed with what he sees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lineblog.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kumano Nati Taisha" class="if uuid-2306765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306765.jpg"></div><h2>  Kotoku-in </h2><p>  Another representative of the temples in Japan, who received wide publicity thanks to the magnificence of the bronze statue of Buddha located on the territory of the temple.  The statue has been here for about 800 years, and reaches a height of 13 meters.  The story of the Buddha statue in Kotoku-in is quite interesting.  Initially, it reached 24 meters in height and was a wooden structure, which was destroyed in 1247 during a storm.  Then the Japanese made a decision to build a bronze statue that could withstand all the elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="datgo.exblog.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kotoku-in" class="if uuid-2306766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306766.jpg"></div><h2>  Peace Memorial </h2><p>  Once the Gembaku dome was the exhibition center of Hiroshima, but after 1945 it acts as a memorial symbolizing the consequences of an atomic explosion.  The bomb hit the building itself on August 6, 1945, 160 meters from the dome.  All the people inside the building died.  Today it is an important exhibit that very clearly reflects the picture of the consequences of an atomic explosion and the inadmissibility of the use of atomic weapons. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mstecker.com" data-author=": Michael A. Stecker, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hiroshima Peace Memorial" class="if uuid-2306768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306768.jpg"></div><h2>  Dzhigokudani Park </h2><p>  This place is famous for the fact that it lies in the Ekoyu valley at an altitude of 850 meters, where more than 160 snow monkeys live.  For most of the year, snow lies here, on which macaques run and entertain visitors.  But the main highlight of this park is the thermal springs, which have become the favorite place for monkeys.  Here they have their own rules - some bathe, while others carry food.  Definitely an interesting sight! </p><div class="photo" data-original="robibudiman05.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dzhigokudani Park" class="if uuid-2306769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306769.jpg"></div><h2>  Tokyo  Landmark of Japan </h2><p>  To date, there is no higher television tower in the world than the <span>Tokyo sky tree.</span>  Its height reaches 634 meters, in addition, it is the only structure that surpasses the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.  It provides a wide range of opportunities for tourists: you can go to one of the panoramic sites and take an unforgettable selfie against the backdrop of the city, either go to a cozy restaurant with a beautiful view from the window or look for a gift for relatives and friends in one of the souvenir shops.  In addition, at the base of the tower is a shopping and entertainment complex. </p><div class="photo" data-original="skdesu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tokyo Tower" class="if uuid-2311745" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2311745.jpg"></div><h2>  Kinkau-ji </h2><p>  The structure is completely covered with sheets of gold.  The Golden Pavilion was built in 1937 by decree of Yoshimitsu in a picturesque place in the middle of a beautiful lake and a lush garden.  This garden is considered to be one of the most beautiful in all of Japan.  The Golden Pavilion is divided into three levels: the first is intended for receiving guests, the second is an exhibition of paintings, and the third floor is designed for religious ceremonies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="saitoutakayuki.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kinkau-ji in Japan" class="if uuid-2311752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2311752.jpg"></div><h2>  Osaka Castle </h2><p>  Everyone has heard about the beautiful castles in Scotland, but do not forget about Japanese architecture.  Local castles are no worse than European buildings.  The famous commander erected this castle in the XVI century.  It consists of eight floors (five aboveground and three underground). </p><div class="photo" data-original="sc.chinaz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Osaka Castle" class="if uuid-2306775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2306775.jpg"></div><p>  The building was erected on a stone embankment as a defense against enemy raids, and the walls of the castle are decorated <span>with gold leaf.</span>  The observation deck, located on the upper floors, offers tourists a beautiful view of the city.  The castle is still the main attraction of Osaka in Japan. </p>
