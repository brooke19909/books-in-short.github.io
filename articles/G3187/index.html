However, it is much more interesting to feel the atmosphere of Ancient Russia.  You can do this in the ancient city of Suzdal.  Reviews of tourists highlight this particular village, which is part of the famous Golden Ring. </p><h2>  Museum City </h2><p>  Suzdal is one of the few cities in Russia that has not been touched by modern buildings.  This place is a real reserve, where a unique number of architectural monuments has been preserved - many are on the UNESCO list of objects. </p><p>  The decision on the special status of Suzdal was made in 1967.  Large-scale works on improvement and restoration began in the city, new expositions opened. </p>

    <p>  Today, the city-museum lives off the tourism industry.  Cafes and restaurants, Suzdal hotels and guest houses, as well as souvenir shops - local residents are always welcome travelers, especially foreigners. </p><p>  About 15 years ago, a garment factory was reorganized.  Since then, an important object has been called the ‚ÄúSuzdal Souvenir Shop‚Äù and is the main supplier of ceramic and clay products, as well as souvenirs from birch bark.  Read about the most interesting gifts in the second part of our review. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  There is a category of tourists who do not care about living conditions at all - they are ready to spend the night in cheap hostels or even in their own tents, if weather conditions permit.  However, most travelers still care about the issue of accommodation. </p><p>  In Suzdal, some locals contain guest houses.  As a rule, the owners occupy one half of the village house, and the other rooms are rented to visitors.  This is the most budget accommodation option, but do not forget about the human factor.  You do not receive any papers about booking or the provision of services, and at any time you may suffer from an unscrupulous owner. </p><p>  Another option is to choose official Suzdal hotels.  In the list of the best, according to tourists, was the hotel "Heliopark".  Read prices, accommodation options, entertainment and much more in our review. </p><h2>  Heliopark Network </h2><p>  Moscow, Kaliningrad, Penza, Krasnaya Polyana, Nebug, Baden-Baden (Germany) and Leukerbad (Switzerland) - the Heliopark chain presents twelve modern hotels with an excellent level of service. </p><p>  Heliopark (Suzdal) fits perfectly into the city landscape.  All buildings of the complex are made in the old Russian style.  The incredible beauty of nature and wooden huts make you feel the special atmosphere of the Russian hinterland, where unity with nature and a sense of freedom charge with energy and positive emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Suzdal hotels" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/955658.jpg" width="600"></div>

In addition, the infrastructure of the hotel involves a full vacation here. </p><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  The hotel "Heliopark" (Suzdal) has 85 rooms of various categories.  All hotel buildings are made of wood.  The furniture is made of environmentally friendly materials, and specially selected textiles and decor elements make the interior of the apartment home-like. </p><p>  SNGL is the only option for a single traveler. </p><p>  DBL / TWIN.  In the buildings "Turrets" and "Manor" 42 rooms are equipped to accommodate two guests.  The rooms have all the necessary furniture, a refrigerator, a TV, a split system, a hairdryer and a set for personal hygiene.

    <p>  SUPERIOR DBL / TWIN.  The improved layout of each of the 30 rooms allows you to comfortably accommodate a family with one child.  The technical equipment is similar to the DBL category.  The minimum cost is 3350 rubles per guest. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  JUNIOR SUITE.  Four two-room suites are most suitable for a romantic weekend.  A feature of this apartment is the corner bath, which is located in the bedroom.  The minimum cost is 4100 rubles per guest. </p><p>  SUITE DBL / TWIN - luxurious apartments with a kitchen equipped with all necessary appliances.  The space is divided into several zones: bedroom, living room and dining room.  The minimum cost of accommodation is 6000 rubles per guest. </p><p>  At the Heliopark Hotel (Suzdal), prices may vary depending on the day of the week (weekdays or weekends) and on meals (breakfast or breakfast + lunch).  Accommodation for children under 6 years is free (without extra bed). </p><h2>  What do guests think? </h2><p>  We hope that the hotel is "working on bugs."  In the reviews you can often read the following complaints: </p><ul><li>  poor sound insulation; </li><li>  weak Wi-Fi signal; </li><li>  faulty plumbing in individual rooms; </li><li>  the need for repair. </li></ul><p>  Unfortunately, these shortcomings lead to the conclusion that the Heliopark Hotel (Suzdal) does not correspond to four stars in terms of level.  Hence, the prices here are unreasonably high. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  As we have already said, most of the inhabitants of the museum city work in the tourism industry, so you will not have problems with food.  This is especially true for guests at the Heliopark Hotel (Suzdal). </p><p>  Traveler reviews mark a huge restaurant complex, which includes: </p><ul><li>  fireplace Hall; </li><li>  Tavern "Tavern"; </li><li>  music room; </li><li>  bar; </li><li>  Hall "Hops"; </li><li>  outdoor cafe; </li><li>  summer arbors. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel heliopark suzdal" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/955661.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  Professional chefs offer dishes according to individual recipes.  The menu also includes homemade products (milk, cottage cheese, etc.), which many of us like to eat for breakfast. </p><p>  The interior "as in a village hut" creates a special atmosphere of comfort.  It seems that you came to visit a very hospitable owners. </p><p>  The only drawback that guests noticed is the price.  However, if your vacation is limited to one weekend, then you are unlikely to pay attention to it. </p><h2>  SPA "in Russian" </h2><p>  We know for sure that not a single hotel or guest house in Suzdal can boast such a luxurious SPA center.  You probably hope to hear about an overseas hammam or mud wraps? </p><p>  No, this is a unique bath complex.  A visit to the bath is a centuries-old tradition of cleansing not only the body, but also the soul.  Heliopark (Suzdal) offers its guests a complex of eleven baths: </p><ul><li>  Salt.  The relaxation room and the steam room are decorated with unique plates of Tibetan salt.  Suitable for the treatment of allergies, chronic respiratory diseases and insomnia. </li><li>  Siberian.  It will pleasantly surprise you with the aroma of birch, oak, juniper and <span>fir brooms.</span>  Instead of bedding, scented hay is traditionally used in the steam room. </li><li>  The bathhouse is black.  The process of preparing such a bath is incredibly complex and takes place in several stages, which only a real professional can handle. </li><li>  Altai.  Sun loungers and the walls inside are made of lime board, due to which, when heated, the room is filled with a delicious aroma.  There is a special room with thatched sunbeds, which will help to relax even more after the steam room. </li><li>  Taiga.  The aromas of spicy herbs, juniper and pine needles will conquer you.  An unusual interior reminds of severe taiga. </li><li>  Country.  To <span>finish the steam room</span> , a unique natural material was used - linden croaker.  It has good moisture and heat capacity, but the main advantage is the aroma of honey that occurs when heated. </li><li>  Noble. </li><li>  Imperial. </li><li>  Merchant. </li><li>  Boyarskaya. </li><li>  Peasant. </li></ul>

    <p>  All visitors can use the services of a bathhouse attendant, make honey massage or honey-salt peeling.  And do not forget about fragrant herbal tea with local honey. </p><h2>  Do not miss! </h2><p>  Most often they come to Suzdal only for one weekend for two reasons: </p><ul><li>  travelers know that during this period you can see all the sights; </li><li>  guests are afraid to get bored in a small town. </li></ul><p>  The last statement has nothing to do with the guests of the Heliopark Hotel (Suzdal) - here everyone will find something interesting for themselves. </p><p>  Firstly, these are water entertainments: swimming in the warm season, boating and, of course, fishing. </p><p>  Secondly, sports.  On the territory of the hotel are equipped platforms where you can find the same active like-minded people.  A bicycle rental service is also available. </p><p>  Thirdly, guests have the opportunity to take part in unusual productions and mass celebrations.  This is a unique chance to try on folk costumes, taste traditional treats and just have fun with Russian songs. </p><h2>  "Schurovo Gorodishche" </h2><p>  The Heliopark Hotel (Suzdal) and the Shchurovo Gorodishche Museum offer you to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of Ancient Russia.  On the territory, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is one hectare, there is a real Slavic settlement. </p><p>  Chopped huts, barns, an armory and a forge, camp kitchen - the basis for <span>the open-air museum</span> was the scenery prepared for the film "The Tsar" (director Pavel Lungin). </p>

    <p>  Today, visitors are taught archery, sword wielding, the art of baking bread in an old oven, and even teach agriculture lessons.  In the barnyard you can "chat" with animals. </p><p>  A visit to the Shchurovo Gorodishche museum is equally delighted for both children and adults - for this reason the complex is recommended to all guests of the Heliopark Hotel.  The prices here are quite affordable.  An entrance ticket costs 100 rubles (free for children up to 5 years old), photos in armor - 50 rubles, training in military skill - 50 rubles, riding a horse - 300 rubles. </p><h2>  In a working environment </h2><p>  Traditionally, large hotels do not forget about their corporate clients.  Almost any event can be held in one of two conference rooms: </p><ul><li>  "Kaleidoscope" is designed for 80 people.  Pros: stylish interior and all necessary equipment. </li><li>  "Festival" is designed for 200 people.  Suitable for large presentations, congresses and conferences.  Hotel staff organize small coffee breaks. </li></ul><h2>  As a keepsake </h2><p>  The excursion to Suzdal will leave you a lot of pleasant impressions.  However, memories tend to fade, which means that you should take care of memorable souvenirs in advance.  So, what to bring as a gift? </p><ul><li>  Honey and mead.  Probably, explanations are unnecessary, because beekeeping is well developed here.  And to imagine Suzdal without this strong drink is simply impossible. </li><li>  Knitwear.  Warm woolen socks with patterns, mittens and scarves, delicate tablecloths and napkins are also in demand - they are most often purchased by foreigners. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel heliopark suzdal" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/955662.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Crafts made of wood and birch bark.  The original boxes, baskets, caskets and bags learned to craft the locals from birch bark.  In addition, souvenir shops traditionally sell wood products (jewelry, dishes, home decoration), skillfully painted by hand. </li><li>  Clay and ceramic jugs, figurines and kitchen utensils.  On objects, the coat of arms of the city or historical subjects are most often depicted. </li><li>  Patchwork.  Original blankets and blankets, bags, pillows and even paintings - their feature is that it is impossible to find two identical things.  Local craftsmen for each product come up with their own ornament and select new patterns and colors. </li></ul>
