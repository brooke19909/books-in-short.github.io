They are made in two ways.  One of them consists in the use of used plastic containers: glasses, bottles, plates, from which various crafts are then created by both children and adults.  The second method consists in the use of special plastic, which in its properties is very similar to the combination of plasticine (which is also soft during operation) and clay (it also hardens after a while).  Its advantage over clay and clay is that its colors are more saturated, vibrant.  Both in the first case, and in the second, excellent plastic figures are obtained.  Moreover, there is no super-complicated task in their manufacture; a novice in this field can cope with it. </p><p>  <strong>With waste</strong> </p>

Recently, they have found unconventional applications - various crafts are made from them.  So two tasks are solved simultaneously.  Firstly, the amount of garbage is reduced, and secondly, crafts are created that become an adornment of personal plots and children's playgrounds.  One of the simplest such figures is a snowman.  It can be made both from cups and from half-liter bottles.

Six cups are taken.  Five of them are glued around the perimeter of the first so that a ball gradually forms.  On top of the first row of cups, a second is glued.  The angle of rotation should be greater than the first.  So in stages, row by row, the first ball is obtained.  Then, similarly, 4 more spheres of different sizes are made.  Two of them are very small and they will be hands.  One of the remaining balls should be slightly less than the first, and the third slightly less than the second.  At the final stage, the medium sphere is set to a large sphere, and another smaller one is placed on it.  On the sides of the middle ball are attached the smallest elements - hands.  Then a snowman is made out (eyes, nose, mouth are glued, a hat or cap is put on).  You can limit yourself to two balls, and then you get a snowman in a simpler version (such as in the photo).  Similarly, figures are made of plastic, from bottles with a capacity of 0.5 liters.  In winter, there is not snow everywhere for the New Year.  The solution in such a situation is such plastic figures, without which the holiday loses a lot. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY plastic figures." class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/227305.jpg" width="260"></div>

    <p>  <strong>New solution</strong> </p><p>  Relatively recently, a special material called ‚Äúplastic‚Äù appeared on store shelves.  Its properties are very similar to clay and clay at the same time.  The material is very expensive, so figurines of a much smaller size are made from it than in the first case.  Water is added to the starting material, and whatever your heart desires is molded.  You can easily make any craft, including a snowman, but only a small one.  The algorithm for creating a figure is known to any child, and exactly repeats the actions that are performed when <span>sculpting from plasticine.</span>  In addition to the snowman, you can dazzle any cartoon character, flower or decorative elements for new beads.  Upon completion of the work, you need to give time for the solidification of the material, and here the figures, made of plastic with their own hands, can decorate your possessions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Figures from plastic master class." class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/227304.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Summary</strong> </p><p>  Now you have learned something new about what you can do if you wish yourself.  This article provides an algorithm for how to create the simplest products from plastic containers and plastic figures.  The master class is given on the example of creating statuettes of snowmen from cups and store raw materials.  Each of the methods perfectly suits a strictly defined material.  You can do a lot of beautiful and exclusive things, so turn on the imagination - and more! </p>
