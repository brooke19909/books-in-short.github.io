  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Real estate in Spain - time to acquire</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Russian citizens can buy property of any kind in Spain except VPO - Vivienda con Protecci√≥n Oficial.  This housing has official state protection.  It is sold at the lowest prices only to citizens of their country.  Payment for VPO is partially subsidized from the state treasury. During the reign of Franco it was strictly forbidden to sell housing to foreigners.  Now, on the contrary, in order to improve the country's economy, the state welcomes foreign investment in real estate. <br><br>  In other cases, there are no obstacles to the acquisition of real estate in Spain for citizens of other countries.  You can choose a secluded rural corner, buy a house there for a quiet measured life or an agricultural holiday, or buy <noindex>  <span>property in torrevieja</span> </noindex>  , in a beautiful resort in the center of the Costa Blanca, the best resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain. <br><br>  Realtors note an increase in demand for three areas of buying property in Spain <br><br>  The first is investing in your future.  People try to buy an apartment or a house in order to live in harmony with the environment in a country with a wonderful climate and developed economy after retirement.  The friendly relations of the local population contribute to this. <br><br>  The second is work in Spain.  Due to their work, many specialists have to spend more time in the country than at home.  Spain is now an economically developed state, so buying a property to stay here while you work is absolutely justified. <br><br>  Third - real estate in resorts for recreation.  Many people prefer to buy real estate in order not to constantly look for a hotel or a rented apartment for the rest, preferring to have their own.  Such a purchase is most beneficial, since when the housing is free, it can be rented out to other tourists, which partially or even fully pays for all the costs of maintaining the apartment during the year.  Such a source of additional income is quite legal and complies with Spanish tax law. Spanish economists reasonably believe that in the next ten years the amount of investment by Russian citizens will significantly increase precisely in real estate on the coast and strongly welcome this. <br><br>  Assistance in the acquisition of real estate in Spain will be provided by the company Prorealproperty, specializing in the sale of real estate abroad.  On the company's website http://prorealproperty.com/spain you can place an ad, leave a request for the purchase of real estate and much more.  Experienced lawyers of the company will tell you what documents you need to have and how to draw up a contract of sale correctly and will help in all these matters.  An online consultant works on the site, who will answer all your questions and help you make the right choice and tell you how to properly fill out an application for the provision of a checkout service. </p></div></article>
