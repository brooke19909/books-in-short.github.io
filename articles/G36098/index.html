Before heading to Turkey, most tourists try to choose hotels to suit their tastes and possibilities.  If you decide to go to Kemer, then the Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 *, which was awarded three stars, can be a good option to settle there for a couple of weeks.  This hotel can be an excellent option in terms of price-quality ratio, if deluxe rooms in five-star hotels cannot afford it, and rooms that are too cheap do not suit you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer paradise hotel 3" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579719.jpg" width="398"></div>

    <h2>  Facade and condition of the building </h2><p>  Kemer Paradise Apple Hotel 3 * was built 25 years ago.  In the process of its existence, the hotel owner has repeatedly made repairs and restoration of individual parts of the hotel.  So, for example, a complete restoration of the building, after which a practically new modern hotel appeared before visitors, was made in 2008, and in 2011 the hotel underwent a small cosmetic renovation.  The hotel building is entirely built of brick.  As the colors were chosen red and white, which at the same time are the colors of the <span>flag of Turkey,</span> and attract attention from many tourists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The name of the hotel is not difficult to guess <span>where the Kemer</span> Paradise Hotel 3 * is located.  Kemer is one of the most popular resort <span>cities in Turkey.</span>  The location of the hotel in the city is very convenient for its guests.  For example, the distance to the beach is just over one kilometer.  It can be overcome in 10-15 minutes of uneasy walking.  In addition, not far from the hotel there are a large number of restaurants and cafes that provide tourists with the opportunity to have breakfast, lunch and dinner, not only in the territory of the three-star Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 *, but also outside it.  Within a few minutes walk from the hotel there is a city market where you can always buy souvenirs as a keepsake for yourself and your friends and relatives who are waiting for you at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer paradise apple hotel 3" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579734.jpg" width="370"></div>

    <h2>  Get to the hotel </h2><p>  Getting to the Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * (Turkey) will not be difficult, although it can take several extra hours to drive (compared to such resort cities of the country as Antalya or Bodrum).  The fact is that Kemer does not provide for its own city airport.  Therefore, tourists who want to relax in this glorious town should first go to Antalya.  You can get to Antalya either by direct charter flight from your city, if it is provided, or via Istanbul.  The cost of the two above options is approximately the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer paradise hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579721.jpg" width="372"></div>  After you arrive in Antalya, you will need to go to the bus station of the city, as there is no direct connection between Kemer and Antalya Airport.  Between the two resort cities of Turkey is about 55 kilometers, so a bus ride will take no more than an hour.  There is also another option: you can make a reservation with the Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * hotel, in which, upon arrival in Antalya, the hotel staff will pick you up.  This service is paid, and you will have to pay for it more than just for a bus ride.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Services provided to hotel guests </h2><p>  The hotel service, which is provided by the Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 *, can be started to be used at <span>Antalya Airport.</span>  Providing a transfer from the airport to the hotel is one of the services that tourists who come to Turkey often use.  In addition, upon arrival at the hotel you have the opportunity to book a room that will have access to free internet, as well as free cable TV.  If cable channels do not suit you, then for an additional fee you can ask the hotel manager to connect satellite TV.  Another convenient hotel service is the provision for personal use of a safe room.  In this safe you can store your valuables and documents.  In the event that something unexpected happened to you, and therefore you need to urgently wash your things, you can always use the laundry service at the hotel.  The rooms themselves are cleaned once a day at a time when the guest is absent.  A nice feature of the Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 *, reviews of which are quite decent, is that it is forbidden to smoke.  In order to be able to drag on a cigarette, you need to leave the hotel. </p><h2>  Sports and recreation </h2><p>  Like any other hotel, which is located in the resort town of Turkey, Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * provides its visitors with a wide range of various sports games and conditions for a good holiday.  Fans of outdoor activities will be pleased to know that the hotel offers the possibility of renting bicycles, with which you can either go swimming on the beach or simply ride around the city of Kemer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paradise hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579735.jpg" width="400"></div>  The main vacation for any person in the resort is the process of swimming in the sea or pool.  Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * provides the opportunity of both.  If the pool is located on site, then to the beach with the sea you will need to overcome a distance of 1 km.  As an additional service you can use the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas.  With them you can sit both on the seashore and not far from the pool.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Each Turkish hotel has its own restaurant, which is located on its territory.  Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * (Kemer) is no exception in this regard.  Reviews about this restaurant are both positive and negative.  Most likely, in this case it is all about the tastes of a particular person.  During breakfast, this restaurant offers its visitors a buffet, which allows you to quickly eat and go for a walk.  In the evening there is the opportunity to have dinner with well-cooked fish or any kind of meat with a side dish.  As an additional entertainment for visitors, there is the possibility of independent barbecue guests.  If the quality of food or service in the restaurant at the hotel does not suit you, then you can always go to the city.  Kemer is a fishing city, so in many cafes you can order almost any type of fish and be sure that it will be fresh and tasty.  A popular food in Kemer is also a doner kebab.  In Russia, another name for this dish is more familiar - shawarma.  But if in Russia it is not always possible to enjoy this food, then in Turkey it is simply hard to leave this type of institution. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer paradise hotel 3 pics" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579733.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The hotel has an average number of rooms, so if you are interested in this hotel, it is better to book rooms in it in advance.  In total, in the three-star Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * you can order three types of rooms: standard, deluxe and luxury.  The budget option of all is the standard room.  As a rule, when ordering this type, the visitor is given the opportunity to use free Internet and cable television in his room.  The deluxe room is slightly better than the standard in size and services, but inferior to the deluxe room, which, in turn, is the most expensive.  Depending on the preferences of the guests, you can choose both a non-smoking room and a smoking room.  Smoking is not allowed in the common area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, but there are specially designated places where this is allowed.  As a service included in absolutely every type of number, one can single out the provision for temporary use of a personal safe.  Only you have the key to it, and it is best to put in it all the valuables that were brought from home. </p><h2>  Hotel room prices </h2><p>  As in any other hotel around the world, the cost of one room depends on three factors: the number of guests arriving, the type of room chosen and the additional services included.  Thus, one standard room for two people with the option "all inclusive" will cost $ 80.  A deluxe room will cost a little more and will require a guest to pay $ 95 per night.  Luxury rooms are the most expensive in Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 * (photo of this room is below). Here the price can reach $ 110. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer paradise hotel 3 kemer" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579732.jpg" width="277"></div>

    <h2>  What is interesting in Kemer </h2><p>  Kemer has a truly stunning nature, so just sitting in a hotel is a sin.  The first thing you can do when you come to this city is to go to Ioryuk Park.  This park illustrates the history of the people who live in Kemer.  Not far from it you can find an ecopark, in which there are a large number of various reptiles.  Many of them are on the verge of extinction.  Of course, being only 55 kilometers from Antalya, not going there would be at least strange.  After spending less than an hour, you can get into the amazing city that was once rebuilt by the ancient Greeks.  The combination of modern Turkish architecture with ancient Greek is breathtaking.  If you can‚Äôt even live without extreme sports for a day, then you can go hiking along Tahtali Mountain, which is the highest point in the southern part of Turkey, and from its top you can see all the charm of the cedar forests of the country.  Fans of active pastime can go to the seashore and, putting on scuba gear, plunge to the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.  The view under water is very beautiful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kemer paradise hotel 3 turkey" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579723.jpg" width="367"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer Paradise Hotel 3 *, guest reviews </h2><p>  The main advantage, according to most visitors to this hotel, is its location in the center of the resort.  This fact allows tourists to go to the point in the city that they like most and not spend a lot of time on it.  Another plus is the level of service and maintenance.  Hotel visitors say that managers were very attentive to them, and minibuses intended for tourists always arrived on time and with an enviable frequency.  Among the minuses, visitors call the small size of the rooms and showers, but do not forget that the hotel is only a three-star. </p><p>  In conclusion to all of the above, it can be noted that the hotel is good, and in terms of price-quality ratio, many hotels in Turkey will certainly be inferior to it.  If you are interested in it, then hurry to book a room! </p>
