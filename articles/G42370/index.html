    <p>  Fans of natural attractions should be interested in excursions to the Palace of Knossos and the cave of Zeus, as well as a trip to Lake Kournas and Balos Bay.  According to tourists, a tour to the Samarya Gorge is very interesting.  If desired, you can go to the islands (boat trip). </p><p>  And of course, all vacationers in Gouves should visit the most popular excursion in Santorini.  Santorini is considered the hallmark of Greece and one of the most interesting islands in the whole world.  Here you will find colorful beaches, stunning sunsets, incredible surroundings and special architecture (numerous white houses with bright blue roofs). </p><p>  Fans of sightseeing holidays will find many interesting things in the vicinity of Gouves.  You can visit some historical sites on your own and even walk to them.  In addition, not far from the village are the most popular cities of the island (Heraklion, Hersonissos), which also have something to see.

    <p>  As for nutrition, I want to say separately.  A lot of good words have been written to the chef of the hotel.  Guests express their gratitude for the quality work performed, all dishes are varied, fresh and very tasty. </p><p>  As for entertainment, here the hotel loses.  On Saturdays, Greek evenings are held at the hotel, and there is no more animation in the middle of the week evening, and guests have to entertain themselves. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you are planning your vacation along the route Greece - Crete - Heraklion, Diogenis Blue Palace Hotel 4 * is a very good option for accommodation.  Following a recent leadership change, the hotel has been upgraded and upgraded to four stars.  The complex is a stone's throw from the best beach of Kato Gouves, and the main attractions of the island can be easily reached both by taxi and by rented car.  The hotel is ideal for a quiet family holiday and for families with children. </p>
