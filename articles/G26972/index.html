    <h2>  Technical features of batik </h2><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Despite the development of technologies and materials, the manual art of batik is still relevant and in demand.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">It is used as an independent art form and as a way of decorating textile things - clothes, scarves, curtains, theater wings.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The very word "batik" comes from the ancient Indian "drop of wax."</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">And it was wax that was originally used as the basis for partial dyeing of fabric to obtain patterns and ornaments.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Moreover, this material is still used in the technique of <span>hot batik.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The very technology of dyeing fabrics in batik art has several directions that are united by one principle - reservation, that is, protection of individual sections of the canvas in order to preserve their color during further dyeing.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This principle is implemented in different ways, depending on the technique of batik.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In addition to the technical side, batik also has its own artistic features, because its uniqueness is a combination of many <span>types of fine art.</span></span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Here you can find elements of graphics, watercolors, pastels, even stained glass and mosaics.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The art of batik itself is unique in that it is very simple to master.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">This is a grateful kind of creativity, because any work in this technique is a unique copy that can be modified, if necessary, with additional decoration techniques, including embroidery or applique.</span> </p>
