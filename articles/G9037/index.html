    <p>  <strong>Izmailovo</strong> </p><p>  The history of this village can be traced back to the sixteenth century, when it was the specific estate of the Romanov boyars.  Gradually, it was integrated into greater Moscow.  Since the beginning of the twentieth century it has been a typical working outskirts.  An indelible imprint of this circumstance is visible to the naked eye to this day.  Izmailovo is Moscow.  But Moscow is not so small.  Not front, not front and not glossy.  This is clearly not the most prestigious area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital.  But it would be unfair not to note that he is gradually changing for the better.  New residential complexes are being built, historical and <span>architectural monuments that have</span> survived to our time are maintained in the proper form.  The Cherkizovsky market, which existed nearby, was liquidated for many years and severely criminalized the situation. </p><p>  <strong>Moscow, Izmailovskaya metro</strong> </p><p>  There are not so many among the native Muscovites who want to move to a <span>permanent place of residence</span> on this eastern outskirts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow metro Izmailovskaya" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/226462.jpg" width="495"></div>  But few doubt that Izmailovo has its own unique look.  The station of the Izmailovskaya metro station itself is very factual and very characteristic of this area.  It was put into operation in 1961.  You have to imagine what time it was.  And this was the era of the struggle of N.S.  Khrushchev with excesses in the field of design and construction.  Thus, he saved money by reducing architecture to a minimum and to zero.  Izmailovskaya metro station was among the first facilities affected by this reasonable (only at first glance) initiative.  You can argue about whether there is architecture in general. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro station Izmailovskaya" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/226463.jpg" width="497"></div>  The station, although made on an individual project, is assembled from standard reinforced concrete structures.  Everything is reduced to the utmost minimalism, even the walls are missing.  This allows you to admire the views of <span>Izmailovsky Park</span> while waiting for the train.  Even on the floor of the station, primitive asphalt was originally laid, which in the following years was replaced by tile.

    <p>  Izmailovskaya metro station is located on the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.  And this only emphasizes its unpretentious appearance against the background of masterpieces located in the same direction, such as <span>Revolution Square,</span> Arbat, Smolenskaya or Kiev.  The visual contrast is simply striking, it seems that the metro train accidentally drove into some other, very poor and miserable city.  But the inhabitants of Izmailov have long been accustomed to this appearance of their station.  And many indigenous Muscovites have bright nostalgic feelings in their hearts when they see a short inscription in some municipal reference book, Izmailovskaya metro station.  And even such an open type of station has become familiar and has long gone down in the history of metro construction.  This is a good example of how not to build and how not to save money. </p>
