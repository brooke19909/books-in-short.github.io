Just a little more than 500 kilometers, and you can be in the "cradle" of the Navy of the country.  <span>The population of Voronezh</span> is already more than one million people.  A lot of people move here for permanent residence from the northern regions of the state, which makes the city very attractive for developers.  Many residential complexes are being built, and one of them is Yantarny (Voronezh).  The residential complex is located in the city center. </p>

    <h2>  Voronezh city </h2><p>  The city of military glory, the largest industrial, cultural, scientific center in the Central Federal District occupies the fifteenth place in the list of millionaire cities - all this can be said about Voronezh.  He took an honorable second place in the ranking of green cities in Russia.  All this makes it very attractive for living and attracts immigrants from the regions of the Far North and other cities.

    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the builder chose the most promising Kominternovsky district for the construction of Amber.  Why promising?  Because there are few industrial enterprises in it, close to the complex there are forest parks, squares, Figured and Triangular groves that give the main mass of oxygen.  In addition, the district provides the most developed infrastructure of social facilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  The place where the Yantarny residential complex (Voronezh) is located is 45th Infantry Division and Begovaya Streets.  This is not far from the city‚Äôs major transport artery - Antonova-Ovseenko street, turning off which you can get into the complex.  This arrangement guarantees good transport accessibility for future residents, allowing traffic jams to pass during rush hours.  Not only with your own car you can quickly get home from the city center, but also by public transport: bus or taxi.  The distance from the city center to the complex is a little over seven kilometers. </p>

    <p>  All rooms in the apartments will be separate, which will allow residents to quietly retire and relax.  The space of the apartments is ergonomic and is most useful.  The developer provides only a rough finish, which involves the installation of an entrance metal door, a final floor screed, a complete intra-apartment wiring of electricity, high-quality plastering of the walls. </p><h2>  The cost of apartments </h2><p>  Amber (Voronezh) is a residential complex that will consist of 970 apartments.  If we talk about a specific number, the project provides for 278 studios, 424 one-room, 216 two-room and 52 three-room apartments.  Thus, it is seen that one-room apartments are traditionally more valued.  And vice versa, large three-room options are practically not in demand. </p><p>  As for the cost of residential premises, the studios are offered for sale for an amount starting from 31 thousand rubles per square meter, which is about a little more than 800 thousand rubles per studio.  For a one-room one you will have to pay more than 1 million 200 thousand rubles, for a two-room one - about 2 million 300 thousand rubles, and a three-room one will make you fork out for 3 million 700 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Positive reviews about the complex </h2><p>  The Yantarny residential complex in Voronezh receives both positive and negative reviews.  Because of what moments do they appear?  Each person looks at the world with his own eyes and sees it in his own way.  So the apartments, furnishings, residential complex as a whole are presented differently to different people.  One of the very important is the local area and its design.  Such future residents really like the developer‚Äôs project, which shows sports fields with a rubberized coating, fenced with high nets.  For those who have children, playgrounds equipped with sandboxes and play areas are extremely important.  For many, it is important that there is a place for walking in the evening or on your legal day off, that is, the presence of walking alleys.  But, of course, all tenants want to be convenient and comfortable in the courtyards.  Those who have already settled in the "Yantarny" (residential complex of Voronezh), rejoice at some moments of the interior decoration (excellent windows) and heating, which does not allow to freeze. </p><h2>  Negative moments </h2><p>  But not only positive reviews were collected by Amber (Voronezh).  A residential complex, especially just built or under construction, will almost always have dissatisfied buyers.  What is the reason for this?  First of all, with a delay in the construction of the complex.  More interest holders are unhappy with the poor sound insulation in apartments, which they are forced to improve on their own or live by everyone.  Some still complain about excessively narrow elevators.  Where sometimes everyone can not fit. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Yantarny itself, a residential complex (Voronezh), is designed with developed internal infrastructure.  It includes a one-level underground parking, a landscaped courtyard, children's playgrounds with swings, carousels, slides and a special coating.  For adults, recreation areas and walking alleys are equipped. </p>

    <p>  As for the external infrastructure, here at the services of the residents of the complex are all the facilities that the city and specifically the Kominternovsky district can offer.  For the young residents of the complex there is a gymnasium, a kindergarten, a school, and sports palaces.  There are a lot of small shops and supermarkets of the federal chain in the district.  There are bank branches and a forest park where you can take a walk. </p><h2>  Ecological situation </h2><p>  Ecology every year in Voronezh is only improving, which is a great merit of the city authorities, who have achieved a change in the positive side of the state of water bodies, who have developed a comprehensive waste management scheme.  As for the location of the Yantarny complex, it is favorably rebuilt near huge groves, Figured and Triangular, giving the main mass of oxygen. </p>
