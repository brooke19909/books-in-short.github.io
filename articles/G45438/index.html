    <p>  There are various competing standards for this technology.  The most popular of these is Qi, which is now supported by companies such as Samsung, Google and Nokia.  However, more and more manufacturers are beginning to use it in one form or another. </p><h2>  Which phones support wireless charging? </h2><p>  Some smartphone models have a built-in wireless charging function (their rating is presented below).  Other devices for this will require replacement of the back cover or housing.  Accessories for Qi are produced taking into account specific phones, so when you connect them yourself, make sure that you choose a compatible model. </p><p>  If a special cover for wireless charging is not available for your smartphone, you can use a universal adapter that allows you to use this technology even for older devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What do you need to know about wireless charging? </h2><p>  As noted above, the Qi standard, which is used today in most Android devices, is currently the leader.  The technology works by using magnetic induction, which allows energy to be transferred from the platform to the phone‚Äôs battery.  The Qi standard, whose name in Chinese means ‚Äúair‚Äù or ‚Äústream of spiritual energy‚Äù, was created in 2008 and began to be developed simultaneously with the participation of 206 companies, including Microsoft, Samsung and Sony. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about which devices support wireless charging, one should also recall the less common PMA standard.  It also works due to magnetic induction, but its area of ‚Äã‚Äãdistribution is somewhat lower.  In June 2014, PMA developers, in partnership with Duracell, placed charging platforms in some public places in the United States to promote technology.  If this idea turns out to be viable in the future, it is possible that more smartphone manufacturers will begin to use this standard. </p><p>  If we talk about which phone models support Qi-standard wireless charging, then the choice will be very large.  Even if your Android smartphone does not have such technology built-in, you can purchase a universal Qi receiver, which costs only about $ 15.  Despite the bulkiness, it will add you significant convenience when using the gadget.  The device attaches to the back of your device, which can then be placed on any Qi-compatible charging platform.  Regarding the question of which phones support Qi wireless charging, it is worth noting that there is a receiver for sale on the iPhone (models 5, 5s and 6), which also receives positive reviews.  Its cost is about $ 30. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Which phones support wireless charging (gadget list) </h2><p>  Those who are interested in the new technology will find it useful to find out the rating of devices that have built-in Qi standards. </p><p>  The most famous model in this regard is the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6,</span> which is currently available for about $ 200.  According to user reviews, this is one of the best Android devices in principle.  Also, this device is a leader in the use of wireless charging.  The smartphone is compatible with Qi and PMA technologies at the same time.  Thanks to its elegant design, good speed and a large 16-megapixel camera, this phone surpasses the iPhone in some respects.  The commercially available Qi charger has a nice long cable for connecting to the network.  Its edges are highlighted in a light blue tint during charging and turn green when it is completed. </p><p>  Among the devices that are capable of charging wirelessly are the following: </p><ul><li>  <span>Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.</span> </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy Note Edge. </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy Note 4. </li><li>  Google Nexus 6. </li><li>  Motorola Droid Turbo and others. </li></ul><h2>  Other Samsung models </h2><p>  Analyzing which Samsung phones support wireless charging, one cannot help but recall the <span>Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.</span>  This model also simultaneously supports both standards - Qi and PMA.  The attractive curved shape of the case and the convenient screen allow owners to instantly access messages and other important data, and the built-in adapter does not impair the use of the device.  If the gadget itself can be purchased for about $ 300, the cost of a Pad device for charging will be about $ 40. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy Note Edge</span> also belongs to this category of devices.  This smartphone with an innovative curved screen offers very strong graphic performance on a bright display.  Its screen size is much larger than that of other devices, so the battery consumption, accordingly, is faster.  In this model, the possibility of wireless charging is not integrated directly into the back of the phone, but a special Samsung cover with Qi support is on sale, which replaces the standard back of the device.  This component costs about $ 25 and is available in two color options: jet black and snow white. </p>

    <p>  If you ask which phones support wireless charging in general, you will notice that this technology mainly affects gadgets with high hardware capacities, for which the ability to quickly charge them is especially important. </p><p>  Based on this, it is not surprising that the <span>Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is</span> also equipped with the described technology.  This gadget is characterized by high multitasking, fast and high-quality camera and high brightness of the screen, having a size of 5.7 inches.  In order to carry out its wireless charging, you will need a special case.  It is available for about $ 30 and comes in two colors. </p><p>  At the same time, Samsung is not the only manufacturer massively using this technology.  Which other brands of phones support wireless charging?  Consider below. </p><h2>  Other brands </h2><p>  Google Nexus 6 has an almost 6-inch screen and is equipped with a high-power processor, so it especially needs the ability to quickly and quickly recharge.  Qi technology is built in here initially, so there is no need to buy an extra cover or case.  This gadget is quite expensive - about $ 500, but fans appreciate its hardware capabilities along with Android 5.0.  All this offers users a high level of comfort.  Despite the fact that there is no special platform for wireless charging, the universal component will do its job perfectly. </p>

    <p>  Speaking about which phones support wireless charging, you can not touch on a model such as the Motorola Droid Turbo.  This smartphone with a screen of just over 5 inches has a camera with a resolution of 21 megapixels and many built-in functions.  Its battery life with active use is approximately 9 hours, so the built-in Qi technology is very useful.  There is also a special charger for this model, which places the phone in an upright position.  This means that you can continue to use the device while charging. </p><h2>  Sony brand </h2><p>  As already noted, the most active new technology is used by manufacturers such as Samsung, Google and Sony.  Which Sony phones support wireless charging?  First of all, this is the Sony Xperia Z3 - a waterproof gadget that, when actively used without recharging, works up to 12 hours.  Its screen is characterized by high brightness, and the speakers provide loud chic acoustics.  Despite the fact that its cost is about $ 400, the device is widely popular.  The cover for wireless charging will have to be purchased separately, and it costs more than a hundred dollars. </p>

    <h2>  Can I adapt my smartphone? </h2><p>  Which phones support wireless charging without built-in technology?  If your device does not have native Qi support, you can separately purchase and install an adapter on it and use the universal wireless charger.  Depending on what brand of gadget, you can connect the adapter via a micro-USB port (on the Android platform) or lightning (on the iPhone). </p><h2>  Universal Wireless Charging Adapters </h2><p>  If your phone is not listed above, then you need a universal adapter and a wireless charger.  You can get them for phones with micro-USB ports (for example, Android) and lightning ports (for example, iPhone).  Thus, you can update and improve almost all devices available on the market.  If we talk about, for example, which Xiaomi phones support wireless charging, then with the above method you will get the opportunity to charge even 5-year-old models without cable. </p><h2>  Universal charger </h2><p>  After you make sure that your phone supports wireless charging (by using the built-in functionality, using a special cover or by connecting an adapter - it does not matter), you need to purchase a wireless charger. </p>

    <p>  Currently, there are many such Qi devices available in various sizes, shapes, and colors.  You can buy such a component not only for use at home or in the office, but also for a car, and even a Qi portable battery.  If you purchased a smartphone that supports wireless charging, it is advisable to choose a specially designed memory for it.  If this is not available or you yourself updated your gadget, finding a universal device is not difficult. </p>
