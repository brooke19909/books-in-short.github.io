    <h2>  Ajami Beach </h2><p>  This is the southernmost beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, located in the old and picturesque area of ‚Äã‚ÄãJaffa.  Many tourists say that it is here that the most beautiful photos are obtained thanks to the stone arches stretching along the coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A multinational audience usually relaxes here, especially many representatives of the Arab diaspora.  Local residents claim that it was this fact that caused the permission to fry barbecue on Ajami.  And if you are planning a picnic, then feel free to go to this beach, you obviously will not stand out among the local public. </p><p>  For those who plan to have a bite to eat in a cafe right on the shore, two cozy places can be advised: </p><ul><li>  Restaurant Cassis.  It is very beautiful and calm, but the food is not one of the cheapest on the beach.  However, this does not bother those who wish to dine in the indescribable atmosphere of an oriental restaurant. </li><li>  The Oldman and The Sea.  This place is always full of people who are even ready to defend the line to try delicious food at affordable prices.  It is interesting that when ordering the main dish, the visitor receives free drinks and snacks in unlimited quantities. </li></ul><p>  If you just want to buy water or snacks, then you will need to walk about seven minutes to the nearest store. </p>

    <h2>  Hilton Beach </h2><p>  This beach area may not appeal to ordinary tourists, because most of it from morning to night is occupied by men of non-traditional sexual orientation.  Therefore, couples here can be quite uncomfortable.  But in general, the beach is very beautiful and well-groomed, in the southern part of it the surfers gather in the mornings who want to catch their best wave. </p><h2>  Family Beach Area </h2><p>  Tel Aviv Beach in Tel Aviv is considered the most picturesque and ideal for relaxing couples and families with children.  In one part there is a small club of surfers, and in the other there are dunes ending in a beautiful cliff. </p><p>  On the territory there is a small restaurant with simple dishes where you can satisfy your hunger and thirst.  For those who prefer more sophisticated dishes, we would advise you to drive a little further than the beach area to the tourist destinations where the most famous restaurants of Tel Aviv are located. </p>

    <h2>  Tel Aviv beaches: reviews </h2><p>  All the beaches that we have listed are municipal, so absolutely anyone can relax here.  However, some tourists prefer to spend time in hotel complexes that have their own piece of the coast. </p><p>  In Tel Aviv, hotels with their own beach are a rarity, as most of them are located some distance from the sea.  Most often, our compatriots, dreaming of their own recreation area on the beach, book hotels with convenient access to the beach, allowing you not to cross busy streets. </p><p>  The Russians who visited Tel Aviv speak with great enthusiasm about the coast of this city.  In addition to the zones we have already described, Nordau deserves attention.  Its territory is fenced from others by a high wall, and everyone who comes here clearly knows the schedule according to which six days of the week are equally divided between men and women, and Saturday is common when you can relax on the beach all together.  It is interesting that our compatriots on women's days with pleasure come here to sunbathe topless. </p><p>  Also, good reviews are left by our compatriots about the smallest beach of the city - Metsitsim.  Young couples gather here and spend a lot of fun.  If you go to this beach on a business day, you will be able to appreciate its beauty, but on weekends it is simply impossible to break through here. </p><p>  We hope that after reading our article no one will say that a vacation in Tel Aviv is far from a beach. </p>
