Many of them are attracted by the Mediterranean Sea, sung by Homer.  Having been on it on Egyptian and Tunisian tours and feeling like ‚Äúexperienced holidaymakers‚Äù, travelers strive to reach a new level by visiting boarding houses in southern European countries: Greece, Spain, Italy. </p><p>  A special "caste" of tourists is made by lovers of Greece, with trepidation related to its rich historical heritage, as well as to modern identity.  Lovers of Crete, one of the oldest, universally recognized, traditional European resorts, feel special in them.  This is one of those relatively inexpensive places where Europeans who value the benefits of civilization willingly go.  Among the rapidly developing resorts of Crete - a pronounced youth, Malia.  Small budget hotels are in particular demand during the high tourist season. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  One of them, the small Argo Studios Malia Apart (Greece, Malia), is dedicated to this article.  It is located in the north of Crete, in the popular (above) Greek resort of Malia, 30 kilometers from the central airport, built in the capital of the island, the city of Heraklion.  At the airport, planes making charter flights from the airports of Russia and Ukraine make a landing. </p>

    <p>  Argo Studios is built in the heart of the youth resort, about 400 meters from the beach.  The hotel complex with 26 apartments, judging by the reviews, is suitable for young families with children and generally ideal for youth companies.  The atmosphere of communication and celebration reigns here, along the road passing by the hotel, cool bikers sweep along.  In the evenings near the hotel, outrageous dance music is loudly pouring from local bars and a rather cool disco. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, according to reviews written by mothers who had a rest in Malia with the family, children who are tired of the beach and sightseeing day get enough sleep.  The fact is that the hotel is removed from the noisiest part of the resort. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The words "we lived at Argo Studios Malia Apart" sound organically.  They didn‚Äôt ‚Äústop‚Äù, they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù, but ‚Äúlived‚Äù.  So they say, since the hotel complex belongs to the ‚Äúapart-hotel‚Äù class, that is, its guests live in fully-functional apartments, which are identical to the apartments in an apartment building.  In each such "apartment" there is a kitchen equipped with a hob, electric kettle, microwave, refrigerator. </p><p>  The cost of living in an apart-hotel is significantly lower than the price of a similar service for staying in a hotel room.

    <p>  Vacationers at Argo Studios Malia Apart willingly describe in their reviews the resort infrastructure surrounding their hotel.  Malia is a coastal zone with the only main street - the promenade.  The latter has a rather cool look, let's say, non-provincial, with a European-style hospitable restaurant, disco and bar infrastructure.  Nearby is a sandy beach awarded the ‚ÄúBlue Flag‚Äù, abundantly provided with umbrellas and sunbeds, located in an ideally quiet bay, in which there are practically no storms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A street with bars and restaurants is essentially the only leisure area, and in the evenings a real full house begins.  The street at sunset turns from a car into a pedestrian, and then - into a real market.  On it, however (people part), motorcyclists and "ATV riders" ride.  There are a lot of such vehicles here. </p><p>  It's impossible to get hungry here: steakhouses with British and Mexican food;  American restaurant serving steaks and barbecue;  Greek taverns with Mediterranean cuisine, pubs with an abundance of beer - all these establishments open their doors synchronously and hospitably.  The resort of Malia is considered youth, and its central part, it seems, never falls asleep.  Crowds of young European people here constantly migrate from the beach to the bar, from the bar to the disco, and from there to the restaurant, to then repeat this cycle. </p>

    <p>  Regarding the shopping infrastructure, right next to the hotel, there are two inexpensive grocery stores within a 3-5-minute walk from it.  This is where you can buy food if you cook your own food in the kitchen. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The second-line hotel, Argo Studios Malia Apart (Crete), is attractive for vacationers with the thoughtful design of recreation areas: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Patented cool courtyard with greenery and flowers; </li><li>  cozy furnished terrace for relaxation and lounge; </li><li>  equipped relaxation area by a small but comfortable outdoor pool; </li><li>  a popular snack bar with billiards (sipping natural juices, good coffee and refreshing drinks). </li></ul><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  In the aparthotel, the interior architecture is predominantly studio.  The design of the apartment is dominated by white color (ceiling, walls).  It has high ceilings and wide euro windows.  There is plenty of natural light in the rooms.  The floor is tiled in wood, which is welcome during the summer heat. </p>

    <p>  The furniture is quite simple, unusual, but made of natural wood.  In general, the design of the apartments can be described as naturalistic minimalism: economically, accurately, inexpensively.  The bathroom is modern and comfortable enough.  It features a kitchen area (which we have already mentioned).  There is a small balcony with a pair of plastic chairs and a table made of the same material. </p><p>  Cleaning is not daily (unfortunately).  Guests have to clean up on their own every two days.  After all, while the apartments are clean, then everything is fine, but if you leave the crumbs, the ants will run.  Sheets and towels, judging by the reviews, washed, but not of the first freshness, however, this is the norm for a budget holiday in Crete. </p><p>  The hotel staff is friendly, responds promptly to requests and wishes. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  The beach is just a five minute walk from Argo Studios Malia Apart.  Reviews of hotel guests indicate that Malya is primarily kilometer-long sandy beaches, a gentle entrance to the water, and a clear turquoise sea.  Everyone here can find a beach for themselves: noisy, partyy, with an abundance of animators (this is closer to the center) or secluded, romantic (to get to it, you should use transport). </p>

    <p>  However, choosing the latter option, you should be wary of sea urchins and petrified sharp corals, so in this case it is recommended to purchase beach shoes.  Here there is a <span>pink beach,</span> which has just such a color due to the shells prevailing on it, as well as the famous Bounty beach, a photograph from which flaunts on a famous chocolate bar. </p><p>  Having chosen a paid beach, you should pay for the sunbeds (6 ‚Ç¨ per couple per day) and keep the check until the end of the day.  After all, having gone away to have a bite, thanks to the check, you will return to the beach and take your sunbeds again. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  What food options did Argo Studios Malia Apart prepare for its guests?  No meals (the cheapest), i.e. meals are not included in the tour price.  However, the hotel complex has an excellent cafe, quite popular in the area.  For a fee, the guest can order any diet for himself: board, half board or only breakfast.  The menu is Mediterranean.  Very tasty.  As we already mentioned, the cafe is popular in the area, so the chef buys unfrozen, fresh fish for cooking. </p><p>  Hotel guests in their reviews report prices from the menu of the taverns of Malia: </p><ul><li>  crab salad - 6 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  portion of spaghetti - 6-10 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  pasta with mussels - 6 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  meat dishes (one serving) - 8-10 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  Moussaka (vegetable casserole with cheese and meat) - 6-8 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  French fries - 2.5 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  a large portion of squid or mussels or shrimp - 12-18 ‚Ç¨; </li><li>  veal in sauce (very tasty) - 12 ‚Ç¨ </li></ul><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Without this way of spending time with guests of Argo Studios Malia Apart, its description would not be complete.  Really!  After all, most tourists visit Crete precisely because of excursions.  They can rather be called sightseers than holidaymakers.  Even a vacation on the Mediterranean Sea for them is presented as a rather pleasant supplement to a well-planned excursion program. </p>

    <p>  The second supermarket, built in the second line, is more suitable for buying souvenirs and light industry products.  If we talk about profitable purchases, then you should opt for gold and silver handmade products sold by local jewelers. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In a wonderful place in terms of climate, resort and excursion potential place (on the legendary Greek island of Crete) is the hotel Argo Studios Malia Apart.  Reviews of tourists indicate its growing popularity, especially among European youth.  Judging by the way young people from Britain, Germany, and France come here, the spirit of "a paradise for youth" is in the air in Malia.
