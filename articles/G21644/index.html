For example, if you need to pay taxes or check them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reissue option </h2><p>  How to get a duplicate TIN to an individual?  Is this real or not?  The answer is pretty easy. </p><p>  In Russia, you can re-issue or restore almost any document.  And a certificate of registration with the tax service as well.  Under such circumstances, a person will receive an established form marked "duplicate". </p><p>  There are various ways to recover a TIN certificate.  And not everyone knows how to use them.

To work with "State services" you must first register, and then - confirm the account.  If you want to order a document through the website of the Federal Tax Service, you will have to register in the "Personal Account of the taxpayer." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Personal Instruction </h2><p>  Where to get a duplicate TIN?  More answer to a similar question will not cause any difficulties.  And what to do in this or that case? </p><p>  To begin, consider the simplest scenario.  This is an independent appeal to the authorized services.  The instruction presented for attention can be considered universal.  It is suitable for the MFC, the Federal Tax Service, and the "one window" services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nsovetnik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="State duty for duplicate TIN" class="if uuid-2963013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2963013.jpg"></div><p>  Instructions for ordering a duplicate TIN in Russia are as follows: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a specific set of documents.  It is not too extensive, but sometimes people experience some difficulties at a similar stage. </li><li>  Write and fill out an application for issuing a duplicate TIN.  The form of the established form can be downloaded on the website of the Federal Tax Service, State Service or taken at any authorized body. </li><li>  Make payment for services on re-issuing a tax registration certificate.  Document recovery is not expensive.  But the initial receipt of the certificate is not subject to duties. </li><li>  Contact the authorized body with a request of the established form. </li><li>  Pick up a ready certificate of tax registration at the appointed time. </li></ol><p>  That doesn't sound too confusing.  But is it so easy to restore a tax registration certificate?  Or is everything simple in theory, but not in practice?  Yes, if you prepare for the operation in advance, you can achieve the desired result as soon as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Government services and orders </h2><p>  How to get a duplicate TIN to an individual?
