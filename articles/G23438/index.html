From the tourist complex to the private beach area, guests can walk in just 1-2 minutes. </p><p>  The infrastructure is well developed here, but the airport is relatively far away.  Antalya Havalimanƒ± (Antalya) is 70 kilometers away.  But in just 15 minutes by car you can get to Kemer, and in the same amount - to the ancient city of Olympos.  Also within 10-12 kilometers is the famous Burning Mountain Chimera, ski resort, Ulupynar and Cirali parks, as well as Moonlight Beach and Kemer Pier. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel itself is impossible not to notice.  It was built in 2004 on a vast landscaped area of ‚Äã‚Äã60,000 square meters.  m. Attention guests are invited to 531 rooms, of which 365 belong to the standard class.  There are also 49 family rooms, two King Suites, 10 apartments with a terrace, 32 non-smoking, 5 for disabled people and 38 luxury villas. </p><h2>  Service, facilities and infrastructure </h2><p>  The Queen Park Hotel in Tekirova (Kemer) is a well-known and presentable complex.  Accordingly, it has everything that should be in a 5-star hotel. </p><p>  The reception is open 24 hours a day, there is a luggage storage room, a tour desk, private parking and high-speed free Wi-Fi spreading throughout the complex. </p><p>  The hotel also has laundry, dry cleaning and ironing services.

She will sit with the child while the adults relax, and for the baby they can remain calm at the same time.

It is worth noting that there are still ‚Äústandards‚Äù with a view of the sea, but they cost slightly more (by 3-4 tons). </p><p>  Rooms with a private terrace deserve special attention.  They also belong to the category of standard.  The conditions are the same, the only difference is a huge terrace, and increased to 88 square meters.  m. area.

And the cost of living, of course. </p><p>  By the way, a week in a family room for three adults will cost 170,000 rubles.  If four guests settle, then you will have to pay 180 tons.

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Holidays at sea - this is why the vast majority of people decide to stay at the Queen Park Hotel (Tekirova).  The beach at the hotel is good - clean, well maintained, spacious, and also private.  It is covered with small pebbles, so that rest on it is comfortable.  The approaches are comfortable, the depth is normal.  The first five meters are shallow, but the farther you go, the lower the bottom.  You can feel the depth by going down to the water from the piers.  Either through a jump, or along one of the stairs. </p><p>  The beach of the hotel is fully adapted for vacationers.  There are tents and free sun loungers, which are enough for vacationers even in the midst of the summer season.  For those who want to have fun there are jet skis, boats, banana, paragliders and much more. </p><p>  Interestingly, the beach is divided into three zones.  One for ordinary vacationers, one for smokers, and a third for people with disabilities.  It is important to note that lifeguards and security are constantly working on the beach. </p><p>  It is definitely impossible to say something about water in the sea, because it changes during the year, as does the weather.  But in general, tourists are pleased with its cleanliness and temperature.  For some, she seems even too warm.  In this case, a huge hotel pool helps out.  It is deep and cool, because it does not have time to completely warm up due to the continuous cleaning system. </p><h2>  Criticism </h2><p>  People vacationing at the Queen Park Hotel (Tekirova) leave mostly positive reviews.  But there are some nuances that, according to vacationers, need a kind of "refinement". </p><p>  Most criticism comes from people going on vacation with children.  A menu designed for toddlers disappoints many.  Not quite diverse, in their opinion, although it includes yogurts, soups, cereals, desserts, nuggets, french fries, etc. </p><p>  Some still have comments on the playground.  It is, and not bad, but without coverage.  And yet there is no pool for babies aged 2 to 5 years.  One of the children's pools for them is too shallow (0.3 m), and the other is too deep (1.1 m).  And there are no small water slides either. </p><p>  By the cons, many still attribute the popularity of the hotel.  It sounds paradoxical, but it is.  The hotel is always full, so lovers of peace and quiet relaxation are unlikely to like it.  Also, due to the workload of the hotel, it is recommended to arrive for breakfast, lunch and dinner early, right at the opening.  In that case, if you want to eat in a more or less quiet and calm atmosphere, of course. </p><p>  And the last minus - after 22:00, parties and noisy discos begin on the territory.  The rooms are well insulated, so the problem is solved by closing the balcony and turning on the air conditioning.  But it was worth mentioning this nuance. </p>

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing? </h2><p>  Finally, it's worth talking about some organizational issues.  It is important to know that registration of new guests begins at 14:00, and departure lasts until noon.  This must be taken into account and tickets for flights that are most convenient and close to these temporary thresholds should be selected.  As mentioned earlier, the hotel is popular and almost always full.  Therefore, it is likely that, arriving at the hotel earlier than 14:00, you still have to wait. </p><p>  The second caveat - in this hotel accommodation for children under six years is free.  But only the baby, if the parents took him with them, will have to sleep on the full-size bed in the room, and not on the nursery. </p><p>  The third caveat - when booking, you must specify your credit card details.  This complex accepts only "Visa" and "Master Card".  Potential guest should use only his card.  After all, upon check-in, the administrator will require you to present it with your passport.  So the name must match. </p><p> The fourth nuance concerns the transfer.  The Queen Park Hotel (Tekirova) has a good location, but still it is a resort village, not a large city.  Getting on your own non-native will be difficult.  Transfer will be required anyway.  And, in order to avoid unnecessary fuss, you need to arrange this with the hotel in advance.  At least a week in advance, you must contact its representatives, provide information about the flight and the estimated time of arrival, so that the transfer can be arranged.  It will be reasonable. </p><p>  Well, enough has been said about the Queen's Park Hotel.  Based on all of the above, it can be stated that this is a worthy hotel complex.  Direct confirmation of this are the apartments booked in advance and the positive reviews of the guests.  And to make sure of the advantages of the hotel personally, you should go to it for a few days of vacation.  To regret it certainly will not have to. </p>
