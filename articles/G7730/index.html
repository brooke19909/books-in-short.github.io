Cancel the required length and fix the stops in a new place with pliers.  The excess part of the zipper is cut with scissors, leaving a few centimeters of stock.  Stock is formed by removing part of the cloves after the limiters. </li><li>  A less painstaking but not very aesthetic way is to cut off the excess part of the zipper.  The place of cut is fixed with a thread and a needle with ordinary stitches. </li><li>  If you need to remove a little from the length of the zipper, then cut off and do not need anything.

It can be several stitches that will be made with threads of the same color as the zipper itself. </li><li>  You can move higher and the limiter, which stands on the lightning itself.  It is easy to deform the bracket with pliers if you first pry it with a screwdriver. </li><li>  If the zipper has plastic teeth, then the limiter can be formed by reflowing the teeth at the desired length.  The rest is cut off with scissors. </li></ul><h2>  Secrets and nuances in the process of shortening </h2><p>  As you can see, all this is not difficult to do.
