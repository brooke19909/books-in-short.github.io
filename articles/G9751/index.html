    <p>  Many know the phrase of the famous writer Antoine de Saint Exupery.  At one time, he said that the most valuable thing in the world is the <span>luxury of human communication.</span>  This statement has not lost relevance today.  <span>Effective communication</span> between people, without a doubt, is one of the main success factors in many areas of human society.  It helps to make loyal and reliable friends, build a career, and achieve recognition and success.  Without effectively building such relationships through communication channels, all this becomes impossible. </p><h2>  Definition of a concept </h2><p>  What are communication channels?  The definition of this concept is important for the process <span>of information transfer.</span>  So, a communication channel is one or another means, using which, you can send a message from source to recipient.  The first of them sends this or that information, and the second receives it.  In this case, the recipient may be more than one.  So, during the presentation, the lecturer transfers information to an entire audience.  Moreover, the message may not be limited to text or sounds.  Often it includes intonations, gestures, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The development of communication in human society </h2><p>  Communication channels are real or imaginary lines of communication along which information flows.  At the same time, both the source and the subscriber need certain means for perception.  They are codes and languages, as well as technical devices. </p><p>  Means and channels of communication underwent changes with the development of human society.  Together with people, they went from the primitive system to the post-industrial civilization.  At the same time, not only the quantity changed, but also new types of communication channels arose.  Natural ways of transmitting information were gradually supplemented by artificial ones created for these purposes by people themselves. </p><h2>  Nonverbal and verbal channels </h2><p>  These types of information transfer are natural.  Non-verbal and verbal channels of communication use means that are naturally inherent in a person.  Thanks to this, the transmission of a semantic message becomes possible. </p><p>  Non-verbal (non-verbal) and verbal (verbal) are channels of social communication.  Moreover, the first of them is the oldest. </p>

    <p>  It arose in the process of biological evolution long before the appearance of man, when higher animals expressed their attitude to certain events with different emotions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Speaking or using the verbal communication channel is a hallmark of the human race.  For the appearance of this process, it was necessary to develop an articulatory system, form a special zone in the brain, etc. It is precisely in the absence of all these biological prerequisites that representatives of the animal world are unable to speak. </p><h2>  The emergence of artificial channels </h2><p>  With the development of human society, a need has formed for the transfer of information in the absence of direct contact between two or more subjects.  That is why artificial communication channels appeared.  The very first of them was the documentary.  It included jewelry and amulets, tattoos and symbols that have certain concepts ("tree", "beast", "woman", etc.).  Such primitive painting was the initial stage in the development of writing.  With its appearance, a new means of documentary communication channel arose.  Manuscripts over time were supplemented by printed literature and the press. </p><p>  Along with the development of the documentary channel of communication, verbal communication continued to improve.  She received at her disposal a telegraph, telephone, radio and television. </p><p>  Today, humanity has a huge selection of communication channels.  Social media of information transfer replenished with new inventions, and this is, first of all, computers. </p><h2>  Types of Social Communication </h2><p>  In modern society, the transfer of information is carried out on the basis of the channels and means of material and technical equipment used.  In this regard, the following types of social communication are distinguished: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Oral.  This communication uses both natural nonverbal and verbal channels, as well as means. </li><li>  Documentary.  This communication uses channels that were artificially created by man to transmit information.  These include print, writing, and visual arts that convey meaning in space and time. </li><li>  Electronic.  Its basis is wired and radio communications, computer technology, magnetic and optical recording tools. </li></ol><p>  All three types of social <span>methods of transmitting information</span> exist in unity with each other. </p><h2>  Verbal communication </h2><p>  The very name of this method of communication is its real content.  Oral communication, that is, "transmitted through the mouth," is not limited only to verbal interactions.  It is also carried out using the senses. <br>  That is why the structure of oral communication includes various ways and means that are its elements.  The most striking of them is speech.  It is capable of transmitting information of increased complexity.  The language of one or another people allows the use of ambiguous words and effective phrases.  In the process of such a message transfer, the effect of ‚Äúdescent of a compressed spring‚Äù often arises, that is, the transmission of a single concept or term causes the interlocutor to understand a large information volume. </p><p>  An important element of oral communication is the recipient's response.  She can be benevolent or hostile, active or passive, pretended, etc. </p><p>  In addition to verbal communication, an important element of oral communication is visual contact.  When transmitting simple information, he plays a greater role than the speech of the interlocutor.  Visual information, including gestures, postures and facial expressions, is needed to introduce emotional and sensual components into verbal communication.  An important element in this case is the concept of appearance.  Hence the proverb that says that every person is met by clothes.  And this is not surprising.  Indeed, in former times, clothing largely spoke of the estate belonging to the interlocutor.  Today, elements of a non-verbal image include not only branded clothing, but also watches, a car, a cell phone and more. </p><p>  In the process of oral communication, the social and landscape environment of the interlocutor is also entered.  This includes elements of the landscape, etc. </p><p>  So, oral communication is a complex interaction of subjects, the process of which includes all the senses, as well as intuitive and logical resources.  In addition, it is the basic way of transmitting information, without which all its other forms become impossible. </p><h2>  Documentary Communication </h2><p>  This is another type of messaging method.  Its main tool is a document, which includes a material stable object, created for use in social communication.  Its distinguishing features are: </p><ol><li>  The presence of meaning.  Only in this case, the communication of subjects becomes possible.  The message is meaninglessly referred to as noise. </li><li>  The presence of a stable material form, which serves to ensure the long-term preservation of the document.  What is "written by a pitchfork on water" does not belong to this category. </li><li>  Intended for use in communication channels.  These may be objects that were not originally documents.  This status was given to historical-cultural, ethnographic and archaeological artifacts later due to the presence of meaning in them, which can be deciphered and ‚Äúread‚Äù like a text. </li><li>  Completeness of the message enclosed in the document.  However, this requirement is relative in terms of unfinished literary works, sketches, sketches, drafts, etc., which at one time were written by great scientists, poets, artists. </li></ol><p>  Today, there is a certain typification of documents. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, it was developed based on their iconic form.  So, all documents are divided into: </p><ol><li>  Readable.  These include written works created in natural or artificial language. </li><li>  Iconic.  This view includes documents that carry images (drawings and paintings, photographs and movies, transparencies, etc.). </li><li>  Ideographic.  These are documents using symbols (maps and drawings, emblems and schemes, emblems, etc.). </li><li>  Character  These are objects related to material objects that perform documentary functions (historical relics, museum exhibits, architectural monuments). </li><li>  Auditory.  These are phonetic, sounding documents, as well as various kinds of sound recordings. </li><li>  Machine readable.  These include disks and magnetic tapes, punch cards, etc. </li></ol><p>  All listed types of documents are types of communication channels. </p><p>  Written text is also an integral part of business communication.  In other words, documents are the main communication channels for each of the existing organizations. </p><p>  Written genres of any company, as a rule, have legal competence.  That is why they are devoid of emotional and any other personal beginning.  But at the same time, documents are organization‚Äôs communication channels that have logicality and objectivity, clarity and semantic exhaustion, compositional orderliness, etc. The text of such a message is directed not only to report, prove, state, etc. It should carry the embodiment of an accepted standard. </p><h2>  Electronic communication </h2><p>  The 20th century was the period of the second technical revolution, as a result of which television and photo telegraph, computer communications and video appeared.  In the same period, e-mail arose, which by the end of the 90s had become the global communication system of the Internet.  All this is the next stage in the development of message passing methods.  It is characterized by the translation of information from oral and documentary forms into electronic. </p>

    <p>  Since its inception, a new type of messaging has been presented as a means of overcoming the distance between subjects.  In addition, it was planned to use the electronic communication channel as a repository of not only written, but also oral information.  This was an instrumental stage in the development of such communication.  It became possible in connection with the achievements of the scientific and technological revolution. </p><p>  When using electricity, the problem of speed in transmitting information was solved.  And if earlier the movement of radio waves occurred at the speed of light, then now the global exchange of messages is provided almost instantly.  At the same time, it allows you to convey oral and written speech, as well as the image.  In addition, electronic communication channels solved the problem of message storage, which allowed us to enter a new paperless stage in the development of social communications. </p><p>  At the intellectual stage of development, there has been a transition from quantitative changes in the transmission of messages to qualitative ones.  It was caused by the fact that the needs of society for the preservation and dissemination of texts began to exceed the capabilities possessed by the available technical means.  Mankind has needed new devices that would be able to store large amounts of information and transmit it over significant distances.  And they were created as a result of scientific and technological developments.  Today, communication channels include computer and expert systems, as well as word processors.  At the same time, artificial intelligence was connected to the process of transmitting information.  This allowed a person to entrust routine operations to the computer, requiring many repetitions and constant attention. </p><p>  At this stage, the personal and group communication needs of mankind are met through the use of the Internet.  This is a global computer network in which virtual space is created. </p><p>  The rapid development of electronic communication channels affects almost all spheres of human activity.  This includes <span>interpersonal communication,</span> and the work of enterprises, and the economy of countries as a whole. </p><h2>  Marketing communication </h2><p>  This method of transmitting information is used in all areas of activity, the purpose of which is to achieve successful sales to meet the needs of society. </p><p>  Marketing communication channels are used to create a positive image of an organization in the market.  Moreover, they are an effective tool in the marketing process.  As a result of such a transfer of information is made: </p><ul><li>  transmission of messages to target groups of the audience on the implementation of certain services or goods; </li><li>  creating a favorable attitude towards the company; </li><li>  formation of the image of the brand, allowing to arouse the confidence of customers; </li><li>  attracting new consumers. </li></ul><p>  Channels of marketing communication can be both external and internal.  Moreover, all of them are designed to transmit information from the manufacturer to the consumer in order to meet the needs of the company and profit from sales. </p>

    <p>  However, despite all the above characteristics, personal communication channels are not always used.  The reason for this is their negative side, the main one of which is the limited size of the audience. </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that personal are the most effective channels of communication in cases where it is necessary to establish relationships with people whose point of view is significant for society.  In other words, with ‚Äúopinion leaders‚Äù. </p><h2>  Media Channel Feature </h2><p>  There is another way of communication, which makes it possible to transmit messages to as many consumers as possible.  It is often used for marketing purposes.  This is the transmission of messages through mass communication channels.  Their main means are television and radio, outdoor advertising and the press, as well as the Internet.  All these are communication channels used to transmit information to the masses.
