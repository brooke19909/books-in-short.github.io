The climate here is sharply continental, that is, temperature jumps are observed throughout the year.  Due to the proximity to Lake Baikal (55 km), weak earthquakes are periodically observed. </p><p>  Irkutsk is an ancient city, built as a prison.  The date of foundation is 1661.  The settlement was badly damaged in 1716 and in 1879 due to fires, so it took many years to recover. </p><p>  Before the revolution, the city was a merchant, and in Soviet times - a place where political prisoners were exiled.  Today, the modern city is a scientific, industrial, educational and cultural center, with a population of just over 623 thousand people.  On the territory of the municipality there are several protected areas: </p><ul><li>  Botanical Garden; </li><li>  Kai relic grove; </li><li>  <span>Dendrological park</span> and others. </li></ul><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  The first ideas for creating the Botanical Garden <span>in Irkutsk</span> appeared at the end of the XIX century.  Then the plans were to remove the Jerusalem cemetery, and in its place to build a garden.  But multiple tragic events in the country postponed long-term plans for many years. </p><p>  The garden was opened only in 1940, when the laying of the first collections began.  During the war, the Botanical Garden in Irkutsk acted as a food base, then about 2 hectares were assigned for planting garden and vegetable crops.  However, this did not stop the introduction of plants. </p><p>  In 1964, the arboretum was laid on the territory of 7.2 hectares.  In 70 years.  XX century, the garden was transferred to the management of ISU, many researchers were reduced, so the number of collections has decreased significantly.  In difficult times for the whole country (1991-1992), the heating main broke through and more than 60% of the plants that were planted in the greenhouses died. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
