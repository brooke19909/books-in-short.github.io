That's just not so simple, but it is difficult for a small child to explain that drawing skills come with time and you should not be upset if the kitten‚Äôs legs are crooked the first time.  How to help the child learn to draw in order to less upset the baby? </p><p>  To do this, there are stencils for drawing.  This is a unique solution that opens up the world of art to the child and makes it simple in the early stages. </p><p>  With the help of stencils, the child will be able to create the contour of the desired pattern, and then paint it in those colors that, in his opinion, are more suitable or more like.  Stencils for drawing help to master the proportions of objects, which in the future can help the child reproduce the subject without outside help. </p><p>  Just imagine what you need to draw a kitten.  Not every adult will be able to correctly depict an animal that sees often enough.  What can we say about the child.  Stencils for drawing will help draw a cat, while only the outline will be depicted - the remaining details will need to be drawn independently.  From this begins the process of creating a child.  The cat needs to draw eyes and a nose, strike a couple of strips to get a beautiful antennae.  Well, of course, one should not forget that the kitten should be colored, which means that the child will have to color it on his own. </p><p>  Stencils for drawing do not do all the work for the child, they only lead him in the right direction.  The kid does not give up a creative lesson at first due to the fact that nothing happens, but continues to circle various pictures. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not forget that drawing stencils teach children to circle smoothly.  It may not seem funny, but the child, due to excessive efforts and the desire to do everything right, inept fingers are very naughty, so the pencil often breaks and spoils even the outline.  For this reason, stencils allow you to gain confidence and direct the child to continue working. </p><p>  Stencils for drawing teach another useful skill - the skill of creating a composition.  When the child has several different stencils, he can depict all the objects in a single picture, but for this he will need to put the house on one side and the cow on the other.  Such a skill cannot be immediately opened, but with constant training it will be easier for a child to place desired objects on a sheet, creating not just separate pictures, but turning everything into a solid work. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that there are a variety of sets of stencils for drawing.  For example, holiday stencils for drawing: new year, birthday, March 8, February 23, all in one box.  You can not only draw pictures, but also group them according to the holiday.  This will allow the child to distinguish one event from another. </p><p>  Younger children are advised to purchase animal stencils for drawing.  Kids are more interested in tinkering with different animals, so such an activity will entice them for a long time, and cartoons do not have to be included. </p><p>  In general, there is no need to prove that drawing stencils are very useful for the development and self-affirmation of children.  Parents should take care of the development of the children, but do it unobtrusively and wonder what becomes easy when the child gets involved in art.  Starting to create pictures using stencils, later it will be easier to draw amazing paintings yourself.  You will not have to wait long for the child to ask for watercolors, oil and other, more complex artistic delights.  So a brilliant artist can be grown with the help of a light passion for drawing stencils. </p>
