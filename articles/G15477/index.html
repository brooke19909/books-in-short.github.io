Having considered her request, it was decided to acquire the state ownership of the house in which Sergey Alexandrovich Yesenin was born and lived. </p><p>  The museum in Konstantinovo was organized shortly after the death of the poet in 1926 in the form of a reading room.  Help in the maintenance and organization of the exhibition dedicated to the poet was provided by the poet's sister.  The Union of Soviet Writers took charge of the hut-reading room.  He undertook to provide the museum with literature and necessary materials.  A little later, a rural library was organized in the parent house of Sergei Yesenin, which became incredibly visited. </p><p>  In order to look at how the great Russian poet lived, where he was born, you need to visit the Esenin Museum-Reserve.  <span>Konstantinovo (village)</span> became famous precisely thanks to him.  For example, in the summer of 1964, more than ten thousand tourists visited it. </p>

    <h2>  Museum opening </h2><p>  On the occasion of the 70th birthday of the poet, it was decided to organize a memorial museum in Konstantinovo.  Initially, it was a branch of the Ryazan Museum of Local Lore, which helped everyone to touch the fate of the poet, to better understand his work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Yesenin estate is located in the very center of the village.  This short house is the heart of the museum.  Everything in him is now as it was then, when Yesenin lived there. <br>  The museum in Konstantinovo is decorated with a wooden bed with a quilt by the window, a chest with books of favorite writers, a mother's fur coat on a hanger, family photographs and a commendation sheet for academic success and excellent behavior were placed on the walls. </p>

    <p>  The garden adjoins the Yesenin's house.  There is a hut in it, in which the Yesenins were forced to live after a fire. </p><p>  The sisters of Sergei Yesenin provided a lot of valuable information about the life of the family, providing invaluable assistance to the museum.  It was impossible to organize it without the help of a huge number of people who bit by bit collecting everything related to his beloved poet, as the first director of the museum V.I. </p><p>  Not far from the memorial museum is the two-story Kashin mansion, where Esenin loved to be during his lifetime.  Since 1969, a literary museum in memory of the poet has been working in it.  His value are the manuscripts of the poet, books and documents. </p><h2>  "Yesenin Russia" </h2><p>  In 2015, a lot of work was done.  The building and the surrounding area have been restored.  The work was carried out on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the museum and the 120th anniversary of the birth of Sergei Yesenin. </p><p>  The museum in Konstantinovo was at the center of the celebrations dedicated to the memory of the great Russian poet. </p>

    <p>  The place where Sergei Yesenin lived, the museum in Konstantinovo, and the village itself are now objects of cultural heritage.  The repair of buildings in this village is subject to special requirements.  Indeed, on the one hand, it is a modern settlement, on the other, the birthplace of the poet Sergei Yesenin, which he did not tire of singing in his poems. </p><p>  The goal of the Eseninskaya Rus project is to preserve the beautiful views of this place and the natural landscape.  Leave it as it was during the life of the poet. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Where is the village of Konstantinovo, Yesenin Museum?  How to get to historical places?  These questions worry many who want to get closer to the poet.  From Moscow from the Kazan station you can take a train to the station.  Fish, and from there by bus to Ryazan.  A <span>bus</span> runs from <span>Ryazan bus station</span> several times a day to the village of Konstantinovo. </p>
