    <p>  Almost every office, even the smallest one, is currently equipped with such a necessary machine as a fax machine.  With it, copies of various documents are sent, ranging from important contracts to various images.  Most often, faxing is entrusted to one person, mainly the secretary, who receives or sends various documents, monitors the performance of the machine, including controls the availability of paper in the appropriate compartment.  But what if the person whose responsibilities it is to receive and send fax copies temporarily departed, and you were asked to look after the machine and at that time the phone rang.  Of course, you will have to pick up the phone and at the other end of the line you are asked to receive documents, but you don‚Äôt know how to use a fax ... Most people are ashamed to say this only because they don‚Äôt want their interlocutor to think about the lack of education.  Although to know everything in the world is simply physically impossible. </p><p>  We imagined such a situation and probably really wanted it to never happen to you?  Then I advise you in advance to learn how to use a fax machine if you work in the office.  If such a need suddenly arises, you will cope with the difficulty and brilliantly exit the current situation. </p><p>  If you need to accept documents, then pay attention to the device panel.  As a rule, there is a big key on it, most often green.  On it, depending on the model of the device, ‚ÄúStart‚Äù or ‚ÄúStart‚Äù can be written.  When you click on this button, a characteristic signal should sound, you will stop hearing the interlocutor, and the reception of the document will begin.  Congratulations - you pressed the right button.  The result of your activity will be a copy of the document on facsimile paper, which, by agreement of the parties, may have legal force.  If, in spite of the characteristic squeaking of a fax, you still do not have a contract in your hands, perhaps your paper has just run out of paper.  Then you need to open the top cover of the machine, under which you will see what sequence of actions you need to perform to replace the empty tube with a new roll of paper.  Pay attention to the appearance of red bars in the resulting document.  This means that few meters of facsimile paper are left and it is worth replacing it right now, so as not to make partners wait in the future when it ends when you receive an important contract. </p><p>  If you need to send a document, then first you need to fill it into the corresponding groove.  Typically, a manufacturer takes care of its users and provides images of how to work with faxing.  The main thing you should pay close attention to is which side you are inserting the sheet into the hole.  It is very important that the document that you send to partners lies face down, that is, the information you send must be on the bottom of the sheet.  It is this image that the receiving side will receive.  After that, dial the number of the subscriber to whom you will send a copy of the document, talk about the purpose of your call and ask to receive a fax.  For those who know how to use a fax, the phrase ‚ÄúStart‚Äù will be understood without words.  For a beginner, it may even seem ridiculous, but it just means that your interlocutor has pressed the "Start" key, and you need to do the same.  After that, the device will begin to accept the document attached to it, converting the information on paper to electronic form.  At the other end of the wire, your interlocutor will perform the inverse conversion.  If everything went well, you can hang up. </p><p>  Now you know how to use a fax, and you can easily accept and send documents without too much difficulty. </p>
