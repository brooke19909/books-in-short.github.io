  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of Tartaria: foundation, years of existence, interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, more and more information appears on the history of Tartaria.  This is a fictitious state, which, according to supporters of an alternative history, was the ancestral home of the Slavic race.  It is assumed that it existed in the XVI-XIX centuries, but was later erased from history as a result of conspiracies of opponents of Russian identity.  Allegedly, at present, all eminent scientists are hiding this truth from everyone. </p><p>  The main evidence for the existence of this state is maps and old books that really mention Great Tartaria.  Under it, cartographers and historians of that time meant the territories of Siberia, the Volga region, Tibet, Central Asia and the Far East right up to the borders with China.  Accordingly, depending on the time period, in fact, the Great Tartary was different states, including the Golden Horde, the Mongol Empire and many others. </p><h2>  How did the version come about? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="derzhava.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolay Levashov" class="if uuid-3012947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012947.jpg"></div><p>  They began to actively discuss the history of Tartaria with the filing of the Russian publicist and writer Nikolai Levashov, the author of the nationalist neopagan occult teaching.  At various times, he called himself a healer and a member of four public academies.  The media has repeatedly described himself as the founder of a totalitarian cult known as the "Renaissance. Golden Age."  In particular, he wrote the book "Russia in Crooked Mirrors", which in the Russian Federation was recognized as extremist for imposing a negative on Jews, the indirect incitement of religious hatred. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Levashov himself died in 2012 at the age of 51.  For the first time he spoke about the history of the state of Tartary in his article "The Hidden History of Russia."  In it, he cites as an experiment a map from the British Encyclopedia for 1771, on which, among other countries well-known to everyone, several Tartaria are present at once, including Moscow, Chinese, Kuban, Mongolian.  Levashov considered that all these are the remnants of the once Great Tartary. </p><p>  According to him, the capital of this empire was destroyed by the hordes of the Dzungars, which was facilitated by Dmitry Donskoy, starting, in Levashov‚Äôs opinion, a civil war against Mamaia.  Similar conspiracy theological versions have already been expressed.  For example, the head of the new neo-pagan religious association "The Old Russian Church of the Orthodox Old Believers-Inglings" by Alexander Khinevich in the early 90's.  In 2004, the Omsk Regional Court banned the activities of its religious community, considering it extremist.  In 2014, he was accused of inciting religious and ethnic hatred. </p><p>  Soon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe history of the state of Tartaria gained some fame in some circles.  As the main arguments of this theory, its supporters always give ancient maps on which this state is mentioned.  Then, the descriptions of the tartars are compared with the Russians, concluding that they are one and the same people.  In some cases, modern words are translated into the ancient parent language, revealing additional meanings in them. </p><h2>  How did the Europeans learn about Tartaria? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="geogen-mir.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alternative history of Tartaria" class="if uuid-3012948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012948.jpg"></div><p>  Acquaintance of the Europeans with the Mongols took place around the 13th century.  Soon, Asians began to be associated with everything bad that could only be in this world, from where the association with demons from Tartarus was born.  European historians of that time soon began to compare the Mongols with the messengers of hell.  The Holy Roman Emperor <span>Frederick II of Hohenstaufen</span> draws these analogies in his letter to the English king Henry III, who ruled from 1216 to 1272. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that the negative connotation to the Mongols was not immediately attached.  When the Europeans first learned about their conquests in Asia, they decided that this was the army of the legendary Christian presbyter John, so they even expected him to help in the war against the Saracens.  In 1221, the bishop of Acre, Jacques de Vitry, even distributed documents, claiming that these were King David‚Äôs reports from intelligence officers from East Turkestan. </p><p>  Thus, he tried to realize the rumors that the Mongols are also Christians.  Confirmation that the Mongols at that time was perceived as co-religionists can also be found in Alberic de Tru-Fontaine, when he describes the battle of Kalka.  However, even then, the chronicler expressed some doubts that the Mongols really have at least some relation to Christianity. </p><p>  By that time, most likely, in Europe, the Tatars were transforming, as the Mongols called then, into ‚Äútartar,‚Äù as well as their identification with an unknown and distant kingdom of the same name, which is located in the Asian region that has not yet been studied by Europeans. </p><p>  Interestingly, in the XVII-XVIII centuries, travelers and missionaries began to write with surprise that in reality there are only Tatars, as they call themselves.  In Poland, Russia, Turkey and the rest of Asia, there are only concepts of the "Tatars" and "Tatars."  For example, such messages can be found in the Information on Siberia and the Way to China, compiled by the missionary F. Avril in 1686, as well as in the New Geographical Description of the Great Tataria, made by the Swedish captain Philip Johann von Stralenberg in 1730. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, some Europeans were aware of the correct pronunciation in the XIII century.  For example, the Chronograph Salimbene of Parma indicates this.  The term "Tatars" is also used by Heinrich of Latvia in the Livonian Chronicle, describing the battle of Kalka. </p><h2>  How did they hide the whole continent? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the state of Tartaria" class="if uuid-3012945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012945.jpg"></div><p>  This rhetorical question is regularly asked by numerous followers of Levashov and his ideas, discussing the history of Tartaria.  Based on the very same British Encyclopedia of 1771, they note that as early as the end of the 18th century, all of Siberia was formed as an independent state with its capital in Tobolsk. </p><p>  At the same time, the existence of Moscow Tartaria is also noted, which, allegedly according to the same encyclopedia, was the largest country in the world at that time.  What is the secret then of the history of Tartaria, where did such a huge state go? </p><p>  Proponents of conspiracy theories say that in order to answer this question, it is necessary to rethink many facts that prove that until the end of the 18th century a gigantic state existed on the territory of modern Eurasia, which was excluded from world history only in the 19th century.  It was then, allegedly as a result of a large-scale conspiracy, that everyone pretended that such a country never existed. </p><p>  As evidence, quotes from the very encyclopedia Britannica of 1771, citing the country of Tartaria and its history, are cited.  In particular, it is written that this is a huge state in the northern part of Asia, which borders on Siberia in the west and north.  Moreover, there are different tartars: </p><ul><li>  Those that live south of Siberia and Muscovy are called Circassian, Astrakhan and Dagestan. </li><li>  Living in the northwest of the Caspian Sea - Kalmyk. </li><li>  Inhabitants to the north of India and Persia - by the Mongols and Uzbek tartars. </li><li>  In the northwest of China, Tibetan tartars settled. </li></ul><p>  Moreover, in this edition there is no mention of the Russian Empire.  But it is written that the largest country in the world is Great Tartaria, which occupies the area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost all of Eurasia.  The principality of Moscow, in which the Romanovs had already ruled by that time, is supposedly only one of the provinces of this empire, called the Moscow Tartaria.  In evidence, maps of Asia and Europe are presented on which this information is confirmed. </p><p>  It is surprising that already in the next edition of the British Encyclopedia, any information about that state is completely absent, which is one of the main arguments of the supporters of conspiracy theories in support of their ideas. </p><h2>  Modern sources </h2><div class="photo" data-original="alexmyll65.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of tartaria" class="if uuid-3012944" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012944.jpg"></div><p>  About what happened to this powerful state, many versions are being put forward today.  Most of them are presented in the work "Tartaria - the history of the disappeared state" from the cycle "Kryon of Russia".  It tells about the beginning of a new civilization, the awakening of a sleeping city, the multidimensional genome of mankind.  The article "Tartaria - the history of a disappeared state" is carefully studied and analyzed, while it is worth recognizing that most of the facts presented in it do not correspond to reality and ideas of modern science about the world. </p><p>  Siberian researcher Sergei Ignatenko has a series of documentaries telling about the forbidden history of Tartaria.  In particular, the author claims that they are based solely on documentary and official materials, putting forward their own versions of the history of our country.  He has mention and work "Tartaria - the history of a disappeared state."  The series consists of four paintings: </p><ul><li>  The first film of the Forbidden Story series about Tartaria.  It tells what was written about this state in the books of authoritative European historians, how the people who lived there dressed and looked, what reports were published by travelers on the basis of their visits.  In the series "Forbidden History of Russia", 1 part about Tartaria is of most interest to the audience. </li><li>  In the second film, Ignatenko talks about the mysterious people of miracles, trying to establish what is the difference between Tatars and Tartars, as well as what relation the miracles have to dinlin. </li><li>  The third film tells about Yermak‚Äôs campaign in Siberia.  The main questions posed by the researcher: with whom he fought when he reached Siberia, who Yermak himself was, even analyzes whether he participated in the atomic war. </li><li>  Finally, the fourth series, entitled ‚ÄúThe Development of Siberia in the 19th Century‚Äù, tells about when, in reality, Siberia was mastered by the Russian Empire. </li></ul><p>  It is in the documentary "The Forbidden History of Siberia-1. Great Tartaria" that the majority of hypotheses that exist about this mythical state are given. </p><h2>  Travel Marco Polo </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.history.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Marco polo" class="if uuid-3012950" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012950.jpg"></div><p>  As proof of this theory, even the works of Marco Polo, in which he describes his many travels, are cited.  In particular, the books on the history of Tartaria contain the 1908 English-language edition of his travels. </p><p>  For example, it is alleged that it is almost entirely devoted to the very Tartaria, its rulers and provinces, laws and orders, life and organization of government, the description of the habits of its inhabitants.  The same information can be found in the Russian translation, with the difference that instead of ‚Äútartars‚Äù it refers to ‚ÄúTatars‚Äù, and the word ‚Äúmogul‚Äù is generally excluded from the text. </p><p>  As a result, the elite and color of the most powerful, large, progressive and wealthy state of the time of the Italian traveler turned into ignorant, wild and bloodthirsty nomads of the Tatar-Mongols.  Moreover, this transformation occurred recently, only at the beginning of the 20th century, when they began to actively rewrite the real history of Tartaria. </p><p>  Interestingly, the researchers studied in detail the editorial notes of the traveler, finding the mention of Tartaria in earlier lists.  The country of Tartaria and its history is of such great interest today, because it completely changes the modern understanding of the structure of the world in those days.  For example, at Polo you can find that the Tartars do not destroy the cities that they capture, do not kill their inhabitants, but appoint them wise rulers who contribute to the prosperity and full-scale development of these areas. </p><p>  If you believe these sources, it turns out that the Tartars, which in the modern interpretation we call the Tatar-Mongols, did not come to new lands with the aim of killing and robbing local residents.  On the contrary, they sought to restore order, obliged the townspeople to do this, tried to ensure the safety of travelers where it was possible. </p><p>  It is important that the concept of "Mughals", which were replaced by "Mongols", was completely removed from the alternative history of Tartaria.  Unlike the latter, the Mughals are Scythians, Tartars and Slavs.  The same Marco Polo wrote that the Mughals are the Tartar royal dynasty.  It turns out that the rulers of all regions of this state were members of the same family, called themselves Mughals. </p><p>  Describing the appearance, the traveler clearly indicates that they were representatives of the white race, regardless of where they lived: in China, Turkestan, India or other areas of Great Tartaria. </p><h2>  State foundation </h2><p>  The Hidden History of Tartaria is another documentary of the Secret Territories project that aired on REN TV.  He came out with the subtitle "Ancient China. Reality."  In particular, the Hidden History of Tartaria states that it was the representatives of this people who played a decisive role in the construction of the Great Wall of China.  Allegedly, this is confirmed by recent archaeological discoveries. </p><p>  Based on this, we can conclude that the history of Tartaria is ancient.  At the same time, it is not possible to establish at least approximately when the first mention of it appeared.  In the film "Tartaria - the history of the disappeared state" it is noted that already in the XI century they recall him after several centuries of oblivion. </p><p>  All this confirms the fact that already in the V-VII centuries this state not only existed, but also had its own Christian rulers.  On this basis, we can conclude that Presbyter John, about whom Marco Polo writes, was the next Tartar king, who had in his subordination a certain number of countries and states. </p><p>  Proponents of the true chronology of the history of Tartaria believe that Genghis Khan in the XII century became the first Tartar king of the non-Christian faith. </p><p>  As a result, it is argued that the Scythians that existed in ancient times did not disappear anywhere, remaining to live on approximately the same lands as before, only becoming tartars.  They had paramilitary groups (hordes) that were most likely distributed throughout Tartaria, no matter how large it was at that time.  Their members were involved in keeping order, collecting tribute, that is, in fact, an analogue of income tax.  Marco Polo also mentions him, speaking of tithing. </p><h2>  Hidden truth </h2><div class="photo" data-original="topwar.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Anatoly Fomenko" class="if uuid-3012946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012946.jpg"></div><p>  In the series The Forbidden History of Russia, the authors ponder a lot about Tartary, in particular, trying to understand why no one is telling the truth about it in modern history lessons.  According to the most common version, the reason lies not even in hiding the glorious historical roots of our ancestors, but in the fact that during a certain period of history, a war was fought to exterminate the peoples of Tartaria by the Moscow principality. </p><p>  Allegedly, the Muscovites exterminated the original settlers, and those who survived were driven away on a reservation.  Then it becomes obvious what is hidden from us in the history of Tartaria.  If you believe this hypothesis, then the history of modern Russia is built on the blood of a foreign people. </p><p>  The history of Russia with Tartaria is closely connected.  It says a lot about the atrocities and sufferings that the Tatar-Mongols brought to our land.  They kept Russians under oppression for three centuries, but still survived.  Proponents of an alternative story believe that the situation developed exactly the opposite.  Based on the works of the most famous domestic alternative historian Anatoly Fomenko, some come to the conclusion that it was the Muscovites who destroyed Tartaria. </p><p>  For example, this version is set forth in Fomenko's New Chronology.  This is a pseudoscientific theory of a radical revision of world history, which has been categorically rejected by the scientific community.  In it, the author claims that the entire historical chronology is fundamentally wrong: the written history of mankind is much shorter than is commonly believed, the states of Antiquity, the early Middle Ages, and especially ancient civilizations are nothing more than phantom reflections of much later cultures that were inscribed due to biased or erroneous interpretation of sources. </p><p>  The history itself, according to the authors of the concept, practically did not exist until the 10th century AD.  According to them, in the Middle Ages there was a gigantic empire with a political center on the territory of Russia, which covered almost all of Asia and Europe, and according to some sources, even both of America.  The contradictions with well-known and documented facts are explained by the global falsification of historical documents. </p><p><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> So, one of the arguments in favor of the existence of a giant world empire in the Middle Ages, which was ruled by Russian khans, is the fact that on Western European maps until the beginning of the 19th century significant territories of Asia were designated as Tartaria. </font></font></p><p> Interestingly, this theory is largely based on the ideas of the scientist and Russian revolutionary Nikolai Alexandrovich Morozov, who proposed a global revision of the chronology of world history.  His hypothesis was very popular at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, where Fomenko studied.  It was promoted at that time by the doctor of physical and mathematical sciences, the Lenin Prize laureate Mikhail Mikhailovich Postnikov. </p><p>  The initial version of the history of Russia and Tartaria was formulated by Fomenko in the early 80s, since 1981 he began to develop the theory together with another Russian mathematician Gleb Vladimirovich Nosovsky, who became the co-author of most of Fomenko's books. </p><p>  It is worth recognizing that in the 90s it turned into a large-scale commercial project.  By 2011 alone, more than a hundred books were published with a total circulation of about 800 thousand copies. </p><h2>  Falsification of history? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="investxp.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="New chronology" class="if uuid-3012949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3012949.jpg"></div><p>  Those who believe in the history of Tartaria and its collapse, strive in every possible way to explain why this empire was virtually wiped off the face of the Earth. </p><p>  Some even call it the "Silent Empire."  The article "Tartaria, or how <span>history is falsified"</span> states that over the past few centuries, Western historians who were outspoken Russophobes mainly wrote about the domestic past.  Allegedly, they could not allow the truth to be revealed about the true role of the Slavic peoples in world history. </p><p>  If in all documents until the XVIII century Tartaria is called a powerful empire with developed shipping, industry, mining of precious metals, fur trade, then from the beginning of the XVIII century this information is carefully extruded from all documents. </p><p>  According to some historians, in ancient times there was a great confrontation between two powerful empires - the Holy Roman and Great Tartar.  The first was built on the Anglo-Saxon Western world, and the second - on the Slavic peoples.  Moreover, the palm belonged to the tartars, in which the Europeans were actually in the position of vassals.  This situation persisted for several centuries. </p><h2>  Empire sunset </h2><p>  Why Great Tartaria disappeared is still not known.  There are several reasons and explanations for this. </p><p>  According to some researchers, the blame was a sharp cooling.  It is worth recognizing that severe climate change often led to the economic decline of the most developed civilizations. </p><p>  Others are confident that this was due to corruption and internecine confrontations that actually destroyed the empire‚Äôs economy.  In any case, supporters of the existence of this state insist that our ancestors were much more cultured than is commonly believed today.  And the real contribution of the Slavs to scientific and cultural progress is still not appreciated. </p><h2>  The most exotic version </h2><p>  Finally, there is a completely exotic version that explains the fate of this state.  For example, some researchers claim that the empire could die as a result of nuclear bombing. </p><p>  In the writings of these fans of alternative history, one can find references to the fact that the situation in the state began to deteriorate radically at the end of the 18th century (according to the modern calendar).  It was then that the Tartars succumbed to the corrupting and destructive influence of monotheism, in particular, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  The population of the European part of Great Tartaria actually plunged into the abyss of aggressive and religious wars, riots, political intrigues, feuds and revolutions. </p><p>  In this version, Great Tartaria is considered the largest state that has ever existed on the planet.  Its natural boundaries extend to all, without exception, the Northern Hemisphere, limited only to ocean coasts.  As a result, the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic oceans (three of the four available) were actually its inland waters. </p><p>  Under the onslaught of world religions, only part of the once great empire withstood the faith of its ancestors and moral purity.  As a result, between the so-called plagued Western lands and the metropolis, the border ran from the Indian to the Arctic Ocean, along the shores of the Caspian Sea, the Ural Mountains. </p><p>  Unsuccessfully for Tartaria there was a war between Muscovy and Britain.  After a series of crushing defeats, she was forced to admit the loss of a significant part of her territories.  In particular, in the Northern Caspian Sea, in the Southern Urals, in North-East and Central India, in South-West Siberia, on the east coast of North America. </p><p>  Proponents of this hypothesis are convinced that in our time the episodes related to this war, which can be considered world-wide in its scope and the number of affected territories and peoples, are known as the development of Siberia.  He was accompanied by the uprising of Emelyan Pugachev in the XVIII century.  Also included is the war for the independence of the British colonies and the United States of America, the colonization of India.  In reality, they believe, all these were parts of one global military confrontation. </p><p>  But even after this, the Great Tartaria by the beginning of the 19th century remained the strongest and largest state in the world.  Adherents of alternative history do not believe that a defeat in a world war could destroy such a powerful and great power.  If only because the people who inhabited the empire only two hundred years ago were completely homogeneous and united.  Therefore, not a single domestic crisis could lead to the collapse of Great Tartaria.  Locals spoke the same language, were of the same nationality and religion.  This situation persisted from Tibet to Novaya Zemlya and from Alaska to the Urals. </p><p>  The only option that seems to them a reasonable and realistic explanation for the death of this empire is the extermination of the whole people into a single person.  But at that time it was beyond the power of any state in the world.  It is believed that the famous military commander Alexander Suvorov, who participated in the defeat of Pugachev and personally brought him to the capital, could inflict a major defeat on the Tartar troops. </p><p>  If you believe this very exotic version, the tartars were finally destroyed in February 1816.  Later it was called "a year without summer," and official modern science considers the beginning of the small ice age, which lasted three years. </p><p>  In March, frosts persisted in North America.  Rains and hail in April and May, coupled with cold weather, destroyed almost the entire crop.  Strong storms tormented Germany, there was a crop failure on the whole planet, therefore already in 1817 grain prices in Europe rose 10 times.  Famine began. </p><p>  It is believed that the clue to this three-year-old cold was discovered by the American explorer Humphreys, who linked climate change to the eruption of Tambora volcano on Sumbawa island.  This hypothesis is generally accepted by modern science.  Although some strongly do not understand how a volcano in the southern hemisphere could affect the climate in the northern. </p><p>  Moreover, although Europe and America were starving, no cataclysms occurred in Russia.  Alternative historians explain this by the fact that, in fact, it was not possible to find out about troubles due to strict censorship.  An indirect confirmation of this is the age of forests, which does not exceed two hundred years.  This means that all of them were destroyed then. </p><p>  Another evidence is karst lakes, common in Russia.  They are perfectly round in shape, and their diameter coincides with the size of the funnels from airborne nuclear explosions.  It is also noted that it was in the 19th century that cancer diseases appeared that came from nowhere. </p><p>  They note that even the fire that destroyed Moscow during the Patriotic War of 1812, as well as the diseases that followed it, too remind of the events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that occurred a century and a half later. </p><p>  It is noted that the majority of the population of the Great Tataria burned out during atomic explosions, the survivors died of cancer and radiation sickness.  Allegedly, the initiators first used the nuclear stockpile against Napoleon, and then, having convinced themselves of its effectiveness, they also used it for the final solution of the Tartar issue. </p>
