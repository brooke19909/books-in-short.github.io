    <p>  Despite the colorful description of the hotel, hotel reviews are not so optimistic.  Guests complain about dilapidated furniture, leaking taps, inoperative household appliances.  Travelers noted dirt near the pools and in the restaurant.  Room cleaning was also of poor quality. </p><p>  In July, the number of rooms booked exceeds the number of rooms available.  Hence the mass of dissatisfied customers.  They are placed in other hotels.  The staff is almost not fluent in English.  Nobody knows Russian.  Everyone speaks Turkish.  The maids and waiters do not wear uniforms.  Employees are rarely at their jobs.  They can easily fall apart on the couch and talk with friends in the lobby or restaurant. </p><p>  Requests vacationers ignored.  Breakdowns in rooms are eliminated after numerous reminders.  The attitude is indifferent, sometimes rude.  Cooks enter into an open confrontation with visitors, behave aggressively and defiantly. </p><p>  For many, it turned out to be an unpleasant surprise that the Internet in the rooms was paid.  Open access was only in the lobby and in the courtyard of the hotel.  Instead of single occupancy, they practice the settlement of two vacationers in one room.  It is almost impossible to get the number indicated in the ticket.  The Turks paid for the apartments paid by the Russians.  Some for a week, others for a day. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  In Mahmutlar itself, there is nothing to see.  Travelers walk in the municipal park.  It has a lot of exotic flowers.  There are benches and fountains.  In the evenings, Barbaros Avenue becomes especially noisy and crowded.  Street artists and musicians are loudly and expressively inviting customers. </p><p>  Craftsmen lay out their "treasures" right on the sidewalk.  In their collections are coins, crafts made from pumpkins, wood, metal and textiles.  Do not flatter yourself, these things can not claim authenticity and originality.  These are just fakes that cost a penny.  Therefore, bargain, and if in doubt, pass by. </p><p>  Any sightseeing tour begins on the banks of the Dimchay River.  It carries its crystal waters from the high peaks.  In the midst of rains, her meek character is replaced by a stormy disposition.  Its current sweeps everything in its path, carrying trees, bushes and colossal boulders torn to the sea into the sea.  A surprisingly tasty trout is found in the river.  The dishes from her meat have a delicate texture and a bright aroma. </p><p>  The cost of visiting the remains of the fortress of Mamur with a tour of the ruins of the ancient settlement Anamurium is $ 250.  The price is for a group of four adults.  You can arrange your travel dates at the hotel reception or at the travel agency. </p>
