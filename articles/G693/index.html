  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to activate iPhone yourself</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mobile phones and personal computers are as much an integral part of the life of a modern person as twenty years ago cassette recorders or radios.  Of course, the complexity of the functional variety and the technology of those times and the current can not be compared, but analogies can be drawn.  And as music lovers once cherished audio tapes, glued them themselves, repaired the tape of their tape recorders, now craftsmen reanimate cell phones, reflash them, rarely turning to specialized service centers for help. </p><p>  IPhones are one of the first places in popularity among smartphones of the latest generations.  Therefore, how to <span>activate an iPhone,</span> it is useful to find out both its current owners and those who plan to become a happy owner in the near future. </p><p>  Activation is the process of connecting the phone to the appropriate cellular network and using the full variety of its operations and capabilities.  Usually done once.  Activation is carried out either when buying a phone, or when the <span>iphone firmware</span> changes - instead of its ‚Äúnative‚Äù, factory installed another, more suitable for the owner.  You need to activate the mobile phone so that it ‚Äúsees‚Äù the inserted SIM card, and is able to recognize the mobile operator.  Before activating an iPhone, you can only call emergency service subscribers from it - fire, ambulance, etc. </p><p>  Step-by-step instruction </p><p>  Activate the cell yourself without improvised means will not work.  To start the process and bring it to the desired result, you need to have a computer with Internet access, an operating system based on Windows ("seven", "pig" or "whist" - whoever has it), Apple‚Äôs special iPhone application downloaded from Ineta (called iTunes).  The application is free, it downloads without problems.  True, the antivirus program on your computer may not let it through, therefore it is better to disable the antivirus program at the time of work. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So how to activate an iPhone: </p><ul><li>  charge the phone, insert a SIM card into it and enter a PIN code, if required; </li><li>  A USB cable should go with the phone (if there is no "native" cable, you need to select it in advance with a suitable input connector).  This cable connects the phone and the computer.  iTunes and the smartphone are connected automatically, the corresponding message on the phone screen will inform about the connection; </li><li>  Next is the activation process, the program does everything by itself.  It remains only to follow the inscriptions and pictures flickering on the screen.  The end of the procedure will also accordingly be indicated by an inscription, then the phone screen will display the desktop.  Then it will be possible to disconnect the computer and the mobile phone by disconnecting the cable. </li></ul><p>  If not everything works ... </p><p>  Not always the process runs perfectly smoothly.  Then an error message appears, the picture of the desktop does not appear on the screen, and, alas, it will not work.  The reasons for this "lack of control" may be different.  For example, a mobile operator is not allowed in the given territory or the mobile phone itself is ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù for a specific network provider.  Similar overlays happen if you buy not the original, but a cheaper fake, for example, a Chinese iphone.  And even if such an instance is activated, it does not always work correctly and not with all mobile operators in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  There is such an option: the phone turned on, it seems to be activated, but there is no cellular network.  Exit - unlock is done, after which the SIM cards of Russian operators gain access to the iPhone. </p><p>  Clarification to the instructions </p><p>  If you are a happy owner of iPhone 4S, then activation for phones of this model is even easier and even without a computer.  How to activate an iPhone of this type?  Well... </p><ul><li>  a SIM card is inserted and the phone is turned on by pressing the corresponding button on the side panel; </li><li>  It is proposed to choose the language of the telephone interface - naturally, Russian is selected </li><li>  auto-selection of your location on maps in Google and Yandex - you can answer either positively or negatively, if desired; </li><li>  Internet connection, wireless, wi-fi.  You can connect immediately, or later.  In any case, the Internet will be needed to activate the phone in the Apple application, as well as to work with various online services of this company; </li><li>  registering the phone on the network of the mobile operator to which the iPhone is connected.  SMS notifications about connection parameters, information about the settings for mms, sms, etc .; </li><li>  the final touches - the option "configure a new device", all recommendations are best implemented; </li><li>  on the phone screen there is a proposal to enter the Internet via wi-fi, always under your Apple ID; </li><li>  an agreement on the obligations and rights of the user is accepted and, by clicking on the button, we begin work with our iPhone! </li></ul><p>  As you can see, everything is quite simple! </p>
