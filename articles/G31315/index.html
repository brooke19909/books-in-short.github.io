That is why throughout the time they are very popular.  Two companies involved in the production of such models can be distinguished: Nokia and Siemens.  Their product lines include telephones that are ideal for people with an active lifestyle.  These devices are capable of withstanding prolonged exposure to water, strong mechanical stress, sandstorms and others. </p><p>  A striking representative of such phones is the Nokia 5100. This model can please not only with a high level of protection, but also with functionality.  The Finnish company tried to release a device that is ideal for energetic users.  Its only competitor is the <span>Siemens M55</span> model <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 5100" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1412234.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Nokia 5100 has an original design.  Confusing it with some other phone is simply impossible.  It is produced in two colors: green and dark gray.  Everyone who considers such a variety to be insufficient can use removable panels.  They are offered in orange, blue, dark green and red.  The panels are not included in the package, therefore, if necessary, they can be purchased separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The dimensions of this model are impressive: 108.5x49.5x22 mm.  Seeing such dimensions, you might think that using this phone is not very convenient, but thanks to the rubberized surface, the device is ideally in the hand. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Given that the predecessor of the Nokia 5100 was a model with the index 5210, you can notice what innovations the Finnish company introduced.  In addition to the usual protection against shock, dust and splashing water, another function was added.  It consists in the maximum safety of the internal module.  This result was made possible after a special keyboard gasket was used and an additional end cover hiding the connector.  Thanks to this, you can talk on the phone during rain or snow.  During testing, the results were shown, which confirmed that in 95% when falling from a height of 2 meters, the device remains completely intact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 5100 battery" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1412241.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  The Nokia 5100 display is not very large, especially when compared with modern smartphones.  However, its resolution is 128x128 pixels.  This is quite decent for such an apparatus.  The display reproduces more than 4000 colors.  It has excellent viewing angles.  Brightness and contrast can be adjusted independently.  Even in sunny weather, display readability is excellent. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The size of the memory in the Nokia 5100 is 725 KB.  Most of the functions are: phone book, games, SMS and MMS, calendar, music and pictures.  This amount of memory is enough for 5-7 Java applications. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that about 500 KB are already taken in the new phone.  That is why to install new applications you will have to delete the old ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 5100 specifications" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1412223.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  Nokia 5100, the characteristics of which will surprise the modern consumer, has a traditional menu.  It was created on the Series 40 platform. On the screen there are already familiar icons with names.  The manufacturer has provided a quick navigation function.  Thanks to her, you can easily call the most frequently used items.  The menu contains 5 lines of text.  Their size is 16 points.  The font is easy to see at a distance of 1 meter.  The number of lines when typing a message increases to 8, but the size of the letters decreases. </p><p>  Menu scrolling is carried out using the button, which is located under the display.  Confirm your selection or exit the application using the side keys. </p><p>  The manufacturer arranged the buttons in the original way: in the center one line goes ‚Äú2‚Äù, ‚Äú5‚Äù, ‚Äú8‚Äù and ‚Äú0‚Äù, on the sides (at an angle), respectively, the rest.  They are of good size, so accidentally clicking on another is almost impossible. </p><p>  Considering this phone model, you need to stop at the rare Extras menu item.  It contains applications that are almost never found in other devices.  For example, this is a thermometer that can measure the ambient temperature, a noise meter, a calorie counter.  The last sentence will be useful for athletes.  The device also has an FM radio.  The reception signal is good, the control is easy, the sound is without interference.  There is a speakerphone during a call. </p><h2>  SMS and MMS </h2><p>  On this unit, you can send SMS messages up to 459 characters in Latin letters.  A distinctive feature of the Nokia 5100 is the Unicode function.  With its help, you can send messages that will contain about 200 characters.  For those who want to add brightness to their messages, the manufacturer suggests using graphic images.  Only 10 are standard, but you can add five more.  If there is a need to free memory, they are easy to delete. </p><p>  There are also no complaints about the MMS function.  Melodies can be received, but not sent.  This restriction on photographs and pictures does not apply. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia calsen 5100" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1412236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional features </h2><p>  Having considered the functionality of the device, we can draw certain conclusions.  For such a phone, it is quite decent.  Exclusive for this model is the presence of a built-in flashlight.  Its radius of action is about one and a half meters. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention that you can connect a digital camera to the phone.  With its help, great pictures are obtained.  However, many users have noticed that working with it is not very convenient, since you have to use an earphone. </p><p>  Like any other phone, this model is equipped with a timer, stopwatch and alarm clock.  You can use an infrared port or a USB cable to connect to a PC. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Nokia 5100 has a standby time of 300 hours.  During a conversation, the phone will last up to 5 hours without recharging.  If you listen to the radio through a stereo headset, the battery can hold a charge for about 20 hours. However, when playing music through the speaker, the device will work for no more than 8 hours. The type of battery is lithium-ion.  Its capacity is 720 mAh. </p><h2>  Nokia Calsen 5100 </h2><p>  The model described above is the original product of the Finnish company.  However, another device was released by a Chinese manufacturer.  Its name has the prefix Calsen.  Let's look at its characteristics.  The case is made of plastic and metal.  Simultaneous operation of two SIM cards is supported.  It is possible to expand the phone's memory with a 8 gigabyte card.  The device is equipped with a 1.3 MPh camera.  The screen size is 2.4 inches.  This phone weighs 124 grams.  Its dimensions are 120x53x15 mm.  It is compatible with all Nokia accessories.  The battery has a capacity of 900 mAh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia 5100 price" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1412210.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Given that the Nokia 5100, the price of which varies within 1,500 rubles, focuses on the level of protection against external influences, the functionality still deserves respect.  Many users noted the excellent reception signal of the mobile network, a large number of applications, good microphone and speaker sound, clear voice.  The advantages of this model can also include a robust case and good battery power.  However, users found a flaw.  It lies in the fact that the keys are pressed too tightly, this causes some inconvenience. </p>
