    <p>  The layout of the house of brick is the first step in the construction.  To make the building stand for several decades, it was warm, dry and comfortable inside, you should pay attention to the advice of specialists: </p><ol><li>  The layout of the house before construction should be carried out after the purchase of the site.  Such a need arises because the location of the building and the terrain affects the design. </li><li>  Before ordering a home project, a preliminary calculation of the total cost is required. </li><li>  At the design stage, the design of the future building is coordinated, as well as the planning of the total living area, its number of storeys. </li><li>  The designer must indicate the exact location of the bathrooms, cable channels, sewers and furniture. </li><li>  In a private house, a place for a boiler room near the kitchen must be provided. </li><li>  With the final layout of the rooms and the living room, you need to make sure that each member of the family will be comfortable living in them. </li></ol><h2>  Nuances in designing a home </h2><p>  The development of the plan should begin, taking into account all the wishes of future residents of the house.  Only after clarification of all preferences can we start the construction project.  To do this, collect the following information: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  site documentation; </li><li>  planting a house on allotted land; </li><li>  complete house plan; </li><li>  facade of the house in the axes; </li><li>  roof sketches; </li><li>  sizes of windows and doors; </li><li>  the location of the channels for ventilation and smoke exhaust; </li><li>  type of foundation; </li><li>  a plan for the location of sewers, electrical appliances and wiring, water supply and heating systems; </li><li>  specification of building materials used. </li></ul><p>  It is not necessary to apply for the development of a project for the construction of brick cottages to specialists, you can compose it yourself, or use ready-made projects of typical buildings.  The time for the construction of a private house is calculated at the stage of creating the project.  The calculation of the term depends on many factors: </p><ul><li>  quality of materials used for the construction of cottages made of bricks; </li><li>  number of contractors; </li><li>  dimensions and design complexity; </li><li>  season and climate. </li></ul><h2>  Estimation development </h2>

    <p>  During the development of the building project, an estimate is drawn up at the same time.  This is a document without which no builder will take up the job.  This document sets out the deadlines and schedule. </p><p>  The main item of expenses for the construction of any building is the cost of construction materials, as well as payment for work to contractors.  An accurate calculation of the cost of construction is carried out according to the following criteria: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  The volume of planned work. </li><li>  Technologies to be used in construction. </li><li>  Dates to the delivery of the object to the customer. </li><li>  The number of firms involved in the <span>development of the plan, estimates,</span> procurement of materials. </li></ol><h2>  Documentation for registering a new building </h2><p>  After the project and specification are ready, it is necessary to obtain a building permit from the city or district administration.  To do this, documentation for the future home is sent to officials for consideration.  After the approval of the authorities, you can safely begin to purchase equipment and materials for construction. </p><p>  Workers begin construction only when the project, estimate and permission for the construction of a private brick building are completely ready, and the land owner obtained permission from the authorities for this type of work.  Also, you can not do without the purchase of building materials. </p><h2>  Terrain preparation </h2>

    <p>  Preparatory work on the site where the construction of the brick structure is planned includes several activities: </p><ul><li>  cleaning land for building from debris and vegetation; </li><li>  marking the territory under the base. </li></ul><p>  During the marking of land for construction work, a number of rules should be taken into account: </p><ul><li>  marking must be done along the external and internal contours of the bearing wall; </li><li>  for such an operation, metal rods and rope are used; </li><li>  the trench should be dug strictly according to the marking; </li><li>  in the process of digging, experts recommend increasing the pit by 30-40 cm in width.  This is done for convenience during cement pouring and installation of the waterproofing layer. </li></ul><h2>  Foundation building </h2><p>  The foundation of any structure is the foundation.  It must be strong enough to withstand the load.  For the construction of a private house of brick, the foundation of the tape type is most often used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The depth of the trench intended for the construction of the foundation depends on the number of storeys of the living space.  For a house with one or two floors, it is enough to dig a trench 1.5 meters deep, for a taller house, the foundation should go into the ground by at least two meters. </p><p>  The construction of the foundation is carried out in several stages: </p><ol><li>  In a trench of sufficient depth, formwork is installed, which should protrude above the soil level by about 20 cm. </li><li>  Crushed stone is poured at the bottom of the pit.  The height of the embankment must be at least 5 cm. </li><li>  Then install the metal fittings. </li><li>  After this, builders lay mortgage elements for the placement of communication equipment. </li><li>  The final step is to fill the trench with concrete.  After the solution has completely dried (about a month), the formwork is removed and waterproofed. </li></ol><h2>  Waterproofing </h2>

    <p>  For the construction of houses and cottages of <span>double brick, the</span> base of a residential building is covered with a layer of insulation.  It is required to prevent water from entering the basement.  As a protective layer, hydroisol or roofing material is used. </p><h2>  Varieties of bricks </h2><p>  The cost of building a brick cottage directly depends on the choice of the main building material.  For the construction of private houses, two types of bricks are most often used - silicate and ceramic. </p><p>  Silicate building material consists of quartz sand and lime.  It has a porous structure, thanks to this property, the walls pass oxygen into the room.  He is also praised for his good thermal and sound insulation.  In addition, the brick has a relatively low weight, which facilitates the overall construction of the house. </p><p>  This type of brick is divided into two types of designs, depending on the manufacturing process: hollow and solid. </p><p>  Ceramic brick is made from small clay fractions.  It has high strength, sufficiently resistant to external influences and has good thermal conductivity. </p><p>  Brick houses and cottages are also constructed using ceramic blocks with a porous structure.  Such material is also highly durable and saves heat in the cold season. </p><p>  The use of ceramics in the construction of a turnkey cottage made of bricks will give not only strength, but also environmental safety, because this material is made from completely natural raw materials. </p><h2>  Bricklaying </h2>

    <p>  After preparing the foundation, you should proceed to the erection of the walls of the house.  When laying bricks, it is necessary to adhere to a number of rules: </p><ol><li>  Construction starts from the corner of the house. </li><li>  There should not be any space between adjacent bricks. </li><li>  A bunch of bricks must be reliable, you can not save on cement mortar. </li><li>  Each brick after installation must be tapped to exclude airiness. </li><li>  A reinforced concrete pillar is installed on top of the bricks. </li><li>  For even masonry, a level and a horizontal in the form of a stretched cord are used. </li></ol><h2>  Roof construction </h2><p>  The roof for the house can be designed in various forms, however, the sequence of its construction remains the same: </p><ol><li>  To begin with, an attic floor is made. </li><li>  Then the rafter system of wood is installed. </li><li>  At the next stage, the crate is mounted. </li><li>  On top of the resulting structure, waterproofing and insulation are laid. </li><li>  At the final stage, the finish coating is laid. </li></ol><h2>  Finishing the exterior walls of the house </h2>

    <p>  The price of building a turnkey brick cottage without interior decoration starts at an average of 2 million rubles.  For this amount, the owner receives a building made according to a standard or newly developed project, a detailed layout of the premises, geological work and a guarantee of several decades for work and building materials. </p><p>  At the time of conclusion of the contract, attention should be paid to the terms, responsibilities of the parties, warranty periods, specifications for materials used in construction. </p><p>  Do not chase the lowest price when building brick cottages, because the main thing in this business is quality, experienced builders and high-quality building materials.  The integrity of the building, the comfort of households and their safety during their stay in the cottage depend on the right choice. </p>
