Travelers are delighted with her. </p><p>  After all, Prague is a city where, on the one hand, it‚Äôs easy to gain extra pounds in restaurants offering a temptation that cannot be abandoned, and, on the other hand, it‚Äôs just as easy to lose them.  Here you can walk with your mouth open, from one sight to another, coming to your senses only when your legs begin to hurt. </p><p>  To these cathedrals, bridges, towers and domes, which are already ten centuries old, and which are practically a miracle!  - did not suffer during the Second World War, you can watch endlessly.  Wherever you go in Old Prague, you will find everywhere that you can immediately put on a postcard. </p><p>  No wonder the Austrian writer Franz Kafka assured that Prague does not let go if you get there at least once.

Here they had to spend a lot of money on completely unplanned purchases, and they regret that they did not come here with a spare suitcase. </p><p>  The shelves of the Czech capital look so artificially that you won‚Äôt get off with a single fridge magnet or the like.  The most popular acquisitions in Prague are handicrafts and jewelry made of semiprecious stone - pomegranate. </p><p>  Competition to him is perhaps the Bohemian glass known to the whole world.  Of course, beer is brought from alcohol, but tourists are advised to choose the Pardubice Porter - a sweetish traditional drink.  And from strong distillates it is better to take plum brandy and Becherovka. </p><p>  In addition, shopaholics will find here a great opportunity to buy cheap things from popular European brands at a low price. </p><h2>  What tourists say about the Olympic Tristar in Prague - reviews and tips </h2><p>  Travelers believe this hotel is very neat, comfortable and suitable for excursions and sightseeing.  The rooms are not very big but comfortable.  Breakfasts can compete with the good Turkish Quartet. </p><p>  In order to spend a couple of days in Prague, it fits perfectly.  During their travels in the Czech Republic, residents of this hotel must pay a tourist tax of 15 kroons or 43 rubles per person per day.  Keep in mind that without this you will not be accommodated in a hotel. </p><p>  Of the minuses of the hotel, tourists note not too good soundproofing.  Travelers are advised to settle on the upper floors.  Student groups often live in the lower ones.  And on the top there is less noise. </p><p>  If you come in the summer or just in fine weather, it is better to walk to the center.  So you will save on travel, and admire Prague. </p>
