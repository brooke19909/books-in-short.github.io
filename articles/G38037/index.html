    <h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  Well, the first thing that we have to discuss with you is what opportunity will open before us after connecting today's function.  The thing is that this is a very important element for the work of absolutely any modern user.  Why?  Yes, all because the ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù (MTS) option is nothing more than the so-called package of services for providing mobile Internet. </p><p>  As a rule, every modern user is used to using the World Wide Web from their gadgets.  And for this reason, every mobile operator begins to offer its customers different rates for the Internet on a cell phone.  The BIT option (MTS) is just what an average user needs.  But, besides her, there are other tariffs.  Let's get to know them.  Maybe they will suit you more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Tariffing </h2><p>  So, now it's time to quickly ‚Äúrun through‚Äù at all possible tariffs that the ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù (MTS) option can offer you.  After all, each option in itself implies some differences.  And they, in turn, are suitable for different intensities of using the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disable bit option on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/865452.jpg"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

    <p>  For example, there is a standard "BIT".  It is quite often used for surfing the Internet, chatting and reading mail.  If you are not a particularly active Internet user (using your phone), then you can safely connect it.  At the same time, you will receive 75 Mb / day, and pay only 180 rubles per month.  Very attractive and good price.  In principle, this tariff should be enough even for downloading some files.  Not very weighty. </p><p>  And there is the option "Super Bit" (MTS).  This is a slightly extended variation of the standard "BIT".  You will receive 3 GB of traffic per month, and you will pay 250 rubles already.  This option is perfect when you are actively using the Internet on your phone.  The Super Bit option (MTS) is what every modern client needs.  You can easily not only communicate and surf the Internet, but also watch entire movies.  And all this without any special ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù.  Is it worth talking about downloading large documents?  Yes, of course.  You can easily ‚Äúupload‚Äù a game or program to your gadget.  And all this will take a fairly short period of time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  And there is the option "BIT Smart" on MTS.  This is such a tariff, which, when exceeded 100 MB per day, reduces the speed of operation to 64 Kb / s.  For this service you will have to pay 8 rubles per day.  With all this, this option is perfect for travelers.  After all, he acts invariably throughout Russia.  And it is very profitable.  The <span>‚ÄúBIT Smart‚Äù</span> option on MTS is, one might say, the traveler‚Äôs real dream.  And now let's talk with you a little about what conditions should be observed before you start using these tariffs.  At this time, you can decide what is right for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="super bit pay option" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/865455.jpg" width="500"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  Let's start with you with the most important points that are worth considering.  The first thing that any modern user should pay attention to is the cost of the service.  The thing is that each tariff has its own monthly fee.  With all this, if at the time of writing off funds you have a negative balance, then you will still be charged this money. </p><p>  You cannot use the Internet on your phone.  To do this, you have to replenish the balance to positive.  And only after that you will be returned access to the World Wide Web. </p><p>  In addition, the ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù (MTS) option is provided to all users of this mobile operator within Russia.  Regardless of your location, tariff prices will not change much.  The main thing is to have before the connection the necessary amount to be debited from your account.  Now you can try to connect the "BIT" option to the MTS. </p><h2>  Teams </h2><p>  So, the first option that can only be offered to all customers is the use of a special USSD command.  It is she who will help you independently connect any function that a mobile operator can offer.  The main thing is to know the dialed combination to send a request to a technical service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart bit option on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/865454.jpg"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In our case, there are several scenarios.  For example, if you need to connect exactly ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù, then dial * 252 # on the phone, and then click on ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  Super BIT is connected using the * 628 # command.  Smart is better to be connected by another method.  Now there is no command to automatically start using this tariff.  And precisely for this reason, we will contact you with another method that can only be offered to MTS customers.  Which one?  Now we will recognize him. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  The second scenario is the use of advanced technologies.  In our case, the Internet and the official website of the mobile operator.  The thing is that on it there is a section "personal account" in which each user can control the cost of funds, as well as connect new features. </p><p>  In order to bring the idea to life, you will have to go through the authorization process.  Your mobile is entered as a login, and you must create your own password when registering in the system.  After that, go to the "services" section, and there, find the "Internet".  Next, you will see all possible tariffs, as well as some conditions for their provision.  Choose something suitable for yourself, and then click on the necessary line.  Now just click on ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and confirm your own actions.  That's all. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the BIT Smart (MTS) option is connected in this way.  You can disable it in the same way - through your account.  But now it‚Äôs worthwhile to talk about the rejection of Internet access services.  How can an idea be realized?  Let's deal with this problem. </p><h2>  Calls </h2><p>  If you decide to disable the "BIT" option on MTS, you can use the most ordinary call.  More precisely, by the method already familiar to us - USSD commands.  They will help us to solve the task best. </p><p>  In order to disable the ‚ÄúBIT‚Äù option on MTS, dial * 252 * 0 # on your phone.  After that, you can click on the call button and wait for the request to finish processing.  You will receive an SMS notification about the successful disconnection of the function.  After that, you don‚Äôt have to worry about writing off funds for BIT. </p><p>  If you have Super Bit connected, you will have to dial * 111 * 628 * 2 #.  After that, you can again wait for an alert from the system.  As soon as it arrives, you can be sure that you have completed the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connect the bit option to mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/865456.jpg"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <h2>  Internet assistant </h2><p>  In addition, to refuse Internet services, you can use the Internet assistant on your phone.  It is automatically installed after the first use of the MTS SIM card.  In order to use it, just find it in the applications. </p><p>  Next, select "services", and there - "Internet".  After that, a menu will appear before you, in which you can easily and simply select your tariff, and then click on the "disconnect" command.  In a few minutes you will receive a notification about the rejection of options for the Internet.  That's all the problems are solved. </p>
