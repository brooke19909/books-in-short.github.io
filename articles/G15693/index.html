    <p>  Moral standards - this is one of the ways to regulate human behavior.  Some definitions add an amendment to it: human behavior in society, however, such an understanding of moral norms greatly narrows them and does not allow them to include the concept of morality, which has a more individualized meaning and content. </p><p>  They are a very important element of a person‚Äôs life, because they determine his behavior and reflect self-awareness, understanding of himself.  At first glance, this phenomenon seems artificially deduced, but it arose for objective reasons in a natural way. </p><p>  People have long understood that life in a common environment has its own rules and laws, breaking which you can achieve only negative consequences.  For example, a primitive man created more comfortable conditions for himself if he eliminated his competitors, destroying their homes and themselves, if he existed separately.  But when he began to live in a community where all the elements are connected, and, in fact, try to live for the common good, it became clear that their destruction will lead only to the worst.  Therefore, one of the main moral standards arose, which reflects the <span>value of human</span> life and forms a ban on murder. </p><p>  Morality is formed by the surrounding reality and at the same time corrects it.  This position proves that its roots go back to the <span>person</span> ‚Äôs evaluative <span>ability:</span> he sees what is happening, evaluates the result of the process and determines whether it is good or bad. </p><p>  Now this assessment is taking place from the point of view of the humanistic potential: how much the events and actions of people contribute to the development and creation.  The basic concepts of good and evil are considered only from this aspect, and this, for sure, is the most reasonable of all possible options. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, unfortunately, sometimes in society they resort to fraudulent methods, and under the guise of high moral ideas (in order not to cause a wave of indignation in the society and get supporters) they bring chaos, destruction and confusion to life.  Most wars are based on just such a method: ‚Äúwe liberate the people‚Äù, ‚Äúwe take revenge, preserving the honor‚Äù - it would seem that these are rather noble moral acts, but the harm and destruction that they bring as a result is not comparable with any moral norm .  Thus, society is misled, and the evaluation <span>function of morality</span> atrophies, because  the assessment turned out to be erroneous, and mankind has not received any creation and development. </p><p>  Moral norms as a regulator of behavior </p><p>  Unfortunately, at the present time they are not enough as a regulator: enforcement, legal, administrative, and a number of other methods are needed to adjust human behavior.  Nevertheless, morality is unique in its manifestation in human life, because it does not need to be announced and documented (like other ways of regulation).  A man himself realizes how he needs to behave in society, and, even without knowing all <span>legal norms</span> by heart, he, having delinquent, realizes that he did wrong and objectively must pay for it with punishment. </p><p>  Using an elementary example, we give the situation: if someone stepped on someone‚Äôs foot, then an apology follows, not because they put him in jail, but because the attacker is ill from what he did to another person.  And this is the highest manifestation of the connection between <span>morality and morality:</span> self-awareness is inextricably linked with the feeling of others in society. </p><p>  According to the same principle, there are <span>moral and ethical standards</span> in the professional sphere, since there are a number of occupations in which a person can exceed his authority and enjoy the situation.  For example, among them are doctors, journalists, military, etc.  Representatives of these professions either receive secret information or contact directly with a person by occupation and, not following the code of ethics, can hurt him very much.  In a word, their actions can be destructive and there are rules against this. </p><p>  Moral standards as a criterion </p><p>  The behavior of some people can be a way of educating others.  Here, moral standards perform an educational function in the traditional way: one generation passes its experience to the next and so mankind retains its appearance.  Children learn from the examples of elders how to behave, and then, having absorbed in themselves with the help of fairy tales and real examples the concepts of good and evil, they grow up and teach their children. </p><p>  Thus, life is weakly imagined without morality, because it is it - one of those important facets that separate a person from an animal. </p>
