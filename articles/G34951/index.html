    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  The four-star hotel "Lydia Maris" is located in a very picturesque place of Kolymbia.  It is located halfway between the capital of the island - the city of Rhodes - and Lindos.  The nearest airport is 28 kilometers away.  Thus, after landing on the <span>island of Rhodes, the</span> road to the hotel will take you about half an hour.  This is very convenient especially if you go on vacation with young children.  Like many <span>hotels in Greece,</span> Lydia Maris Hotel 4 * does not have its own beach.  They are mostly municipal, so you will have to pay extra for renting sun loungers, umbrellas and other equipment.  The sea is only 350 meters from the hotel.  So, having made a pleasant ten-minute walk, you will get the opportunity to relax on a wonderful small-pebble clean beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Lydia Maris Hotel 4 *: reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for you to get the most accurate and complete picture of the four-star hotel in Rhodes under the name "Lydia Maris", we offer you to get acquainted with the impressions of our compatriots who this year had a rest here.  Looking ahead, we inform that the vast majority of tourists were more than satisfied with their choice and are ready to recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit the island of Rhodes. </p><p>  The travelers liked the hotel rooms very much.  According to them, they are very spacious, stylishly decorated and furnished with new furniture.  The equipment in the rooms is modern, in working condition.  If any malfunctions arise, then the problem will be fixed very quickly.  In addition, many tourists note the fact that upon arrival, the staff tries to accommodate arriving guests in the best rooms, whenever possible, without requiring any additional payment.  So, many of our compatriots were accommodated in junior suites, although only standard rooms were pre-paid.  Such an attitude towards guests by the Lydia Maris Hotel 4 * (Kolymbia) administration was appreciated by tourists.  As for the cleaning of the rooms, it was always carried out regularly and carefully.  Also, maids changed towels and bed linen three times a week.  Satisfied with the travelers and the location of the hotel.  According to them, the entire tourism infrastructure is within walking distance. </p>

    <p>  As for the reviews of vacationers about nutrition, all of them are almost 100% positive.  So, according to tourists, the choice of dishes is very wide.  And a lot of superbly prepared meat dishes.  Many guests of Lidia Maris celebrate delicious pizza, which was cooked in the afternoon in a street-mounted oven.  Guests also appreciated the constant availability of fresh fruits and vegetables, a variety of desserts, sweets, pastries and snacks.  Travelers enjoyed the drinks served in the hotel bars. </p><p>  As for the distance from the beach, then, according to our compatriots, it takes no more than ten minutes to go from the Lydia Maris Hotel 4 * to the sea.  The beaches here are small pebble and very clean.  In general, almost everyone was satisfied with a beach holiday. </p><p>  But back to the hotel.  Since the main contingent of its guests consists of middle-aged Europeans, there is no stormy animation program and noisy entertainment here.  However, there are still animators.  During the day, they invite guests to do water aerobics, play volleyball or water polo, etc., and in the evenings they hold mini-discos for the youngest travelers.  Also on site you can have a great time near the pool.  In addition, tourists who visited the local spa were very pleased.  According to them, the services here are not cheap, but their quality is beyond praise.  In addition, experienced travelers recommend that all vacationers in Rhodes must make trips to the sights of the island.  Moreover, it is most convenient to do this on a rental car, especially since the prices here are very reasonable. </p><p>  As for the staff of the Lydia Maris Hotel, many tourists in their reviews respond very warmly to the staff.  So, someone notes the smiling and pleasant maids, someone recalls the friendly and fast-working waiters, someone was very pleased with the receptionists at the reception, and someone was impressed by the local animators.  Our compatriots note only one small minus.  It consists in the employees' ignorance of the Russian language.  This is due to the fact that there are not many Russian-speaking tourists staying at this hotel.  However, you can always speak with Lydia Maris Hotel 4 * staff in basic English or German. </p><p>  Summing up, we can confidently say that in general, the hotel "Lydia Maris" really liked the tourists staying here.  According to them, the hotel offers the best combination of price / quality.  Many of our compatriots do not exclude the possibility of their returning here.  And they will recommend this hotel to their friends and acquaintances. </p>
