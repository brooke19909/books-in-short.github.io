However, the voices of his ideological inspirers still do not stop.  Among them is <span>Joseph Goebbels,</span> whose quotes can still be found in books, in films, and on the Internet. </p><p>  So what was this German speaker talking about, a master of propaganda and lies?  Let's try to briefly answer this question. </p><h2>  Who is Goebbels? </h2><p>  The name and surname of this politician does not inspire fear for modern young people, but meanwhile some dozens of years ago, the surname of this leader of the German people was a household name. </p><p>  He was a very famous figure in Nazi Germany, an associate of Hitler, who was responsible for propaganda and public education in the Reich.  A brilliant speaker, Goebbels could talk for hours.  Millions of people listened to him, millions of people believed his words.  However, the propagandist himself in his letters and conversations with loved ones often allowed himself such words addressed to the Fuhrer or the party that ordinary citizens of the country could not allow. </p><p>  Goebbels was certainly known as a smart, erudite and talented person, however, being a convinced Nazi, he caused a huge number of misfortunes to many peoples on earth, including his own German.  The crimes of this man are truly terrible.  However, he did not survive the Reich, and his death in 1945 was shameful and terrible. </p>

    <h2>  Joseph Goebbels: quotes that went down in history </h2><p>  Goebbels spoke a lot in public.  Many of his statements have been preserved for us by film, some of his associates and colleagues illuminated something in the memoirs, but we will consider only some of the expressions of this person, having previously classified them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  His quotes are about the new Germany. </li><li>  About politics. </li><li>  About the Russians. </li></ul><p>  So, with regard to quotes about Germany, Goebbels was a consistent supporter of the fascist idea, according to which, the future of the country should be determined by a strong state, headed by clean, racially clean people. </p><p>  This will be a <span>totalitarian state</span> with the right to intervene in the private life of a simple person.  For example, Joseph Goebbels noted that the goal of a nationalist revolution is precisely a totalitarian state. </p><p>  Goebbels brought a lot of evil to the German people with these words, his quotes about the essence of the Nazi state are still studied by historians around the world, trying to understand what role this man played in unleashing the world war. </p><p>  He spoke of the dictatorship of the nationalist idea, which should be the engine of social progress.  The politician said that the will of the people should be in harmony with the will of the great leader, while an experienced dictator should be able to keep his people in check. </p>

    <h2>  Goebbels on politics </h2><p>  Goebbels's quotations about propaganda, as well as politics, are no less widely known. </p><p>  The great propagandist of the Reich was able to speak beautifully.  For example, he compared the moderate politician Ribbentrop to a champagne merchant who seeks personal gain and does not think about the political success of his country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, Goebbels subordinated all forms of human activity to politics, and generally referred to jurisprudence as the ‚Äúcorrupt girl‚Äù of all politicians. </p><p>  Goebbels wrote a lot about <span>lies, a quote</span> about political and historical <span>lies is</span> widely known.  So, he noted that it is possible to reformat the consciousness of the people only by replacing their true history with a false one. </p><h2>  Joseph Goebbels about Russian people </h2><p>  In 1941, <span>fascist Germany</span> faced an insoluble task: the resistance to the invasion of the German army in the USSR was very strong.  Naturally, the Reich propaganda master should have turned his attention to our compatriots.  Goebbels‚Äôs quotes about Russians are also widely known today. </p><p>  For example, this skilful speaker called Russian people "subhuman," animals that did not represent any historical value.  ‚ÄúThis is not a people, but a rabble,‚Äù the German politician wrote. </p><p>  There are many quotes on this subject, but on the whole they have one motive: the Russians must be destroyed and their lands taken for the hardworking German people.  So, in general, everything that Goebbels said about the Russians (quotes that were passed from mouth to mouth) is purely negative. </p>
