    <p>  What is the power of Lorentz?  Imagine a certain medium, which is penetrated by the lines of electromagnetic field strength.  If you place any <span>electric charge</span> in this area (it can be either an elementary particle or a charged body), then F will be affected by it, called the ‚ÄúLorentz force‚Äù.  One of the key points is the presence of acceleration in a particle.  In other words, the charge is mobile.  There is a formula for numerically determining its effective value: </p><p>  F = Q * (E + ((1 / c) * v) * B), </p><p>  where Q is the charge;  E is the electric field strength;  B is the magnetic field strength;  v is the velocity of the particle carrying the charge;  c is the constant <span>speed of light.</span> </p><p>  This is just one view.  There is a more complicated spelling that allows you to determine what the Lorentz force is equal to, the direction of the vectors and their potentials are also taken into account. </p><p>  As already indicated (and can be seen from the formula), a prerequisite is movement.  The fact is that when a charge moves, due to its interaction with the field, an <span>EMF (electromotive force)</span> arises <span>.</span>  Moreover, it does not matter at all what the nature of the effect that initiated the movement (gravitational, the effect of charges on each other, etc.) is. </p><p>  Compared with other influences, the Lorentz force is directly interconnected with the conclusions of Lenz and obeys his Rule.  Recall the essence of the latter.  The action exerted by an electromotive force on a charge moving in the field is always oriented in this way (this is a vector quantity) in order to prevent any changes in acceleration. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  We can say that the Lorentz force is determined by the Coulomb interaction of charges and two additional components associated with the movement - the influence of magnetic force and electric field.  Usually, the following model is used to explain the processes: in a <span>magnetic field</span> with induction vectors B, there is a section of a conductor of length L and cross-sectional area S through which electric current flows I. The latter directly depends on the number of charge carriers Q passing through a unit volume over a certain time ( that is, with speed v).  Hence, the desired force (Lorentz) is the ratio of the external force affecting each carrier in the considered volume of the conductor to the number of charges. </p><p>  If we consider <span>vector quantities,</span> then the Lorentz force is always perpendicular to the directions of speed and induction.  You can very easily determine its orientation by using the well-known rule of the left hand.  To do this, mentally place the palm of the left hand next to the conductor so that four fingers indicate the direction in which the electric current flows, and the field induction vector is perpendicular to the palm.  As a result, the thumb (right angle with the rest) will indicate the vector of the force that affects the charges.  One of the features of this force is that it only changes the direction of the velocity vector of each charged particle, while not changing the energy of motion (kinetic energy). </p><p>  Some time after the discovery, the use of the Lorentz force was also found.  One of the most famous is its manifestation in the Hall effect.  It is thanks to it that in this phenomenon a shift of charges and the appearance of potential on the conductive plate (tape) occur.  <span>The Hall effect is</span> widely used in various measuring instruments and sensors.  It is also worth noting the principle of operation of CRT kinescopes, in which the deflecting effect of a directed magnetic field on a moving charged particle is used: the electrons emitted by the electrodes ("guns") on the surface coated with the phosphor are deflected to points with known coordinates precisely due to the interaction of the field strength lines and the charge of moving particles . </p>
