Waterproof, shockproof, rugged mobile phones</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In everyday life, we are used to using phones that have powerful technological potential, but remain fragile, elegant and not protected from external factors.  For example, even if you have an iPhone, you should be afraid for it, because in the event of a fall, the device may fail.  The same applies to most other devices - the large touch screen makes them vulnerable to shock, and various functional openings (like a headphone jack) pose a risk of dust and moisture getting there, which can also damage the device. <br>  In this article we will consider phones that are fundamentally different from such a concept.  No, these are not traditional ‚Äúbricks‚Äù with a minimum of functions;  We will consider high-tech, multifunctional models capable of performing a wide variety of tasks.  At the same time, their security allows these devices to come into contact with water, sand, give in to mechanical stress - and remain unharmed. <br>  The article will be written in the form of a list of the most worthy models.  It is impossible to create a rating from protected devices, because you have to choose by what criterion you should evaluate - performance or the degree of protection of the device. <br>  Meet: Introducing dustproof and waterproof, shockproof, indestructible phones. </p><h2>  Kyocera DuraScout </h2>

    <p>  You probably have not even heard about the company that released this product.  The reason for this is the lack of our country in the list of regions for which these devices are supplied.  Nevertheless, you can buy it in Russia. <br>  The phone definitely deserves attention for a number of reasons.  Firstly, of course, this is the highest degree of phone security.  What does it mean, both protection against mechanical damage, and the encryption of data transmitted with its help.  Thus, the device can be used for communication on important matters, and you can take with you on trips anywhere in the world.  In addition, the phone has a stylish appearance, which is also unusual, given the design of most other secure devices.  If we are used to seeing that an indestructible <span>waterproof phone</span> is a huge, rough ‚Äúbrick‚Äù of sports coloring, then DuraScout is a stylish <span>smartphone with a large screen,</span> which can be used in everyday life.  2GB of RAM, a 4-core processor and a powerful battery give the device significant functionality.  Its cost is about 500 dollars (in the USA). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Cruiser bt55 </h2>

    <p>  Another interesting representative of the class of secure devices is the phone, which cannot be killed both from the point of view of physics and in terms of cybernetic influence - the model protected from all sides is BT55.  The device was released by Chinese developers in 2015.  Despite this, the smartphone managed to gain wide fame and attract a large number of buyers.  And, if we look at its characteristics, it will not be difficult to understand the reason for such success. <br>  Not only can the device withstand any destructive factors, it is also equipped with the latest technology: it has an eight-core processor (with a clock frequency of each core of 2 GHz), a colorful five-inch display, and has a 3200 mAh battery.  The device can be taken on any trip, without fear for its serviceability.  The device is at one of the Chinese auctions of about 250-300 dollars. </p><h2>  Sigma mobile X-treme PQ33 </h2>

This is Sigma, which falls into the category of ‚Äúbrand of indestructible phones‚Äù and occupies a place in the top three there. <br>  The PQ33 is a true confirmation of this.  A device protected from all sides shows incredible performance, as for such a gadget.  This is achieved due to the work of the 8-core ‚Äúheart‚Äù, which is successfully combined with 2 GB of RAM.  The device‚Äôs camera is not inferior to the best ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù smartphones thanks to a resolution of 13 megapixels.

    <p>  Rugged phones are made not only in the USA or China.  So, one more worthy copy can be found among the products of French developers.  In particular, we present the Fieldbook F1 model, which is also able to show good results in terms of working in extreme conditions.  This is another phone that cannot be killed when exposed to moisture, dust or mechanical shock.  You can drop it and not be afraid that the model will fail. <br>  At the same time, unlike the Chinese Cruiser, the F1 phone is made in an elegant design, which includes a large screen with a size of 6 inches.  The device also has excellent technical parameters: 4 processor cores with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz, as well as 2 GB of RAM show a high level of performance.  In addition, the developers have introduced the ability to support microSD-cards up to 2 terabytes (!).  This allows you to turn your smartphone into a real hard drive for storing data, say, during a trip or trip to a place remote from civilization.  A real device for travelers and just an unkillable phone with a powerful battery. </p><h2>  RugGear RG970 Partner </h2><p>  Another phone with an excellent level of protection is the brainchild of RugGear, model RG970 Partner.  The device is made in a classic case for this type of apparatus - it is a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù with rubberized plugs and sidewalls, capable of withstanding, as it seems at first glance, a drop from any height.  In addition to the strength of the case, the phone also has a good filling, which should include a 2-core MediaTek processor, GPS, Bluetooth, 3G modules.  To navigate better than this unit, you won‚Äôt be able to find the phone with the same functionality. <br>  ‚ÄúUnkillable‚Äù RG970 Partner will cost 36 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  No.1 X-Men X2 </h2>

    <p>  Another Chinese product is the X-Men X2 rugged smartphone.  The device is presented in a budget price class, although it has all the basic functions necessary for use in travel and hiking.  For example, a 4-core chipset is installed here, there is 1 GB of RAM, as well as a durable battery for 5800 mAh.  With such parameters, the model can be attributed to simple devices that can help in the campaign.  Moreover, due to the capacious battery, the device will be able to work on a single charge for a long time, which is already a positive quality for a phone that can be a camera, communication tool, multimedia center, as well as a navigator.  This is a real unkillable phone with a powerful battery. </p><h2>  Caterpillar cat b15q </h2>

    <p>  It's no secret that Caterpillar, a company specializing in the manufacture of construction equipment, also produces mobile phones.  What is noteworthy, we are talking about unkillable cell phones that can tolerate various <span>extreme conditions</span> without disrupting performance. <br>  One of the most secure in this category is the <span>Cat B15Q.</span>  The model is not the newest - it was introduced back in 2014, and even as of today it can be considered one of the most enduring on the market.  This is achieved due to the incredibly durable massive body, so the phone is not killed.  Appearance of the device is such that to use it in everyday life, of course, is not very convenient, but just right for tourism. <br>  However, the technical characteristics of the device suffer a little due to its ‚Äúphysical‚Äù component - there is only 1 GB of RAM, a processor with a frequency of 1 GHz, and a 2000 mAh battery. </p><h2>  teXet X-driver TM-4104R </h2>

    <p>  An interesting solution was a product from the budget manufacturer of tablets and ‚Äúreaders‚Äù teXet.  The model is made of plastic and rubber (although the traditional component for such devices, as it seems at first glance, remains a metal case).  According to its <span>IP68</span> protection class <span>, the phone</span> is able to remain intact even after falling from a height onto asphalt.  However, to say that this is the best unkillable phone is impossible - it brings down the hardware.  Here is the processor, whose clock frequency is 1 GHz, and the RAM reaches 768 MB.  With such characteristics, the device can be used, except as a navigator, camera or communication device.  For the performance of some more complex tasks, it is most likely not suitable. </p>
