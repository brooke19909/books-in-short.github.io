    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  A manufacturer from South Korea tried to do everything to make this smartphone the best, at least among the ‚Äúsmall copies‚Äù of the flagships.  Therefore, the developers equipped the <span>LG d618 G2 mini with</span> very strong features.  The processor consists of four cores, each of which has a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz.  As a RAM, it was decided to put 1 gigabyte, and as internal internal memory - 8 gigabytes.  If this amount is small, then this smartphone supports MicroSD flash cards up to 32 gigabytes.  The device itself has a screen diagonal of 4.7 inches, but its resolution is not very large, only 540 x 960. In addition, the latest version of Android is used as the operating system - 4.4. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This smartphone has several names.  One of them is the LG Optimus G2 mini, as a tribute to the previous line of corporation smartphones - Optimus.  The 8-megapixel camera of this smartphone decorates its back side, while the quality of the pictures remains at a fairly good level. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2>

    <p>  Many people liked the design of the LG G2 mini.  The appearance characteristics of the smartphone are very attractive.  The whole phone is made of plastic.  At first glance, everything is done at a fairly high level.  The material itself is very high quality, in the hands of the phone is very convenient.  On the front of the smartphone are touch control buttons, as well as a speaker and a <span>front camera.</span>  Turning the device over, you can find a rather interesting phone socket along with the main camera.  The panel attracts special attention.  The fact is that this is not just an ordinary piece of plastic, but slightly corrugated.  This was probably done in order to avoid the phone‚Äôs excess markiness and to improve the grip of the LG d618 G2 mini white smartphone with a hand.  If you look at the bottom end of the smartphone, you can find several holes.  Two of them are speakers for conversation, and one is a connector designed both for charging the phone and for connecting a smartphone to a personal computer.  In the upper end of the device is a headset jack.  It is also worth noting that the phone‚Äôs power button (as well as <span>volume controls)</span> are located in an innovative way, namely on the rear panel, right under the camera.  This may seem a little unusual, but at the same time quite convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  LG G2 mini (technical specifications of the display and its size) surprised everyone even when it was announced, because the screen size is not standard 4 or 4.3 inches, like other "younger brothers" flagships, but 4.7 at once.  However, despite such a large size, the developers were stingy with its resolution of 1280 x 960. Instead, we get unacceptable 960 x 540. The coating of the glass on the screen itself is very tactile and not too scratched, which is a definite plus.  The screen brightness is at a very good level, and the colors displayed on the smartphone display look very realistic.  The problem occurs in bright sunlight.  In this case, the image becomes faded, and the detail is reduced.  But this is a problem for many smartphones, so this fact should not be considered a special minus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lg g2 mini" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545590.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  The latest version of Android, namely Android 4.4, is installed on the <span>LG G2</span> mini <span>phone</span> , reviews of which are good enough both from buyers and from reputable experts.  In addition, the company has developed several interesting programs that will facilitate not only the use of a smartphone, but also the use of various household and electronic devices that are turned on using the remote control.  The program through the infrared port can control almost every electronic thing in your home.  Another ‚Äútrick‚Äù of developers from South Korea is the KnockOn program, which allows you to turn on and off the screen of your smartphone with a few taps on the screen.  This moment is very convenient and does not require a lot of effort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  LG G2 mini, specifications: battery and runtime </h2><p>  That's where the real plus and advantage of this model is in its battery.  The battery capacity of the device is large enough for those smartphones that exist on the market today.  It is 2440 mAh.  This suggests that you can use the smartphone for various purposes for almost the entire working day, and it will not require a momentary charge.  If you use your smartphone adequately, then the battery charge can easily last for two business days. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="case for lg g2 mini" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/548581.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Audio &amp; Video </h2><p>  The sound quality of this unit is good, but still inferior to the clear leaders in these characteristics, which are the NTS and Samsung.  As for the video, thanks to a sufficiently strong processor and a gigabyte of RAM, the videos play quickly and without hangs.  But there are problems associated with screen resolution.  Due to the fact that it is only 960 x 540, sometimes there is a slight ripple in the frames. </p><h2>  Camera and photo quality </h2><p>  LG G2 mini, the technical characteristics of which do not cause any questions, has two cameras: the main and front.  The main camera has eight million pixels, which is quite normal for a small copy of the flagship.  The quality of the photos taken by this camera is kept at a fairly high level.  It should be noted that the detail and clarity of the image when shooting with a smartphone from LG is better than similar smartphones of other companies.  This can not but rejoice the first owners of this device, especially if for them the camera and the quality of the photos in the smartphone is the most important factor. </p><h2>  Communication and Internet </h2>

    <p>  Let's look at such an important factor for the phone as communication, with the smartphone LG G2 mini.  Reviews of many owners say that this is one of the best devices in order to go online and chat with friends.  And perhaps they are right.  The fact is that when you connect to the Internet, the connection occurs almost immediately, and the initial connection speed is always at a very high level.  As for the Wi-Fi network, the situation is similar.  When you find the necessary access point, the connection occurs instantly. </p><p>  As for conversational communication, which is the main function of any phone, there are also no problems.  The interlocutor is heard perfectly even at a speaker volume level of fifty percent.  In case you are on a busy street, an 80 percent volume level is enough to hear a friend located on the other side of the connection. </p><h2>  Options and prices for this gadget </h2><p>  After purchasing a smartphone from a South Korean company, you will receive a box with all the necessary accessories for the LG G2 mini.  The paper-based manual is the first thing you see when you open the box.  It can be useful for those people who first encountered the issue of using a smartphone.  In this manual you can find all the necessary information regarding the device, its functions and capabilities.  In addition to the documentation, you will also receive a headset in the form of headphones.  Moreover, this accessory is of very good quality.  Of course, if you are a music lover, it is preferable to buy something better, but for an ordinary listener these headphones are a pretty decent option.  Another component in the box is a USB adapter, designed to connect a smartphone to a computer.  Well, the final item in the box is the charger.  Case for LG G2 mini is not included, but you can always buy it almost anywhere. </p><p>  As for the prices for this product, they are set by different stores independently.  In some cases, there may be a different price for this phone, depending on the additional flash memory.  The average price of this smartphone is $ 275, which is quite acceptable, especially when you consider what characteristics it has. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg g2 mini specifications" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/548579.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  LG G2 mini.  Customer reviews and expert opinions </h2><p>  The smartphone from the South Korean manufacturer LG has collected a very good harvest in terms of reviews.  Of course, each user proceeded from the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio, so it is not surprising that most of the reviews are very positive.  Many users among ordinary customers note an excellent battery as the advantages of the device.  Some of them claim that they can do without charging for more than two days.  Also, many buyers note the quality of photos that are taken using the camera phone.  The only factor <span>that</span> some users are <span>unhappy with</span> is the design of the back of the smartphone.  They claim that such a design is not characteristic of ultramodern smartphones, but their grandmother‚Äôs glasses case.  As a ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù, some users suggest that the company also bundle out a case for LG G2. <strong></strong>  mini, but that's a little over the top. </p><p>  The opinion of experts largely coincides with the opinion of ordinary users of smartphones.  After conducting several comparative analyzes, they came to the conclusion that this version of the phone is almost the best for the price of $ 275.  The only drawback that they could not keep silent about is the small screen resolution.  Although many people do not pay attention to how flawless the image on their screen is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg optimus g2 mini" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/545609.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize the review </h2><p>  LG is gradually starting to increase its share in the general market for high-tech smartphones, and it is safe to say that the LG G2 mini will be able to make this share even larger.  This model has a 4-core processor, and the <span>clock frequency of</span> each core is 1.2 GHz.  Despite the fact that the smartphone‚Äôs RAM is one gigabyte, its performance is at a very high level.  Do not forget about his camera.  Despite the fact that, unlike the flagship, it is only 8 MP, the image quality is kept at a very good level.  Moreover, no matter what time of day it was during the shooting.  Very convenient are the new programs.  As for the sound and communication, they are also up to the mark.  Do not forget that we considered only a budget version of the smartphone, the price of which does not exceed 300 dollars.  And for such a price it is not always possible to find a high-quality device that can fully satisfy your needs. </p><p>  It is clear that this LG d618 G2 mini white phone is not a clear leader among smartphones in terms of its characteristics, but it was produced as a competitor to similar smartphones from other companies.  And we can say with confidence that this product is a very interesting option for those who do not have money for the LG G2, but they like its design. </p>
