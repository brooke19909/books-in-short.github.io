On-board systems for diagnosing and tuning a foreign and domestic vehicle filled the market.  Naturally, buyers had questions about which computer to choose and how to properly configure it.  If everything is clear with the latter - you just need to study the operating instructions, then things are worse with the choice of model. </p>

    <p>  The focus of this article is one of the representatives of on-board computers in the domestic market - "Multitronics TS 750".  This device, judging by the reviews of the owners, really resembles its PC appearance.  The reader is invited to familiarize themselves with the functionality of the on-board computer, its technical characteristics and user experiences before making a purchase. </p><h2>  Advertising is the engine of progress </h2><p>  Better start with a product description by the manufacturer.  The beautiful packaging shows the basic functionality of the device with the listed technical characteristics, which should attract the attention of a potential buyer.  But, as practice shows, in the domestic market, everything happens quite the opposite.  The Russian buyer is well versed in modern technology and will certainly notice the advertisement that extol the <span>on-board computer</span> "Multitronics TS 750": </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Powerful 32-bit processor.  In fact, for the second decade, 64-bit crystals are considered to be productive. </li><li>  A lot of informative displays.  In fact, there is only one display, and on it, like on any other monitor, you can configure windows to display information. </li><li>  Support for all protocols for diagnostics.  The computer can be programmed as you like - the main thing is that the car has the appropriate controllers. </li></ol><p>  And there are plenty of such inconsistencies in the description.  It is unclear why the manufacturer made such an advertisement, because the device already attracts attention with its worthy functionality and ease of use. </p><h2>  First meeting </h2><p>  The Multitronics TS 750 computer is offered in colorful cardboard packaging, like all similar car accessories on the market.  Inside, in addition to the device itself, the buyer will find a plastic pocket for convenient installation of the on-board computer, a cable from the wires, an instruction manual and several plates of double-sided tape.  As users note in their reviews, the equipment is complete, and there are no complaints about it. </p>

    <p>  As for the quality of manufacture and assembly of an automobile accessory, things are a little different here.  The device is completely made of plastic, and the wall thickness of the device leaves much to be desired.  Therefore, many users recommend securely fastening the on-board computer to the dashboard of the car with double-sided tape. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Connect a bot computer </h2><p>  The instruction manual included with the ‚ÄúMultitronics TS 750‚Äù device makes it clear to the user that the car accessory can be installed immediately, barely removed from the box (competitors' products have recently been supplied with CD-ROMs rather than paper versions of the manual).  Installing an on-board computer is simple and does not require special skills: </p><ul><li>  <span>double-sided tape is</span> glued on the car panel; </li><li>  the plastic protective cover of the on-board computer is glued; </li><li>  a loop of wires is threaded through a plastic frame and connected to the OBD2 connector of the car; </li><li>  the computer is securely fastened in a protective casing. </li></ul><p>  Everything is easy and simple.  There is no need to start additional wires for ignition or to remove power from the battery.  There are only questions about the sensitivity of the virtual lock, because it is different for all cars.  However, the instructions contain a description of the procedure for setting this parameter. </p><h2>  Setting Fine Settings </h2><p>  Before the owners of the car there are 2 ways of development of events related to the use of the on-board computer "Multitronics TS 750".  The instruction describes the ability to fine-tune the device, with the introduction of real data and a complete diagnosis of the car.  However, there are users who in the old fashioned way use the ‚ÄúI know everything‚Äù method and configure the parameters they need without assistance.  Hence the negatives in the media regarding the inoperability of the on-board computer. </p>

    <p>  At the first connection, the device independently determines the controller of the car and displays its name on the display.  Often, a computer determines a typical universal device that fits many other brands of cars.  Therefore, the user needs to specify the exact name of the controller in the parameters.  For example, the computer has detected a "CAN bus", but in fact there is a "M74CAN" bus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Curious symbioses </h2><p>  On the first pages of the operating manual, the manufacturer mentions the possibilities of connecting the Multitronics TS 750 on-board computer to a PC or laptop.  Naturally, dropping the device settings, the user will be interested to provide control of the car from a mobile device.  But this only happens in films, but the ability to connect an on-board computer to a laptop is limited only by analyzing the set parameters, importing settings, and editing some parameters of the device. </p>

    <p>  Maybe in the coming years they will invent the possibility of driving a car through the OBD2 port, but so far the symbiosis with the computer ends with the diagnosis and transfer of ready-made configurations between on-board devices of the same modifications. </p><h2>  Speech synthesizer </h2><p>  Before setting up the "Multitronics TS 750", the owner should learn about the specific features of the car accessory.  Neither on the box, nor in the introductory part of the instruction says anything about voice alerts that the device is capable of publishing.  <span>Speech synthesizer,</span> judging by user reviews, may unpleasantly surprise a car enthusiast - not everyone will be happy to hear a loud female voice in the car after a half-hour setup of the on-board computer. </p><p>  As for the speech synthesizer itself, there are no questions about its work.  Sound warnings are really needed in the electronic system of the car.  Any breakdown, malfunction or change of parameters for the worse will not go unnoticed by the user.  It only takes a little time for the car owner to get used to the voice alert. </p><h2>  Raw device functionality </h2><p>  One of the main problems of all users is how to connect the Multitronics TS 750 to the fuel system for monitoring fuel consumption.  The on-board computer control panel provides several ways, but their functionality raises many doubts among motorists.  For many, it is not the best option to take readings of the sensor built into the tank.  The fact is that different volumes are displayed at different angles of the machine.  Moreover, it is measured in tens of liters of fuel. </p>

    <p>  Experts recommend that users abandon the manufacturer‚Äôs ready-made solutions for reading data from the fuel system controllers and use the only proven way - to enter data manually.  Yes, after each refueling, you need to make changes to the on-board computer.  The technique is resource-intensive, but 100% effective. </p><h2>  Informative display </h2><p>  A huge LCD screen is what attracts the attention of users to the on-board computer "Multitronics TS 750".  Connection, setup and diagnostics are not possible without an informative display.  Let the screen diagonal is only 2.4 inches, and the resolution does not exceed 320 x 240 dpi, but this is enough to fully work with a car accessory. </p><p>  If everything is clear with the setting (you need to scroll through the menu items and select the necessary parameters), then with the display of information on the display, many questions arise.  It is worth noting that here, in fact, there is nothing complicated.  You just need to combine the necessary indicators by groups, and then decide in what sequence and how many parameters on the screen you need to display information on the display. </p><h2>  Additional functionality </h2><p>  For many motorists, the installation of "Multitronics TS 750" is inextricably linked with the installation of parking radars.  The fact is that the on-board computer supports the operation of these wonderful devices at the hardware level.  Therefore, it is not surprising that many buyers prefer to purchase such a kit.  There are no problems with installation and configuration, the main thing is to always remember that the on-board computer works with a pair of identical parking radars, from the same Multitronics brand. </p>

    <p>  The device also supports operation in the oscilloscope mode, however, for this it is necessary to purchase a special cable.  Many motorists recommend abandoning this functionality to ordinary owners.  The fact is that to work with data obtained as a result of monitoring the entire system, knowledge in electronics is also needed.  Beginners will not be able to fix breakdowns in a car without a specialist. </p><h2>  Advanced Diagnostics </h2><p>  In fact, you can talk for hours about the functionality of the Multitronics TS 750 computer.  The instruction manual, albeit briefly, but still describes all the features of the on-board computer.  About 200 operating parameters of the car is far from a myth for this car accessory.  Whatever the operation of the system, everything can be diagnosed and tuned: the fuel system, engine operation, electrical equipment and other car functionality, the existence of which the user did not even suspect. </p><p>  Of the additional parameters, the motorist will like the ability to manually adjust <span>the ignition timing.</span>  After all, every driver wants his car to drive faster.  Warming candles, managing a large cooling circle, initializing the computer - the entire car system is in the hands of the owner of the on-board computer "Multitronics TS 750". </p><h2>  Feedback </h2><p>  Advertising is good, but most potential buyers would like to see the reviews of the real owners of the car accessory.  The advantages of an on-board computer include huge functionality.  Not that motorists actively use all the features, rather, on the contrary - out of two hundred settings, only a dozen functions are interesting.  The advantage of this device is that each customer will find the parameters he needs, the access to which Multitronics TS 750 can provide.  User reviews attributed to the advantages and ease of installation with the ability to quickly connect. </p>

    <p>  But the optional functionality was met negatively.  Universal on-board computer lost its appeal immediately after the introduction of restrictions by the manufacturer regarding the use of parking radars of other brands.  And the number of sensors is very confusing for motorists (only 2). </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  On the on-board computer market, the product that can provide the buyer with more functionality wins.  The device "Multitronics TS 750" is a confirmation of this, because it is he who is able to satisfy any motorist with his own capabilities.  Yes, there are negative reviews regarding the operation of some sensors, but this is already a problem of the car itself, and not the on-board computer.  The same monitoring of fuel in the tank, a strange oscilloscope and control of lighting devices cause a feeling of inferiority, but there are still many more advantages. </p>
