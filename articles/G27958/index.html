    <p>  Lipetsk region is located 400 kilometers from the capital.  The location of the park on Google Earth coordinates is 52.367494.38.766142.  You can get here from Moscow along the M4 highway, passing the village of Voronovo, but not reaching Zadonsk.  There will be a right turn in the direction of Kamenka and Alekseevka.  Then we go until we see the sign “Kudykina Gora”.  The Lipetsk region meets us with a lot of direction signs to this cultural object, so you won’t get lost.  There is a parking lot near the park; the entrance to it is also marked.  There are a lot of places on the site - enough for everyone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mode of operation </h2>

    <p>  Kudykina Gora Children's Park (Lipetsk Region) is open on all weekdays and holidays, except Mondays.  It opens at 10 a.m., and closes at 8 p.m.  Entrance to the property is free.  During rains, the park is closed, so before leaving, it is better to check the weather by phone - the park administrator will answer all your questions (8-960-140-50-00).  Calls are accepted on business days strictly from 10.00 to 17.00. </p><h2>  How the park is arranged: Scythian fortress </h2><p>  This is a huge territory among meadows and fields.  On a large hill stands a huge wooden structure, either the Kremlin or the fortress.  This is the first thing that catches your eye even from the road passing under the sign "Kudykina Gora".  Lipetsk region has a rich history.  According to archaeologists, the Sarmatians lived here for a long time, before the arrival of the Mongol-Tatars there were many ancient cities.  Maybe that’s why the organizers of the park built this facility here.  It is called the Scythian fortress.  Inside the building, fairs of masters take place on weekends and holidays, the entrance costs 50 rubles.  Here various crafts of Russia are presented, in each shop you can see and even try to make some trinket yourself, for example, to mold a clay pot.  You can also purchase souvenirs.  On weekdays, no one is here, but the children are free and free, they can run around, climb stairs to the walls and so on.  You can tell the guys that before, we mostly built wooden houses, but they often burned, so now all the structures are made of concrete and glass.  “Kudykina Gora, Lipetsk Region, 2014” - such a photo in your family album, especially if it was taken against the background of the Scythian fortress, will take pride of place and after a few years will bring beautiful memories of an interesting vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kudykina Gora Lipetsk region 2014" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455218.jpg" width="600"></div>

There are always a lot of kids on the beach who splash in the water with screams and run on the sand.  For adults, the lake will be small, but the kids just right.  In fact, swimming is prohibited here, as there are no changing cabins and rescuers, this is stated on special signs established by the administration of the Kudykina Gora park.  The Lipetsk region is characterized by very hot summers, as a result of which no prohibitions can stop the kids.  And on the beach of the lake is always a full house. </p><p>  The purity of the water and the coastal zone inspire deep respect for the administration of this cultural property.  Every Sunday at 13.00 on the lake an animated performance is played - a water battle.  A very exciting sight!  Here is such a park "Kudykina Gora" (Lipetsk region).  The photos presented in the article demonstrate the sights of this object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kudykina Gora Park" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455219.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Playground </h2><p>  To the left of the parking lot is a playground.  Its size is impressive - it is a huge pile of various elements: turrets, climbing frames, slides, cable reels, spiral pipes, swings and other things.  Entrance to this zone is possible only barefoot, shoes are left at the entrance.  As a coating - fine sand.  Most likely, your child will never forget that he was on the playground in the park "Kudykina Gora" (Lipetsk region).  Visitors' comments about this building come down to the fact that they have not yet seen such a huge object.  Similar playgrounds can be found in the resorts of Malaysia, and in our country there are no equal to it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kudykina gora how to get there" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455220.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Safari Corral </h2><p>  Past the playground, the path leads to a huge corral.  It contains ostriches, camels, rams, yaks, etc. Animals come to fences, allow themselves to be fed and stroked.  On the territory of the "safari" you can ride a horse-drawn cart.  Those who wish are offered pony rides, donkeys, horses and camels.  On the lawn, outside the fence, goats graze.  All children consider it their duty to shove at least a little cabbage into them, so that these animals are more like piglets.  Further down the path there is a source, ducks and other birds swim here, there is also a bathing place for people.  For those who are not too interested in animals, there are trampolines here, however, the line for them is longer than for a pony. </p><h2>  Other </h2><p>  At the entrance to the park they sell kvass for bottling, ice cream, there is one cafe where you can relax and have a bite.  At the entrance there is a hut - this is a bookstore.  Bringing animals into the park is prohibited.  In addition, smoking is strictly prohibited on site.  At the request of the client, here you can organize a birthday for your child with an animated presentation.  In winter, you can go sledding, skiing and snowboarding here.  The disadvantages include the fact that there is little shade in the park, you can easily overheat on a sunny day, which, by the way, explains the great popularity of the lake, since there is simply no other way to cool.  There are few toilets, given the number of visitors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="kudykina mountain lipetsk region reviews" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455221.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <p>  The advantage is that everything is in one place: animals, a lake, and a playground.  Be sure to visit the park "Kudykina Gora" (Lipetsk region).  The photos in this article will help you make up your mind about this cultural site.  The place is simple, without any frills, unobtrusive, but this is its charm.  They do not sell cotton candy and all kinds of trinkets at every step, such as balloons.  Everything has been done here in such a way that the children rest, and do not pump out all their cash reserves from their parents.  You just enjoy the rustic surroundings and spaciousness.  In the city, all playgrounds huddle in a limited space, but there is scope here.  When you get here, at first it even haunts some kind of feeling of indifference, and then you begin to have fun. </p><h2>  Etymology of phraseological circulation </h2><p>  The expression “to Kudykina Gora” was used earlier and is being used now in order to interrupt the questioning of too curious passers-by.  His appearance is associated with the long-standing traditions and prohibitions (taboos) of our ancestors, who believed that there were many spirits and all kinds of dishonesty annoying good people on the domestic expanses.  Therefore, to say out loud where you are going was a bad sign, so you had to laugh it off like that.  In fact, such an answer is a gentle indication to the interlocutor where he should go.  Previously, this was enough for an outsider to stop poking nose in your affairs, now it may not be enough.  As they say, you don’t have time to show our man “Kuzkin’s mother”, so he is already interested in “where the crayfish hibernate”.  The etymology of the word is quite transparent, it comes from the adverb “kuda” (“where”). </p><p>  According to another version, the origin of phraseology is also associated with the ancient beliefs and way of life of the Slavs.  According to her, “Kudykiny Gory” is the habitat of the so-called magicians - the Magi.  People went to them for advice or help in difficult times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lipetsk Kudykina Gora" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/455222.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  So where is this notorious mountain? </h2><p>  We have already examined the modern object - Lipetsk ("Kudykina Gora"), however, there are other geographical versions of its location.  The first of them: in Crimea, near Feodosia there was an ancient monastery of John the Baptist, it was located just on a mountain with such a strange name.  Near the monastery are the ruins of the Armenian-Kipchak fortress, destroyed in the Middle Ages.  The second version is the Moscow Region.  Here since ancient times, there are two villages called Kudykino and Gora.  They are located next door. </p><p>  But which version is the most correct, it's hard to say, choose for yourself. </p>
