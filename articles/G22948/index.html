  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which phone is better. Model Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Almost every day, we watch on television an advertisement that the next improved model of a mobile phone went on sale.  And what is there only already in them!  And the camera, and the camcorder, and the music player, and the TV ... But before, even a trivial calculator was considered a real innovation.  Nowadays, manufacturers of modern technical devices are measured mainly by the size of colorful touch displays, incredible amounts of memory (which sometimes exceed the characteristics of some full-fledged home computers), as well as the number of cores of built-in processors.  And everything is so beautiful, unusual and alluring that eyes just run up. </p><p>  And now, you have a need to purchase a mobile phone.  Surely, the question immediately appeared about which <span>phone is better.</span>  It is not surprising, because everyone has different requirements for devices of this type.  Today we will highlight several basic categories of people in accordance with their preferences in technology and advise the most suitable option for a mobile phone. </p><ol><li>  Just call.  Yes, despite the obsessiveness of seductive advertising, there are still enough people for whom a mobile phone is, above all, a means of communication.  And by no means only people of <span>advanced age</span> prefer the latest models with a simple and convenient option to use with a minimum set of functions.  Business people who use a mobile phone only for calls to partners do not make any special requests for the size of the screen and the presence of built-in applications.  They are best suited to budget options, the cost of which usually does not exceed 2000 - 3000 rubles.  They hold a charge well and provide high quality communications.  Also, such a phone is difficult to break or damage, it is more hardy in extreme conditions.  Can you relate yourself to this category of consumers?  We decided to buy a device easier, but do not know which one yet?  A good <span>budget-</span> class <span>phone is</span> hiding under the brands of Samsung and Nokia.  They have already established themselves as high-quality mobile phone manufacturers.  Also, their models often have the function of using simultaneously two SIM cards at once, which is especially important for business people. </li><li>  Cinema and music center in your pocket.  Which phones are best for movie and music lovers?  When buying, pay attention to the <span>screen resolution,</span> which should be as high as possible.  The speakers should sound loud, clear and not distort sounds.  The size of the display also matters: the larger the better.  Prefer models with large internal memory or a slot for cards.  Most of these options are now, but their price range is quite high. </li><li>  Tribute to fashion.  Here is one piece of advice.  If you want to be always in trend - buy the sensational iPhone.  This miracle of technology is now at the height of fashion and is especially appreciated by young people.  Representatives of club life do not wonder about which phone is better.  They just buy Apple products. </li><li>  Computer in miniature.  Do you want to always have convenient access to the Internet with you, but laptops and tablets are too bulky for you?  Use your device.  Which phone would be better to get in this case?  Of course, with a large screen, high-quality sensor and built-in applications such as a browser.  You can safely take the Samsung Galaxy Note as an example. </li><li>  Active life.  Did your phones die a brave death, drowning in a mountain river or falling from a cliff?  Choose a model according to your lifestyle.  Her body must be well protected from shock, dust and dirt.  The screen should have a special coating that will prevent scratches (the inscription <span>Gorilla Glass</span> in the characteristics of the device is the best option).  A special chic is a phone with a display, which is not scary to drive with wet fingers.  Sensors, as a rule, do not live long with such treatment.  Many manufacturers have similar models, but most of them are concentrated among Sony brand products, as well as among its smartphones with the Xperia prefix (for example, Xperia Go).  Do you want the most honest answer to the question about which phone is better for an active person?  Take <span>Nokia 3310, you</span> will not lose.  This model has never "died" from careless hands.  Simple, but as reliable as possible. </li></ol>
