In 2015, the phablet of Huawei was released.  The development was carried out jointly with Google.  Huawei Nexus 6P 32Gb (reviews about the characteristics read below) almost immediately after the release became the top.  Many buyers opted for it because the gadget used a large number of innovative developments. </p><p>  This article will provide an overview of the phablet.  Also, the reader will be able to read reviews of not only customers, but also experts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nexus 6p reviews" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638253.jpg" width="560"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  A large list of benefits can be identified by studying the reviews.  Huawei Nexus 6P has a metal case.  This material helps to prevent the formation of cracks in the fall and other mechanical damage.  The model is also equipped with a high-quality AMOLED screen.  And thanks to the use of a modern processor, the developers were able to achieve high performance.  For protection, a fingerprint scanner was installed on the device.  By activating this option, only the owner can unlock the phone.  Joint development with Google provides users with an update to the system and other programs in the first place.  Thanks to this, the owners of this smartphone will always use only the latest software versions.  Surprisingly, the resolution of the cameras can hardly be called amazing, but in 2015 such parameters were considered among the best.  The battery life also exceeded all customer expectations, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Huawei Nexus 6P is equipped with a 3450 mAh battery.  The developers optimized the processes as much as possible, which affected the duration of the gadget without recharging. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  What disadvantages do customers talk about in their reviews?  Looking ahead, it is worth noting that they are quite typical.  For some reason, the developers did not bother about the bright design.  There are no interesting elements, so you can not call the appearance of the model original.  Many buyers were disappointed by the lack of a slot for a removable drive, so it is recommended to pay attention to the amount of internal memory.  This indicator is indicated in the name of the model, for example, Huawei Nexus 6P 32Gb.  User reviews and comments often relate to the topic of the USB connector.  In the device, developers have implemented a new type of port.  Currently, it is not yet widespread, so many owners attribute this criterion to disadvantages.  The lack of a second SIM card earned the most complaints.  Given the considerable cost, such shortcomings have become quite critical.  If you pay attention to competitors, for example, iPhone 6s Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 5, then the manufacturer had to try to get rid of contentious issues as much as possible and present the buyer with a truly perfect gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nexus 6p 32gb reviews" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638254.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rating </h2><p>  The device entering the market is evaluated not only by customers, but also by experts.  According to the latter, the smartphone Huawei Nexus 6P on a five-point scale scored 4.1.  The biggest comments concerned multimedia, dimensions and design, the Internet.  The highest rating, according to experts, deserves memory and communication. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The following are statistics on ratings.  The average score of 4.1 is derived based on the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  Dimensions and design - 3. 9. </li><li>  Multimedia - 2.6. </li><li>  Battery - 3.6. </li><li>  Internet 3.0. </li><li>  Work with text files - 4.0. </li><li>  Screen Features - 4.5. </li><li>  The camera resolution is 4.7. </li><li>  Productivity - 4.9. </li><li>  Communications - 5. 0. </li><li>  Memory - 5.0. </li></ul><p>  Now let's look at each item in more detail. </p><h2>  Dimensions and Design </h2><p>  Phone Huawei Nexus 6P is considered a full-fledged phablet.  According to many buyers, it is truly huge.  Its dimensions: 159.3 √ó 77.8 √ó 7.7 mm.  Holding it and simultaneously controlling it with one hand will fail.  Even an adult man will not be able to cope with this.  In order not to accidentally drop it and make full use of all the functionality, you will have to use both hands.  It also weighs a lot - 180 g. </p><p>  The choice of design by the developers did not cause a flurry of emotions among buyers and experts.  Many believe that he is far from outstanding.  The front panel looks quite typical and even boring.  The only thing that can be distinguished here is the presence of two speakers located above and below.  The frame around the screen is proportional.  However, at first glance it may seem quite wide.  This is evidenced by reviews.  Huawei Nexus 6P is equipped with a screen, which occupies about 70% of the entire front panel area.  At the back, the smartphone looks more interesting.  On the lid, the manufacturer used a combination of several materials.  Most of the surface is metal, and at the top is a plastic strip of black with a glossy surface.  It has a camera lens, flash and sensors.  Immediately below it you can see the microphone hole. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The case is not folding.  For this reason, the developers brought the nano-type SIM card slot to the side.  There are no comments on the build quality, it is at a high level.  Many owners noticed that the case is practically not afraid of anything.  However, over time, if you wear a smartphone, for example, along with keys, shallow scratches may form.  The assortment contains three colors: silver, white and black. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nexus 6p specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638268.jpg" width="529"></div>

    <h2>  Huawei Nexus 6P: features and reviews on the screen </h2><p>  This model will delight owners with a high quality screen.  Display Type - AMOLED.  Resolution: 2560 √ó 1440 pixels.  Its diagonal is 5.7 inches.  Due to the pixel density of 518 ppi, the image displayed on the screen is as clear as possible, graininess and other noises are completely absent.  In the sun there will be no problems with the display, the information on it is well read, the brightness level does not decrease.  An adaptive adjustment function is provided.  It allows you to automatically adjust the brightness level.  Users noticed that the viewing angles are quite wide.  You cannot adjust the screen contrast, as this option is not provided by the manufacturer.  About the color rendition only laudatory reviews are written.  Huawei Nexus 6P in this matter will satisfy even the most demanding user.  The maximum number of different shades is displayed on the screen.  They look natural and rich.  No calibration notes.  The only thing that is not provided for in this phone is the gloved control, the sensor responds only to the touch of fingers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone Huawei nexus 6p 32gb" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638306.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The phablet has excellent cameras.  Frontal resolution is 8 megapixels.  At the core of the rear is a 12-megapixel matrix.  The manufacturer used laser focusing, a wide aperture and a large sensor.  Unfortunately, there is no optical stabilization system.  This is due to the fact that modern optics works with large pixels, so this option is no longer necessary.  However, experts believe that this explanation is more like an excuse, since stabilization is still used in many professional cameras. </p><p>  The main camera interface is simple and straightforward.  The user on the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the viewfinder will see a minimum of icons and settings.  There is an HDR + mode.  It operates at a fairly fast speed and is able to detail shaded areas.  Thanks to this, only a few can compare with the Huawei Nexus 6P.  Reviews of the owners about the quality of the images are only laudatory.  Also, users separately highlighted such modes as ‚ÄúPanorama‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlur‚Äù.  Using the latter, you can take a picture with a blurred background.  A feature of this camera is that even the smallest elements look crisp and quite sharp.  Noise in the photo appears only during filming in low light, usually at night. </p><p>  Using the rear camera, you can shoot 4K video.  Maximum available resolution: 1280 √ó 720 px.  Recording clips is carried out at a speed of 120 frames per second. </p><p>  The front camera is ideal for selfie lovers.  Detailing, focusing, lack of noise - the advantages of optics installed on the gadget.  The 8-megapixel matrix allows you to record video in Full HD.  However, in comparison with the main camera, the speed is somewhat lower.  It is 30 frames per second. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone huawei nexus 6p" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638323.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard.  Work with text files </h2><p>  Not surprised users with a keyboard from Google.  It is more than standard and does not have any remarkable elements.  The model provides continuous input support.  The user can switch languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith a separate key.  Marking is provided only for the top row with numbers.  Domestic buyers are grateful to the developers for not forgetting to provide the keys for the period and comma, displaying them separately on the keyboard. </p><h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  What will allow you to do a complete, and most importantly, a true review of Huawei Google Nexus 6P?  Owner reviews and test results.  Many users were unsatisfied with the standard "stuffing".  Why?  The manufacturer has installed only one browser.  Few will be surprised to know that this is Google Chrome.  Given the considerable amount of RAM (3 GB), you can be sure of a fairly high functionality.  Even if you open several tabs, the device will be excellent, and, most importantly, cope with the tasks with high speed.  Users are allowed to install another browser.  The disadvantages include the lack of synchronization with the desktop version of Google Chrome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="huawei nexus 6p review" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  The highest score, according to experts, was given to communications.  The phablet is equipped with a full flagship set.  The only thing that upsets users is the lack of a slot for a second SIM card.  What communications are offered in this model? </p><ul><li>  Wi-Fi - dual-band, fully compliant with modern requirements. </li><li>  Bluetooth version 4.2.  It is considered quite economical, which is impeccably a plus.  Also, the A2DP profile support option did not go unnoticed. </li><li>  The smartphone works with networks of mobile operators of the 4th generation. </li><li>  There is an A-GPS function.  The accuracy of the determination of the parameters is carried out thanks to the support of GLONASS. </li></ul><p>  For some reason, the developers decided to abandon the standard microUSB connector by installing USB Type C. Using it, you can connect to other gadgets and also charge the battery.  An adapter for a standard port is provided in the kit with which the smartphone Huawei Nexus 6P is equipped.  Reviews published on the network testify to the popularity of the gadget.  In them you can often find information about this adapter.  Owners advise to treat it rather carefully and in no case to lose it, since in the free sale it practically does not happen. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  According to experts, multimedia is the weakest point of this gadget.  A low rating was set due to the fact that the device works with a small set of audio and video codecs.  For example, the formats FLAC, TS, MOV, RMVB are not supported.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that some AVI files also cannot be played.  The audio player installed by the developers is rather boring and standard.  The interface is confusing.  Many users complain.  The demo is accompanied by annoying ads.  In order to get additional features and remove pop-ups, you need to purchase a paid version.  A video player is not provided in this gadget.  Only Google Foto is integrated.  Thanks to him, you can perform some actions, however, you should not rely on great functionality.  The sound quality is average.  Music is approximately equally played both through the speakers and through the headset. </p><h2>  Huawei Nexus 6P: review and battery specifications </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the smartphone is equipped with a 3450 mAh battery.  You cannot call him weak.  Within 7 hours, you can watch video in HD-quality, while using the maximum brightness level settings.  Users noticed that you can increase battery life in this mode by about a couple of hours.  To do this, you need to lower the brightness and enable the "On Airplane" mode. </p><p>  The advantage of this gadget was the new version of Android - the sixth.  Due to this, in standby mode and with a small load, not every modern device can compare in the battery life.  If you use the phone as a player by connecting a headset, then the battery will last about 102 hours. </p><p>  During the game, the Nexus 6P also showed itself on the good side.  At maximum brightness, the phone can work up to 5 hours.  Such a result can be considered above average.  In their reviews, the owners claim that with an average load the device can withstand a day and a half.  For extreme purposes, you can use the power saving mode.  Operating time is extended up to 40 hours.  When this mode is activated, the device reduces productivity, disables geolocation, background data transfer, leaving only the most basic functions.  The developers took care of the possibility of fast charging. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone Huawei nexus 6p" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1638324.jpg" width="520"></div>

    <h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The "filling" of the Nexus 6P can rightly be called the top.  The amount of RAM is 3 GB.  Such storage is quite enough for the smartphone to cope perfectly with any tasks and applications.  During testing, the device showed flawless results.  The case did not heat up, there were no freezes.  Excellent performance is provided thanks to a processor consisting of 8 cores - Qualcomm MSM8994 Snapdragon model.  The layout is of type 4 + 4.  Thanks to this, it became possible to optimize all processes.  Four cores operate with a frequency of 2.0 GHz, the rest with 1.55 GHz.  Adreno 430 GPU is responsible for the quality of the information displayed on the screen. </p><p>  On sale there is a smartphone Huawei Nexus 6P 32Gb and two modifications.  The standard version is equipped with 32 GB of internal memory.  The other two versions use 64 and 128 GB of storage.  Buyers are advised to pay attention to the lack of a slot for a memory card.  Therefore, the optimal indicators of the volume of storage must be considered in advance in accordance with the goals.  In the Huawei Nexus 6P 64Gb (a review of the model is based on expert and user reviews) of the 64 GB user will be available about 53. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Summing up, it must be said that the Nexus 6P model was developed by a Chinese manufacturer in conjunction with Google.  The developers installed Android 6.0 on it.  However, despite updating the version of the operating system, there are no special chips in it.  Users have no comments on the operation of the fingerprint scanner.  Many liked the ability to launch the camera by double-clicking on the power button.  The sensor is excellent, it responds quickly.  The highlight of this model is the USB connector of the new standard.  It is not yet widespread, therefore, the manufacturer in the kit offers an adapter.  The cost of the phablet is quite high, at the time of release, the price for it started from the mark of 500 dollars. </p>
