The fact is that there are no Tinkoff branches throughout the country.  Branded ATMs are also absent.  How does it work and what is the benefit for users? </p><p>  Tinkoff was founded as a Wells Fargo bank, which used a remote customer service model.  Entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov suggested that this method of work can be implemented in Russia.  As a result, Tinkoff Bank was founded.  Over 10 years, new products were created, the level of service was improved. </p>

Customers give positive feedback on deposits: the bank has one of the highest interest rates. </p><h2>  Cash withdrawal </h2><p>  Probably everyone who has at least one payment card knows the problem of cashing money.  In search of a ‚Äúnative‚Äù ATM, precious minutes, and sometimes even hours, are spent.  Tinkoff customers do not know such a problem.  Despite the fact that, in principle, a Tinkoff ATM does not exist, cardholders easily withdraw money in any other device without thinking about which organization it belongs to.  And all because customers have no difference where to cash out: the commission is either not charged at all, or the same everywhere. </p>

    <p>  For users of Tinkoff Black there is also a referral program.  For each customer brought, a reward of 500 rubles is due. </p><h2>  Negative points </h2><p>  Reviews about the Tinkoff Black card are mostly good, but not everyone liked it.  The objectives of opening a bank account are different for everyone, and requests for a package of services, too.  What are some Tinkoff Black users disappointed with?  The main reasons for dissatisfaction with the card are as follows: </p><ul><li>  conditions for receiving remuneration for storing funds - someone uses the card only as a deposit, and for 8% per annum you need to make purchases; </li><li>  maintenance cost (1200 rubles per year); </li><li>  overstated minimum withdrawal amount without commission; </li><li>  a large number of conditions and requirements that affect the amount of commissions and remuneration. </li></ul><h2>  Tinkoff Credit Card: User Reviews </h2><p>  Credit cards are a predominant part of the work of Tinkoff Bank.  Getting a loan here is easy enough: fill out an online form and wait for the operator to call.  Approve it almost always, the bank is not afraid to work with unsecured loans.  But this is more than offset by the interest rate, which in reality is more than 40%. </p>

    <p>  The leader among the credit cards of this bank is Tinkoff Platinum.  Customer reviews about her are contradictory.  On the one hand, such benefits as cashback (1%), low cost of annual maintenance (590 rubles), and a grace period (55 days) are noted.  On the other hand, many users are concerned about the ease of obtaining a loan; they are not happy with the high interest rate from 30 to 45% per annum.  Many conditions and exceptions to them spoil the impression, which affect the amount of loan payments. </p><p>  An interesting option to save and increase money is the Tinkoff Black debit card.  Reviews, terms of receipt and use were fully considered in the article.  The reader only needs to understand how acceptable the requirements of the bank are, and whether he needs such a payment card.  Like any other banking plastic, Tinkoff Black was created for certain purposes - the accumulation and active use of funds.  Only when these conditions are met, the card will be beneficial for its owner. </p>
