To the surprise of many buyers, the U10 and U20 models were released, which became one of the most popular, as they have a number of distinctive features.  The article will focus on the U20 version. </p>

    <h2>  Design and usability </h2><p>  Even before the presentation of the device, it became clear that the Chinese manufacturer decided to update the appearance of their gadgets.  The U20 phone seemed truly fresh, and all buyers said: the attempt to create changes was successful. </p><p>  Most of Meizu's products are made of plastic and metal.  The described model is made of glass.  It has a metal frame, which creates a unique look.  The device is sold in three different shades: black, gold and white.  There is also an option with a white panel on the face and a pink back surface. </p><p>  All other details are completely in the style of the manufacturer.  The front panel is symmetrical, as evidenced by the characteristics of the Meizu U20 phone.  Above the screen there is a control key.  A fingerprint sensor is built into it.  In addition, the button allows you to exit to the home screen or return to the previous menu.  The front-facing camera and sensors are located on either side of the speaker.  The indicator of missed notifications is located under the glass, and it is difficult to see it in the off state. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the left side is a slot for SIM cards and an external drive.  On the right is a button to turn on the phone and adjust the sound level.  On the top panel, the user can find the second microphone, and all the connectors and speaker are located on the bottom.  These are common characteristics of Meizu U20 16 Gb and 32 Gb. </p><p>  This is not to say that this phone is perfectly assembled, but overall it is not bad.  The metal frame is made of several parts.  Typically, such solutions are found in low-cost phones.  The difference between them and the U20 is that all the parts are perfectly made and sized.  The joints are invisible. </p><p>  The phone is beautiful, but the usability is average.  The device has a rectangular shape, the corners are rounded.  This is not to say that such a solution would be ideal for a phone with a 5.5-inch screen. </p><p>  According to buyers, these shortcomings are fully compensated by the key under the screen and the ability to work with gestures.  The device may just not be happy with the keys - there are models with marriage, where their progress is a bit sluggish and slow. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Most of the front surface is a 5.5-inch screen.  A display is created from an IPS-type matrix with Full HD resolution.  This is stated by the characteristics and reviews of the Meizu U20.  It has a protective surface made of glass.  The edges are rounded, the coating is oleophobic type.  The developers did not try to create the effect of covering the display from edge to edge.  The matrix has a thin black frame.  The front panel is a white hue.  Users praised this design decision, calling it successful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Contrast and brightness are not at the best level, but the manufacturer is worth praising for their settings.  The owner will be able to quickly choose for himself the maximum indicator of any setting, regardless of where he is: on the street or in a dark room. </p><p>  The color rendering of the device is excellent.  The picture will not seem oversaturated or, on the contrary, dull.  The image is natural.  Built-in system for automatic brightness control.  It works correctly, but there are slight delays.  In general, the display is excellent. </p>

    <h2>  Hardware Platform, Runtime </h2><p>  <span>The Meizu</span> U20 <span>phone</span> (16 GB - the memory characteristics of the most popular modification) in terms of performance is a complete copy of the M3 Note device of the same manufacturer.  The gadget runs on a platform from MediaTek.  It is sold in two versions: 2/16 GB and 3/32 GB.  There are two lots for SIM cards and an external drive.  There is a working wireless signal module, bluetooth, navigation.  There is no radio, instead of a MicroUSB connector, Type-C is used.  However, many buyers do not notice these shortcomings. </p><p>  The provided equipment is quite enough to play and spend time in other demanding applications.  The phone will please you during normal everyday use, communication on social networks and so on. </p><p>  Characteristics and reviews of the Meizu U20 allow us to make a predictable conclusion that a decrease in battery power from 4100 to 3260 mAh affected the device‚Äôs operating time.  If you load the device at an average level, using a mobile signal, social networks and chat rooms, then the device will work for about a day.  At the same time, you can make a little call and take photos.  Buyers consider the operating time as a normal indicator, however, if the manufacturer optimized smartphones, then they could show better results. </p><p>  The speakers and overall playback are practically no different from the indicators that give out the M3 Note.  The sound is explosive, loud.  The phone has a good volume margin.  However, buyers note that the device produces a sharp reproduction.  The voices of the interlocutors may be perceived somewhat distorted.  In headphones, the quality is good and most buyers like it.  There is no sound chip, so this model is inferior to other flagships from Meizu. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u20 performance review" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2039009.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Software platform </h2><p>  A review of the characteristics of the Meizu U20 continues with a description of the software platform.  The phone runs on the Android operating system of the sixth version.  On top of it is installed a proprietary shell "Fly".  If you buy a Chinese version phone from Russia or Ukraine, then official sellers will take care of the customer‚Äôs maximum convenience - special Google localization and services will be installed. </p><p>  The manufacturer makes its platform as unlike other software as possible.  At the same time, the main operating system practically does not affect the functionality and experience with similar gadgets - it all depends on the version of Flyme. </p><p>  The shell is simple.  She got a minimalist design.  This is considered an advantage, according to buyers.  The system is controlled comfortably.  The key in the center of the bottom panel has the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù function when pressed.  If you touch it, then the person will go to the previous menu.  When held, the phone locks.  If you need to go into running applications, then you need to draw from the bottom to the top.  In general, these characteristics of the Meizu U20 are good. </p><p>  Many already advanced users are annoyed by certain nuances.  For example, the Google Now assistant is slow.  Many notifications either do not arrive or are delivered very late.  Icons of installed utilities have poor design, when compared with those applications that are embedded in the system. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  As in many other specifications, the U20 is completely similar to the one installed on the M3 Note.  The module - 13 megapixels, aperture - f / 2.2.  The flash has two sections, built-in autofocus.  The front camera received a 5 megapixel sensor.  The lens is wide-angle.  The characteristics of the Meizu U20 32 Gb or 16 Gb in this matter do not differ. </p><p>  In general, you need to understand that the camera is an ordinary module.  These are built into all modern phones.  At the same time, each manufacturer uses various technologies that provide good (or not so) image quality.  The camera of the described device takes excellent pictures in good lighting conditions.  But in difficult situations you can‚Äôt rely on her.  Photos will be bad, with a lot of distortion and noise.  However, for the price for which the manufacturer offers to buy a phone, all buyers put up with similar shortcomings.  Sometimes the quality of a photo can be improved by adjusting and using certain options, for example, controlling shutter speed, focus, and so on.  You can change the shooting modes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="meizu u20 photo specifications" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/2039010.jpg" width="600"></div>

Most of the specifications correspond to those presented earlier in the M3 Note device.  Impressions of using the phone are similar, except that the design is much better.  If the appearance for the buyer is one of the important criteria, then the described model should pay special attention.
