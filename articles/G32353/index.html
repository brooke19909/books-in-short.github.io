This hotel complex is often visited by tourists from the CIS. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tia heights makadi bay" class="if" height="247" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/734895.jpg" width="440"></div>  Judging by the reviews, most of which are positive, minor flaws in servicing guests still occur.  However, this circumstance is compensated by the more than affordable price of permits.  It is for April-May 2015 (for the landmark we took the cost of the tour for 2 adults for 7 nights with a flight from Moscow and back) is $ 950 for a Standard Dune Room and $ 1010 for a Lagoon Room (a detailed classification of hotel rooms will be presented below).  However, for a good rest, in addition to choosing a rating hotel, as you know, the choice of a reliable and responsible tour operator is also important.

    <p>  According to the recommendations of experienced holidaymakers looking for the best tour to Tia Heights Makadi Bay Hotel, a potential tourist should choose one that has been operating for at least three years and also has several branches in the country.  The most pragmatic Russian tourists prefer to minimize possible risks, so they buy a tour to Tia Heights Makadi Bay from the largest operators such as Pegasus, Sanmar, Coral, Intourist, Polar. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The location of the hotel.  Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel complex under consideration is thirty kilometers from Hurghada.  According to reviews, most customers like this privacy: a wonderful family vacation away from the bustle of the bustling resort town.  The hotel is located on the first line off the coast of Makadi Bay, in the middle of the resort of the same name.  The bay itself has sandy beaches, a bottom-relief conducive to relaxation, a unique underwater world that makes it attractive to divers. </p><p>  On the coast there are about ten five- and four-star chain hotels of international level.  The embankment of the hotel zone is a favorite place for the promenade of local holidaymakers.  Just read the reviews full of impressions of the oriental style of cafes, hookahs, restaurants, and it becomes clear: this place attracts tourists.  A common pedestrian area with restaurants, bars, shops, a disco is available for guests of any hotel, including Tia Heights Makadi Bay 5 *. </p><p>  The hotel complex under consideration is quite large.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãhis territory is impressive - 100,000 m <sup>2</sup> .  She is well maintained.  Tourists are accepted for accommodation by the hotel buildings located here: the main three-story building, 29 two-story cottages, 12 two-story villas, 9 four-story residential blocks. </p><p>  There is a water park on the territory of the hotel complex, consisting of a whole network of pools, among which there is a unique huge pool with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6400 m <sup>2</sup> .  The impressions of the spa guests are enthusiastic, some of them (fans of water games and sports swimming) even prefer this pool to the sea.  By the way, it is heated.  Tia Heights Makadi Bay 5 * thanks to a whole system of attractions (30 water slides here!) Is approaching the water park in terms of recreation infrastructure.  Therefore, sometimes the word "aquapark" is found in its name. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to the aforementioned super pool, the hotel has an outdoor heated pool adapted for children, as well as a closed one in which guests of the hotel complex can comfortably swim and swim even in the winter windy months. </p><p>  In addition to the beach and pools, the therapeutic capabilities of the Tia Heights Makadi Bay 5 * hotel are determined by the spa center operating here, where real professionals work.  This center is one of the best on the coast.  Here, in addition to the general thermal effect, hotel guests receive massage, aroma massage, peeling, and local spa treatments for the face. </p><p>  However, tourists who want to get the maximum range of services from a hotel-water park and purposefully buying a tour in it should be careful.  Indeed, in Makadi there is a four-star hotel with a similar name - Tia Heights Makadi Bay 4 *. </p><h2>  Types of living rooms </h2><p>  The large five-star hotel complex Tia Heights Makadi offers its guests 1,062 rooms equipped to meet the diverse needs of vacationers.

Hotel guests receive three meals a day in the main restaurant, as well as snacks and drinks (Egyptian alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  In the case of choosing the All Inclusive food concept, only imported alcoholic drinks, ice cream and fresh juices (freshly squeezed juices) are paid.  The broader concept of Ultra All Inclusive, in addition to all of the above, also includes a free dinner (by appointment) once in a hotel at the √† la carte restaurant.  Also, as part of the Ultra All Inclusive concept, a number of imported spirits are free for Tia Heights Makadi Bay Aqua guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tia heights makadi bay prices" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/734959.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the main restaurant "Aladdin", operating on the first and second floors of the main hotel building, the hotel complex also has four restaurants: fish, oriental, Chinese, Italian.  A la carte dinner is also available.  There is also a cafe, five bars and a hookah bar.  The latter is decorated in oriental style.  Comfortable sofas, Arabic paintings and unusual lamps adorn comfortable booths and several original rooms. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  The choice of tourists of this particular hotel is not least affected by the fact that its beach is one of the best in Makadi.  Tia Heights Makadi Bay (pay tribute to the staff) keeps him in excellent condition.  In the reviews of hotel guests, this well-groomed and well-maintained sand ribbon of 500 m in length with a smooth entrance to the sea is often mentioned with gratitude. </p><p>  All guests have enough umbrellas and sun loungers.  Near umbrellas, wind barriers are additionally equipped. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tia heights makadi bay aqua" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/734896.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  The sea itself in the water area of ‚Äã‚ÄãTia Heights Makadi Bay <strong> </strong>  very clean.  At a depth corals are found.  To the left of the beach is a small hotel pier, where boats moor.  A characteristic of Makadi is the constant windy weather.  The refreshing north breeze is pleasing, but when it is strengthened to a strong wind, especially in winter, rest at sea has to be limited. </p><p>  Animators work well on the beach, supporting a fun atmosphere and paying special attention to children. </p><h2>  Water park, slides, pools </h2><p>  Of course, a weighty argument in favor of choosing Tia Heights Makadi Bay Aqua is a water park.  Everything here is well maintained and beautiful.  Many hotel guests prefer to relax on its territory, rather than on the sea beach.  Moreover, there is the opportunity to dine right at the water park, after taking the coupons in the restaurant and presenting them to waiters scurrying around the pools. </p><p>  The work of the water park has its own characteristics.  Water is supplied to the slides from 10 <sup>00</sup> to 12 <sup>00</sup> and from 13 <sup>00</sup> to 17 <sup>00</sup> . </p><p>  Successful design of children's slides.  Kids really enjoy riding them.  Bathing in the water is comfortable: all children's and adult pools are heated. </p><p>  Tia Heights Makadi Bay Aquapark Staff <strong> </strong>  promptly responds to the wishes of hotel guests.  If something on the beach doesn‚Äôt suit you (for example, there aren‚Äôt enough rubber rings), it‚Äôs enough to tell the girl gurleleysheniye, she will call another employee and bring circles.  Particularly shy in this regard is not worth it. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  In addition to the classic hotel services provided by the hotel complex under consideration, tourists also use additional ones. </p><p>  Car enthusiasts who want to more actively get acquainted with the sights of the country of the pharaohs have the opportunity to rent a car.  Near the hotel there is a parking lot where you can park your car.  The highway from Makadi to Hurghada has one-way traffic.  But still, tourist drivers in the early days are experiencing a <span>cultural shock</span> from the average speed on the route of local drivers.  They most often rush at speeds under 180 km / h. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hurghada Tia Heights Makadi Bay" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/734957.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  To buy fruit, you can walk to the right side (facing the sea) from the Tia Heights Makadi Bay Hotel.  Prices <strong> </strong>  in two shops located there, noticeably (forty percent) lower than in a hotel complex store.  For example, a kilogram of mango costs $ 7 versus $ 12. </p><p>  It is possible to send and receive faxes, parcels and mail: the hotel has a post office.  For the convenience of guests there is free Wi-Fi. </p><p>  You can use the services of a business center and conference room, hold a business event.  Thanks to the modern office equipment and communication software provided by the hotel, the entrepreneur does not feel isolated from his usual sphere of business interests. </p><p>  Additional paid services (laundry, dry cleaning, family doctor services) are also available for guests of the Tia Heights Makadi Bay hotel complex.  The tour operator through its guides quite actively offers hotel guests a variety of excursions.  Moreover, guides (this is a common practice for all hotels), despite the obviously high excursion tariffs, are financially motivated to implement as many tourist trips as possible.  Overpayment in comparison with the excursion tariffs of city travel agencies is 25-50%. </p><h2>  Hotel services: paid and free </h2><p>  After checking into the hotel, guests are entitled to a number of free services.  They can attend six hotel tennis courts, play darts, chess, participate in beach volleyball, indoor soccer, aerobics.  Disco and evening shows are regularly organized for them. </p><p>  The range of paid services is more impressive.  This is a rental of tennis rackets and balls, spa services, horse riding, diving, mini golf, water skiing, surfing. </p><p>  For the youngest guests of the hotel, a local mini-club ‚ÄúSolar Children‚Äù is open (organizes a game program) from 9 <sup>30</sup> to 17 <sup>00</sup> .  Various entertainments are held in two age subgroups: from 4 to 7 years old and from 7 to 12 years old. </p><p>  Russian-speaking animators organize non-boring leisure activities for kids on children's <span>water slides</span> and playgrounds.  An entertainment program awaits the children in the evening (from 19.30 to 21.30).  For the subgroup of the smallest, it is called "Good evening, Sani!", And for older children - "Mini-disco". </p><h2>  Where to buy excursions? </h2><p>  The country of the pharaohs is one of the most popular holiday destinations for tourists.  However, recklessly buying excursions right at the hotel is more expensive for yourself.  Our subjective recommendations (taking into account the risks of ugly driving on Egyptian roads) are as follows: buy one or two excursions from the hotel‚Äôs guides (the farthest, for example, to Cairo or Jerusalem).  Safety criteria are prioritized here.  Excursions involving travel over short distances can be bought at proven city travel agencies (with at least a three-year work history). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tia heights makadi bay 4" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/734952.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  Briefly say a few excursions - visiting cards of Egypt. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Cairo, on the Giza plateau, there is the famous ensemble of three <span>pyramids (Cheops,</span> Chefren and Mykerin), as well as a giant sculpture of the Sphinx.  In the capital itself, the most famous tourist attraction is the world famous <span>Cairo Museum,</span> which contains exhibits - relics of ancient civilization.  Luxor (in ancient times Thebes) is attracted by the preserved architectural funerary ensembles. </p><p>  For hotel guests with diving skills, diving excursions are interesting. </p><p>  Of course, all trips are not free.  As you already understood, the tours sold by the tour operator are more expensive than those of urban travel agencies. </p><p>  Why do we dwell on excursions in such detail?  The point is the excessive creativity with which they are implemented by the guests of the Tia Heights Makadi Bay hotel.  Tours purchased from a particular tour operator do not imply the obligation to take excursions from him.  Nevertheless, hotel guides try to impose a complete list of excursions.  In addition, guides mischievously explain to ignorant tourists that the insurance they paid is valid only if they make trips under the control of a tour operator.  This is not true: insurance is valid regardless of this factor. </p><p>  In any case, you should not argue with the guides regarding the excursions, since they are motivated.  It's useless.  Just go away. </p><h2>  Accommodation issues: which staff to contact.  Reviews </h2><p>  By the way, many pressing issues of rest and hotel accommodation are not necessarily decided by guides.  It is possible that after your refusal to buy expensive excursions, they will be "offended", and you will not get any advice from them.  However, this is normal practice.  According to vacationers, do not rely excessively on Tia Heights Makadi Bay guides.  Reviews of hotel guests addressed to them contain comments indicating that tourists who do not buy excursions quickly lose all interest.  They recommend guests to follow the announcements on the board in the lobby and then do not bother with advice.  Of course, this is unprofessional. </p><p>  ‚ÄúOffended‚Äù guides often forget to present its spa center to disadvantaged hotel guests.  In principle, this does not change anything - people themselves learn about what they need and visit a hamam, steam room, sauna, go for a professional massage.  All of these therapeutic procedures are available at relatively reasonable prices. </p><p>  Therefore, the guides <span>did not</span> meet <span>the wedge.</span>  There is an alternative.  We recommend that hotel guests seek the advice of the competent hotel staff located to the right of the reception, gerreleyshens. </p><h2>  Hotel guests travel to Hurghada </h2><p>  Sociable tourists and guests wishing to spend a vacation in a party atmosphere or advanced guests who are fond of diving, often take minibuses to a city called Hurghada.  Tia Heights Makadi Bay generously arranges transportation of its guests to the disco of the provincial capital.  And there is where to shake oneself.  Traditionally, Europeans visit the Hard Rock Cafe.  The Havana Club is especially popular with ‚Äúacidic‚Äù youth.  The club "Calypso" is considered relatively inexpensive: having paid $ 15 for admission, the visitor, by choice, automatically receives a glass of beer or a glass of wine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tia heights makadi bay coral" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/734951.jpg" width="440"></div>

    <p>  In addition to thirsty young people, people who want to see the sights of the city and athletes who prefer water sports go to Hurghada (in the morning, though). </p><p> The most visited by the hotel guests are the Thousand and One Nights Palace, the Titanic Water Park, the Red Sea Aquarium, the Museum of Marine Biology, the ruins of the ancient Roman settlement Mons Claudianus, and the Christian Coptic Church.  After visiting the above-mentioned facilities, hotel guests often bribe for themselves at affordable prices fruit, soft drinks, and some exotic seafood in the Metro chain stores located there. </p><h2>  Hurghada - for divers </h2><p>  Although the hotel complex has its own diving center, enthusiasts of exploring the coral world, for a change, seek to get the maximum experience in the best diving clubs in Hurghada, the capital of the Red Sea province, by diving directly from the boat that delivered them to the desired water area.  Indeed, in addition to the coral reef located near Tia Heights Makadi Bay, which is quite compact, the main reefs near Hurghada are located further from the coastal zone.  Crowded with populations of coral fish and various marine objects, they are located in the vicinity of Giftun Island, in a paid marine park.  The most famous among them coral gardens are Shaab Ruhr Um Gamar, which is also called the encyclopedia of the Red Sea, and Gotha Abu Ramad. </p><p>  However, the most interesting place experienced divers strive for in the waters of Hurghada is Karless Reef, which is also called the Moray House. </p><p>  Divers staying at the hotel we are considering seek to visit the above reef gardens, painted in a wide range of colors: from bright pink to piercing blue (by the way, only living corals are painted). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Concluding our story about the hotel complex Tia Heights Makadi Bay 5 *, let us recall its signature features: this is a hotel-water park, offering a noisy, fun family and youth vacation on 30 exciting water slides.  These fun-filled rides of various configurations and complexity are kept in good condition by friendly staff.

    <p>  An unconditional bonus is also a large, well-maintained and comfortable sandy beach, as well as a nearby reef with a rich underwater world.  It also has a spa and a variety of facilities.  Guests characterize the hotel as a cozy, calm, attractive complex for families. </p><p>  An important role is played by the mood of the vacationers themselves, a friendly and respectful attitude to the staff.  Do not be a beech tree, smile at the people serving your vacation, greet them in Arabic, saying ‚ÄúAghlen‚Äù or ‚ÄúSalam‚Äù, thank, saying ‚Äúshu (o) crane‚Äù, say goodbye to the words ‚ÄúUshufak‚Äù (‚Äúsee you‚Äù) or "Maasalama."  It's simple, elementary, but, believe me, you yourself will feel a positive response. </p><p>  Have a nice rest! </p>
