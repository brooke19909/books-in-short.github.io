The largest of them is Tenerife, which focuses on shopping centers, entertainment venues, and better beaches.  The island is also famous for the most striking and eccentric parties, which are constantly arranged here.  And the main resort of Tenerife, Las Americas, is located in the very south of the island, and is characterized by a warm climate and an active night and day life.  In order to find out all the charms of this place in more detail, we will start with the main one, namely the beaches. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tenerife las americas" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276092.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Like all recreation areas of Tenerife, Las Americas is completely covered with fine black <span>volcanic sand.</span>  It is with such a natural heritage that the Canaries are famous.  This resort is conditionally divided into eight beaches, the infrastructure and equipment on which, in principle, are identical.  Being on one of them is free, but you will have to pay for umbrellas, sun loungers and other amenities, and a lot.  It is worth noting that among all the resorts on the island of Tenerife, Las Americas is the most visited and prestigious, so the prices for accommodation, food, and other services are very high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of las americas tenerife" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275943.jpg" width="600"></div>

The northern part is in front of the volcanic ridge, and this territory has a very rich flora and humid climate.  However, this area is not safe from seismic and weather surprises.  The southern part of Tenerife, Las Americas in particular, in its landscape resembles a desert, where it is always hot and dry.  Coolness can only be found near the ocean.  By the way, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãall the beaches of this resort, special dams are installed that protect the resort from high waves.  Therefore, you can swim in warm and calm waters here in winter and summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tenerife las americas photo" class="if" height="421" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/275945.jpg" width="585"></div>
