  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a kokoshnik with your own hands: features, ideas and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russian culture is very peculiar.  She was always a little different from the European.  Despite the fact that our fashionistas ordered themselves outfits with an eye on the West, the special charm inherent exclusively in our country was always reflected in the clothes.  Take, for example, kokoshnik.  There is no analogue of this headdress anywhere in the world.  How to make a kokoshnik at home, read below. </p><h2>  Sketch </h2><p>  Before you begin any creative work, you need to think through every step.  The first step is to draw a sketch.  To come up with a complicated hat for many is an unrealistic task.  Therefore, before you start creating a sketch, you need to look at the analogues.  Regardless of whether you plan to make a thing - stylized or folk, you should study all possible options.  Copying other people's works is not creativity.  Art is the embodiment of one‚Äôs idea. </p><p>  When you get enough analogues, you can start drawing.  Picture the form you like and fill it out collectively from the viewed images.  When the form and decor are thought out, start painting the sketch.  The colors of the kokoshnik can be either pastel or bright.  Everything will depend on the image that you will complement with a hat. </p><h2>  Pattern </h2><p>  How to make a kokoshnik?  You already have a sketch of the headgear, now you need to create a pattern on it.  Based on the picture below, you need to come up with something similar.  Keep in mind that the kokoshnik is the headpiece that was sewn, and it is still individually sewn under each head.  Of course, the accessories that animators wear at children's parties come to mind. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a kokoshnik" class="if uuid-2433794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433794.jpg"></div><p>  But these are consumer hats, they have nothing to do with art.  And how to make a kokoshnik for your head?  Draw a pattern and try on it.  If the workpiece sits perfectly on your head, you can work with it.  If the paper pattern sits with folds or does not fit at all, increase the arc below.  Thus, the headgear will become smaller, but the space for the head will increase. </p><h2>  Frame </h2><p>  The pattern is ready, now you need to think about how the hat will hold.  How to make a kokoshnik?  The basis should be a rigid form.  Ideally, it should be made of wire.  How to create such a blank?  Take the wire and use pliers and pliers to give it the shape of a kokoshnik.  Then you need to make another arc holding the rim to which the decorative element is directly attached. </p><div class="photo" data-original="seaofestrogen.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://seaofestrogen.com/2016/04/making-a-russian-kokoshnik/"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to create a folk kokoshnik" class="if uuid-2433809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433809.jpg"></div><p>  If you don‚Äôt have wire or if you don‚Äôt know how to bend it, how to make a kokoshnik from cardboard?  In this case, you will need a dense material that is well deformed and does not create creases.  Cut the mold out of it.  You can fasten such blanks with both Moment glue and a hot gun. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  How to make a folk kokoshnik?  The easiest way is to build a hat from cardboard, and then ground it.  You can use both construction soil and decorative.  Apply a thin layer to prevent the kokoshnik from getting too heavy.  After that, you can start painting.  For this purpose you need acrylic paint.  If it is not available, you can mix gouache with glue in a 1: 1 ratio.  The folk kokoshnik most often decorates the Khokhloma or Gzhel ornament.  If you want to modernize a hat, you can take a folk color scheme (red-black or white-blue) and draw any image with it.  It is desirable that the drawing was floral or floral.  Abstract forms here will be inappropriate. </p><h2>  Close-fitting </h2><p>  How to make a kokoshnik for the Snow Maiden?  For this purpose, a wire frame should be used.  It is one thing to make a headdress in a folk style for a kindergarten matinee, and quite another for a fairy-tale heroine entertaining children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stillatelie.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a kokoshnik for the snow maiden" class="if uuid-2433822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433822.jpg"></div><p>  On a wire frame you need to pull a blue, blue or white cloth, and then insert a cardboard inside the form.  Not all shapes will be comfortable to fit with pre-sewn material.  If your headpiece has a complex frame, it will be much easier to pull the fabric directly onto the form and fasten its two sides with a handmade seam.  Then in a similar way you need to tighten the bezel.  But it is not necessary to insert a cardboard into it.  When both forms are ready, they need to be bonded to each other.  It is advisable not to glue the fabric, but to stitch it. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  How to make a folk kokoshnik with your own hands, you can read above, but how to decorate it?  From ancient times, the girl‚Äôs hats were decorated with glass, pebbles and ceramics.  Today, the choice of decorative details is amazing.  You can use beads, beads, rhinestones, artificial and natural stones, metal elements and other accessories.  It is advisable to embroider the kokoshnik with something shiny.  Matte textures will stand out poorly.  Although, of course, you can play in contrast.  For example, use glass beads and matte braid for decoration.  For decor, lace, gold and silver plaits, satin ribbons are also suitable.  You can use artificial flowers made from fabric or paper to decorate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maverickcult.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="kokoshnik decor" class="if uuid-2433825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433825.jpg"></div><p>  It is advisable to decorate not only the kokoshnik, but also make a forehead patch.  You can create it from interwoven bundles, which will need to be abundantly sprinkled with hairspray, or a mesh of beads.  The second version of the decor is more popular. </p><h2>  Mount </h2><p>  When the headpiece is created, it remains to figure out how to fix it on the head.  The easiest way is to attach tapes to it.  I must admit that he is the most effective.  But if the kokoshnik is heavy, for example, completely embroidered with beads, satin ribbons will not be able to hold it on his head.  Then to such an accessory you need to sew on an elastic band at the back.  You can hide it thanks to the bow, which will be tied from wide sections of airy fabric, such as chiffon or tulle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kknews.cc" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make cardboard kokoshnik" class="if uuid-2433797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2433797.jpg"></div><p>  Another way to fix the kokoshnik is by invisibility.  Small hair clips can hold a lightweight accessory made of cardboard.  You can make the mount part of the kokoshnik.  To do this, you will need to sew ribbons or lace to the front rim of the headgear.  Thus, the tape will encircle the forehead and further descend to the back of the head. </p>
