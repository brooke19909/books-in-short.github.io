    <h2>  History of education </h2><p>  Until the middle of the 19th century, the Adyghe aul Mezib was located on the territory of the modern village of Divnomorskoye.  Subsequently, the place was called "fake Gelendzhik."  The name is not accidental, since the captains of the ships from afar at night confused him with Gelendzhik. </p><p>  The fake Gelendzhik - the village of Divnomorskoye - went down in the history of Russia.  The Russian seamen took advantage of the similarities during the war with the Turks, placing in this place an imitation of fortifications, which they, taking for real, began to shell.  After completion, having consumed all the shells, they were surprised to see the ships of the Russian squadron coming from the direction of Gelendzhik. </p><p>  The origin of the name is associated with the beauty of the sea, which washes Divnomorskoe.  Everyone who visited the village constantly repeated: ‚ÄúWhat a wonderful sea is here!‚Äù  And so it happened - Divnomorskoe.  Gelendzhik, located next to the village, becoming a popular resort, began to rapidly develop and grow.  Therefore, the village Divnomorskoe was in close proximity to the city. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik Village Divnomorskoe" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/1775983.jpg" width="600"></div>  Climate in Divnomorskoye </h2><p>  Gelendzhik, Divnomorskoe are located in the <span>Gelendzhik Bay,</span> where a humid and subtropical climate is formed by the mountains of the Caucasus, protecting the territory from cold north-westerly winds.  It has warm winters with rains, hot summers full of sunny days.  The temperature at the height of the holiday season can reach 30 degrees.  The coastal water in the sea is warm, warms up to 26 degrees. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is good to relax with children here, since a pebble beach compares favorably with a Gelendzhik beach, it is gentle, the bottom two meters from the shore is sandy and shallow. </p><h2>  How to organize a vacation </h2><p>  Divnomorskoe, especially recently, is very popular.  The following factors contribute to this: environmental conditions;  developed infrastructure;  location - proximity to the city, highway;  a large selection of housing, ranging from high-end to inexpensive.
