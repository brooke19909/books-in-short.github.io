    <h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  Separately, it is worth talking about the conditions for a beach holiday at the Djerba Sun Club Hotel.  Reviews about the beach of this hotel complex guests leave mostly positive.  Here's the difference between a vacation here: </p><ul><li>  The hotel is on the second coastline.  The beach is located at a distance of about 50 m from the nearest residential buildings, but no further than 350 m from the farthest buildings of the island hotel.  There is a road between the beach and the hotel complex. </li><li>  The beach is sandy, the sea is of medium depth, which is especially good for families with children or for the elderly. </li><li>  Sun loungers and parasols at the hotel beach are provided free of charge.  You can pay extra if you wish for a soft mattress for a deck chair and beach towels. </li><li>  Less - a large number of algae in the sea.  All marine vegetation carried out on coastal sand is cleaned daily by tractors in the morning, simply raking it in heaps and dragging it to the territory of neighboring beaches.  Moreover, the hills of algae lie for several days.  It is for this reason that guests of the Djerba San Club 3 * complex express their dissatisfaction, reviews contain references to the unpleasant smell of musty algae and the spoiled sea landscape.  It is worth noting that many algae do not interfere with many. </li><li>  Animals on the beach - the most controversial "attraction" of the beach of the hotel "Djerba Sun Club".  Reviews of hotel guests on this subject are very different.  Someone like camels walking along the seashore, horses and a small donkey very much.  Animals, according to tourists, are very peaceful, calm and, in addition, for a relatively small fee you can ride them or take some photos.  In addition, all traces of the vital activity of animals are removed by their owners.  But there are also many people who are extremely indignant at the presence of animals on the beach. </li></ul><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  What can the 2016 reviews say about the rooms in the three-star hotel ‚ÄúDjerba Sun Club‚Äù (see photo in the article below)? </p><p>  The rooms are designed to accommodate from 1 to 4 guests.  The hotel complex includes more than 300 rooms equipped with everything necessary for relaxation: each has sleeping places (single and double beds), shower or bath, telephone, TV with satellite TV (with several Russian channels), air conditioning, exit to the terrace or a balcony.  For an additional fee, the room is equipped with a cot. </p><p>  On the conditions of stay at the hotel often leave positive reviews.  The rooms are called cozy, comfortable, convenient, although equipped with no frills, only the most necessary. </p><p>  What are the tourists dissatisfied with with negative reviews about the conditions of their stay?  Tunisia, the Djerba Sun Club hotel and the island itself were remembered by many people as a real African heat, therefore, the presence of a working air conditioner in the room is a very important condition for relaxation.  In some rooms there is only shared air conditioning, some of the guests this is not enough. </p><p>  Another note concerns the interior and furniture in the rooms.  Many tourists note that the furnishings in the rooms are far from new, and repairs in the rooms would not hurt to refresh.  At the same time, there are practically no complaints about the sanitary condition or cleanliness in the rooms. <strong></strong></p><p>  Important: smoking is not allowed in the rooms! </p>

    <h2>  Service and staff </h2><p>  It is no secret that the reputation of any hotel is not least dependent on the work of the staff and the quality of service for guests.  What can tourist reviews say about the service in the hotel complex?  Hotel ‚ÄúDjerba Sun Club‚Äù, according to most vacationers, can be proud of the good work of its staff.  There are many stories on tourist forums about the courtesy, friendliness and calm nature of employees.  Tourists describe the attendants, mostly consisting of local residents, as very reserved, unperturbed people who are not characterized by excessive fussiness, obsession, conflict when solving problems.  The following is especially noted by vacationers: </p><ul><li>  Daily cleaning of rooms, maintenance of cleanliness in residential buildings and on site. </li><li>  Towels and bed linen are regularly changed in the room. </li><li>  Ability to communicate with hotel staff in Russian.  Given that the main language of communication on the island is French, the hotel staff, making efforts to learn the language of the client, deserves the highest rating.  Also at the San Club Hotel there are employees from Russia who can be contacted if a language barrier has arisen. </li><li>  Rescuers work daily at each pool of the Djerba Sun Club Hotel.  The 2016 reviews of the work of these specialists are simply excellent: vacationers talk about the fact that lifeguards even look after the children in the pool, if necessary, calming the babies lounging in the water. <strong></strong></li><li>  Active work of sports instructors and animators. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Catering for hotel guests is organized on an all-inclusive basis in the hotel restaurant Djerba Sun Club (Tunisia).  The reviews of 2016 of our compatriots who had a rest in this hotel complex are mostly positive.  Tourists often talk about such features of hotel cuisine: </p><ul><li>  Excellent food quality and beautiful appetizing design of dishes. </li><li>  Big variety.  Many dishes of meat, poultry, delicious fish dishes, salads, seafood.  Great selection of fruits and desserts.  A good assortment of side dishes and sauces. </li><li>  Food is served in sufficient quantities, all guests have enough seats in the restaurant. </li><li>  Tasty daily afternoon snacks - ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù, during which pancakes and ice cream are served. </li><li>  For young children, it is possible to install a children's chair. </li></ul><p>  Negative moments a bit.  You can highlight, for example, such comments: </p><ul><li>  Inadequate, from the point of view of restaurant visitors, the quantity of clean dishes on distribution, claims to the cleanliness of the plates. </li><li>  Poorly fried, tough street barbecue meat. </li><li>  <span>Incorrect behavior of</span> tourists from Asian countries. </li></ul><p>  From alcoholic drinks in the restaurant and hotel bars, tourists can be offered wine (bottled or from barrels), beer, whiskey or various cocktails. </p><p>  Of particular note is the provision of drinking water and drinks, as well as the quality of water at the Djerba Sun Club Hotel.  Reviews of Russian tourists who admire the quality and variety of food at the hotel often contain comments about drinking water and drinks.  Most often you can find such opinions: </p><ul><li>  Water for making tea and other hot drinks, as well as drinking water in the hotel restaurant uses desalinated, slightly salty taste.  What is quite common for the African continent creates a problem for tourists from Russia and European countries.  Therefore, most often you have to buy bottled water. </li><li>  Coffee and tea are served in the hotel restaurant only in the morning.  The rest of the day, these drinks can be ordered in one of the bars. </li><li>  Drinks at the hotel's vending machines end quickly. </li></ul><p>  From the positive aspects, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  There is always enough drinking water in coolers located around the hotel. </li><li>  Drinks sold in vending machines in the hotel complex, including coffee and tea, are of good quality. </li></ul>
