It is located in the Zaporizhzhya region.  Low prices, shallow sea, amazingly beautiful nature make this place popular among tourists with children.  For a long time, vacationers complained about the lack of entertainment infrastructure at the resort.  But not so long ago, nightclubs, a digital cinema and a dolphinarium appeared here.  The last entertainment facility that Berdyansk acquired is a water park.  Aerial photographs of pools, lawns and slides are impressive.  Well, what's inside?  Interesting?  Safely?  In this article, we studied the reviews of those who have already managed to visit there, and made a small digest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Berdyansk" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/666726.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Berdyansk: Cape of Good Hope Waterpark </h2><p>  It was opened in 2006 and is currently one of the largest in Ukraine.  According to reviews, everyone will like this place: both extreme lovers, and those who want to calmly soak in the jacuzzi, and, naturally, children.  Here you will find a fair portion of adrenaline and only positive <span>emotions.</span>  <span>This</span> place is definitely a must visit for everyone who comes in the summer to Berdyansk.  The water park, whose photo is surprised by the lush green of lawns in the middle of the withered steppe, gives coolness and a good rest. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of this entertainment complex was done by the best specialists of Ukraine.  It is stylized as an old feudal castle.  The grooming of lawns planted with exotic plants is monitored by a whole team of gardeners.  You do not like pools because of the irritating eye bleach?  Do not worry: the water here is sea.  Have you heard that on a <span>water slide</span> people were breaking their heads and breaking limbs?  Only not in the "Cape of Good Hope"!  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  Even the coating near the pools is made of non-slip porcelain tiles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Berdyansk slides" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/664779.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Where is the water park located? </h2><p>  This entertainment complex plays a significant role in the life of the resort.  Not only locals will tell you the road.  Even the first vacationer to meet will tell that the "Cape of Good Hope" is not in Africa, that it is a water park (Berdyansk).  The address of this establishment: Makarova street, 2. The complex is located at the very beginning of the <span>Berdyansk spit.</span>  A city minibus will bring you there (the fare in it costs three hryvnias).  The stop is called "Nemo Dolphinarium."  This is quite convenient: one ride on a roller coaster and watch a performance with the participation of funny bottlenose dolphins.  To avoid prolonged queuing at the box office, reviews are advised to purchase tickets online.  There is no time limit for visiting the water park.  You can ride a roller coaster, sunbathe in sun loungers and swim in the pools from ten in the morning until the establishment closes at half past seven in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berdyansk water park photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/664788.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Cape of Good Hope, water park (Berdyansk): slides </h2><p>  This water entertainment complex is the largest in Ukraine in several ways at once.  First, the area.  The vast territory of more than 50 thousand square meters makes it possible to simultaneously receive about 3,000 visitors.  Also, “Cape of Good Hope” is the champion in the number of water attractions.  There are already 31 of them, and new ones are installed every year.  The highest water slide in Ukraine (more than 17 meters) also adorns this water park.  Berdyansk is not in vain proud of its “Cape of Good Hope”: the maximum length of water attractions here is about 150 meters - also the longest in the country.  There is also a hill, during the descent along which a speed of 15 meters per second develops.  Also in the water park you can ride on special rafts and boats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Berdyansk water park cape of good hope" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/664804.jpg" width="393"></div>

    <h2>  Water entertainment complex infrastructure </h2><p>  What awaits tourists arriving at the water park?  Berdyansk is becoming a city more and more like Egyptian or Turkish resorts.  Therefore, secured parking adjoins the territory of the complex.  Guest reviews strongly recommend visiting the water park on Saturday or Sunday: on weekends, a 20 percent discount on tickets.  Kids who are not yet three years old are entitled to free admission.  Together with the ticket fee, you may require 20 hryvnia.  This is a deposit for using the left-luggage office.  After you give the key, 10 hryvnia from this amount is returned.  The entrance ticket gives the right not only to be on the territory of the complex until its closure, but also to use all, without exception, water attractions.  There is a water park and services for an additional fee.  This is a cozy gazebo where you can smoke a hookah, as well as food in a cafe and restaurant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Berdyansk address" class="if" height="235" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/664794.jpg" width="313"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure and rides </h2><p>  Visitors to all water sports complexes are divided into three categories: extreme sports, lovers of bliss and families with small children.  So that all these people do not interfere with each other's enjoyment, the leadership of the “Cape of Good Hope” divided the water park (Berdyansk) into three zones.  For the smallest, there is a shallow pool with a mass of low and not at all scary slides (maximum height - 2.8 meters).  The main pool is surrounded by about a thousand snow-white deckchairs.  Enough space for everyone.  Its dimensions are impressive: 1000 square meters.  A Jacuzzi is built in around the edges.  There is also a <span>swimming pool.</span>  Lovers of tickling nerves will find <span>something to do</span> in the water park.  The reviews claim that this, of course, is not the Wadi Wadi in Dubai, but the Free Fall, Niagara and Tsunami attractions make the <span>heart go off the heels.</span>  However, there are less risky slides.  For example, reviews mention the Valley of the Snakes, the Ring of Asteroids, and The Secret of Bermuda. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  The staff of rescuers specially trained in the Ministry of Emergencies of Ukraine continuously monitors what is happening in the pools and on the rides.  In addition, instructors provide order.  They help vacationers sit on a raft or on a hill, make sure that there is no crush, and small children do not go to extreme attractions.  So all the tales of broken heads and broken hands are a myth and a black PR.  Visitors claim that Cape of Good Hope is the safest water park.  Berdyansk thus became an example for other cities in the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Water park sun berdyansk reviews" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/664839.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Of course, almost all visitors want to relax for their money to the maximum, and therefore they appear at the ticket office at the entrance before the opening of the complex.  But staying in the water all day and riding a rollercoaster excite wolfish appetite.  And it is strictly forbidden to enter the complex with your food and drinks.  The water park has a cafe, bar and restaurant.  According to reviews, prices in these catering establishments are somewhat overpriced.  And this is perhaps the only minus of the "Cape of Good Hope." </p><p>  There is a nightclub "Sun" in the resort town.  He was sheltered on its territory by this water park.  “Sun” (Berdyansk), which is very positive reviews, has the longest bar counter in Ukraine.  And the dance floor rests right on the pool.  Regularly in this night club foam discos are organized with the participation of the best domestic and foreign DJs. </p>
