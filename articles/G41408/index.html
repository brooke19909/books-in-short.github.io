Today, mobility occupies a major place in the development of technology, including in the field of electronic computing.  Compact gaming computers of various manufacturers, mini-PCs, and even low-power media players that were released a little earlier are no longer surprised.  However, the new Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 is an amazing gadget. </p>

    <h2>  What does this device look like? </h2><p>  The appearance of the IdeaCentre Q190 is a delicate balance between tiny sizes, reasonable performance and low price.  This mini-PC has dimensions of only 0.9x6.1x7.6 inches, with the exception of the optional DVD drive, which is attached on top, thereby adding extra thickness to the device.  The basic configuration has a retail price of approximately $ 350. </p><h2>  Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 - Features Overview </h2><p>  Despite its small size, the IdeaCentre Q190 is equipped with a dual-core Celeron processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB hard drive.  The only thing that is not provided for in the basic configuration is a specialized graphics chip, as well as opportunities for self-updating and additions.  The Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 mini-computer has good enough characteristics to be used as a media player or PC for working with documents.  However, not too powerful processor and integrated graphics will not allow you to play modern games or use specialized programs that require high power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to arrange it? </h2><p>  The small size of the device will allow you to install it vertically on any surface.  If you want to place it as compact as possible, then use the included bracket to attach the nettop to the back of the monitor or HDTV.  Moreover, thanks to the <span>silent fan</span> installed in the device <span>,</span> you are unlikely to hear the Q190 working behind the display, even if you are in a completely quiet room. </p><p>  If you are looking for a compact media player, keep in mind that the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 does not have a Blu-ray disc reader in its basic configuration, only a DVD drive can be connected. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  As already noted, the IdeaCentre Q190 is quite small in size - if you put it vertically, it takes up very little space.  As expected from a device with such dimensions, the power source cannot be connected inside the Q190 - there is a design typical for laptops. </p>

    <p>  The silver-black plastic case is quite attractive and has a hinged lid that closes the front ports.  If you choose the Q190 configuration with the ability to use DVD-ROM drive, you will see that the drive is a small additional device.  In general, the nettop Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 does not visually seem as durable as models with metal cases, but outwardly it wins much.  Its design looks more modern and attractive and is much better suited for home use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Control panel and keyboard </h2><p>  In addition to the optical drive, the gadget comes with an Enhanced Multimedia Remote Lenovo wireless backlit input device.  Outwardly, it resembles a tiny smartphone, made in the style of the keyboard, and is equipped with a Nub touchpad.  This remote is very convenient for performing quick manipulations when working on YouTube, as well as launching various programs.  However, typing long emails on it is not very convenient.  In other words, this add-on is ideal for use as a remote control for playing media files, but if you intend to use a mini-PC to work with productive programs, you will need a full-sized keyboard. </p><p>  According to the instructions attached to the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190, the touch panel of the remote control is designed to perform the basic tasks of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Various configurations </h2><p>  Please note that Lenovo offers a variety of optional devices in the kit, depending on where you buy your IdeaCentre Q190.  For example, Lenovo's original web store offers the Q190 with a traditional USB keyboard and mouse, as well as an advanced multimedia Remote.  Amazon, on the other hand, has a nettop for $ 389.98 with an enhanced multimedia remote control and DVD drive.  This configuration is the most common (Hetton Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Test results </h2><p>  As testing by IdeaCentre Q190 shows, the Celeron 887 processor with a frequency of 1.5 GHz and a dual-core chip responds to commands quickly enough to make multimedia playback and basic tasks without any difficulties.  This chip is supported by 4 GB of RAM, integrated <span>Intel HD</span> 3000 <span>graphics</span> (which is actually part of the Celeron processor) and a 5,400rpm hard drive with a capacity of 500 GB.  In addition, other Q190 configurations can be found on sale, in which <span>the i3 processor</span> core and 1 TB hard drive are available. </p>

    <h2>  Internet connection </h2><p>  The device also contains an integrated Broadcom 802.11b / g / n Wi-Fi adapter.  Despite the fact that the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 does not have an external Wi-Fi antenna, it does not have any problems playing wirelessly streaming 1080p video from a router located in another room. </p><h2>  Ports and possible synchronization </h2><p>  Although the technical characteristics of the gadget are rather modest, a sufficient number of ports and connection options for other devices are offered.  Behind the hinged lid located on the front, you will find a pair of USB 3.0 ports, an SDXC card reader, and headphone and microphone jacks.  There are four USB 2.0 ports on the rear panel (one of them is blocked if you use a DVD drive), a Gigabit Ethernet port and a digital audio port.  There are also connectors for connecting and outputting VGA and HDMI video.  In addition, you must purchase an HDMI-DVI adapter to connect a DVI display to your mini-PC. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The compact Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 comes with the default 64-bit version of Windows 8. This is a progressive step because many competing mini-PCs (for example, from the manufacturers Zotac and Giada) are not equipped with the installed OS, so the user will have to buy and install it yourself.  In addition, the device has a loaded Loadout antivirus and many other useful things - McAfeeAntivirus, PowerDVD, CyberLink Power2Go, Microsoft Silverlight, Adobe Reader, Lenovo Cloud Storage and support for other applications.  You also get a pre-installed copy of Microsoft Office 2010, but it is inactive, so you will need to buy or provide an existing license to use it. </p><h2>  Memory and Download </h2><p>  Despite the 5,400 rpm hard drive, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 boots up very quickly, namely: a Windows 8 desktop is fully loaded in just 15 seconds.  Launching applications, of course, is not as fast as on standard PCs equipped with a solid state drive, but it is still pleasantly impressive. </p><p>  In general, tests show that the IdeaCentre Q190 responds quickly enough to perform such everyday tasks as browsing the web, Office applications and playing media files.  DVDs and 1080p video streaming play very smoothly without delay or hesitation.  But if we talk about resource-intensive applications such as <span>video encoding,</span> the IdeaCentre Q190 can not be compared with a standard desktop computer of a modern model.  In addition, on this device you will not be able to play next-generation games that require large resources - the integrated graphics equipment Intel HD 3000 does not have sufficient technical specifications for this. </p><h2>  Main conclusions </h2><p>  Thus, the IdeaCentre Q190 will not take first place among high-performance devices, but the gadget is very good and high-quality among mini-PCs in this price category.  The basic model, offered on the official website of the manufacturer, costs only $ 335 and is equipped with 4 GB of RAM, a USB keyboard and a mouse.  A more advanced version of the device, equipped with an additional DVD-drive and a multimedia Remote, can be purchased for a little less than $ 400. Despite the fact that other manufacturers offer more powerful devices for the same price, the IdeaCentre Q190 still wins, if only because it includes preinstalled Windows 8 and useful software, which competitors cannot offer today. </p>

    <h2>  What consumers say </h2><p>  According to users, as a small and quiet home theater or computer for playing video and music, the Lenovo IdeaCentre Q190 (reviews of which are very positive, as you can see) is the most suitable option.  It is also a great compact computer for student and school homework, office applications, web browsing, and other typical home user tasks.  If you don‚Äôt perform such intensive work as video editing and are not keen on demanding games, the Q190 offers decent performance considering its price and compact size. </p><p>  The only real claim to the Q190 that users make is the inability to play Blu-ray discs.  However, this feature will be available, as promised by Lenovo.  Of course, you can always connect a Blu-Ray reader to an external USB port, but it will not be very convenient.  In the end, mini-PCs are purchased to save space.  In addition, this gadget works almost silently, which is another obvious advantage. </p><p>  As the owners say, you can connect this nettop not only to the monitor intended for this, but also to a modern TV.  Simply connect the video cable for this and make the appropriate settings.  It is also possible to share the gadget with units such as a music center or home theater. </p><p>  And, finally, you can independently restart and install the software you need on a mini-computer - there are restrictions only regarding the processor power and technical characteristics that depend on it.  Any programs that do not require too much resource consumption can be installed without any difficulties. </p>
