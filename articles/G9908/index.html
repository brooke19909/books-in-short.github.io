Perhaps this is partly true, but in Russian cities many families are forced to huddle in the small rooms of the old <span>housing stock.</span>  Unfortunately, the housing problem in our country is very acute.  For this reason, the sale of a room in a communal apartment is of interest to many citizens, since there is always a buyer for such housing.  Each of the counterparties has its own goals: someone is tired of wandering around in rented apartments, and someone has found the opportunity to purchase more spacious mansions.  In any case, one should not forget that selling a room in a communal apartment is a troublesome procedure, which takes a lot of time and effort.  At the same time, it is fraught with certain difficulties, but this fact should not scare away a potential seller. </p><h2>  Neighborhood Question </h2><p>  The sale of a room in a communal apartment begins with the settlement of the issue with the neighbors. </p>

    <p>  The fact is that if you decide to sell "meters" in a communal apartment, then the pre-emptive right to purchase your property belongs to them.  Without observing this condition, it will be illegal to sell a room in a communal apartment.  The consent of the neighbors to the transaction may not be obtained by the property owner, but he is simply obliged to inform about it.  It is noteworthy that the third party is offered the same terms of sale as a neighbor who refused.  In other words, to overstate the cost of housing in order to be safe in case the deal breaks down, it doesn‚Äôt work out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of course, troublesome business is selling a room in a communal apartment.  It is not so easy to get neighbors' refusal in practice, for the reason that in some cases it is not possible to find them (someone has not lived in the city for a long time, someone has moved to another area).  It often happens that all the neighbors are in place, but they don‚Äôt want a new tenant to appear: it is customary for us to treat strangers with caution.  This tactic of behavior is most often chosen if there is a sale of a room in a communal apartment in Moscow. </p>

    <p>  Many are afraid that a person with a criminal past or an unbalanced psyche will live next door to them. </p><h2>  How to set room owners </h2><p>  If you are determined to sell a room in a communal apartment, then you must determine the list of persons who are the owners of the premises located next to you. </p><p>  First you should contact the Rosreestr, where you fill out the relevant application and pay the state fee for providing information.  You will receive a written reply within approximately five days. </p><h2>  What to do next </h2><p>  Having established all the owners of the apartments located in your house, you should send them a letter offering to purchase real estate from you, indicating the footage, living conditions and price.  Your neighbors have a whole month to make a decision. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  If after this period you do not receive a response, then this can be regarded as a rejection of the transaction. </p><h2>  Clearance transaction </h2><p>  After the above formalities are met, you can either search for a buyer or complete a transaction (if a buyer is found). </p><p>  Do not forget that all real estate transactions <span>are subject to state registration,</span> which is carried out by employees of Regpalat.  It is necessary to collect a certain package of documents in order for the sale to be legalized.  It should also be remembered that if the new owner violates the rules of human society, neighbors will have the right to challenge the transaction.  For this reason, the choice of the buyer should be taken as seriously as possible. </p><h2>  List of documents </h2><p>  So, we are close to the final stage of such a deal as selling a room in a communal apartment.  Documents for its implementation should be prepared in advance. </p>

    <p>  First, you will need a passport.  Secondly, you must submit a document confirming the fact that no one is registered in the premises for sale.  Thirdly, you must present copies of <span>registered letters</span> that you addressed to the owners of apartments located in the neighborhood.  In addition, you will need a document from the liaison office stating that the distribution was completed.  Fourth, you must submit <span>documents of title</span> for housing, an extract from the BTI and the cadastral plan of the property. </p><h2>  The nuances of the transaction </h2><p>  Most of the difficulties arise at the initial <span>stage of the sale of a</span> room in a communal apartment, when neighbors should be informed in writing of their intention to complete a transaction.  What to do, for example, if Ivan Ivanovich died, and his relatives have not yet inherited?  Waiting for them to appear is not the most suitable solution to the problem.  It will be optimal to turn to the court to recognize the room as orphaned property.  In the course of the proceedings, relatives will certainly be found, and the situation will be resolved. </p><h2>  Neighbors make obstacles </h2><p>  As already emphasized, situations often arise when neighbors deliberately interfere with the transaction, ignoring the written notice.  In any case, the document will be labeled ‚ÄúRefusal of receipt‚Äù, which will be evidence of the notice of the transaction. </p>

    <p>  If the neighbors deliberately drag out the time with the answer, and you don‚Äôt have time to wait a whole month, you can do the following: arrange the transaction not as a purchase and sale, but as a gift, not forgetting to get money from the buyer before that.  In this case, you can save time. </p><p>  Remember that selling a room in a communal apartment is a rather troublesome procedure, and you should prepare for it in advance: then it will take less time and effort. </p>
