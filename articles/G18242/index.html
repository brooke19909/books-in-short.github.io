They hate cables and their confusion.  That's why most people are much more willing to invest in speakers that can provide music remotely over a wireless network.  This review attempts to figure out whether to purchase <span>the</span> Creative D100 portable <span>speaker system</span> that meets these requirements. </p><h2>  Music for all occasions </h2><p>  Creative Singapore, known for its <span>Sound</span> Blaster <span>sound cards</span> , also makes good wireless headphones, so it's interesting to compare other devices from the same manufacturer that support the same Bluetooth interface.  One of these models is a beautiful portable speaker Creative D100, which, according to marketers, is perfect for use at home and outdoors.  The advantage of such equipment and the technologies used by it should be, first of all, the ability to connect an almost unlimited number of devices capable of audio playback.  This can make the life of its owner much more enjoyable. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Technical characteristics of the model are as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  frequency range: 20 Hz - 20 kHz; </li><li>  signal to noise ratio: more than 80 dB; </li><li>  weight: 1 kg; </li><li>  dimensions (length x width x height): 336x115x115 mm; </li><li>  wireless: Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR with profile A2DP (stereo) / AVRCP (remote control); </li><li>  working distance: up to 10 m (in open space; walls and other obstacles may affect the range of the device). </li></ul><h2>  Unpacking </h2><p>  The first impression of the packaging in which the portable audio speaker is delivered cannot be called overly sensational, but the box is made at a decent level.  It does not constitute anything out of the ordinary, but it is reliable both from the point of view of appearance and from the point of view of ensuring the safety of contents.  Inside it is the device itself, a power cord with two interchangeable adapters so that it can fit into any outlet, as well as a set of Creative D100 instructions and manufacturer's flyers.  According to user reviews, the only thing missing is AA batteries, which are needed for speakers in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Creative D100 Design Review </h2><p>  If we talk about assessing the appearance of the device itself, as well as the functionality that the manufacturer tried to endow with a compact speaker, then the first thing that catches your eye is its color.  The Creative D100 case is available in black and white, and the tone of the material of the front panel that hides the speakers can be selected in accordance with your tastes from the proposed pink, blue, green and black options.  This decision indicates that the target audience of the model are children and users looking for an inexpensive portable wireless speaker system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Noteworthy is the design of the device, which looks at least interesting and elegant.  The difference in size between the front and rear of the case (13.25 ‚Äùin front and 11.6‚Äù in the back, which corresponds to 336 and 295 mm) in combination with the rounded sides is really pleasing to the eye and very pleasant, especially when viewed from the side.  The cylindrical shapes are physically larger than the dimensions of the Logitech Z515, so Creative speakers at a weight of 998 g seem very light.  You can easily carry them around the house or take them on a picnic with you to have fun in nature.  True, the manufacturer does not offer a protective case, as in the case of the Logitech Z515.  However, the front panel also looks great.  Most of it is covered with material of the selected color, under which a pair of speakers is hidden.  These are 2 3-inch 2-watt sound emitters manufactured by Cambridge SoundWorks. </p>

    <h2>  Management and connectivity </h2><p>  In the center of the panel is a pairing button with Bluetooth devices, as well as volume up and down keys.  They are not only functional, but also look aesthetically pleasing, without spoiling the appearance of the model.  On the back of the Creative D100 column is an on / off button, an AUX-IN input and a power input jack.  Below is the compartment cover, which allows you to change the way the device is powered.  You can insert 4 AA size batteries here, and the speaker system can work outside the premises equipped with electrical outlets.  In addition, 4 rubber feet are installed on the bottom panel to prevent the speakers from slipping. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  How it works? </h2><p>  Assessment of sound quality is very subjective and difficult in the absence of special equipment.  In this case, you can rely on the opinion of experts.  According to owners, the D100 is one of the best portable speakers that does everything that users require from this type of equipment.  Most of all they like the way acoustics work while watching movies.  The sound is very pleasant, voluminous and clear (as in games).  However, the impression when listening to music is not so rosy.  It seems that the audio speakers overdo it with low frequencies, which is confirmed in the headset of the same manufacturer Sound Blaster, and forces this feature to be attributed to the disadvantages of the model.  Some may like it, but this difference in sound indicates the imbalance in the frequency ranges of the device.  However, the bass-rich compositions sound satisfactory, the high frequencies are clear and do not seem metallic and rattling, which is impressive for Bluetooth speakers. </p>

    <p>  For their price, the D100 speakers work surprisingly well.  In quality, they are fully consistent with the Super Tooth Disco speaker system, providing high performance with fewer sound emitters, which is partially offset by an excellent amplification system.  The D100 has only 2 speakers, but the only difference that can be caught between this $ 80 model and the $ 150 Super Tooth Disco is even better sound at high frequencies in a more expensive system, which, however, is leveled by annoying RF creak and static . </p><p>  The Creative D100 is powerful enough - the sound level is capable of reaching values ‚Äã‚Äãthat can even be dangerous at close distances, and the volume is surely enough to completely fill the sound of a small office.  Although Creative‚Äôs portable speakers lack some things, such as a convenient carrying case or case and a built-in rechargeable battery, their half the price speaks for itself.  The speaker sounds just as good as any other Bluetooth speaker, which costs less than $ 100, although its cheaper finish and larger dimensions are not in its favor. </p>

    <h2>  Wireless connection </h2><p>  The Creative D100 connects to other devices via Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR and supports A2DP and AVRCP profiles.  This technology was named the best at CES 2010 and received an appropriate award from representatives of the Bluetooth SIG organization, which is developing and licensing this wireless standard.  The device is very easy to establish a connection, regardless of whether it is a smartphone, laptop, mp3 player, tablet or PC.  Just hold the power button for a few seconds to activate the detection mode and select the speakers in the corresponding music player.  The whole procedure takes less than a minute on both Android phones and Apple iPhone.  The <span>Logitech Z515 model,</span> however, also offers a wireless USB adapter, which allows you to save the charge of your smartphone by connecting the speaker system to a PC. </p><p>  Users who have established the connection of the speakers with various devices, say that at the same time they never had any troubles.  It also pleases with a rather large reception range, which, depending on the mated equipment, can reach 10 m. In practice, the speaker system is able to work at twice as much distance.  Equally good is the battery life of the model.  According to the manufacturer, without a power supply from the mains, the speaker can function for 25 hours. Even if in reality this time is not so long, it will be enough for a pleasant party in nature. </p>

    <h2>  Some notes </h2><p>  According to user reviews, some aspects of the model‚Äôs work cause comments.  The discontent is that the D100 volume can only be adjusted using the sound level buttons on the speaker itself, and not on the smartphone, tablet, MP3 player, laptop or PC that is paired with it.  This is not a big problem, because Creative speakers sound good regardless of the volume and type of audio they play. </p><p>  Another, more serious, observation is that the low cost of the model is associated with the prospect of premature failure.  Although most owners do not have problems with Creative portable speakers, there are cases of failure of some D100s that stop working after a long period of daily use.  Although the low price makes this less shocking, owners recommend buying speakers from sellers with a good customer service guarantee system and a reasonable return policy. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  According to user reviews, the Creative D100 portable audio system has a nice design and is painted in pretty colors, provides an excellent wireless Bluetooth connection, has an audio input, provides excellent sound for movies and games (as a PC speaker), and is capable of long battery life.  At the same time, when listening to musical compositions, an imbalance in different frequency ranges is noticeable, and the batteries are not included. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Speakers Creative</span> D100 is not intended for sophisticated music lovers, as evidenced by the technical characteristics of the model, but it should be recognized that the portable speaker perfectly performs its tasks.  The small size, interesting design and charming pastel shades definitely speak in favor of the device, which, thanks to this, will not be difficult to find your place in an apartment or a family trip to the open air.  The D100 can even be mounted on the trunk of a bicycle and enjoy music while riding.  Portability is supported by an instantly established wireless Bluetooth connection, the range of which even exceeds the expectations of the manufacturer itself.  In general, this is one of the <span>best portable speakers</span> that the owners strongly recommend purchasing, especially since its price is also interesting at $ 80. </p>
