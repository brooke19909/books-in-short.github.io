It was named after its founder, Romulus.  Rome is a city with the greatest history, experiencing ups and downs at different times.  What are they, Roman emperors?  A list of the greatest rulers is presented in the article. </p><h2>  First Emperor of Rome </h2><p>  The creator of the ancient empire and its first ruler was a man named Octavian Augustus.  He was the youngest candidate for the throne, and his candidacy was not taken seriously.  However, August was smarter.  Cunning, resourcefulness and ingenuity allowed him to open a list of Roman emperors.  Augustus initially secured a place in the triumvirate, but, striving for sole rule, removed <span>Mark Anthony</span> and Mark Lepidus from the path. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of roman emperors" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1770492.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Octavian ruled Rome for 44 years, almost until his death.  At the beginning of the reign, he was a tyrant, but soon gained foresight, began to build wise plans.  He launched a serious construction in the city.  Under the first emperor, many Roman writers became famous.  He tops the list of Roman emperors who received the recognition of the people during their lifetime. </p><p>  If the career of Octavian Augustus was very successful, then this can not be said about his personal life.  Three marriages were not happy, and the only daughter upset her father.  She did not limit herself to guilt and debauchery.  Among her lovers was the famous poet Ovid. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Roman emperors </h2><p>  The list of rulers will be continued by Nero and Vespasian.  The first was the adopted child of the emperor Claudius, after the death of which he took over the rule of the country and killed his own son.  Later, Nero organized the murder of his mother.  The tyrant ruler became famous for his cruelty and malicious deeds.  It was he who brought the adviser Seneca to suicide.  He killed the emperor and his two wives, thereby clearing his way to solitary rule without constraints.  It is known that he was fond of playing the lute and writing (however, mediocre). </p><p>  The list of Roman emperors is continued by Vespasian.  He is known for his lively mind and great stinginess.  Vespasian's great achievement was the end of the Civil War and the establishment of order in the army after it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman emperors list" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1770495.jpg" width="600"></div>  It was this ruler who introduced the tax system in the country, without disdaining a single source of income.  He has the catch phrase: "Money doesn‚Äôt smell."  After the death of the stingy emperor, Rome did not have a single debt.  Under Vespasian, the famous Colosseum was erected.

    <h2>  Emperors of the <span>Roman Empire:</span> List of Conquerors </h2><p>  Titus (son of Vespasian) served faithfully in the army of Rome.  In 71, he was appointed commander of the guard, and from 73 he already ruled the empire with his father.  To a greater extent Titus was engaged in military affairs and relations with foreign powers.  He was loved by people, as he was distributing money to the victims during the volcanic eruption. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Trajan is a great conqueror who is known for his military campaigns.  During his reign, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Roman Empire increased more than ever.  As soon as he ascended the throne, he immediately began organizing conquests: he conquered Dacia, Arabia, Mesopotamia and Armenia.  As for domestic politics, Trayan protected the interests of the Senate, for which he received the title "Best Emperor". </p><h2>  Adrian and Marcus Aurelius </h2><p>  The list of Roman emperors in chronological order continues to Adrian.  Adrian, who lost his parents in childhood, did not continue the policy of his predecessor and educator Trayan, since he did not like military campaigns.  Sometimes the emperor is compared with Peter I, he also loved to learn and study, build and travel.  During his reign, Rome overtook an architectural boom.  Adrian sometimes independently came up with designs for new buildings.  The emperor‚Äôs personal life was not particularly successful, because he did not like his wife, he preferred the freedman Antinous to her. </p><p>  Marcus Aurelius is the great thinker of Rome.  Despite the fact that his favorite pastime was reading literary and philosophical works, he became a commander.  He organized campaigns in Asia and Europe, was one of the most famous persecutors of Christians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="emperors of the roman empire list" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1770496.jpg" width="404"></div>

    <h2>  Septimius Severus and Constantine the Great </h2><p>  <span>Septimius Severus,</span> born in North Africa, was building a military career.  His troops proclaimed Septimius emperor, and when he entered Rome, not a single person was against him.  He is one of the fairest emperors of the Roman Empire, suppressed riots and conspiracies. </p><p>  Constantine the Great (a native of illegitimate marriage) ends our list of Roman emperors.  From the age of 14 he participates in military campaigns along with Diocletian.  One of his most significant decisions was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmoving the government to the East.  It was Constantine who laid the first stone of the city of Constantinople. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of Roman emperors in chronological order" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31847/1770498.jpg" width="445"></div>  He got a prefix for his name thanks to his great achievements.  Constantine freed the Catholic Church and its servants from paying taxes, and gave them many privileges.
