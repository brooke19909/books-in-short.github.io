And why not take advantage of such a great product?  Products come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, are beautifully painted in different colors, and are perfectly glued.  It is not difficult to work with them, so even the teachers in the kindergarten offer the kids to make pasta crafts with their own hands. </p><p>  You can create both flat pictures and volumetric designs.  Often used pasta in the manufacture of jewelry for children - beads, bracelets and earrings.  Products from ordinary products look beautiful, but to create a spectacular crafts from pasta with your own hands, it is better to paint them in bright colors.  How to do this, consider in more detail below in the article.  We will tell you which paints are used for this process. </p><p>  We also advise parents what children's DIY pasta crafts can be done at home.  The article also has the original design of an Easter egg for the holiday table.  We offer mothers such difficult work, and children can help by choosing the right item from a common bowl. </p><h2>  Variety of pasta </h2><p>  To create masterpieces of manual labor in the store, it is recommended to look ahead for pasta of the required size and shape.  To create rounded lines in the picture, horns, shells, wheels are used.  For flat or lines with corners, use long or short noodles, spirals, short or long tubular pasta. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is advisable to choose products that are already the correct size, otherwise when they are cut or broken, they may become deformed or the edges will become uneven.  Decorate crafts from pasta with your own hands, usually with bows of wheat. </p><h2>  How to color products? </h2><p>  It is always more pleasant to perceive a bright and colorful craft.  Therefore, you often have to deal with the problem of painting pasta.  The easiest way to color pasta is to use food coloring.  They are sold in separate small bags in powder form.  In order not to spoil the dishes after staining, use either old cups or disposable plastic cups. </p><p>  Before painting, each powder is poured into a separate container and, following the instructions on the package, poured with cold water, thoroughly mixed until completely dissolved.  Check that there are no grains of paint, otherwise the pasta will be with dots of dark spots on the surface. </p><p>  Then the material is laid out in the right glasses and held for 10-15 minutes.  After the end of the process, the pasta is taken out and laid out on a newspaper for drying.  In order not to stain the table with paint, it is advisable to lay a plastic film under the newspaper.  After the pasta has completely dried, you can arrange them for convenience in color or shape. </p><h2>  Flowers for mom </h2><p>  As a simple DIY pasta, for children of the younger group of kindergarten, you can offer to make a bouquet of flowers for mom on March 8.  Different materials will be used for work.  The combination of fluffy yarn, spiral pasta and twisted balls of napkins will make an indelible impression on mom.  For gluing parts, it is better to take PVA glue.  The teacher can pre-draw the middle of the flower, thereby indicating the boundaries for gluing twisted balls.  Napkins are better to take bright - red, yellow or blue, since pasta spirals do not need to be painted. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.colectivotandem.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pasta daisies" class="if uuid-2407408" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2407408.jpg"></div><p>  The manufacture of DIY pasta crafts for children begins with filling the middle.  For this, the guys tear a piece from a whole napkin and roll a ball in their palms.  One side of it is coated with glue (it is more convenient to use an adhesive pencil for this type of work) and is attached by pressing it on the center of the future flower.  After filling the core, you can begin to attach the pasta.  Spirals with a brush are smeared with PVA glue and are placed in the form of sun rays from the middle in different directions.  When all the petals are completed, it remains only to attach a green thread to the stem and curl a leaf out of it.  Greeting card for mom is ready! </p><h2>  Funny rainbow </h2><p>  This is a very bright picture, for which you need to paint the horns in all the colors of the rainbow.  You will also need cotton wool to create a cloud.  That's all you need for this pasta craft.  Master class for beginners read further in the article.  Children will be able to make such a picture already in the middle group of kindergarten.  Previously, in the evening of the previous day, you can paint the horns in different colors, lay them out on a newspaper to dry.  In the morning of the next day, it remains only to arrange them in different bowls and place them on the tables. </p><div class="photo" data-original="manualidadesparajesus.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rainbow crafts" class="if uuid-2407417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2407417.jpg"></div><p>  The teacher can facilitate the task by drawing contours with a simple pencil of each strip of the rainbow.  Then it will visually look even.  Paste the glue in a shallow plate, and the kids will simply dip the pasta into the glue and put them on the desired strip.  When all the colors have found their place on the rainbow, with a brush, paint the bases with PVA glue on one and the other.  Then put pieces of cotton wool on the plastered places.  So that they attach well, you need to press them lightly with your palm, but in no case rub them.  Everything, do-it-yourself pasta crafts ready! </p><h2>  Salt Dough </h2><p>  If you want to keep the creativity of your baby as a souvenir, then we can offer an excellent option for making DIY pasta crafts.  Master class we bring to your attention further.  Flowers located in salt dough can be stored for many years after drying.  Naturally, to create a picture, short thick pasta needs to be colored.  The color scheme is chosen at will, the only requirement is a combination of different colors for the petals and the middle of the flower.  To complete the stem and leaves, you need a green color. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers in salt dough" class="if uuid-2407421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2407421.jpg"></div><p>  After staining, let the pasta dry, knead the salt dough.  For 200 grams of Extra fine salt, add 200 grams of wheat white flour and mix the dry mixture well.  Then pour there 100 grams of ice water.  Before kneading, check that there are no wounds or scratches on the hands, otherwise the salt will hurt.  You can wear rubber gloves.  The dough should be tight.  Before work, it should be wrapped in plastic wrap for a while and put in a cold place.  The dough is rolled out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 1 cm. Then, with a knife, squares are cut, on which the pasta is pressed in the desired position.  Then the craft must be thoroughly dried.  If for other crafts from salt dough you can use the oven, then you can‚Äôt do this for working with pasta.  Drying the crafts will have a natural way, not far from the battery or heater.  In summer, you can lay down work on the windowsill and leave for several days. </p><h2>  Horn Bracelets </h2><p>  You can spend time with your child with benefit, for example, by making beautiful jewelry from horns.  After dyeing pasta using the previously described method, they are put on a strong nylon string.  For design beads alternate the color of the horns.  For the central pendant, it will be more interesting to choose pasta in the form of wheels or bows.  If you want to make such a bracelet, as in the photo in the article, then read the method for making pasta crafts with your own hands step by step. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mumsgrapevine.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bracelet for yourself and mom" class="if uuid-2407429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2407429.jpg"></div><p>  To make it more convenient to string "beads" on a rope, it should not be too soft.  So that the horns are upright, the thread is threaded through them twice, first strung from the bottom up, and then the upper thread is threaded in the same way again.  The next ‚Äúbead‚Äù is already threaded with the bottom thread and also twice.  When the required length of the bracelet is reached, the upper and lower ends of the rope are tied into a bundle. </p><h2>  Fish for babies </h2><p>  The next version of the crafts can be offered to both babies and older children.

Firstly, painting can be done jointly a day before class.  Secondly, older preschoolers can already use scissors and a pattern.  The teacher distributes to the children a sample of the fish drawn on cardboard, they trace it with a simple pencil and cut it out with scissors.  Then they stick the horns on their own, decorating the scales, tail, fin and mouth of the fish.  Pasta is glued with a brush and PVA glue. </p><h2>  Peacock palm </h2><p>  A beautiful and bright pasta craft is obtained when the main silhouette of the bird is made with gouache paints.  Red paint is applied to the child‚Äôs palm and it is applied to a sheet of paper.  The thumb is thus set aside.
