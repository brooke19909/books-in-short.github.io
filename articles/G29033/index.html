    <p>  In truth, this method is not particularly popular among subscribers.  It takes too much time.  Thus, you can turn to the help of other handouts.  They will precisely answer the question of how to share the balance at MTS without any outside help, and even with great speed. </p><h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  For example, there is such a situation as the use of the "Personal Account" on the official website of the mobile operator.  You must go through the authorization process, and then refer to the menu item "Features at zero".  There, select "Share balance" from MTS and see the instructions. </p><p>  Often, just click on "OK" and then indicate the number of a friend from whom I would like to request funds.  Confirm your desire and wait for an answer.  If nothing happened, most likely, the interlocutor simply refused you.  Otherwise, you will see a notification message about the successful provision of the service. </p><p>  Practice shows that the ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù is the most unpopular method that can only be used by MTS subscribers.  After all, there are at least 2 approaches for using the offer.  And just they are the most common among all available. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay service share balance" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1121311.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As soon as you cope with the task, it is worth sending a message to the short number 363. And that‚Äôs it, you can wait for an answer.  Now it all depends on your interlocutor.  If he agrees to give you money, then soon you will receive a message.  Not?  Then you will not receive any answer at all. </p><h2>  From a friend </h2><p>  Of course, it has already been repeatedly said that for successful activation on the MTS "Share Balance" you will have to obtain the consent of the second subscriber.  Your interlocutor.  What can be done to make the request successful? </p><p>  Suppose we are in the place of a person who is asking for money.  After our friend makes a request, we will receive a message in response with a confirmation code and conditions.  For a positive answer, you can use one of the already known methods: either a USSD command or a message.  It all depends on what kind of option the "asker" chose. </p><p>  In the first case, you will have to answer with a USSD combination.  It is of the form: * 363 * confirmation code #.  Send it by pressing the call button and that's it.  Funds will be debited from your account and transferred to a friend.  If an SMS command was used, the process will be slightly different.  You will have to send a transaction confirmation code to 364.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this.  If you do not agree to share the balance, then simply ignore all messages and requests that are sent to you. </p>
