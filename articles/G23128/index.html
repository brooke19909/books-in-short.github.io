The name of this sports equipment has not yet been fully established, but it is very popular.  Perhaps tubing in Moscow, the main thing is to know the place. </p>

    <h2>  How are the tubing arranged? </h2><p>  Inflatable sledges consist of a cover and a rubber chamber.  The cover is made of polyvinyl chloride fabric.  It has two polymer layers and a <span>reinforced mesh</span> made of lavsan cord.  The canvas is very durable, has good wear resistance and water-repellent properties.  Provides good glide even on a very thin layer of snow.  The upper part of the cover is made of colored polyester fabric, which gives the tube a picturesque look. </p><p>  The camera is made of durable vulcanized rubber.  It is almost the same as a car camera, it has a nipple with a cap.  In many cases, tubing manufacturers use ordinary car cameras.  The camera is placed inside the case and closes with a sealed zipper.  This eliminates the ingress of snow into the cover.  Tubing in Moscow will amuse not only children, but also adults. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The diameter of the cheesecake is from 60 cm to one meter or more.  The weight that single inflatable sledges can withstand can reach 90 kg, and the capacity of double tubing is 220 kg, that is, two adults can ride them at the same time.  "Cheesecakes" with a diameter of up to 70 cm are produced for children. Large tubings are designed for adults.  Children on such "cheesecakes" can ride only with adults.  The inflatable sleigh has handles that people hold on to, as well as a leash with a hook for towing uphill. </p><h2>  How to inflate tubing correctly? </h2><p>  In order to pump up tubing, you need to perform a number of simple steps: </p><ol><li>  The case is laid out on a flat surface, free of stones and sharp objects. </li><li>  The camera is inserted into the case with a nipple in and down. </li><li>  The pump attaches to the valve and the process of filling the chamber with air begins.  In this case, the camera increases in size by several times and should completely fill the entire internal volume of the cover. </li><li>  You need to make sure that the cover sits tightly on the camera, does not hang out and adheres to it on the entire surface without wrinkles.  Otherwise, the case and camera will quickly wear out, and the tubing will become unsuitable for further use. </li><li>  Disconnect the pump, check that the valve does not release air from the chamber, and then put a cap on the valve. </li></ol><p>  If the camera is pumped up in a warm room, then the air will be compressed on the street, and the tubing will need to be pumped additionally.  If you fully pump the tubing after being in the cold into a warm room, then the air will expand, and part of it will need to be released from the chamber to prevent it from breaking.  In the summer, the camera needs to be freed from the air and removed from the case.  Well, in winter, you can safely ride on a tubing in Moscow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to ride an inflatable sled correctly and safely? </h2><p>  There is no control and braking system for the inflatable sled.  When descending from the mountain, the tubing is practically uncontrollable, but the air chamber dampens when it collides with an obstacle, which reduces the force of impact and reduces the risk of injury. </p><p>  So that riding on the tubing does not end in trouble, you must follow simple rules: </p><ol><li>  You can not ride in places where there are steep slopes with cliffs and large stones, boulders. </li><li>  There should not be people on the descent, as well as obstacles in the form of trees, bushes, poles and buildings. </li><li>  The route for descent should be smooth, without sand, gravel and ice.  At the end of the descent there should be a level ground or a slight rise for the natural stop of the sled. </li><li>  It is unacceptable to couple the tubing to each other in a ‚Äútrain‚Äù, as this may lead to their capsizing. </li><li>  Do not try to jump into the tubing if it rushes at high speed. </li><li>  Hold the handles during descent. </li></ol><p>  It's time to decide where it is best to ride the tubing in Moscow.  The capital can offer several places for such entertainment. </p>

    <h2>  Tubing in Moscow </h2><p>  In Moscow itself and in the suburbs there are all conditions for practicing tubing.  Slides with clean slopes and a slope of no more than 20 degrees are many.  Fans of tubing have long chosen them and created special tracks, which are called tubing tracks.  Those who have their own tubing can come to these places and ride for free.  True, you will have to climb the hill on foot and drag the sled behind you.  If you decide to go tubing in <span>Moscow, Sokolniki</span> will be happy to welcome everyone. </p><p>  In Moscow, everyone who has their own inflatable sled can ride on a convenient slope at the <span>Novodevichy Convent</span> for free <span>.</span>  Small slides of the Neskuchny Garden will appeal to both children and adults.  There are small descents in the <span>Catherine Garden.</span>  Unfortunately, there are no lifts in these places, but the slopes are quite gentle and short, so the climb upstairs turns into a pleasant walk in the fresh air. </p><p>  Where else is tubing <span>in</span> <span>Moscow</span> carried out <span>?</span>  <span>Vorobyovy</span> Gory is a great place for this event.  The sports center has an eighty meter tubing track.  You can rent single and double inflatable sledges.  Double tube can withstand weight up to 220 kg.  Thanks to the good lighting of the track, you can use it even at night. </p><p>  In Krylatskoye on the hills there was built a track with a lift specifically for those who want to ride on tubing.  You can use it for free on your sled.  You need to pay for the lift.  Those who have arrived without a tube can use the rental service.  As you can see, tubing in Moscow is offered in many places.  Krylatskoye also boasts excellent hills. </p>

    <h2>  Outside Moscow </h2><p>  In the Moscow region, tubing enthusiasts are attracted by ski clubs, in which special routes for tubing are created.  The length of the tracks in some of them reaches 100 meters.  Almost all of these routes have lifts.  A very large number of vacationers come here on weekends, and the administration is forced to introduce some restrictions.  For example, you are not allowed to ride your own tubing, they must be taken at rental points.  On <span>weekdays,</span> with the permission of the administration, you can ride your inflatable sleigh.  Be sure to try tubing in Moscow. </p>
