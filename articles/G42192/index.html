Leningrad region</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern highways and vehicles are an opportunity to get "from point A to point B" quickly and with maximum comfort.  So, by car, a trip from Vologda to Novaya Ladoga along the federal highway A114, the length of which is over 500 km, takes less than 9 hours.  Useful information about the route will help to reach the final point of the route without any problems.  Important components of a successful trip are well-developed roadside infrastructure and the availability of recreational facilities. </p><h2>  Oh, the roads ... </h2><p>  Almost the entire outback of Russia 150‚Äì200 years ago was off-road.  In those years, an ironic phrase appeared about bad roads - one of the two eternal troubles of a vast country.  The author of the immortal utterance could be Pushkin, but more often authorship is attributed to Gogol.  Pushkin believed: after 500 years, "... the roads, it‚Äôs true, will change immensely: the Russian highway here and here, connecting, will cross ...".  Implementation of this plan took less time than the poet predicted.  For example, south of the mouth <span>of the Volkhov River,</span> two major federal highways of international importance are laid: Vologda - Novaya Ladoga (highway A114) and Kola (M18). </p>

    <h2>  One of the most important elements of the transport system of Russia </h2><p>  Route A114 continues the <span>international transport corridor</span> from Northern Europe to the Asian part of the mainland (Western China).  The motorway runs through the territory of two regions of the Russian Federation - Vologda and Leningrad, connects the cities of Vologda, Sheksna, Tikhvin, Novaya Ladoga (Leningrad Region) and other settlements.

In each direction - two lanes, traffic flows for the safety of traffic are separated by a metal fence.  There are two-level interchanges that replace hazardous intersections.  The width of the road covered with asphalt in the main sections is 7‚Äì8 m. </p><p>  The length of the motorway from Vologda to the city of Novaya Ladoga (Leningrad Region) is 531 km.  This distance can be overcome in 8 hours 55 minutes.  The most dense traffic of the main types of vehicles is present on the site between Cherepovets and Vologda.  Drivers who set off on the A114 highway need to know that complex segments are located near Leontievo and in the vicinity of the Tikhvin ring road. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Modernization of the A114 motorway </h2><p>  The high economic and tourist potential of the South Ladoga, Vologda Oblast and numerous attractions attract people to these regions.  The number of cars passing along the Vologda-Novaya Ladoga federal highway is increasing by about 15% annually.  The highway is undergoing reconstruction and modernization aimed at ensuring traffic safety and improving roadside infrastructure.  Until May 2017, builders plan to increase the number of: </p><ul><li>  lanes, additional interchanges, culverts; </li><li>  sidewalks and pedestrian crossings; </li><li>  lighting devices; </li><li>  road signs; </li><li>  parking lots for personal transport, stops where passengers can take the buses "Novaya Ladoga - Volkhov", and another route transport. </li></ul><p>  A small part of the route is already equipped with "electric shepherds" - devices for scaring away moose.  Devices are powered by solar panels and supply electric charge to metal wires.  Tension does not pose a threat to the lives of people and animals, but it frightens off the latter when trying to get out on the road.  In the future, the number of "electric shepherds" will increase in those sections of the Novaya Ladoga highway where the migration routes of large wild animals pass. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Service on the highway </h2><p>  The main elements of the roadside infrastructure are on the territory of settlements, in large you can find car repair and tire fitting.  Probably, they will have to go in search of them a little away from the motorway.  There are many organized parking lots on the section of the route laid on the land of the Leningrad region.  Motels and hotels in Volkhov, Tikhvin and in front of Vologda have an attractive appearance.  Gas stations and cafes are located right on the highway and can be found 45‚Äì50 km away. </p><h2>  Natural conditions of the Vologda - Novaya Ladoga road </h2><p>  A freeway is laid on the northwestern edge of the Russian Plain, in a forested area.  The relief here is determined by the alternation of lowlands with ridges and elevations.  The cities of Novaya Ladoga, Volkhov, Staraya Ladoga are located on the spurs of the Baltic-Ladoga ledge.  The lowland plain extends 120‚Äì125 km east of St. Petersburg.  The absolute height usually does not exceed 200 m. A lot of lakes, rivers and swamps are the main natural feature of the North-West region.  Some water bodies belong to the Atlantic basin, while others are connected with the Arctic Ocean or the Caspian Sea.  On the way from Novaya Ladoga to Vologda to the north-west, the road crosses the rivers: Sheksna, Suda, Chagoda, Syas, Volkhov and other watercourses. </p><h2>  Climate in the motorway area </h2>

    <p>  Temperature conditions and precipitation in the regions where the route from Vologda to Novaya Ladoga is laid depend on cyclones and anticyclones coming from the Atlantic and the Arctic.  The climate of the territory is temperate continental, winter is relatively mild with frequent thaws, summer is moderately warm. </p><p>  The average temperature in January is from ‚Äì8 to ‚Äì11 ¬∞ ; in July, the thermometer‚Äôs column is more often in the range from +16 to +18 ¬∞ .  The absolute maximum reaches +36 ¬∞ , the absolute minimum is ‚Äì52 ¬∞ .  The warmest are the southwestern areas of the route.  A significant amount of precipitation falls here over the year - 500‚Äì600 mm.  The rainiest period is summer-autumn.  Snow cover is established in the second half of November or early December, melting in the second half of April. </p><h2>  The path "from the Varangians to the Bulgars" </h2><p>  The Novaya Ladoga highway is the shortest road from St. Petersburg to Vologda, Arkhangelsk, Yaroslavl.  In the Leningrad Region, the motorway approaches the mouth of the Volkhov River.  The confluence of <span>Lake Ladoga</span> is located in the center of the coastline of South Ladoga region between the Neva and Svir River deltas (100 km).  The history of this land is inextricably linked with the past, present and future of Russia. </p>

    <p>  In Staraya Ladoga, 15 km upstream from the mouth of the Volkhov River, in ancient times the Volga-Baltic River Route passed - "from the Varangians to the Bulgars and Khazars."  A lively international exchange was conducted from the second half of the 9th century.  The trade route was used by Russia, the <span>Volga Bulgaria</span> and the <span>Khazar Khaganate.</span>  Much later, canals were laid near the coast, connecting the Volkhov with the Neva.  The lake-river and marshy region was not suitable for the construction of land roads.  The history of the highway in this area dates back to the creation of monasteries in Tikhvin, Novaya Ladoga, Dymi, which were visited by <span>Russian tsars.</span> </p><h2>  How to get to South Ladoga </h2><p>  If you plan to get to Novaya Ladoga by car, then from St. Petersburg you can drive along the Murmansk highway to the Volkhov bridge.  Before the bridge there is a turn onto the A 115 highway, which leads to Staraya Ladoga and Volkhov.  To Novaya Ladoga - turn onto the regional road. </p><p>  A convenient option for travel by public transport is through the regional center - Volkhov.  At the train stations of the city, located on different banks of the river of the same name, trains from St. Petersburg come.  There are also trains stopping from Moscow heading north (to Petrozavodsk and Murmansk).  By train from St. Petersburg can be reached in 2.5-3 hours, from Moscow - in 8.5 hours. </p><p>  Buses and minibus No. 23 leave from Volkhovstroy-1 station to Novaya Ladoga. This transport runs along the left bank of the river.  Regular bus "Volkhov - Novaya Ladoga" No. 24 goes in the same direction, but along the right bank.  Interval of public transport: buses run after 1 hour, minibuses leave more often. </p>

    <h2>  City of New Ladoga </h2><p>  During the Northern War, Peter I ordered the residents of Tikhvin and Ladoga to move to the vicinity of the old Nikolo-Medvedovsky Monastery, the location of which at the mouth of the Volkhov River the sovereign considered convenient for commerce and shipbuilding.  The proximity to St. Petersburg (120 km) and Shlisselburg was also taken into account.  For New Ladoga, the year 1704 was a turning point, when the shipyard was laid.  After 6 years, the first military vessels equipped with guns went down from the slipways. </p><p>  Ancient Ladoga began to be called "Old", and the new city quickly grew and settled down.  On its territory some buildings from the complex of St. Nicholas Medvedsky Monastery were preserved, a significant part of it was destroyed by German knights in 1538.  In total, there are 19 cultural, historical and architectural monuments in the city of Novaya Ladoga (Leningrad Region).  Among them are the buildings of the 18th century: the Clement Church and the officer club of the Suzdal Regiment. </p>

    <h2>  Rurik's residence </h2><p>  Staraya Ladoga is the oldest known Eastern Slavic city in Russia.  This large village during the Varangian Rurik became a territory, "where did the Russian land come from."  Founded Ladoga no later than 753 years, the name of the settlement was given in the Scandinavian language - Aldoga, which means ‚Äúold river‚Äù.  The advantageous position at the beginning of the journey from the northern countries to the south and east contributed to the heyday of the city.  In 862, he was led by the Varangian Rurik, who was called up to Russia, after some time transferring his residence to the headwaters of the Volkhov River - to Novgorod.  In Ladoga, another legendary prince Oleg the Prophet died. </p><p>  The fortified city flourished before the invasion of the Swedes in 1313, who came on ships on Lake Ladoga.  The remains of ancient buildings were found in 1702 by Peter I, who decided to relocate the old Ladoga people closer to the coast.  Archaeological excavations on the territory of the ancient fortress have been conducted for more than 130 years.  The found rarities and artifacts took a worthy place in the exposition of the Staroladozhsky archaeological museum-reserve.  On the territory of the village preserved churches of the pre-Mongol era, other temples and monasteries, ancient mounds and ancient settlement. </p>

    <h2>  Volkhov - a city on ancient trade routes </h2><p>  On the banks of the river.  Volkhov archaeologists have found numerous evidence that it was here that the Volga-Baltic route passed, and local residents carried merchant ships through the rapids.  In 1918, builders of one of the first-born of the GOELRO plan, the Volkhov Hydroelectric Power Station, and the sights of the city appeared in these parts. </p><p>  The Volkhov-Novaya Ladoga bus route passes through the village of Staraya Ladoga.  Only 10 km separate the industrial city from the Staroladozh Museum-Reserve.  Having traveled about 30 km southeast to Zelenets station, you can see the ensemble of the Trinity Monastery, built in the late Middle Ages.  There is one hotel in Staraya Ladoga, and 4 hotels in Volkhov where you can stay and relax. </p>
