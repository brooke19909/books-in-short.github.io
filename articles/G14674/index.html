  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Censuses of the USSR</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Governments of developed countries periodically conduct surveys of the population.  All-Union population censuses in the USSR, like any others, were carried out in order to see the real picture of the life of the population, to summarize the activities of state structures and to outline a further work plan.  There are, of course, other sources of information, such as the recording of acts of civil status, however, the study of archival documents may not always provide an answer to the question posed.  For example, in today's Russia it is impossible to identify information on the birth order of children in a family using documents.  Or another situation: the attestation commission stores data on the number of diplomas received, but it is impossible to determine how many people really work or can work in the scientific community, because some graduates went to completely different structures, and some went outside the state.  In our multinational country, it is impossible to ignore the linguistic and national issues.  Current statistics do not provide comprehensive information, and the census is becoming the only alternative. </p><p>  Over the entire existence of the country, eight such large-scale events were held.  Population censuses in the USSR had different goals, and, accordingly, the list of control questions changed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.playgroundmag.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Passport of a citizen of the USSR" class="if uuid-3090942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3090942.jpg"></div><h2>  1920 census </h2><p>  In the difficult circumstances of the unfinished Civil War and complete economic devastation, the first large-scale accounting was carried out within the borders of Soviet Russia.  The current situation dictated the special nature of the census. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The authorities were interested in the following parameters: </p><ul><li>  demographic aspect (birth rate, mortality and marital status); </li><li>  the availability of educational institutions; </li><li>  agricultural accounting; </li><li>  the presence of industrial enterprises. </li></ul><p>  At the center of the study was a man.  For the first time, in addition to the question of literacy, the question of the level of education and employment, as well as participation in wars, was included.  The results were processed manually.  Some areas still covered by the fire of war were not included, so this census is not considered universal. </p><h2>  Post-war data collection </h2><p>  The first <span>census</span> in the USSR was carried out in 1926.  One of the features was the replacement of the clause on nationality with a clause on nationality.  In addition to the main questions contained for the unemployed.  The authorities were interested in the duration of unemployment and the previous occupation.  The family card created specifically for the survey included the composition of the family with separate couples and children, housing conditions and the duration of the marriage.  The results were developed in the most thorough way, and special attention was paid to family data.  For the first time, the use of machine data processing began. </p><p>  In addition to the main survey tools of the census in the USSR, they included their own sheet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of the Asian part of the USSR" class="if uuid-3090928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3090928.jpg"></div><h2>  Population accounting during the period of repression </h2><p>  The 1937 census is considered unsuccessful and was double-checked in 1939.  Its main drawback was the date - one day.  A lot of difficulties caused by the change in the list of questions and the short term of the census, repeated postponement of the dates and constant interference in the preparation of the country's top leadership predetermined the failure of the procedure: the total number of residents was lower than the estimated.  The responsibility was transferred to the census leaders, who, in the light of the repressions of 1937, were recognized as enemies of the people.  The results were recognized as defective and were not published anywhere.  Subsequently, analyzing preliminary data, scientists found that the underestimation was small.  The quantitative indicator of the country's population, declared by senior management, turned out to be overestimated.  The number was exaggerated in order to hide the enormous loss of life during the famine and repressions of the 30s, as well as to prove the reliability of the statement of socialist propaganda that rapid population growth is one of the merits of the socialist social system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.prlib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Compilation published from the 1939 census" class="if uuid-3090701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3090701.jpg"></div><h2>  Data collection in 1939 </h2><p>  By the time of the repeated census in the USSR, the procedure was changed.  The program included issues such as a community group and attitude towards the head of the family, as well as a note on permanent and temporary residence.  A period of three years was allocated for processing information at three machine-counting stations.  However, only preliminary results were summed up and published. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.prlib.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Published 1939 Census Results" class="if uuid-3090715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116115/3090715.jpg"></div><h2>  1959 event </h2><p>  The 20-year break between the censuses of 1939 and 1959 was caused by huge casualties during the Great Patriotic War and economic post-war difficulties.  To military losses (27 million people) were added losses from hunger, which claimed about 1 million human lives.  Naturally, I. Stalin refused statistics in 1949, since this kind of information should have remained hidden and could not be used to promote a socialist lifestyle.  One of the results of the event was the introduction of benefits for the third and next child in order to increase childbirth among the Russian population. </p><p>  The 1970 census is significant in that for the first time in its process only a quarter of the country's population was interviewed (the method of selective information).  The results of this event showed that for every thousand men in the country there are about 1,200 women, and the share of the urban population (56%) is almost equal to the rural (44%). </p><p>  The processing of data collected during the 1979 census in the USSR of the USSR was carried out for the first time using computers.  The results of the work carried out with great care subsequently became a source of widely used information about changes in the composition of the country's population. </p><p>  The last (1989) census in the USSR differed from the previous ones by the inclusion of information on living conditions.  The results became the basis for the development of housing cooperation. </p><p>  The procedure for large-scale registration of the population has changed and improved throughout all 70 years of the existence of the Soviet Union.  Data that has not always been preserved is securely hidden in local and central archives.  For those who want to look into the past of their family and fatherland, one of the sources of information may be the census of the USSR.  You can find a person by contacting the local government, which is in charge of the state archives. </p>
