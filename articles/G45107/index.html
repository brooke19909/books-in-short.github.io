Greece was defeated by the war with Sparta, which lasted 27 years with short interruptions.  In addition, immediately after the fall of Athens, other cities began to fight with each other for the primacy.  A significant crisis swept through Ancient Persia, the sun of the Achaemen dynasty was dropping to sunset.  Due to constant attacks, Egypt was ruined.

    <p>  The turning point for history was 359 BC.  e.  The distant Greek province was led by the twenty-three-year-old king Philip.  Under his leadership, Ancient Macedonia was born.  But he became not only the founder of the empire, but also opened a second wind to the culture of Greece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Greece fan </h2><p>  Philip was born in the <span>capital of Macedonia</span> - Pella, in a royal family.  He ascended the throne during the bloody events.  The cause of the strife was Philip's mother, Eurydice, who had a love affair with her daughter's husband.  On her orders, the king was killed. </p><p>  His brother Perdicckus ascended the throne, who was killed by enemies in 359 BC.  e.  Then Philip became king of Macedonia instead of a minor nephew.  But later, having won the confidence of the troops, he removed the heir and took the throne.  It was he who expanded the poor province to the size of the empire, which is known as Ancient Macedonia.  The history of the establishment of the state began with the military reform of the ruler.  Another way to success was diplomacy. </p><p>  Philip was the first to arm his warriors with long spears (up to six meters).  Thanks to this, the traditional phalanx became invincible.  Another invention was the first catapult.  During the battles in 338 BC  e.  he became the full ruler of Greece. </p>

    <h2>  Intrigues of the Macedonian elite </h2><p>  A year later, the king was carried away by a noble girl from Macedonia, because of which he divorced his wife the Olympics.  From his first marriage, he had two children: daughter Cleopatra and son Alexander, who should have led the empire of Ancient Macedonia later on.  But the new marriage of the father did not suit the young man.  Therefore, he left his mother after Macedonia.  Philip apologized to his son, and he returned to his homeland, trying to remain neutral and not to take sides in the conflict of his parents. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 336 BC  e., during the wedding ceremony of daughter Philip, one of the guards rushed forward and killed the king.  He died at the age of 47. </p><p>  The killer was executed when he tried to escape.  History is still unknown who was the customer.  According to one version, this is an offended Olympiad.  Alexander was also blamed.  Also under suspicion was the brother of the Olympics - Alexander Molossky.  Later, Philip's son officially blamed the Persians. </p><h2>  Finishing Father </h2><p>  The new ruler in the person of Alexander received Ancient Macedonia.  Greece was already subordinate to the new king, but he decided to implement his father‚Äôs plan and capture Persia.  The ruler continued to develop military engineering in 334 BC.  e.  went to the enemies.  The victory on land was easy and lightning fast.  But in the course of the battles a problem arose - the absence of a combat-ready fleet.  Alexander compensated for this with a new strategy.  He attacked important naval bases from land. </p><p>  After defeating the old enemies - the Persians - the king went to Egypt, the granary, which was supposed to feed his entire empire.  He has respected this civilization with centuries of history, and there he was greeted as a god.  Egypt surrendered voluntarily.  Ancient Macedonia gave a new impetus to the development of Egyptian and Greek culture. </p>

    <p>  After the death of Macedon, his warlords divided the empire among themselves. </p><h2>  The heyday of the empire </h2><p>  Philip was a supporter of Greece.  There is evidence that from 368-365 years.  BC  e.  he was captured in Thebes, where he became interested in the culture of a <span>developed country.</span>  Therefore, after the conquest of Greece, he allowed the bright minds of that time to return to their cities and continue to work.  The king invited the Greek philosophers and teachers to his homeland.  The culture, language, and writing of Ancient Macedonia were based on the knowledge of the Greeks. </p>

Each conquered city was immersed in Hellenism, that is, it completely turned into a Greek polis with a temple, agora (market square) and theater.  The priority of father and son was the creation of not only a large, but also a civilized empire.
