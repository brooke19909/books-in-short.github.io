    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Side's Mediterranean climate is suitable even for those tourists who have pressure problems.  The best time to visit this resort is the period from May to October, when the sea temperature is the most comfortable.  Hotels in this popular resort among Russians are presented for every wealth and taste.  Here there are both chic ‚Äú <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="18" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">fives</span> ‚Äù and inexpensive ‚Äú <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="19" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">treshki</span> ‚Äù.  Most of them are on the first line and have their own plot on the beach area.  Side is a great option for families with children.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="35" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">In addition to the fact</span> that almost all hotels have the appropriate infrastructure for small customers, there is a very convenient entrance to the water and few stones.  Therefore, many tour operators for tourists with young children recommend exactly Side hotels, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="36" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">in particular</span> Nova Beach Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nova Beach Hotel 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2122644.jpg"></div>

This factor is primarily due to the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="0" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSemantic">fairly affordable</span> prices of local hotels and, of course, excellent service.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="9" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Recently</span> , the number of Russians choosing to stay at Nova Beach Hotel in Side has increased.  It has a great location.  The hotel is built in the heart of the resort, within walking distance of the ancient city, amphitheater and harbor.  Around is beautiful nature: the city is surrounded by orange and pine groves, so an amazing aroma of freshness soars in the air. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="20" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Another</span> advantage of the hotel is its small <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="21" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">distance</span> from the airport.  Transfer lasts less than an hour, which is convenient primarily for tourists with children. <br>  Nova Beach Hotel was built at the end of the last century, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="37" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">but</span> this does not mean that it is old.  It was reconstructed several times.  The last time major repairs with the replacement of furniture and plumbing was carried out in 2013. </p><p>  The first thing that catches the eye of tourists is the accuracy of the territory.  She is clean and well maintained, albeit small. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nova Beach Hotel Turkey" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2122641.jpg"></div>

Bathrooms <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="24" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">combined</span> with a shower, there is the most minimal set of hygiene items. </p><h2>  Suggested meals </h2><p>  For many Russians, the question of the quality of the food provided is in the first <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="15" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">place - higher than</span> even the offered service and number of rooms.  When a tourist buys a tour to a Turkish hotel with an all-inclusive concept, he tries to distract himself as much as possible from all household worries, so he wants the food offered to be of high quality and delicious.  Judging by the reviews of many Russians, Nova Beach Hotel offers just such a meal.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="6" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">This</span> hotel, like most others in Turkey, operates according to the all-inclusive concept that is incredibly popular among Russians.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="25" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Moreover</span> , the price of the tour includes not only the "buffet" provided three times a day, but also delicious coffee and an unlimited number of drinks, including alcohol from a local producer. </p><p>  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="38" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">In addition to the</span> main restaurant, the hotel also has a coffee shop, a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="11" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">snack bar</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="13" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">  </span>  and a beach bar.  Within walking distance, in the center of Side, there are many other √† la carte establishments. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Excellent food, good rooms, quality service, the presence of a swimming pool on the hotel territory - all this infrastructure, of course, should be at the level, but when a tourist goes on vacation to the sea, he is always interested in how far the beach is, whether it is comfortable and what coating has.  Those who choose Nova Beach Hotel 3 * have nothing to worry about.  The beach is just a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="27" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">three</span> minute walk, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="28" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">it</span> has free sunbeds and umbrellas.

    <h2>  Conditions for the smallest </h2><p>  Since the hotel area is small (only 2.5 thousand square <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">meters</span> ), children have nowhere to go around.  Nevertheless, for them in a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="29" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">green</span> oasis there is a small playground.  <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="30" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">Another</span> service for the smallest is the provision of high chairs in the main restaurant. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Nova Beach Hotel offers residents an outdoor pool with sun loungers and parasols.  There is also a bar where tourists with all-inclusive bracelets can get drinks for free until midnight.  Of the on-site entertainment, only table tennis and paid billiards are provided.

    <h2>  Nova Beach Hotel Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of Russians have remained quite their rest.  First of all, our compatriots note a convenient location - the proximity of the beach, shops and cafes. </p><p>  There were no particular complaints about the placement.  The only drawback that some Russians note is that the staff knows only Turkish and German and at the same time does not understand Russian at all.  The fact is that the Germans <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="16" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="14" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">  </span>  The main contingent of vacationers at Nova Beach Hotel.  If necessary, a manager is called who speaks not only English, but also a little Russian.  Nevertheless, the presence of a language barrier does not affect the work of the staff: the hotel employees are always polite and smiling. </p><p>  As for the rooms, they have everything you need.  Especially Russians liked the bungalows. </p><p>  The food is very tasty and varied.  According to some, here they feed, as in the expensive " <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="31" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">five</span> ".  There are always meat and chicken, fish, as well as all kinds of snacks and salads on the trays.  Many liked the delicious cakes.  From the terrace of the restaurant, located in front of the sea, a very beautiful panorama opens.  Very <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="32" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">warm</span> sea, sandy beach with a gentle entrance to the water, sun loungers with mattresses, showers - all is well. </p><p>  One main drawback of <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="7" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkStyle">this</span> hotel <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="33" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">, nevertheless</span> , is the complete lack of animation.
