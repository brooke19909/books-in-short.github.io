  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Temperature in the refrigerator and its effect on the shelf life of products</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  One of the most important household appliances in any kitchen is considered a refrigerator.  It is intended for products that require lower storage temperatures.  The basis of his work is the principle of heat processing and its transformation into the external environment.  Refrigerators come in different sizes, colors, volumes, and can also be equipped with various functions.  The temperature in the refrigerator is maintained at a certain level and contributes to the long-term storage of products. </p><p>  Usually this appliance consists of two parts: a refrigerator and a freezer.  This is a classic option.  The freezer is designed to <span>freeze food.</span>  Its <span>average temperature</span> is an average of -18 degrees.  Today, mainly two-chamber refrigerators are manufactured, where the two components are located separately from each other. </p><p>  Many people are interested in the temperature in the refrigerator.  It may vary depending on the model of this household appliance. </p><p>  Modern technology is equipped with a function for adjusting the temperature inside the refrigerator or freezer, as well as in separate compartments (in some models).  However, this does not save some products from spoilage.  The reason for this is the improper distribution or storage of food in the refrigerator.  Therefore, consider a few tips regarding this problem. </p><p>  The temperature in the refrigerator is not evenly distributed.  From the school physics program, we know that warm air tends to rise up.  Consequently, the lower shelves of the refrigerator will have the lowest temperature, and at the top - the highest.  Therefore, it is necessary to arrange products accordingly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The average temperature in the refrigerator reaches 4 degrees.  However, thanks to modern advances in the production of household appliances, this option can be adjusted.  If the products began to deteriorate faster than it should be, you just need to set a higher temperature.  Start with small values, that is, reduce it by 1 (maximum 2) degrees.  If you notice that there is a slight freezing of food, make the <span>temperature higher</span> by 1 or 2 degrees.  The temperature in the freezer may not be lower than -30 degrees.  Optimum for freezing foods are -20 degrees.  These parameters must be taken into account when choosing a <span>temperature regime.</span> </p><p>  Every housewife should know that the products should be properly distributed in the refrigerator.  Those of the same type can be stored on the same shelf.  It is better to keep all products in packaging.  This is necessary primarily so that they do not absorb the smell of neighboring products.  For packaging, you can use a special film.  This is especially true for very fatty foods that give their flavor well. </p><p>  For water, milk, juices and other bottled drinks there are special compartments on the doors.  Vodka and other alcoholic beverages can be stored in the freezer. </p><p>  Each product has information on storage conditions.  Read it carefully and select the appropriate storage location. </p><p>  Some home appliance models have a dry zone.  In this case, the temperature in the refrigerator is zero, and the humidity is about 50%.  In this area, products are stored a little longer. </p><p>  The wet zone, which some models are also equipped with, on the contrary, has a humidity of about 90% and zero temperature.  Here greens and fruits perfectly retain their qualities. </p><p>  Using this information, you can extend the shelf life of some products in the refrigerator, without losing their quality.  Do not forget to use all the functions that your home appliances have, because they are provided for convenience. </p>
