There are a lot of hotels here, from very cheap guest houses to chic spa complexes.  We offer you to stay in a very comfortable hotel of medium price category Paradise Beach Resort 4 *.  An interesting fact - in Zanzibar, the stars themselves award the hotels to the owners, so their number does not always correspond to the quality.  Regarding Paradise Beach Resort, you can be absolutely sure that he is given four stars honestly.  Here, tourists are waiting for excellent rooms, quality food, excellent service.  The owner of this establishment, Senor Alejandro lives in one of the rooms, eats what the cook prepares for the guests, so there is always control over the taste and freshness of dishes.  With tourists, Senor Alejandro is friendly and sociable.  You can always turn to him and quickly resolve any issue. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In a picturesque place <span>of Zanzibar Island</span> , where there is white sand, palm trees and turquoise waters of the ocean, there is Paradise Beach Resort 4 *.  Tanzania, more precisely, its coastline from the island is located only 40 km.  If you look at the map, you can see that Zanzibar rises from the water almost parallel to the continent, stretching from the southeast to northwest.  Its western side is washed by the Zanzibar Strait, and the eastern Indian Ocean.  Approximately in the center of this part of the coast there is a large bay, on the banks of which the relatively large city of Kwaka Town has grown.  7 km from it, Uroa Beach stretches with a wide hundred-kilometer ribbon.  This is where the hotel we are describing is located.  In walking distance from it there are only small fishing villages, so the rest of the guests is perfectly calm and measured.  Here you will find a special life, completely unlike the mainland, untouched by man natural massifs, beauty, purity and serenity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paradise Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1729492.jpg" width="488"></div>

Zanzibar has its own international airport named after Amani Karume.  His second name is Kisonuni.  Unfortunately, not all airlines have flights here from Russia.  If you fly with Flydubai, there will be only one connection in Dubai, with Qatar Airways there is also one connection in Doha.  If you use the services of other airlines flying to Tanzania, there will be two transfers - in Dubai and in Dar es Salaam or in Nairobi.  In all cases, you will have to wait from 5 to 12 hours to expect the desired flight at the airports.  Arriving at Zanzibar, getting to the hotel is already easy.  It is most convenient to take advantage of the transfer provided by travel agencies where tickets were purchased.  Independent tourists can take a taxi.  You will have to pay about $ 80 for it.  Drive from the airport to the hotel a little less than 40 km.  In time it takes half an hour. </p><h2>  Description of the hotel and territory </h2><p>  Paradise Beach Resort 4 * began to function in 2009.  Its name "Paradise Coast" is fully true.  The territory it occupies is not very large, only 2 hectares, but it is unusually beautiful, lawns, flowerbeds are broken all around, benches are installed, hammocks are suspended.  In the shade of palm trees and surrounded by flowers unusual for the Russian eye, there are pretty buildings and bungalows under <span>reed roofs.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paradise Beach Resort 4 Zanzibar" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1729511.jpg" width="495"></div>  Near the houses there are two swimming pools, one large, the other small, a hydromassage bathtub, which can be used for free, is installed slightly under the African-style canopy.  In the public area there is a bar stylized as an exotic gazebo and a small shop.  Free parking is available at the main entrance.  Please note that there are several hotels in Zanzibar whose name includes the words "Paradise Beach", so sometimes there are confusion in the description.  Our hotel is located almost on the shore of the vast ocean.  From some of his bungalows to the sand line is only a couple of meters.

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  To accommodate guests provides 56 rooms Paradise Beach Resort 4 * (Zanzibar).  Reviews about them are good.  For tourists who have traveled a long way and spent long hours at airports and airplanes, it is very valuable that the hotel at the official Check in at 14-00 places accommodation immediately upon arrival, and if the number indicated in the voucher is busy, people are accommodated in an equivalent free.  Additional payments for this do not require.  The design of all rooms is different, but everywhere there is a special Zanzibar flavor.  It is created by tapestries on the walls, figurines and animal figures, beautiful stoles on beds, and somewhat unusual furniture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Room categories in buildings: </p><p>  - "Standard" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã24 square meters. </p><p>  Categories in the bungalow: </p><p>  - "Standard" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã18 square meters. </p><p>  - "Suite" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã41 square meters. </p><p>  - "Premium" with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã45 square meters. </p><p>  There are also family houses located literally on the coastline. </p><p>  Views from the windows can be on the garden, pool and ocean.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  It is advisable to take all-inclusive tours at Paradise Beach Resort 4 *.  Reviews about the catering are excellent.  The only thing tourists are warned about is that you need to come to the restaurant at the beginning of breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The menu includes all kinds of salads, fresh vegetables, side dishes, chicken, beef, seafood, sweets, exotic fruits.  From drinks coffee, Coca-Cola, sprite, tea, beer, wine, delicious cocktails are offered. </p><p>  There are 4 bars in the hotel infrastructure, all open until 24-00.  Local drinks and cocktails are free here. </p><p>  Light snacks and pizza are available at the poolside bar throughout the day. </p><p>  On the beach and in the neighboring village, locals sell mangoes and pineapples very cheaply every day. </p><p>  It is nice that the birthday party administration gives the cake.  Congratulation takes place solemnly during dinner, when all the guests are present in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Leisure for adults </h2><p>  The Paradise Beach Resort 4 * hotel is focused on a quiet harmonious vacation.  Guests here can spend time at the pools around which sun loungers and umbrellas are installed.  The water in the pools is always clean, beach towels are changed by the reception staff upon request.  There is a bar nearby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paradise Beach Resort 4 Tanzania" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1729487.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <p>  For sports fans, there is a small fitness room on site, which can be practiced for free.  There is a massage parlor nearby for relaxation lovers. </p><p>  In the evenings in the restaurant and on the veranda of the hotel entertainment programs, performances by artists, interesting shows are held.  According to the reviews of our tourists, you need to pay for them in the course of action. </p><h2>  Leisure for children </h2><p>  Not a lot of services provides Paradise Beach Resort 4 * for its little tourists.  For them, a children's section is equipped in the pool, and in the rooms, at the request of the parents, the cots are installed for the kids.  For children under 1 year they are free, for the rest you need to pay 27.5 cu  per day.  In the evenings for kids, a mini-disco and a short entertainment program are held.  There is no playground in the territory yet; there is no children's menu in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Holidays in Zanzibar largely depend on which side of the island you chose the hotel.  In the west, in view of the fact that there is only 40 km to the mainland of the water surface, there are almost never tangible tides.  On the east, "looking" into the vast ocean, the <span>ebbs and flows are</span> very significant.  They are up to 4 times a day, with water leaving the coast for 2 km.  Especially tangible water movements in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãUroa beach.  For this reason, it cannot be said that a beach holiday at the Paradise Beach Resort (Uroa) 4 stars is very successful, although the hotel is located almost on the beach.  It is very good to sunbathe here, since the sand on the beach is white and very soft, like flour, and umbrellas and sunbeds are always available, and they are free.  If the tide is caught, the entry into the water on the beach at the hotel is very even, the depth does not start from the shore itself, which is especially appreciated by vacationers with young children. </p><p>  Adults and during high tide are not very comfortable relaxing on this beach, because there are too many algae.  Some tourists think that they are being brought in from the ocean, but this is only partially true.  In fact, in the Uroa region, the locals have whole plantations of these algae.  They grow them and sell them in restaurants.  Our tourists can even organize excursions to these underwater plantations. </p><p>  During low tide, the hotel provides free transport to the nearby beach, 3.5 km from Uroa.  Here, water level fluctuations are weaker, and the ocean is a little cleaner. </p><p>  Those who rented a car do not depend on the quirks of nature, because any beaches of Zanzibar are accessible to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paradise Beach Resort Uroa 4" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1729501.jpg" width="492"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  To diversify your vacation, there are a lot of opportunities for the guests of Paradise Beach Resort 4 *.  Zanzibar is an unusually beautiful and distinctive island.  The most popular tourist destination here is Stone Town (Stone Town) and its so-called House of Miracles.  This is the palace of the former sultan of the country and at the same time a museum.  The unusual carved doors standing in almost every house attract attention in this city.  In addition to Stone Town, tourists are always invited to visit the famous Josani forest with its unique plants and animals, spice plantations, the Tomb island, where flying dogs live, the Prison island to stare there on huge turtles.  It is very interesting to do snorkeling and diving in Zanzibar, because the underwater inhabitants of coastal waters are unusually beautiful. </p><p>  In addition, tourists can rent a car or order a taxi and go to the west coast, where there are dozens of cafes, discos, bars and nightclubs.  There, a noisy fun life boils almost until the morning. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  Paradise Beach Resort 4 * is perfect for those who dream of a relaxing holiday, away from the noise of tourist centers, night clubs and discos.  On the coast where it is located, there are not even shops, only small kiosks with a limited selection of goods. </p><p>  The hotel rooms are cozy and comfortable, but in them, as on the entire coast, they often turn off the lights.  This entails turning off the air conditioners and the water supply. </p><p>  The hotel allows pets. </p><p>  Payment for services here is accepted in cash.  Reservations can be paid by credit card. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lagoon Paradise Beach Resort 4" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1729465.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  Paradise Beach Resort 4 * (Zanzibar, Tanzania), reviews </h2><p>  This hotel has a rating of 4.3-4.5 points out of 5. Such high tourist ratings prove that the conditions for a comfortable stay are excellent.  The advantages noted in the reviews: </p><p>  - well-groomed beautiful area; </p><p>  - bright, spacious rooms; </p><p>  - tasty food; </p><p>  - wonderful working staff; </p><p>  - close proximity to the ocean. </p><p>  Hotel comments are as follows: </p><p>  - Wi-Fi is weak; </p><p>  - light often turns off; </p><p>  - far all entertainment centers; </p><p>  - strong tides on the beach. </p><h2>  Paradise in Sri Lanka </h2><p>  In conclusion, I would like to briefly talk about the Lagoon Paradise Beach Resort 4 * hotel.  It is also located in a tropical garden on the Indian Ocean, but on the other side from Zanzibar, namely in Sri Lanka, in the Tangalla region.  It is also very beautiful, there are many flowers and evergreen shrubs on the territory, bungalows under reed roofs, a pool and a bar are located in the shade of palm trees.  The hotel is located on the coast, 7 km from the nearest town, so the rest here is also very calm and harmonious. </p><p>  In Lagoon Paradise Beach Resort 4 * (Sri Lanka), only 35 rooms are offered for tourists, among which 12 are standard, 16 are deluxe and 7 are so-called Cabana, including 1 with a beach view and 6 with a view the lagoon.  All are equipped with a TV, air conditioning, fan, fridge, furnished terrace and hygiene room.  All rooms are very spacious and comfortable, made in white and brown colors. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of this hotel is that it is very rare to sell tickets to the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystem.  Mostly, breakfast is included in the room rate and is served in a restaurant by the ocean.  Tourists must pay extra for lunch and dinner.  Another inconvenience is that you can get from this hotel to the city only on tuk-tuk "accredited" at the hotel.  Drivers' prices are quite high.  The rest of the rest in this corner of Sri Lanka is excellent. </p>
