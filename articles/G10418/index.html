Reviews about this institution contain a number of negative comments, the most significant of which can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  The interior of the hotel is already quite "tired" and shabby, and therefore the repair will not interfere. </li><li>  The floor in the room is covered with carpet, which is completely covered with spots.  Despite the fact that they clean the apartment every day, it does not get any cleaner (the only positive point is the daily change of bed linen). </li><li>  Frozen convenience foods predominate on the buffet menu. </li><li>  The same dishes are served every day for breakfast, and since their variety is not very large, they become boring in a couple of days. </li><li>  The furniture in the rooms is very old and scratched. </li><li>  The actual design of the hotel is much more modest than in the photo on the Internet. </li><li>  Even if you arrived at the hotel with huge, heavy suitcases, you should not expect someone to help you get them to the room. </li><li>  The restaurant is very cramped, and therefore there is little fresh air and huge lines at the distribution. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  In all the variety of dishes served in the restaurant, there are no dietary ones, which creates great difficulties in providing food for children. </li><li>  To get to the sea, you have to cross a busy highway. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the hotel is focused on a quiet family vacation, it is always very crowded and noisy (this is due to the specifics of local tourists). </li><li>  All hotel rooms, including rooms, are thoroughly saturated with the smell of tobacco smoke. </li><li>  At night, the noise of the ventilation system makes it very difficult to sleep. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Mixed feelings evoke relaxation in the resort Leonardo Privilege Eilat 4 * (Eilat).  Reviews about this place mark exceptional courtesy and courtesy of the staff in relation to the guests.  The restaurant also serves a delicious buffet three times a day.  Its menu is significantly different from the standard, because here the emphasis is on the local cuisine.  In addition, there is a huge amount of living space and light in the rooms, as well as a private balcony.  Perhaps this is all the positive points. </p><p>  The specificity of this hotel is that, according to the preferential system, a huge number of local people are settled here, which is characterized by very strange standards of behavior.  They smoke in restaurants, rooms, lobbies, scatter trash, shout - and no one makes any comments about this.  Therefore, if you are planning a vacation in this institution, check with the administration in advance whether such rides are planned for the period of your intended stay.  It is also worth noting that the hotel just needs repairs, because all the furniture is old, creaking and very worn. </p>
