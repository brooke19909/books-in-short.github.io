Unfortunately or fortunately, everything about this device was known even before the exhibition - some craftsmen mercilessly merged all the information into the Network, which, however, was completely confirmed. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2><p>  If you are a person interested in phones, then you should be interested in the LG V30, the release date and features, an overview of which will be presented in this article.  If you came here to find out specific numbers, then we hasten to disappoint you: at the exhibition, the exact delivery dates were not announced, as, indeed, the prices.  It would, of course, be more convenient if more data about the LG V30 were leaked to the Network: release date, features, price, which countries will be delivered.  But, alas, we are content only with conjectures. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, after the exhibition it is already possible to confidently evaluate the brand new flagship phone.  And he has many advantages, believe me. </p><h2>  Phone view </h2><p>  A lot of important things in LG V30: release date and specifications, appearance.  But it‚Äôs precisely the latter that‚Äôs what we evaluate the phone at when we first met.  In appearance, the novelty from LG is very reminiscent of Samsung products.  Still the same wide display, rounded corners, thin edges, the case, stylized as metal.  Seeing such a phone in the hand of a passerby, you will confuse it with the Samsung with a high probability.  However, the similarities dissipate as soon as you take the Samsung smartphone in one hand and the LG V30 in the other.  The first thing that catches your eye is size.  The presented flagship is wider and higher, and also black stripes on the display vary greatly in width. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Two main questions about the LG V30: release date and display.  And here we can give an answer only to one of them.  The main advantage of any smartphone is its work surface.  Here it is in abundance.  At your disposal 6 inches of high-quality screen with a resolution of 2880 by 1440 pixels.  As you can see, the sides are 19: 8.  As expected from such a hot new product, the color reproduction of the V30 is at the highest level. </p>

    <p>  Especially pleased with the saturation of dark colors, so if you prefer the aesthetics of a variety of dark shades, then this flagship will pleasantly surprise you.  But the fact that the control buttons are transferred to the display itself will have to get used to.  But this is not critical.  The graphics chipset Adreno 540 is responsible for the performance of the display. Its power is enough to maintain color reproduction to "excellent" even with an active game, which already shows its level.  Another clear advantage of the LG V30 display is its low power consumption.  This significantly increases the working life on a single charge.  Undoubtedly, the entire graphic component is easily customizable to the needs and whims of the user.  Here you change the brightness, and change the color scheme, and many additional pleasant surprises. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  LG V30: release date and specifications, design </h2><p>  Apparently, the smartphone will hit the shelves by the end of this year.  As you can see, the phone is small in size and very conveniently fits in your hand.  It is thin enough to fit perfectly into the inside pocket of a jacket (7.3 millimeters).  And the ratio of length to width (151.7 and 75.4 mm) is not bad. </p>

    <p>  A notable feature is the presence of the power button of the fingerprint scanner on the back cover of the smartphone.  Also pleased with the dual main camera, auxiliary sensors and LED flash to it.  The volume buttons are customarily placed on the left side. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  When the next flagship telephone comes into the world, what is the first thing that interests buyers?  Two questions torment buyers of the LG V30: release date and specifications.  What is inside this gadget?  This is of interest to many.  We respond immediately. </p>

    <p>  The entire system operates thanks to eight Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor cores with a frequency of 2.45 GHz.  This is a fairly powerful microprocessor that provides stable fast operation even with a heavy system load.  To help him allocated as much as 4 gigabytes of RAM.  A very good tandem.  There is plenty of internal memory here - 2 gigabytes with the possibility of using MicroSD up to two terabytes.  Very impressive, isn't it? </p><h2>  Photo and video </h2><p>  At the same presentation, almost everything was said about the LG V30: release date and specifications, photos and videos.  It was the last two points that received particular attention.  V30 developers noticed that more and more people are uploading author's photos and videos to the Web.  Therefore, it was decided to put in the phone some of the best cameras that LG could only afford.  The decision to pursue modern trends is a very wise move, and the company used it one hundred percent.  As a result, additional software for shooting was embedded in the phone system, which makes the picture much more attractive.  And, of course, as many as three cameras: one front and two main. </p>

    <p>  All cameras use optical lenses made of pure glass to achieve maximum quality, which standard plastic can not guarantee.  However, the cost of such lenses is much higher, but the game was worth the candle.  Paired with 16 megapixels of the main camera and 13 megapixels of its "little sister", this phone is capable of taking very high-quality photos even in a dark room or at night. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Well, if we talk about the LG V30, the release date and characteristics of this phone, then you need to consider that it is powered by a 3300 milliampere / hour battery.  This battery is completely and completely enough for a day or more, taking into account aggressive work.  It is possible to charge the battery both by charging from a 220 volt network, and by means of a special station, that is, wireless charging.  The duration of the charge also helps to increase the program to save battery power.  At its core, this is just a set of protocols in case you need to maintain the performance of your device for some time to come. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  The company put the main effort into the display and cameras, and this can be seen immediately, as soon as the phone falls into hands.  But what can music lovers do for whom the phone is primarily a platform for listening to music, a multifunctional player?  There are certainly a lot of such people, and LG has not forgotten about them.  For this reason, the V30 has an audio chip amplifier that can improve the quality of the sound coming from the speakers.  Speaking of them. </p>

    <p>  The speakers in the phone are still quiet, and you can only appreciate the usefulness of the built-in chip when you connect a good headset to the phone.  But otherwise, they are suitable for light background music. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The LG V30, whose release date and specifications were discussed above, receives a lot of comments from users.  To summarize, what do we have?  As many have noticed, the LG V30 is not a rival, but a worthy competitor to the now-leading Samsung.  And it's hard to argue with that.  But if we separate the model from everyone else, we get a phone with unusually prioritized, shifted towards the display and shooting amateur photos and videos.  Nevertheless, it is minimalist, beautiful, of acceptable size, easily suitable for today's trends, powerful enough, with optimal energy consumption. </p>
