But few people know that this resort village has a namesake in the Primorsky Territory of Russia.  Rather, this settlement in the Far East was named so because of indirect competition with the Crimean.  Say, Livadia Bay <span>in the Primorsky Territory</span> lies at the same geographical latitude as the South Coast.  Check if this is so.  And what kind of rest is there?  How developed is the infrastructure of the Far Eastern village to host holidaymakers?  We are investigating this issue as well.  Here you will find a brief overview <span>of the recreation centers</span> in the village.  We will also talk about the climatic features of the Primorsky Territory.  And how to get to Livadia?  What is there to see?  You will learn about all this from our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest in livadia of the coastal region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2182496.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where is Livadia located </h2><p>  The geographical latitude on which the village is located is 42 ¬∞ 52 ‚Ä≤ s.  w.  And this is a degree and 40 minutes (that is, about 185 kilometers) south of the Crimean Livadia!  <span>This village</span> is located in Primorye near the city of Nakhodka.  Rather, since 2004 it has been its area.  Holidays in Livadia of the <span>Primorsky Territory</span> has several advantages.  The first is easy accessibility.  From the center of Nakhodka, the resort can be reached in just 50 minutes.  Every hour there goes a city bus number 122. <span>Residents of Vladivostok,</span> from which Livadia is separated by 154 kilometers, have the opportunity to come to the resort with a direct bus that leaves daily.  Motorists will easily reach the coastal village, moving along the highway from Nakhodka to Uglovoye, and near the village of Dushkino, turning south.  From Vladivostok, getting to the seaside resort is even easier.  After all, the A188 highway goes through it.  The village itself is small.  Only 18 thousand people live in it.  But every summer 30,000 tourists visit it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Livadia coastal region photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2182483.jpg"></div>

As it turned out, geographical latitude is not the main thing.  The more southern Primorsky Livadia has a much more severe climate than its Crimean namesake.  And all because of the cold current.  It causes fogs and drizzle even in June and the first half of July.  The cold sea warms up only to +20 degrees even in summer.  But in the bay of Livadia - shallow water.  Therefore, comfortable bathing temperatures are set there + 23-24 degrees.  The best period for a holiday in Livadia of the Primorsky Territory is August.  Autumn (September and early October) is also a good time.  It is warm, clear weather.  But gusty northerly winds can reduce the temperature from +20 to zero in just a couple of days.  In addition, the Primorsky Territory is a zone of passage of typhoons.  So in the summer, they can ruin your vacation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Livadia bay coastal region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2182488.jpg"></div>
