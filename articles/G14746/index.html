    <p>  The picturesque small hotel Mira Golden <span>Resort Hotel 4 *</span> is located almost in the center of Kemer, not far from the sea coast.  This is a cozy place where you can relax, enjoying the beauty of nature and views of the mighty mountains.  The distance to the nearest international airport, which is located in Antalya, is about 45 km, but the hotel, as well as travel agencies, as a rule, provides its customers with a convenient transfer.  By the way, the center of Antalya with all its attractions and entertainment for tourists is 55 km away. </p><p>  The hotel itself is small, but very comfortable.  The territory here is generously decorated with greenery, so walking along it is a pleasure.  In the center is a large four-story building.  In the courtyard there is a swimming pool, sports fields, places for relaxation and much more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel complex Mira Garden Resort <span>Hotel 4 * (Turkey,</span> Kemer): what do the rooms look like? </h2>
