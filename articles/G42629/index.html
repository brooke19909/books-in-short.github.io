In the cultural life of the former fishing village, the Middle Ages and modernity were closely intertwined.  Thanks to the picturesque landscapes and developed infrastructure, the city has turned into a popular tourist center. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The real pearl of the country is located on the shores of the North Sea.  The colorful Stavanger (Norway), surrounded by beaches, fjords and mountains, appeared in 1125, and after the construction of the episcopate and the cathedral, it becomes the administrative and religious center.  However, after four centuries, it loses all statuses and becomes an ordinary fishing settlement, in which no more than three thousand people lived. </p>

    <p>  The 19th century was marked by the appearance of the first canneries, and the village began to actively develop.  And long before the beginning of the oil age, the city flourishes thanks to smoked fish.  It is known that about 70 enterprises producing canned goods with herring and sprats worked here.  Unfortunately, in 1965 all the plants were closed, and only a few years later, when an oil field was found in the fourth largest city, it turned into a key region for the country's economy.  Almost the entire population works in this industry, and the city has the lowest unemployment rate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate and weather </h2><p>  Stavanger (Norway), before visiting which it is advisable to get acquainted with the features of the mild <span>marine climate, is</span> beautiful at any time of the year.  Tourists who want to visit the northern city in winter will not freeze, because the average temperature in the daytime ranges from 0 <sup>0</sup>  to + 8 <sup>0</sup> , and there can be frosts only at night.  To travel this time of year, warm clothes and shoes are needed to roam the cozy streets without fear of sea coolness.  Snow in the city in winter is a very rare occurrence. </p><p>  One of the most wonderful times to visit the oil capital, open to the moist and warm winds from the Atlantic, is spring.  Snow is already melting in April, and the temperature rises to +14 <sup>0</sup> . There are very few cloudy days (no more than 8-10), and almost no precipitation.  Such weather conditions make the northern city especially attractive in the eyes of tourists. </p><p>  Summer is the rainy season, and therefore it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the weather forecast in advance so that the impressions of the trip are not spoiled by heavy rainfall and cloudy days.  With the arrival of cyclones from the Atlantic, wind speed can increase up to 10-12 meters per second, and the temperature does not rise above + 25 <sup>0</sup> C. When going on vacation, grab an umbrella with a raincoat. </p><p>  In the fall, when there are a lot of clear days (the temperature ranges from 10 <sup>0</sup>  to 20 <sup>0</sup> ), it is so nice to get acquainted with a city that can tell a lot about its rich history. </p><h2>  City beaches </h2><p>  The fabulously beautiful Stavanger (Norway), characterized by a warm climate, offers guests a lot of options for active and passive recreation.  Its sandy beaches, the longest in Norway, are also considered the most beautiful.  By the way, along the coast are numerous lighthouses that receive tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Sulastranden is a popular beach where you can not only swim and sunbathe, but also enjoy water sports, which are facilitated by windy weather. </p><h2>  Cultural capital </h2><p>  It is no coincidence that the city of Stavanger (Norway) is called the cultural capital of the country: there are a huge number of theaters and museums that are of interest to vacationers. </p><p>  Huge kilns for smoking fish, cans seaming machines have been preserved in the canned goods museum, and most of the machines are in working condition.  It is curious that at the entrance there were special devices that recorded the time of arrival and departure of workers. </p><p>  Of course, the oil museum opened in the city, made in the form of a <span>drilling platform,</span> visiting which you can learn all about black gold and its mining. </p><h2>  Stavanger, Norway: University </h2><p>  The city was an educational center at the dawn of its existence: in the Middle Ages a school worked here.  The University of Stavanger, founded in 2005, is the fifth largest university with more than nine thousand students.  The university, which cooperates with the industrial enterprises of Stavanger and other higher educational institutions of the USA and Europe, successfully implements research projects that are funded by the state. </p>

    <h2>  Old town consisting of wooden houses </h2><p>  Revenues from the sale of oil allowed local authorities to restore the Old Town (Gamla Stavanger), which began to be built around the cathedral.  The historical part consists of more than 170 wooden houses with red roofs, and the oldest of them appeared in the middle of the XVIII century. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Stavanger (Norway), the sights of which deserve to be visited, is famous all over the world for its pretty buildings with white painted walls.  This tradition originated in the XVII century, when the production of paints began in the settlement.  White was considered the most expensive of them, since zinc, which was very expensive at that time, was added to it.  In villages, residents were limited to red or green shades, and in the city, wealthy owners did not spare money.  They painted the buildings in white, showing everyone their wealth. </p><h2>  Color street </h2><p>  Among the few streets, one is of interest, on which there are colored buildings that stand out from the rest.  According to the law, the facade cannot be changed in the city, and only 17 years ago a hairdresser opened, the walls of which are painted in pink.  The visiting entrepreneur, who received permission from the authorities, thus attracted the attention of customers.  Gradually cafes and shops began to appear on Tsvetnaya Street, which favorably differed from the usual snow-white houses that adorned several centuries Stavanger, Norway.  Photos of a popular tourist attraction are made by all admiring guests who know for sure that those who have not been here have not seen the city. </p>

    <h2>  St Swithun Cathedral with an interesting history </h2><p>  In the compact center of the oil capital, which can be bypassed in a few hours, the most famous sights are located, making the look of the pearl of Norway unique.  The most interesting historical and religious monument is <span>the cathedral</span> built in the XII century.  A curious story is connected with his appearance: when the Norwegian king decided to divorce his wife, all local confessors refused him, and only one bishop promised to help the monarch, but demanded that he erect a magnificent cathedral in Stavanger, in the very center of the city.  Made of soapstone, it was divided into northern and southern parts.  The builders made one half of the landmark in the Romanesque style, and the other in the Gothic. </p>

    <h2>  Natural monument </h2><p>  The main natural attraction is the Prekestulen rock, which rises 600 meters above the Lysefjord.  It is surprising that it is an absolutely flat square.  Hundreds of thousands of tourists rush to Stavanger (Norway) to enjoy the amazing beauty of the unique object.  Due to the fact that the shores of the 42-kilometer Lysefjord are not populated, a wonderful panorama opens up for guests: these were the landscapes several millennia ago, when a crack filled with glacial water appeared in the earth's crust. </p>

    <p>  Despite the huge popularity of the rock, not every vacationer will be able to climb it.  Prekestulen is not equipped with funiculars, and therefore, before climbing, you must evaluate your strength, since the load on the heart is very large.  From the cliff, nicknamed "the pulpit of a preacher," extreme people make parachute jumps. </p><h2>  In memory of the ancient battle </h2><p>  Not far from the city, a unique monument is installed, which is a Viking sword thrust into the ground.  The monument of swords in Stavanger (Norway), opened at the end of the last century, symbolizes the heroic past of courageous warriors led by Harald the Fair-haired, who won the battle in 872, after which the western lands were united into a single state. </p><p>  The ten-meter composition evokes admiration and awe: giant swords stuck in stone symbolize the glory of the victors in the battle and finally the peace that has come, because no one will be able to pick up weapons.  From the modern monument comes the inexpressible charm of the Middle Ages, shrouded in legends. </p>
