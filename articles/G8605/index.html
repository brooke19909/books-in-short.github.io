  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to sew a bag quickly and economically?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who once tasted the joy of creativity would like to create a unique thing again with their own hands.  Needlework not only makes it possible to be original, but also helps to save significantly. </p><p>  Women do not already think of their existence without a bag.  Large and small, winter and summer, classic and extravagant, bags and handbags, they always catch our eye.  How to sew a bag with your own hands? </p><p>  An optimal and very economical option for a youth bag is old <span>jeans clothes.</span>  Before starting work, jeans, a skirt or a jacket must be washed.  Ripping them, of course, is very dreary, so just cut the seams, leaving decorative seams and trim.  We select the most preserved parts that have a decent appearance.  Having thus prepared the material for work, we proceed to modeling. </p><p>  When I had to decide how to <span>sew a bag of jeans</span> for my daughter, I just took a leather bag and built a paper pattern for its size.  Optionally, you can increase or decrease the capacity of the bag due to the side parts and the bottom of the bag.  I sewed the lining for the bag from an old raincoat. </p><p>  For sewing, I needed additionally: a large zipper for the bag and a small zipper for the pocket (ripped from old jeans), four rings for the bag‚Äôs handles, a smiley applique from fabric (bought in haberdashery).  Before stitching the bag, she made a technological map for herself.  When I thought it over on paper, I sewed the bag very quickly. </p><p>  On one side of the bag, a ‚Äúsmiley‚Äù is looking at us, stitched onto a square of denim fabric with a fringe around its edges.  On the other hand - a decorative pocket with a small zipper from old jeans.  The cost of a denim bag is 250 rubles.  And my girlfriend‚Äôs girlfriends expressed a lot of compliments about our author‚Äôs model. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now I‚Äôm thinking how to sew a bag for the summer.  I really like bags with decorative trim from variegated braid, beads, sequins and more.  Having traveled to the shops, I came up with a new model.  I will buy jacket fabric of an interesting texture.  It will take only 80 cm. The bag will resemble a briefcase, only the handles are long and sewn on the sides.  On the valve of the portfolio I will nastrochivat a suitable color tape, sew the beads.  Is it really difficult?  Not at all.  But I‚Äôll save at least a thousand rubles from the family budget. </p><p>  Still have an idea how to sew a summer bag for the beach.  A wide range of furniture fabrics impresses with texture and colors.  It will take 50 cm to sew a simple flat bag.  Such a beach bag will be quite durable. </p><p>  And the daughter asks to sew a bag a bag.  I chose fabric - raincoat fabric.  I came up with a model, made a pattern.  The bottom of the bag is a circle.  Measured the length of the circle, divided into four parts.  She built a trapezoid on paper: the upper side is ¬º of the length of the circle, she added five centimeters to the base.  This is a wedge.  Its height depends on your desire.  There are four such details.  The pen is measured individually.  We cut out the details with allowances for seams of one and a half centimeters. </p><p>  Draw up a technological map of tailoring. </p><p>  A) Sew the wedges to each other with the seams out.  We cut the seams to 0.7 cm, smooth it on both sides, sew the decorative braid on each seam. </p><p>  B) Sew the bottom to the bag, also seam out.  After we cut the seam, wrap it with braid and stitch the edge. </p><p>  C) We process the upper edge of the bag with <span>decorative braid.</span> </p><p>  D) From the top of the bag to retreat ten centimeters down, mark the horizontal line.  Stitch the braid outside so that it breaks in two opposite places.  Pull the handle of the bag sewn from raincoat fabric through the braid.  Sew the ends of the handle together, hide under the braid.  Pull out the handles on both sides, tighten the bag. </p><p>  E) If desired, you can decorate the wedges of the bag with wooden beads or buttons of different sizes. </p><p>  I think that my daughter will be satisfied.  Try to sew with me? </p>
