Generals of the USSR</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The highest ranks of the military command have always been held in high esteem.  But how long has this title existed for so long?  And who were the people who led the armies and fronts, completing history during one of the most ambitious military conflicts of mankind? </p><p>  Who are the generals of World War II? </p><h2>  Ranks in the Soviet Union </h2><p>  Until 1940 there was no such rank in the air forces of the Soviet Union.  Its analogues were the divisional commanders, commanders, commanders, commissars.  True, in September 1935 the title of Marshal appeared, which was awarded to five people.  But before the war, only two of them remained alive. </p><p>  In May 1940, for the first time, slightly more than a thousand people were presented to the rank of general and admiral.  At the <span>beginning of the war,</span> there were 1,056 people in this rank.  By May 1945, their number reached 5597 people. </p><p>  Among the dead and missing from 1940 to 1945, there are 421 general and admiral. </p><p>  Let‚Äôs take a closer look and name the outstanding military leaders. </p><h2>  Ground Fronts </h2><p>  Even being in the highest ranks, a soldier remains a soldier.  And he is completely immune from death on the battlefield or for the sake of honor.  Although there were others who held a different opinion.  But we will talk about them in the appropriate section. </p><p>  So, not all generals of World War II survived.  I.R.  Apanasenko, M.P.  Kirponos, I.A.  Bogdanov, F.Ya.  Kostenko, M.P.  Petrov, N.F.  Vatutin and I.D.  Chernyakhovsky heroically died under various circumstances.  M.G.  Efremov committed suicide in order not to get the Nazis alive, and D. G. Pavlov was repressed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The remaining generals of World War II, a list of which will take more than one page, survived and contributed significantly to the victory of the Soviet Union in this conflict. </p><p>  We will mention only a few.  THEM.  Baghramyan was twice presented to the title of <span>Hero of the Soviet Union, a</span> participant in many offensive operations. </p>

    <p>  <span>K.E.</span>  <span>Voroshilov</span> was awarded not only two gold stars.  Also named after him is a heavy self-propelled gun mount - "Klim Voroshilov." </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Air Defense Front Commanders </h2><p>  In general, in order to win battles of many thousands, you need to have knowledge and experience in many areas.  For example, to understand professionally in strategy and tactics, to know all the nuances of various troops, their ability to interact.  Indomitable will and speed of decision-making are also needed.  These and other qualities make military commanders who can command armies from the highest officers. </p><p>  The generals of World War II also led the air defense forces.  Among them, the following names can be mentioned: M.S.  Gromadin, P.E.  Gudymenko, <span>D.A.</span>  <span>Zhuravlev</span> and G.S.  Zashikhin. </p><h2>  Soviet traitor generals </h2><p>  But not all <span>USSR generals</span> placed honor and loyalty to the motherland above their own lives and interests.  Among the latter, there are several people. </p><p>  G.N.  Zhilenkov was captured in Germany near the city of Vyazma.  There, he impersonated an ordinary soldier and until 1942 he served in the Wehrmacht as an ordinary driver.  But by chance he was identified by a forester.  After the interrogation and confirmed readiness to cooperate, Georgy Nikolaevich meets with Goebbels and is appointed to assist Vlasov. </p><p>  In 1945, was detained by the Americans.  He told the Soviet counterintelligence about himself, hoping for cooperation, but after the trial he was sentenced to death.  The execution by hanging was committed in Butyrka prison. </p><p>  V.F.  Malyshkin was captured after the Vyazemsky Cauldron.  Immediately expressed a desire to cooperate.  He worked in the propaganda department and since 1943 he became an assistant to Vlasov in this matter. </p><p>  He was also detained by the Americans, transferred to the Soviet authorities and executed in Butyrka prison. </p><p>  B.S.  Richter, F.I.  Trukhin also managed to serve both the Soviet and German sides. </p><p>  Thus, we see that the generals of World War II did not always act heroically.  They were ordinary people with their fears and desires, but also with remarkable talents in the military sphere. </p><h2>  Wehrmacht commanders </h2><p>  What was happening on the other side of the front?  Which German generals of the Second World War were particularly famous in the battles? </p><p>  Among them are also those who died in battles.  These are Gunter von Kluge, Fedor von Bock, Georg von Witzleben, Walter Model, Erwin Rommel and others. </p><p>  Almost all of them were awarded the Iron Cross order, which has been issued since 1939 for three or more successful dangerous operations. </p>

    <h2>  German traitor generals </h2><p>  However, not everything went as smoothly as it might seem.  Among the command of the Wehrmacht there were also people who did not agree with the course of events.  In search of a better fate, they were on the lists of traitors to their homeland. </p><p>  Vincenz Muller, Lieutenant General.  In June 1944, he was abandoned with the 4th Army near Minsk.  Tippelskirch, the official commander of this unit, left him all powers, having escaped with his headquarters. </p><p>  As a result, not receiving support, supplies, provisions, not even having simple intelligence cards, he was forced to stop resistance and surrender to the Soviet troops. </p><p>  As we see, many generals of the Second World War changed their minds after, having received no support, ended up in captivity.  Otto Corfes, for example, was captured near Stalingrad and surrendered in full parade.  Subsequently, he collaborated with the Soviet troops, for which his family in Germany was subjected to severe repression. </p><p>  Bernard Bechler was also captured near Stalingrad.  The main reason why officers began to collaborate with the enemy was that they blamed Hitler‚Äôs foresight. </p><p>  It turns out that the generals of World War II were ready to serve their country and win the battle, but the leadership did not always appreciate their zeal.  Resentment, disappointment and other feelings pushed for cooperation with the enemy. </p><p>  Thus, in the article we figured out a little about who the generals are, and talked about the outstanding military leaders of World War II. </p>
