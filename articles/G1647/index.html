First aid for poisoning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hazardous chemicals include toxic drugs that are used in both agriculture and industry.  When released or spilled, they can pollute the environment and lead to damage or death of plants, animals and people. </p><p>  Such chemicals are found in large volumes, usually at refineries, defense, pulp and paper and chemical industries, as well as non-ferrous and <span>ferrous metallurgy</span> plants <span>.</span>  In addition, they are available at meat and dairy and food production facilities, at trading bases and refrigerators. </p><p>  Chemicals are usually contained in enterprises in such quantities as to ensure uninterrupted three-day work.  They are stored in special warehouses, placed in containers with a high coefficient of strength.  In addition, each group along their perimeter is surrounded by a closed earthen embankment or enclosing wall made of anti-corrosion or non-combustible materials. </p><p>  The most common hazardous chemicals are chlorine, ammonia, and mercury.  In an emergency situation, they go into a gaseous state and form special lesion zones having a different area and concentration.  It will depend on the wind.  Under adverse weather conditions <span>, the affected area</span> can reach several tens of kilometers. </p><p>  We will dwell in more detail on the characteristics of the most dangerous substances. </p><p>  The chemical substance <em>chlorine</em> is a yellow-green gas with a pungent and irritating specific smell.  By its properties, it is two and a half times heavier than air.  It has the ability to accumulate in a low place, flow into tunnels and cellars.  Its vapors irritate the mucous membrane, skin, as well as the eyes and respiratory tract.  Direct contact will cause a burn.  When exposed to the body, it can cause chest pains, dry cough, vomiting, impaired coordination, shortness of breath, <span>pain in the eyes</span> and lacrimation.  If there is a lasting effect, then it is likely to be fatal. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  First aid methods are as follows: </p><ul><li>  remove or remove the victim from this area; </li><li>  remove contaminated shoes and clothing; </li><li>  drinking plenty of water is recommended; </li><li>  rinse face and eyes with water; </li><li>  induce vomiting if a chemical enters; </li><li>  give the opportunity to breathe oxygen; </li><li>  provide peace. </li></ul><p>  <em>Ammonia</em> has the form of a colorless gas with a special smell of ammonia.  It is two times lighter than air, but in combination with it is explosive.  In the presence of a large dosage, it can cause damage to the respiratory tract, the main signs of which are: asphyxiation, increased <span>heart rate,</span> cough and runny nose.  Vapors so irritate the skin and mucous membranes that cause lacrimation, pain in the eyes, itching on the skin, redness and burning.  Quite often burns occur with ulcers and blisters. </p><p>  First aid methods are as follows: </p><ul><li>  put a bandage on the victim, which should be moistened with water, or with a five percent solution of lemon; </li><li>  remove or remove from the infected area, while transporting only lying down; </li><li>  give the opportunity to breathe <span>water vapor</span> (warm) ten percent menthol solution; </li><li>  rinse eyes and mucous membranes for about fifteen minutes with water. </li></ul><p>  <em>Mercury</em> refers to liquid heavy metals.  The substance is very dangerous when it enters the human body.  Vapors are highly toxic and can cause severe injuries. </p><p>  First aid for mercury: </p><ul><li>  quickly leave a dangerous place; </li><li>  change clothes, change shoes, wash in the shower, rinse your mouth. </li></ul><p>  If a source with hazardous chemicals is found, you must immediately leave the room and call a specialist. </p>
