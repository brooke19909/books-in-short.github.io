  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to invest 200,000 rubles to make a profit?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any person can ensure that his money multiplied and worked for him.  For this reason, the question of where to invest to earn money, one day confronts everyone.  A small amount is hardly enough to generate solid income.  But with large investments, the investor discovers many opportunities and attractive prospects.  But first you need to decide where to invest the money in order to receive income from them. </p><h2>  Investment Principles </h2><p>  Any successful investor has principles on the basis of which he acts and achieves outstanding results.  These are the people who ask where <span>to invest at a high percentage of</span> income, and then instantly act, and are people whose income increases daily.  For those who earn an amount that allows them to extend it to the next salary, this seems incredible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Successful success" class="if uuid-3019472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019472.jpg"></div><p>  But you need to pay attention to the fact that even large investors once started from scratch.  They also wondered where to invest 200,000 rubles in order to make a profit.  Not everyone had start-up capital from birth.  But they managed to invest the accumulated money and achieve success, even in times of crisis.  Do not expect the right moment, think for a long time where to invest with a guarantee.  Even large players, often taking risks, sometimes miss, and sometimes win - and this is normal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most important goal for someone who is thinking where <span>to invest at interest</span> is the formation of passive income.  This is a long-term goal, but it is important to strive to close it as quickly as possible. </p><p>  First of all, you need to choose the object in which the investor will invest money, guided by the principle: maximum profit with minimal time costs. </p><p>  It is such characteristics as income and time spent that determine how effective a person is and how high-quality his life is. </p><h2>  Investor Secrets </h2><p>  If you observe successful investors, you will notice that they are all guided by approximately the same set of principles.  These principles work when a person is constantly guided by them in their decisions. </p><p>  First of all, they weigh the benefits and risks.  Thinking about where to invest 200,000 rubles to earn, an experienced investor will compare these two indicators.  Often a successful person will choose a risky enterprise, which if successful will turn out to be a big profit. </p><p>  Usually investors with big start-up capital win.  Projects with a high degree of reliability also have a high entry threshold.  And if someone decides where to invest 200,000 rubles to earn, it's time to think about partnership with the same person.  This will allow you to move to a more interesting market. </p><p>  The next important secret of experienced investors is contributing to several sources.  They always have fallback options, sharing contributions.  If one source goes down, there will always be another. </p><p>  It is important to say no to loans.  Despite the fact that a person may be tempted to ask how to borrow 200,000 rubles and where to invest the money received on credit, you should not give in to him.  The chances of investing successfully with existing loan debt are extremely small. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, you should not expect instant results, instant profit.  Each project has its own payback period.  And a number of long-term investments, even if you invest 200,000 rubles, will still bring income only after a few years. </p><p>  Thus, there is nothing complicated in investing. </p><h2>  Why don't people do that </h2><p>  In the study of this topic, the question arises: why, if everything is simple enough, does the majority of the population remain poor?  Someone in a hurry to argue that the wealthy people are simply deceiving, hiding the main secrets, explaining where you can invest 200,000 rubles, being uninterested in the wealth of those who are advised to do so. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="He is an investor" class="if uuid-3019470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019470.jpg"></div><p>  But you do not need to look for big secrets where they are not.  The reason for poverty is quite simple: most people are afraid of high income.  Many people think that they will encounter difficulties in understanding with people around them if they start earning more and living better.  And many do not perform the simplest steps according to the instructions in order to get rich, because of the banal laziness.  Many will ask the question where you can invest 200,000 rubles, but will not do anything from the recommendations received.  And someone will go and try everything in practice.  Such people as a result will become rich.  It's easier for people to blame the outside world than act. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Where to invest 200,000 rubles </h2><p>  First of all, you need to divide this amount into 3 directions.  Then the amounts will be quite safe, they will reduce the risks.  There are several options for where to invest 200,000 rubles, which will "shoot" even in a crisis. </p><h2>  Deposit account </h2><p>  The first such option is to create a deposit account with a bank.  This is the most popular investment method.  For those who asked where to invest 200,000 rubles, this method is suitable, despite the fact that this will not be a full-fledged investment.  It is rather an auxiliary way to form your airbag for a rainy day.  Deposits up to 1,400,000 rubles are insured, and thanks to this, those who think where to invest 200,000 rubles will receive a certain guarantee of security. </p><p>  However, there are subtleties that must be taken into account.  For example, they relate to the choice of bank.  So, preference should be given to the largest players in the market.  They offer a set of the lowest interest rates.  They are hardly likely to be deprived of their license, leaving investors with nothing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="They agreed" class="if uuid-3019476" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019476.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the method of conducting foreign exchange transactions is popular.  It is important to monitor trends and learn to understand this issue. </p><p>  Among the main advantages of cash deposits to the bank are: guaranteed income, the ability to withdraw money invested at any time, no risk of losing money.  At least they come down to a minimum. </p><p>  But the main disadvantages are the small amount of income, the commission in cases where the account is closed ahead of schedule.  Thus, the greatest profit is where there is a maximum share of risk. </p><h2>  Internet business </h2><p>  Conventional trading has long migrated to the online sphere.  And although there is competition between online stores, almost every one of them finds its customers.  A great idea regarding where to invest 200,000 rubles will be the creation of an online store, website, forum, blog on a popular topic.  A site with high traffic is easy to monetize, receiving large dividends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Online store" class="if uuid-3019474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019474.jpg"></div><p>  A monetary contribution to the project will bring great profit in the future.  But he also has a long payback period - from 6 months.  For the most part, revenue from sites comes from sales and advertising. </p><p>  Favorable information products - training, video, audio-master classes.  They are created once, and then sold in thousands of copies.  At the same time, there is competition that can be easily dealt with by highlighting a product for a particular audience segment. </p><p>  In addition, advertising comes from information resources that are visited by many people every day.  Also practiced selling links, placing banners, contextual block, participation in affiliate programs. </p><h2>  Startups </h2><p>  Interesting enough alternatives are startups.  You can also invest 200,000 rubles in them to earn income.  This is not difficult.  All you need to do is find a site on the World Wide Web on which startup owners upload data on projects.  The most famous at the moment are MyPyo, SearchFunds. </p><p>  Among the main advantages of this approach to solving the problem is receiving dividends, returning investments with interest, and the right to a share in the company.  But it is important to remember that not every project ultimately comes to payback.  Some of them are never realized. </p><p>  The choice among startups is really wide.  There is an opportunity to invest money with someone, but there is also a chance to invest money yourself. </p><p>  In addition, you can take advantage of P2P lending.  The main point here is to invest in a business.  Each project must be pre-checked for purity of credit histories.  Income from the amount of 200,000 rubles sometimes reaches 30% per annum. </p><p>  If you actively invest in startups, you can receive benefits for the acquisition of shares.  But you need to consider that this company is quite risky.  Someone transfers the authority to manage the amount of money to the fund, which will take control of the process.  The investor will only pay commission fees, receiving their interest on profits. </p><p>  To start investing, you need to register in the start-up database.  The most popular of them are Pipeline, Spark, CrunchBase. </p><p>  To minimize risks, you need to look at startups controlled by accelerators.  They promote projects from a business idea to investment.  And they are engaged in the selection of suitable startups quite carefully.  For this reason, they do not have to worry about quality. </p><h2>  Art </h2><p>  Investing in art is also a method of generating passive income, which many are unable to fully appreciate.  The most popular way to invest in art is by painting.  It is known that their prices are rising, and profits from them are growing up to 30%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="This is a picture" class="if uuid-3019473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019473.jpg"></div><p>  Among the advantages of this method of investing are listed legitimacy, reliability, price increase, stability.  Prices for paintings do not depend on the exchange rate, the main role here is given to timing.  The longer the paintings are stored, the more valuable they become.  This is a stable investment that will pay off in the future.  And the amount of 200,000 is fine.  Investments in the art industry are also practiced. </p><p>  You can minimize the risks by acquiring for the most part the picture.  It is important that the paintings belong to famous masters.  Market forecasts in this area are easily tracked through the May-Moisis index. </p><p>  Acquisition of paintings can be carried out at auctions.  There are more than 3,000 of them, at the moment the largest of them are American, the second largest are European.  The most popular auctions are Sotheby's, Bukowskis, Christie's.  An investment of 200,000 rubles is just enough - this amount is the minimum threshold for entering the art industry market.  With such an amount, it seems possible to receive about 20-50% of dividends. </p><h2>  Precious metals </h2><p>  Of these types of investment, gold bullion is considered the most popular investment target.  They are sold by weight, starting from 1 gram.  Metal has a tendency to rise in price over time.  In addition, they invest money in bullion coins - collectible, commemorative.  They are quite liquid, in most cases they are not subject to VAT.  At the same time, the payback period is increased. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Is this gold" class="if uuid-3019471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019471.jpg"></div><p>  A metal score is also practiced.  This method of investing consists in buying precious metals at the lowest price and reselling them at the time of closing the account at an increased cost. </p><p>  The main advantages of such an investment: stability, convenience.  While money, under the influence of inflation, is losing value, this process does not apply to precious metals.  It is also convenient to collect gold, making purchases every month.  Thanks to this, investing 200,000 rubles will be completely safe.  And if prices begin to rise, it will be an excellent source of income.  When you are planning to invest in precious metals, do not forget that often their price does not increase over a sufficiently long time period. </p><h2>  Franchise </h2><p>  While creating your own business is considered a time-consuming process, and the amount of 200,000 rubles is unlikely to be sufficient to open it, buying a franchise gives more guarantees for success with less labor. </p><p>  The acquisition of a franchise imposes certain restrictions on the owner.  Franchisees usually work in tight frameworks.  There are a lot of franchise offers with an investment of 200,000 rubles in the market.  Usually they are associated with online stores, bookmakers, beauty industry. </p><p>  Among the advantages of this method of investment, they usually list the readiness of an already debugged business model, low entry thresholds, and quick payback periods. </p><p>  In addition, it must be borne in mind that not all relations between the franchisee and the franchisor are documented.  And for this reason, all kinds of pseudo-franchising firms use this, setting huge fines for the fact that the conditions are not met.  For this reason, it is important to ensure that the franchise owner includes in the agreement all points that may interest the franchisee.  Keep in mind that renting space for a franchise business is more difficult.  It will be necessary to take into account the requirements of the franchisor to the premises. </p><h2>  Securities </h2><p>  In addition, investments in shares of companies are popular.  This method seems quite simple.  However, the securities market by its nature is not stable.  And even minor changes in the enterprise can fundamentally change the situation with stocks, the value of them sometimes drops instantly and unpredictably.  But it can fly up just as abruptly, and it is far from always possible to predict this.  For this reason, novice investors most often entrust management of this area to professionals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Securities" class="if uuid-3019475" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101487/3019475.jpg"></div><p>  Reduces the risk of investing in shares of state-owned enterprises.  It is important to know how securities are provided.  This may affect the ultimate risk that the investor will have to face. </p><p>  If you have 200,000 rubles available, check out all the options presented in the article and choose the one that you like best.  And if you carefully read the article, then you will choose not one, but three options. </p>
