    <h2>  From the history of accessory </h2><p>  A regular <span>scarf</span> knitted in a circle or sewn at the end of knitting, snud is called differently in different countries of the world: an infinity scarf, a circular scarf, etc. Names completely determine its appearance.  This allows you to experiment with wearing such a scarf, creating different images and using only one model. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a modern snud is not new.  In the mid-eighties of the last century at the peak of fashion was the so-called pipe, which was worn both on the head and on the neck.  Actually, the classic snud model is completely borrowed from this accessory, the main criteria of which were simplicity in performance, convenience and versatility.  The world's leading designers continue to exploit this trend, offering the accessory in various collections and giving advice on its operation.  The versatility of this piece of clothing allows you to wear it, regardless of the time of year.  Following design tips, you can knit such a scarf yourself, using various knitting patterns for a snout. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Choose material and color </h2><p>  Classic snood is a well-draped, wide circular scarf.  It can be made of any material - wool, silk, various mixed fabrics.  Knitted, knitted, snoods - a separate niche in a huge family of circular scarves.  The choice of yarn to fulfill any planned model is huge today.  Snood can be knitted from wool, boucle, cashmere and its derivatives, and even from fur ribbon.  The choice of yarn also determines the patterns for the snouts.  Patterns of knitting patterns made of <span>thick yarn are</span> significantly different from graphic images of patterns for thin threads. </p><p>  When choosing a color for warm knitwear, one should adhere to moderation in tones: knitted products of restrained natural shades always look more noble, not distracting attention from the main ensemble of clothes, but softening or emphasizing the created image.  Light, gray-steel, beige and brown-green tones are suitable for a classic outfit.  Juicy burgundy and black colors will add extravagance to the silhouette.  <span>Patterns for a scarf-knit knitting needles</span> are also selected <span>according</span> to the color and texture of the yarn from which the model is planned to be made.  In addition, it is necessary to choose the right size of the knitting needles. </p><h2>  Knitting needles: simple patterns </h2><p>  An important quality of knitted snacks is the ability to drape well.  Knitted from a very thick thread, it loses the ability to soft drape, but looks great due to the texture of the yarn.  Knitting patterns for knitting needles from thick loose yarn are the simplest and fastest to do.  For example, scarves knitted with a garter stitch look flawless.  They are warm, spectacular, calm.  This demonstrates the presented photo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="snood knitting scheme" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/700957.jpg" width="340"></div>

All rows of fabric are knitted with facial loops.  To obtain a plastic edge, edge loops are performed: the first loop of the row is always removed, and the last is sewn on the wrong side. </p><h2>  Elastics in knitting snoods </h2><p>  No less spectacular are the snacks made with various types of gum or a combination of gum with a face or garter stitch.  In the presented photo - relief strips made by English rubber are interspersed with inserts from the front surface.  This pattern is simple and effective: on the one hand, English knitting lies on the front field, and on the other, on the wrong side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting needles" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/700964.jpg" width="487"></div>

Schemes of the <span>English gum</span> : </p><p>  1st row: alternately knit 1 person.  and 1 out. </p><p>  2-nd: the front ones are knitted according to the drawing, before the wrong side they make a yarn, with which it, without knitting, is thrown onto the right knitting needle. </p><p>  3rd: all the facial ones are performed together with the crochets with one facial loop, and the wrong ones are performed in the same way as in the 2nd row: they are cast over the yarn and removed with a loop. </p><p>  From the 3rd row, the pattern is repeated. </p><p>  You can associate a snood with a completely English viscous, without alternating with all kinds of inserts of a different texture. </p><h2>  Double-sided knitting patterns for a snout </h2>

For such a wardrobe detail as snood, this is very important.  It twists and shows the same pattern on both sides, which looks very profitable, despite the fact that the products use the simplest patterns for a knitting needles.  Schemes for them are not needed, drawings are easily performed according to the description.  Such a pattern looks identical on both sides: a large braid of 16 loops connected by alternating front and back stripes (like a 2x2 elastic band) on a garter weave.  The braid is knitted 16 rows, in the 17th weaves: 8 loops are dropped on an additional knitting needle in front of the canvas, 8 loops of the second part of the braid are knitted, and then loops from an additional knitting needle.  The braid pattern is necessarily maintained during interweaving, which creates a two-sided canvas effect.

    <h2>  Large braids and aran </h2><p>  Drawings with interweaving from large braids or harnesses are one-sided, but no less spectacular.  They are often used in knitting scarves and snoods.  Usually weaves are performed on the wrong side, outplaying the relief of the braids made with front loops.  When choosing large braids, you need to focus on the thickness of the thread that is used in the work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting patterns for snud" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/700967.jpg" width="236"></div>  There is a rule: the thicker the yarn, the more loops and rows can be involved in the execution of the bundle, and, conversely, a thin thread involves elegant small transitions, ennoble and increase the cost of the finished product.  The photo shows various models of scarves and snoods made of thick loose yarn, as well as threads of medium density and thickness.  Each sample in its own way is good in different situations.  Arana and braids - traditional patterns for a knitting snout.  The schemes of such drawings are quite complex, when performing work, it is necessary to strictly adhere to the established procedure for knitting loops. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

    <p>  A certain effect is provided by the alternation of large tows with thin openwork stripes or made of various pearl patterns.  There are many options here, but choosing any one, you should not heap a large number of weaves - the work will be more difficult, the fabric is coarser, and the softness of the lines should attract in the finished product. </p><h2>  Fantasy patterns for making a scarf </h2><p>  Another large block consists of knitting patterns for a snout, patterns of which combine embossed braids and lace inserts.  These patterns are not as complex as they sometimes seem, but the execution will require careful knitting of each row. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="double-sided knitting patterns for snood" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/701002.jpg" width="390"></div>  In the photo, showing similar combinations of patterns, medium-sized pigtails and openwork stripes alternating with each other are connected.  Another rule of knitting scarves is that you don‚Äôt have to pull the fabric too tight, the loops should ‚Äúwalk‚Äù on the knitting needles quite freely.  It is the correct density that largely "makes the face" of the product, emphasizing its individuality.  Given our recommendations, it is not difficult to do snood knitting.  Patterns of knitting patterns are given the simplest, but very interesting in the finished fabric. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting scarf patterns" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/700998.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  How and what to wear snood </h2><p>  The versatility of the accessory suggests a huge range of uses in a modern wardrobe.
