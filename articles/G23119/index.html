There is also its own landscaped <span>green</span> recreation area.  <span>This is</span> Perovsky <span>Park</span> - a place where all locals regularly come for a walk and sometimes Muscovites come from other areas.  What is interesting about this recreation area, what kind of entertainment does it offer to vacationers, and what can you do here today? </p><h2>  Hunting grounds, luxurious estate, city park ... </h2>

According to many historians, royal hunting grounds were located here.  This fact is also indicated by the emblem of the district - a golden hunting horn and a silver feather.  Local lands and the estate constantly passed from hand to hand.  Once the estate was owned by Count P. A. Golitsyn, who built the church of the Icon of the Mother of God ‚ÄúThe Sign‚Äù (1708), which has survived to the present day.  Later, the estate passed into the ownership of J. V. Bruce, a man about whom there were many legends and gossip.  Then the estate was bought by Elizabeth Petrovna and granted to A. G. Razumovsky.  After the death of the favorite of the Empress, the land again lost its owner, and later, during the revolution, the Perovsky park was officially opened here.  Today, only memories remained from the once magnificent manor, but meanwhile the recreation area boasts mighty trees, and some of them have already celebrated their centenary.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Moscow" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1159199.jpg"></div>  Today, the recreation area is quite landscaped and is one of the favorite places for walks of residents of all the surrounding areas.  The historical layout of the park, the author of which is the architect Gilardi, has been preserved.  One of the most significant modern facilities located here is the Lokomotiv Sports Stadium.  There is also a pond in the park, a large skateboard Ferma, children's and sports towns.  The attraction zone deserves special attention: there are among them simple ones designed for the little ones (trains and swings), but adult adrenaline lovers will not be bored, because they are waiting for a roller coaster and other "serious" carousels.  Perovsky Park will please you with a small but incredibly interesting zoo, summer stage and cinema, as well as opportunities for practicing a wide variety of outdoor sports.
