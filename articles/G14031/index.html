    <p>  There are many periods in the history of school education in Western Europe and the USA that are interesting for modern Russian education. </p><p>  Education systems in Western Europe and the United States developed under the influence of powerful discoveries in the natural sciences at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, including in the psychology of a child.  At this time, reformatory pedagogy began, many of whose ideas are relevant and in demand today. </p><p>  The Italian doctor Maria Montessori proposed the formula "based on the child."  The Swedish writer E. Kay substantiated the method of natural consequences - the creation of exercises for the development of the child‚Äôs natural forces.  American educator John Dewey became the founder of the project methodology and pedagogy, focused on practical life skills. </p><p>  During this period, new models of the school were actively developed: the "School of Action" by August Wilhelm Lai in Germany, the "School of Life Through Life" by O. Dekroli in France.  International pedagogical organizations and movements sprang up, proclaiming free, nature-friendly education and training.  In the first place - the cognitive interests of students, taking into account individuality, stimulating activity. </p><p>  The traditional class-lesson system was criticized because of the strict regulation of the learning process and restrictions on the actions of the child. </p><p>  "Reformed" pedagogy gave impetus to the revision of traditional education systems in Europe and the USA.  In the 40-60s of the XX century, significant school reforms of the education system began.  The transformation was based on the desire to educate proactive, independent, creative people who are able to work at the level of advanced technologies.  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãreform is the creation of a multivariate general education. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Reform of the American education system in 1961 put forward the principles of the obligatory "Five Bases": English and literature, mathematics, natural sciences, <span>social sciences,</span> computer technology.  The remaining subjects are elective courses, of which there were about a thousand. </p><p>  The education system in Germany also took the form of ‚Äúbasic subjects plus elective courses‚Äù, and also introduced new profile areas - technical, agricultural, technical and technological, music, and utilities. </p><p>  In England, such transformations affected public schools.  The education system looked something like this: 50% of the study time was devoted to English and literature, mathematics, religion, physical education;  50% - packages of compulsory subjects of choice - humanitarian, natural sciences, mathematics. </p><p>  The <span>education</span> system <span>in the United States has been</span> reformed in the direction of <span>working with gifted children</span> at the level of state programs.  There were "super gardens" for gifted children up to five years old.  <span>Talented children</span> were selected in schools (the main criterion is the ability to think outside the box) and were tested.  About 35 thousand gifted students received benefits for admission to the best universities in the country.  To prepare future schoolchildren, the government programs ‚ÄúStart‚Äù and ‚ÄúSesame‚Äù were created, within the framework of which pre-school classes for children were organized, and 130 educational TV programs for preschoolers appeared. </p><p>  In the 60-80s of the XX century, experimental schools had a great influence on foreign education systems, which tested new <span>teaching methods.</span> </p><p>  ‚ÄúOpen School‚Äù was a full-time educational institution: in the first half - lessons, in the second half - group classes (theater, tours, drawing, walking). </p><p>  The ‚Äúschool without walls‚Äù helped to reduce the classroom density and increase interest in the educational process without additional costs.  The study of basic disciplines was carried out at school, and elective courses were conducted at industrial enterprises, in offices, etc. </p><p>  The "alternative school" in the USA served as a contrast to the classroom lesson system - each student has an individual curriculum;  classes in research centers, libraries, museums;  involvement of parents in the learning process. </p><p>  There is no doubt that educational systems abroad developed in a humanistic direction, focused on the <span>personal development of</span> children, and also widely introduced <span>specialized training</span> and specialization. </p>
