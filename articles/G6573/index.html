For some people, you need to quickly and accurately capture the best moments of life, and for others, the camera is the main tool in the profession of a photographer and provides them with income. </p><p>  Most models are made for the average user, so understanding them is not difficult.  But professional cameras require specialized knowledge. <noindex>  <span>Here</span> </noindex>  consider the main features of the choice of cameras. </p><p>  An inexpensive model, with enough features and good shooting quality, can be bought for up to $ 100.  Most of them have 5 - 16 megapixels, and digital or optical zoom, which provides good shooting.  The LCD display allows you to view images and is located on the back of the camera or a retractable bar.  Many inexpensive models allow you to record video in HD quality.  For non-professionals, the auto focus function will be useful. </p><p>  The leader in terms of price and quality among budget models can be called Samsung.  Many Samsung models are equipped with Smart technology, which allows you to directly send pictures to social networks or e-mail directly from the camera.  Fairly inexpensive models allow you to edit photos directly on the device.  The face recognition function will be useful, the camera itself will configure the necessary photo settings.  When buying an inexpensive model, it is important to ask about its compatibility with a tablet or laptop, so that transferring data to these devices is easy. </p><p>  Advanced models have a large number of megapixels, there can be from 12 to 20. Well-established brands such as Nikon, Sony, Canon, Panasonic have worked well for a long time.  They are used by most professional photographers who use the camera for commercial photography.  To do this, you need to know the basic nuances of choosing professionals, although everyone can prefer something of their own.  First of all, the presence of a large matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãappreciated, it allows you to shoot a natural and sharp picture.  The quality of a full-fledged video or report will depend on optics and zoom.  Powerful zoom helps bring the subject closer to the desired distance.  Professional models have the ability to do serial shooting, that is, for personnel, continuous, with a timer, self-timer, and bracketing.  Focusing in such models can be done either manually or automatically multipoint or frame by frame. </p><p>  Professionals hold the camera in their hands very often because of the kind of activity, therefore a high-quality and convenient case is important.  Among its advantages when choosing can be called dust and moisture resistance of the case.  Those who are shooting underwater or in other extreme conditions need to buy models with a protected case. </p></div></article>
