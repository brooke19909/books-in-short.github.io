    <h2>  Types of Volcanoes </h2><p>  There is a division of these formations into extinct, dormant or active.  The first - destroyed, blurry, not showing any activity.  Volcanoes are called asleep; volcanoes are not known about eruptions; however, their shape is preserved, and tremors occur in their womb.  Acting - those that are either erupted in the present, or their activity is known from history, or there is no information, however, the volcano emits gases and water. </p><p>  Depending on which type of channel eruptions occur, they can be fractured or central. </p><h2>  Eruptions </h2><p>  Eruptions are long and short-lived.  Long ones include those that occur over several years, and sometimes even centuries.  Short-term - those that last only a few hours.  Large <span>eruptions of volcanoes,</span> familiar to us from history, are most often short-lived, but extremely powerful in destructive force. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The harbinger is a concussion inside the volcano, unusual sounds, ejected volcanic rock.  At the beginning of the process, it is cold, then replaced by red-hot debris and lava.  On average, gases and various debris rise to a height of 5 kilometers.  Much stronger explosions are also known: for example, Bezymyanny threw pieces of rock to a height of about 45 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Emissions </h2><p>  Volcanic emissions are found at various distances from the source - up to tens of thousands of kilometers.  Depending on the strength of the explosion and the amount of accumulated substances, the volume of debris can reach tens of cubic kilometers.  Sometimes there is so much volcanic ash that even in the daytime, impenetrable darkness sets in. </p><p>  Before the appearance of lava, but after a powerful explosion, sometimes an incredibly powerful wall of ash, gas and stones occurs.  This is a pyroclastic flow.  Its internal temperature ranges from 100 to 800 degrees.  The speed can be either 100 km / h or 700. </p><p>  According to recent researchers, during the eruption of Vesuvius, it was the pyroclastic flow that caused the death of most of the population.  Previously, it was believed that the inhabitants of Pompeii died of asphyxiation, however, X-ray data from the found remains paint a different picture.  So, scientists are sure that the lives of the inhabitants of Herculaneum and Stabius were taken away by a pyroclastic flow, the temperature of which was approaching 800 degrees.  Both towns were swept off the face of the earth within a minute, their inhabitants died instantly.  Only the fourth pyroclastic flow reached Pompeii, the temperature of which was ‚Äúonly‚Äù about 200 degrees.  This confidence is based on the condition of the remains: the inhabitants of the villages burned to the skeletons, the bodies of the Pompeii were almost intact before they were covered with ash and flooded with lava. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The pyroclastic flow of the volcano is able to move not only on land, it easily overcomes water barriers.  The heavy substances in its mass settle in the liquid, but the gas moves forward with accelerated force, although it loses power and cools.  Passing the water, the pyroclastic flow is able to rise above sea level. </p><h2>  Eruptions of our time </h2><p>  Over the past hundred years, several major earthquakes have occurred that have caused changes in weather conditions around the globe.  Even the last few decades have brought some more than unpleasant surprises.  Thousands, tens of thousands of people die from eruptions, cities are destroyed, hectares of fertile land are unsuitable. </p>

    <p>  Moreover, after particularly powerful eruptions, the weather on all continents can change.  Particles of volcanic ash remain in the atmosphere, reflecting sunlight.  The last time the temperature during the year after the eruption was below normal by 3 degrees on the entire planet. </p><p>  The most powerful eruption of the 20th century occurred in 1911 in the Philippines.  Almost one and a half thousand people died, volcanic rock fell asleep more than 2 thousand square kilometers of land.  Currently, this volcano is considered one of the most dangerous. </p><h2>  Catastrophe </h2><p>  Most scholars are inclined to believe that in the near future something much more terrible awaits us.  For many years, experts have been studying Yellowstone.  They are not interested in the park, which is interesting for tourists to visit, but in the volcano, which occupies almost its entire area.  Its diameter is almost 70 kilometers, which is simply unbelievable for such formations.  In addition, the source of magma is not located 100 km from the surface, but only 8-16 km. </p><p>  According to scientists, the Yellowstone explosion will destroy not only America, but also a large, if not all, part of the living on the planet.  Pyroclastic flows will demolish everything at a distance of more than a hundred kilometers from the source, cover most of the United States with ashes, Canada will suffer greatly during the eruption. </p><p>  Powerful earthquakes will cause huge tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean.  These giant waves can even reach the central parts of the continents.  Megatons of substances entering the atmosphere will not allow the sun's rays to reach the surface of the planet, causing a cold snap and nuclear winter.  According to various forecasts, it will last from 3 to 5 years.  During this time, most of the plants, animals and people will have time to die. </p>

    <p>  It is believed that only in the first months of life a third of the world's population will lose.  Moreover, there is a high probability of deaths from a lack of water, since it will be infected with toxic sediments.  After the end of winter, survivors will be exposed to an incredible greenhouse effect. </p><p>  The time frame of this cataclysm is not precisely indicated.  Despite the fact that scientists cannot agree on the dates in which this will happen, naming the time intervals from 10 to 75 years (the reference point is the present), they are all sure that such a powerful eruption will happen.  The main question remains: when exactly ... </p>
