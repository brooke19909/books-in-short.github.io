Then the walls of the product are formed, which in the future can be finished with any material and in any way.  Decorative baskets are created in the same way as lace napkins.  Additionally, the canvas just needs to be starched. </p><h2>  The easiest knitted basket for decor </h2><p>  Decorative baskets are most often used to store small things.  For their manufacture, it is worth using knitted yarn.  This material is easy to maintain and easy to work with.  It holds well and is elastic at the same time. </p><p>  To learn how to crochet a basket, you need to use the following scheme: </p><ul><li>  Create an amigurumi ring that will count 8 single crochet columns. </li><li>  The second row involves an increase in the number of loops in 2 times.  Therefore, you need to make an addition to each loop, knitting 2 single crochet in 1 previous loop. </li><li>  In the third row, you need to make additions through 1 column, in the fourth after 2 loops.  In each subsequent row make an increase between additions by 1 loop.  Make additions until you get a circle with the required diameter. </li><li>  Next is to knit the wall.  The first row is knitted so that when creating a column, only the front thread of the loop is knitted. </li><li>  The remaining rows fit without adding or decreasing.  Each loop is made to standard.  Knit until the sides of the required height are obtained.  The walls can be knitted with double crochet. <div class="photo" data-original="petelawrieblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making an oval basket" class="if uuid-3130373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3130373.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The simplest basket can have a square or oval shape.  The main thing is to find a suitable knitting pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Crocheted openwork basket </h2><p>  Crocheting interior baskets is quite simple.  You can start work in the same way as the most ordinary basket.  This will make it possible to form a strong base that will hold its shape well.  A simpler manufacturing option involves knitting a lace napkin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2xlme.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative basket" class="if uuid-3130351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3130351.jpg"></div><p>  To give the product rigidity to maintain shape, you need to starch a napkin.  Next, put the moistened product in water with starch on a bowl, allow to dry.  This will result in a decorative basket, which after washing can change its shape in accordance with the wishes of the needlewoman. </p><h2>  Decorating knitted basket </h2><p>  Before crocheting a basket, it is worth considering further decoration.  To do this, you can use a lot of different tools and materials: </p><ol><li>  Glue gun. </li><li>  Needle and thread. </li><li>  Stapler. </li><li>  Super glue. </li></ol><p>  Crocheted baskets do not always have an attractive look or require additional decoration.  To decorate a knitted basket, you can use ribbons with which you can easily make embroidery.  Lace and guipure will help make the basket more romantic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crochetkingdom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorating knitted basket" class="if uuid-3130371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3130371.jpg"></div><p>  You can tie some elements from the threads, then sew them to the base of the basket.  Additionally, sequins, beads, beads, buttons, stripes can be used.  Entire applications from different types of materials can be created on the body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  DIY shopping bag for functional use </h2><p>  To make the basket more functional, it is worth considering how to make it look like a bag.  To do this, you need to find a diagram of how to <span>crochet a bag-basket,</span> which will have handles to improve functionality.  It is worth preparing knitted or cotton yarn with a thickness of at least 1 cm, it is also important to choose a suitable hook. </p><p>  How to crochet a basket with handles: </p><ol><li>  Dial a chain of 15 air loops.  Having left 1 loop from the edge, knit a single crochet in the second from the edge.  Knit in single crochet without indentation to the end of the chain. </li><li>  In the last loop of the chain you need to knit 6 SC, forming a turn.  We continue to knit on the second side of the chain with crochets.  At the end of the chain, knit 5 stitches in the last loop. </li><li>  The second row is also tied in a circle.  In each loop of rotation, knit 2 crochet columns.  Knit the third row, like the previous ones, but in the loop of rotation do the addition after 1 column. </li><li>  In all the following rows, the addition in the rotation loops should be done after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 columns, respectively.  Having formed the bottom, proceed to knitting the walls of the bag-basket. </li><li>  Knit the walls without additions.  Knit the first row of the transition from the bottom to the wall so that only the back thread of the loop is captured.  Then knit usually. </li><li>  When the walls are ready, you need to make handles.  First, calculate the resulting columns from knitting.  Decide on the diameter of the handles by counting a certain number of columns.  For example, to form a pen, you need 20 columns.  Mark 20 columns on opposite sides of the basket. </li><li>  Knit a row in the same way as the sides of the basket.  Over the marked 20 columns, knit a chain of 20 air loops.  To make strong handles, you need to knit about 5-10 rows. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted shopping bag" class="if uuid-3130356" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3130356.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to finish the job and start decorating. </p>
