Company valuation for different types of investors</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the modern world, many different sources and methods of generating income are available to people.  Someone prefers to choose the traditional path, taking a hired job.  And there are those who find alternatives for themselves.  For example, investing.  This method allows you to receive passive income.  However, for many, it still seems complicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="financniodbornici.sk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Federal Law on Foreign Investment" class="if uuid-3047573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047573.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the point? </h2><p>  Investing involves investing in any developing project, purchasing securities, and so on.  An investor can be both an individual and a legal entity, whose ultimate goal is profit. </p><p>  However, it is important to understand that financial investments never guarantee one hundred percent profit.  In fact, all types of investors are at a certain risk by engaging in similar activities.  However, it has nothing to do with playing the lottery when the result is unpredictable. </p><p>  Before investing their own funds in any asset, investors carefully study it and establish the probability of making a profit.  If the risk is too great, you can refuse the transaction.  This approach is meticulous and minimizes the likelihood of financial loss. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Who is an investor</span> and what does he do? </h2><p>  If you believe the generally accepted wording, the above term refers to an individual or legal entity that invests its own funds in various projects for further profit or intangible benefits. </p><p>  With a profit, everything is clear.  This is a certain amount of money.  With the intangible benefits of investing, things are a little more complicated.  This can be the achievement of certain strategic objectives, increasing one's own authority, etc. </p><p>  In accordance with the legislation in force in the Russian Federation, the following entities may become investors. </p><ol><li>  Broker. </li><li>  Dealer. </li><li>  Pension Fund. </li><li>  Credit or insurance company. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.berliner-zeitung.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="All-Russian Public Association of Private Investors" class="if uuid-3047574" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047574.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  It is important to understand that all types of investors are working for the future.  They cannot be 100% sure of the profitability of the project, acting exclusively, as they say, at their own peril and risk.  That is why it is important to be well versed in the investment activities in order to reduce the likelihood of potential risks. </p><p>  Situations in which investors lose their own investments are not excluded.  It is better to be mentally prepared for such a turn of events, not to despair and take the current situation as an experience that allows you to draw some valuable conclusions and avoid mistakes in the future. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Investing is an activity in the implementation of which you have to constantly learn and learn new features.  Those who do not have to pay for mistakes with their own money. </p><h2>  How to start? </h2><p>  The start of <span>investment activity</span> requires not only the availability of a certain amount of financial resources, but also a reasonable approach.  First of all, you need to think through a strategy in detail and evaluate your own strengths. </p><p>  Some investors prefer low risk, combined with a similar profit.  Others, on the contrary, are prepared for maximum risk in pursuit of colossal profits. </p><p>  All types of investors should understand that such activities do not bring fabulous profits in the first months.  In some cases, it takes years or even decades to build equity. </p><p>  Investing is a lengthy process, during which the growth of invested funds is quite slow.  Especially at first. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dgbrechtsschutz.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who is the investor and what does he do" class="if uuid-3047576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047576.jpg"></div><h2>  Investment Risks </h2><p>  So, as mentioned above, investing your own funds in any project or securities carries not only the possibility of profit in the future, but also a whole set of potential risks.  The main one is making profit below the planned level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, there are several other potentially dangerous factors for investors. </p><ol><li>  The change in the value of the assets of the company in which the funds are invested depends on the global economic situation.  There is always the possibility of its decrease. </li><li>  Changes in the exchange rate also have an impact on investment activities. </li><li>  If the company in which the funds are invested goes bankrupt, the investor has the risk of completely losing his own investments. </li></ol><p>  However, even despite the presence of all kinds of risks, for some players, such activity is very successful and allows you to extract substantial profit. </p><h2>  Types of Investors </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.blogmojo.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="enterprise valuation for different types of investors" class="if uuid-3047578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047578.jpg"></div><p>  There is a certain classification on the stock market dividing all the players present on it into several categories depending on the goals and methods of carrying out their own activities.  Let's talk about the main ones. </p><ol><li>  Private  These include both beginners and experienced players in the stock market, who act according to the general rules and use personal funds to carry out their own activities. </li><li>  Institutional.  Such terms are called investors who act as certain regulators.  Their activity is reduced to the implementation of accumulations and subsequent transfers from private as well as state investors.  In fact, such players manage other people's assets.  They are hired by large companies.  For example, carrying out their own activities in the field of insurance. </li><li>  Foreign  As the name implies, such players are engaged in similar activities in foreign countries. </li></ol><p>  So, let's discuss in more detail the classification of issuers and investors. </p><h2>  Private </h2><p>  Representatives of this category in the stock market include individuals or, in simple words, the most ordinary citizens.  Interestingly, they may not even have a financial education. </p><p>  Most private investors in Russia are active businessmen or co-owners of enterprises.  As a rule, they prefer to invest in real estate, not very large projects and various banking products. </p><p>  The income that private investors receive from their own financial activities is usually called passive.  With a competent infusion of funds, you can have a stable source of income.  However, as a rule, for many, investing is not the main, but additional activity. </p><p>  Often, potential investors make a big mistake, believing that to enter the stock market you need to have huge financial investments.  However, this is not at all true.  It is important not the amount of available funds available, but the ability to calculate risks and manage them correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wn.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="foreign investor foreign investment" class="if uuid-3047581" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047581.jpg"></div><p>  The easiest option available to most Russian citizens is to open a deposit at the bank.  This method has low profitability, but brings a guaranteed income. </p><p>  There is an all-Russian public association of private investors, which unites those involved in similar activities. </p><h2>  Institutional </h2><p>  Real estate, as well as securities and metals, are usually considered as profitable projects.  These are quite large players who make up a substantial part of the stock market. </p><p>  Institutional investors include legal entities that receive the right to manage other people's capital.  These are various insurance and pension funds, as well as other large corporations.  I must say that they are usually distinguished by the presence of professionalism and experience in conducting such activities. </p><p>  It is worth noting that institutional investors have some limitations regarding the conduct of their activities.  For example, if we talk about banking institutions, these will be the following items listed below: </p><ol><li>  You can not buy back more than 10% of the number of shares owned by the company. </li><li>  The list of assets owned by the bank should include no more than 5% of the shares. </li></ol><p>  These are rather tough conditions that banking institutions try to circumvent legally.  For this purpose, for example, subsidiaries are created.  This allows you to trade in the stock market, as well as invest your own funds, without the above restrictions. </p><h2>  Foreign </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="classification of issuers and investors" class="if uuid-3047579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047579.jpg"></div><p>  This category includes individuals and legal entities located abroad, as well as entire foreign states. </p><p>  How is investing in Russia possible? </p><ol><li>  Equity participation in enterprises with state citizens. </li><li>  Opening of new enterprises. </li><li>  Acquisition of real estate and securities. </li><li>  Registration of rights to use natural resources, including land. </li></ol><p>  The activities of the above-mentioned stock market entities in Russia are regulated by the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Foreign Investments‚Äù. </p><p>  It is worth noting that financial injections from abroad affect not only the stock market, but also the national economy as a whole.  They allow you to expand current economic processes, become an incentive for new financial injections, eliminate unemployment and have a better effect on increasing household incomes. </p><p>  That is why the attraction of foreign investors and foreign investment should be welcomed by the state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kleinezeitung.at" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="institutional investors include" class="if uuid-3047583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3047583.jpg"></div><h2>  Assessment Features </h2><p>  Any project requires careful consideration at the stage when a decision is made on the implementation of further financial investments. </p><p>  Company valuation for different types of investors has some features.  For example, private players, managing their own funds, can afford a high level of risk in the pursuit of maximum profit.  Institutional investors manage foreign capital, so they try to choose the most reliable tools to increase the funds entrusted to them. </p><p>  However, there are some general indicators of investment activity that all types of investors pay attention to.  For example, indicators of economic efficiency.  This is the basic information that allows you to decide on the feasibility of investments.  In addition, for some stock market participants, compliance with the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Foreign Investments‚Äù is necessary. </p>
