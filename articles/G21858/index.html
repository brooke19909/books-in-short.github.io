Tourists love him very much for the silence and proximity to the Black Sea.  The microdistrict is located next to the Psezuapse river.  Only 42 km separates it directly from Sochi and 135 km from the city of Krasnodar.  However, the focus of our attention today is not even the village itself, but the guest house "Nadezhda" (Lazarevskoye).  It is to him that our article will be devoted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guest house nadezhda lazarevskoye" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1564155.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The snow-white three-story building invites tourists to visit one of the available rooms.

The cost of these rooms is 1700 per room per day. </p><p>  Tourists are allowed to take children of any age with them.  All children under 12 years are charged 400 rubles per night for extra beds.

    <h2>  Opinion of tourists </h2><p>  It would be logical to assume that you are not the first to visit the guest house "Nadezhda" (Lazarevskoye).  The reviews will help you make a complete impression and decide if the conditions are right for you.  Having studied them, we came to the conclusion that you can go here without any doubt.  The rooms are very clean, quiet in the evenings, the grounds are ennobled, there are flowers and green spaces all around.  In the yard there is a small pool. </p><p>  The rooms have a good shower and toilet, no interruptions in the supply of hot and cold water.  Air conditioning works fine, which saves from unbearable heat.  A small fridge in the room allows you to keep a stock of drinks on hand, and a spacious balcony is the perfect place to have tea in the evening.  The hostess of the hotel is a very pleasant woman who always goes towards her guests. </p><p>  There are some minor disadvantages to consider.  There is no parking for cars, only one will be located on the territory.  The house itself is located on a hill, if children and elderly people are traveling with you, for them going to the beach and back can be difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="guest house nadezhda lazarevskoye reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1564154.jpg" width="451"></div>

    <h2>  Rest on Turquoise street </h2><p>  Continuing to consider the rest in Lazarevsky, we found that there is another hotel of the same name, which is also popular with tourists.  That is why we decided to tell the guests about him, so that there was plenty to choose from if you decided to visit Lazarevskoye.  Turquoise, 4, guest house "Nadezhda", it is about him that we will discuss later.  This is a private and quite small hotel, where standard and economy class rooms are prepared for you. </p><h2>  Description of rooms </h2><p>  At first glance, this guest house looks rather modest, but the rooms have everything you need to relax, neat repairs and modest but solid furniture.  Therefore, if you are interested in a roof over your head and a clean bed, then welcome to Lazarevskoye (4 Biryuzovaya St.).  Guest House "Nadezhda" offers you rooms with all amenities.  It has a fridge and TV, air conditioning and a toilet with shower.  Economy rooms have a fan to save you from the heat.  In the courtyard is a spacious kitchen.  If you are a fan of homemade food, then you will like it.  And if not, you can go to dinner in a cafe, which are many here. </p><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  For one person you have to pay from 400 rubles per day.  In May, a two-room suite can be rented for 800 rubles per day, in June the price will rise to 1000. July-August is the peak of the season, 1800-2000 rubles will have to be paid per day at this time.  In September, the price starts to fall, and the velvet season will meet you with a pleasant discount of up to 1300 rubles per room per night.  For a three-room suite in May you will have to pay 1,000, and in July-August the cost will increase to 2,500. A quadruple room will cost about 200 rubles more. </p><p>  Tourists note that for Sochi this is a very good price.  The conditions for relaxation are excellent: cleanliness, silence and proximity to the center.  The sea, beach and promenade are only 70 meters away.  Even in extreme heat it will not be difficult to go for a swim and go back.  Of the minuses, it can be noted the lack of food and parking in the hotel, but these minuses can be reconciled, given the low cost of the permit. </p>
