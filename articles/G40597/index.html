Rich in natural resources, it has good oil reserves and is the main producer of precious metals.  The second largest city, Medellin, was considered one of the most unsafe a few decades ago, and the crime rate here was off the charts, but now it has become the main tourist center, which was facilitated by the Social Urbanism program, which the former mayor of the city began to implement. </p><p>  After the implementation of many costly projects, life has changed dramatically for the better, and this approach of turning the metropolis, which was dominated by influential drug cartels, into a “smart city” was recognized as innovative. </p><h2>  The eventful history of the metropolis </h2><p>  Medellin <span>(Colombia), with a population of</span> more than three million people, was founded at the beginning of the 17th century by the Spaniards who came to the Abboura Valley, where the native Indians lived.  The discontent of the people was quickly suppressed, and the tribes, divided into small groups, disappeared after a few years.  The small village turned into a large city, in the valley of which they began to engage in gold mining, after which the settlement began to grow sharply.  The progressive Medellin, which gained independence from Spain, turned into the capital of Antioquia, which at that time was inhabited by about six thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colombia medellin supremo" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1456677.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 20th century, industry and the automotive industry were developing in the main trading center of the state, exporting coffee and gold, and a non-alcoholic drinks factory was emerging.  A huge number of immigrants and economic growth had negative consequences - the prosperity of the drug mafia.  A sharp jump in crime affected the reputation of the city, and only after the death of the cruel P. Escobar in 1993 did relatively calm times begin.  Now it is an industrial center with developed infrastructure, which is famous all over the world for Colombia. </p><p>  Medellin, which does not lose its colonial charm, attracts tourists with its amazing beauty and a huge number of attractions that I want to talk about in more detail. </p><h2>  The Three Black Cubes Library </h2><p>  The city of eternal spring, as locals lovingly call it, surprises with a variety of architectural monuments, similar to which are not found anywhere.  Biblioteca Parque Espana is an amazing complex, consisting of three black granite cubes connected from the inside by spans.  Before this original looking library appeared, it was necessary to demolish 146 buildings located on the territory of the future attraction, covering an area of ​​more than 14 thousand square meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medellin Colombia" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1456663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since the city of Medellin (Colombia) is not too lit in the dark, “Three Black Cubes” serve as a kind of beacon for residents and tourists.  The look of the city library is as recognizable as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and huge black boulders are visible from anywhere in the metropolis.  The merit of architects lies in the fact that, depending on the time of day and the angle of view, the architectural ensemble looks different every time. </p><h2>  Botero Park </h2><p>  The picturesque and sculptures of the famous artist <span>Fernando Botero,</span> working in the technique of figurative art, boasts colorful Colombia.  Medellin is a city to which the master donated his works, and now 23 bronze masterpieces are in Botero Square, filled with tourists from morning to evening.  This is a whole sculpture park located in the city center, where you can view the original works made in a grotesque manner without any fuss. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medellin Colombia population" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1456689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Art Museum Antioquia </h2><p>  A city with an interesting history is rich in museums, where all tourists who prefer to learn a lot about their vacation destination can easily get to.  Amazing art collections will introduce you to a past that Colombia never forgets. </p><p>  Medellin is primarily known for the Antioquia Museum - the oldest in the province.  Founded in 1881, the cultural institution is now located in the building of the Mint and is located next to Botero Park.  The works of the famous artist are stored here, and the exposition itself is located in 17 spacious halls.  Enthusiastic tourists will be able to see the masterpieces of art of the pre-Columbian and colonial eras, as well as interesting works by contemporary authors. </p><h2>  El castillo </h2><p>  Another museum that cannot be told about is El Castillo, which contains unique collections of antiques, porcelain, sculptures, tapestries, stained glass.  Tourists are struck by the building itself, more reminiscent of a medieval castle in the Gothic style.  The monumental building was once privately owned, and the museum became 45 years ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colombia medellin" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1456666.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  In addition, El Castillo is a huge library and concert hall, which often hosts performances by creative groups. </p><h2>  Metropolitan Cathedral Basilica </h2><p>  Medellin (Colombia), whose inhabitants profess Catholicism, attracts tourists with a special charm of its religious monuments.  The Central Cathedral, built in 1931, is known as the largest brick building in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medellin Colombia" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1456720.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Located in Bolivar Park, the powerful architectural ensemble is an active temple in which masses are regularly held for parishioners.  People come here to admire the skill of architects who created an amazing building that looks unusual and majestic. </p><h2>  Parque de los pies descalzos </h2><p>  Tourists hurrying to rest have already heard about the most unusual park, in which it is forbidden to walk in shoes.  The main idea of ​​the green oasis was Eastern philosophy, leading a person to enlightenment.  Broken into three zones, “Barefoot Park” will appeal to those who want to merge with nature and relax in silence away from noisy highways.  Zones of air, stones and water will present real pleasure and peace, and it seems that the same corner has been found in the metropolis, which allows you to relax and feel like a child, jogging along the grass. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ​​medellin colombia" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1456662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Parque de la luz </h2><p>  In modern Medellin (Colombia), a photo of which emphasizes its originality, people often come to see with their own eyes a real miracle located in Cisneros Square.  The park of light, created by a local architect, is no different from the others during the day, but in the evening, 300 tall columns equipped with flashlights and reflectors will make your heart beat from the sight you saw. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Medellin Colombia photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1456657.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The pillars that symbolize the urban forest, illuminating Cisneros Square, depending on the phases of the moon, are something special that one wants to admire. </p><h2>  Coffee country </h2><p>  Of course, Colombia is a country of coffee, in the production of which a large part of the country's population is involved.  Farmers do not resort to harmful artificial additives, and a favorable climate and land not affected by technological disasters help them get a good harvest.  This drink has deservedly become world famous, because its popularity is closely linked to the strict quality control that Colombia carries out before export.  Medellin Supremo is one of the best types of coffee, appreciated for the fact that all stages of production are carried out manually.  Tourists adore it for its great taste with a light nut undertones and are sure to bring it from a trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="colombia medellin supremo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1456732.jpg" width="262"></div>
