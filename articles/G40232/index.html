Reviews and specifications</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  BBK, whose televisions are known worldwide, has recently released a new line - LED models.  The released series immediately became interested in their bright and interesting names: Mandarina, Vanilla, Avokado.  All devices have a backlight function, as well as a built-in media player.  The Mandarina version also has a dedicated DVD player.  Some models have Full HD resolution, others belong to the HD Ready class. </p><p>  Thanks to the beautiful appearance and impeccable bright details, the TV will fit into any design of the room.  Under the BBK brand, Vanilla TVs are available in different edging colors (it is made in the shade of champagne), Mandarina is characterized by a predominance of orange, and for Avokado - green. </p><p>  The software that runs the TVs is lightweight and easy to use.  The case of the device looks ergonomic and elegant, especially underlined by touch keys.  An excellent quality of technology can be called support for almost all video formats. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk tvs" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085033.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  It will not be a secret to anyone that BBK (TVs are more concerned) has been manufacturing products that are in great demand among consumers for several years.  And although the equipment is manufactured in China, the company remains the leader both in Russia and in other countries.  It is suitable for those people who seek for a low price to purchase a high-quality LCD TV.  A large assortment allows you to find exactly the model that even an overly picky buyer will like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to recognize BBK (LED TVs) among a large number of equipment, it is worth paying attention to whether there is a backlight.  It will allow the person watching a movie or series to make the viewing process unusually realistic. </p><p>  If we consider TVs, focusing on their dimensions, it should be said that the largest device was with a diagonal of 45, and the most compact - only 15 inches. </p><p>  The main products of BBK are LCD TVs with DVD support.  The function of the latter is now not so in demand, but still pleases many buyers.  This is due to the fact that so far many people save photo and video archives on portable media in the form of disks. </p><p>  No need to bypass the external <span>characteristics of TVs.</span>  They deserve praise and applause, because thanks to the pleasant design they will be in perfect harmony with the design in any style. </p><h2>  BBK White Appliance - LT-2003S LCD TV </h2><p>  Manufacturing companies, creating LCD televisions, understand that the device must be different from a standard monitor.  This is due to the fact that it will be used for completely different purposes.  Almost all devices have unusual shapes, design, decoration elements.  BBK TVs are no exception.  19-inch devices of this company are common, so it is better to consider the option with a diagonal of 20 ". </p><p>  LT-2003S is available in some colors, white has become more common.  In principle, the shade and width of the TV allow installation in small rooms with a standard design.  The device has unusual qualities.  On the one hand, this is a regular LCD TV, on the other - a device that is able to connect to a computer using the necessary firmware.  The budget model has a resolution of 800x600 pixels.  Yes, today there are many options with higher image quality, but their cost is much higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk led tvs" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085029.jpg" width="350"></div>

However, it is worth remembering that liquid crystal partitions are intended for home use, playing on consoles and watching video from disks.  All of the above does not have permission above this, therefore producing models with parameters greater than those considered is simply irrational. </p><p>  It is impossible to see the time for which the panel responds in the technical specifications and brochures - the company ‚Äúhides‚Äù it.  However, according to customer comments, it can be judged that no more than 25 ms. </p><p>  <span>BBK LED TVs,</span> whose sound <span>reviews</span> are pretty good, transmit it in stereo.  On the case you can find three inputs at once.  They are necessary for playing on the console, connecting speakers or a VCR. </p><p>  The front panel has several buttons that facilitate the use of the device.  The stand on which the TV is located has a very rigid stand, so the probability of tipping over is zero. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk lcd tv" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085050.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Performance LT-2003S </h2><p>  The tuner from the company showed itself not from the best side.  In order to understand how to connect the BBK to the TV, you need to carefully read the operation book.  During installation, you should be careful and serious, because when making an error, the signal quality may be slightly affected.  A home antenna for this TV will not work, you need to use something larger. </p><p>  When connecting channels, the device automatically makes all the settings.  But it is worth noting that the channel does not have a manual search.  All you can do with your own hands is shuffle them, give everyone a name, etc. </p><p>  The cost of the device varies within $ 500, but at the same time it is able to work only from one TV tuner.  Accordingly, the picture-in-picture function is not available.  Viewing angles are good;  when the TV is deviated by 160 degrees, the image is not lost, the clarity and color gamut remains the same. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to connect bbk to tv" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085035.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Remote controller </h2><p>  Strange as it may seem, the TV remote control has become the most interesting detail.  The BBK somehow transformed him;  it seems as if they got it not from the box with a rather expensive device, but from the box with a player for the car.  The form of the device is ordinary, simple, the color scheme is simple.  For a serious TV, which has a liquid crystal screen and is not a standard decoration of an apartment, such a remote control is too modest.  It is also possible that the buyer will subsequently use a device similar to a tablet PC, or another more solid unit, but all the features of the TV can be experienced only thanks to the ‚Äúnative‚Äù remote control. </p><p>  Although the company takes some steps towards a more modern and elegant design of its products, something is still missing.  This also applies to the design of the menu.  Although simple to use, it is unpretentious and uninteresting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="led bbk tvs reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085031.jpg" width="158"></div>

    <h2>  BBK Feature LMP3229HDU </h2><p>  This model entered the market quite recently - about two years ago.  The technical characteristics of the TV make it possible to conclude that the manufacturer took into account all its errors and corrected them in this version.  The image will never be distorted.  This is due to the fact that the format is 16: 9, the resolution is 1920x1080, and the diagonal is 31.5 inches. </p><p>  Particular attention should be paid to the design decision.  The case was made of a material that does not require special care and is resistant to mechanical damage.  The instrument stand is strong and stable, so the TV certainly will not fall by itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bbk 19 tvs" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085378.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  BBK LEM2249HD Feature </h2><p>  The model has a diagonal of 22 ", so you can install it in the living room, kitchen or bedroom. Image resolution - FullHD. In addition, the TV has good viewing angles, a clear picture. It also has functions that allow you to install the device as a monitor or and for its intended purpose. </p><p>  The TV has a backlight - LEDs are located on the edge of the screen.  This allowed us to make the device as flat as possible.  Among the options you can find a timer, the inclusion of a stereo sound system, it is possible to connect a digital tuner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="remote for bbk tv" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1085038.jpg" width="395"></div>
