They significantly increase the functionality of the smartphone.  However, from time to time, the user receives notifications about the availability of updates for a particular utility.  In the article, we will consider what it is for, how to install it, and how to cancel the application update on Android. </p><h2>  Why update apps? </h2><p>  Companies developing mobile applications are constantly working to improve their product in order to make it more functional, interesting, fast and easy to use.  That is why updates in the Play Market periodically appear for applications already installed on the mobile device. </p><p>  The main reason you need to update utilities is software imperfection.  The creators are in a hurry to share their developments, while others are not ahead of them.  However, often the software has many bugs, errors that slow it down.  Over time, releasing updates, these shortcomings are fixed, offering an improved version of the utility.  In addition, many applications can be attacked by viruses that are launched to steal passwords, personal data, etc. In turn, the developer, in addition to improvements, seeks to increase the level of security. </p><p>  But sometimes situations arise when you need to return to the old version.  Then information may be useful, how to undo the last update of the application on the "Android".  More about this later in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="applives.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="uninstall android application updates" class="if uuid-3181900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181900.jpg"></div><h2>  The need for periodic updates </h2><p>  No specific recommendations can be made here.  The fact is that many users of the Android operating system have hundreds of applications installed and at least 10 of them will require updates daily.  This slows down the device to a certain extent, and if updates occur without connecting to a Wi-Fi network, it also significantly consumes mobile Internet traffic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In favor of a periodic update, it is worth saying that there are utilities that a user cannot do without in everyday life.  After updating the device, they work better and faster, they allow you to solve tasks, without resorting to unnecessary actions and the use of third-party programs. </p><p>  Some applications can be updated less frequently or not at all.  These are the programs: </p><ul><li>  not having access to the Internet; </li><li>  not reading the contact list; </li><li>  not leaving information in memory; </li><li>  without access to SMS messages. </li></ul><p>  There are a lot of such applications, for example, Compass or Flashlight.  If they already work well, then updating them is useless.  As for the rest of the programs, before installing the new version it is necessary to familiarize yourself with the description for it.  If it offers a solution to problems such as a utility vulnerability, a solution to the problem of excessive memory consumption, then, of course, it is recommended to update. </p><p>  If the benefit seemed obvious, and after installation the user did not like the new functionality, then he can cancel the update of the application on Android.  This is not difficult to do if you use the information in this article. </p><h2>  Removing Updates </h2><p>  In ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù, in addition to installation, updates can be deleted.  However, this function is limited to applications downloaded in Chrome, YouTube, Gmail, etc. By removing the update, the utility takes on the form in which it was at the time of the initial installation.  How to remove application updates on Android?  To do this, you must perform a series of sequential actions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab and select ‚ÄúApplication Manager‚Äù; </li><li>  in the list that opens, select the desired utility; </li><li>  then click ‚ÄúStop‚Äù, and after that - ‚ÄúDelete update‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  It's all.  After performing the described actions, all installed updates of a particular application are deleted, and the program returns to its original state. </p><p>  There are programs in the settings of which automatic updating is registered.  They inform about the changes after the fact.  The device‚Äôs functionality allows you to cancel the automatic update of applications on Android. </p><p>  If for some reason you need to restore the old version of some application, you will need to download it from the corresponding resource on the Internet.  At the same time, you should be extremely careful, because many sites through which applications for Android are distributed may contain viruses.  Therefore, the download is made from trusted sources, having read reviews of members of the forum. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smartphonus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove application update on android" class="if uuid-3181896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181896.jpg"></div><h2>  Ban updates </h2><p>  In some cases, smartphone users may need to turn off updates, for example, to preserve mobile traffic.  To do this is quite simple: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  go to the Play Market and open the menu on the left side of the screen; </li><li>  select the line "Settings" and click on "Auto-update applications"; </li><li>  in the proposed list the item ‚ÄúNever‚Äù or ‚ÄúOnly via Wi-Fi‚Äù is marked. </li></ul><p>  You can also mark or, on the contrary, cancel the activation of the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù function.  When it is turned on, notifications about the release of a new version of a particular application regularly come to the smartphone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geek-nose.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how on android to cancel application update" class="if uuid-3181868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181868.jpg"></div><h2>  Cancel updates </h2><p>  If, for some reason, the download of the patch begins without a corresponding notification, the update can be interrupted.  The easiest and fastest way to remove the application update on Android is as follows: </p><ul><li>  open the notification tab and find a specific application; </li><li>  then a long press on it opens a menu in which the line "About the application" is selected; </li><li>  in the window that appears, click "Erase data", after which the download will be interrupted. </li></ul><p>  In order to continue to avoid such unauthorized downloads, in the Google Play menu, you must disable the automatic program update function. </p><h2>  Disabling a specific utility update </h2><p>  In order to cancel the application update on ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù in automatic mode or select certain programs that should not be installed themselves, you must follow the step-by-step instructions: </p><ul><li>  Log in to the Google Play app </li><li>  open the tab ‚ÄúMy applications and games‚Äù in the left side menu; </li><li>  select a specific program and click on it; </li><li>  in the menu that opens, uncheck the box next to the line "Auto-update". </li></ul><p>  From now on, a separate application will not download updates, while other utilities will continue to install new versions automatically. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pomogaemkompu.temaretik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel application update on android samsung" class="if uuid-3181913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181913.jpg"></div><h2>  Manual update </h2><p>  When you independently download the latest updates for your favorite programs and games, the user has the opportunity to reduce the consumption of Internet traffic and speed up the phone, since the software will not be constantly downloading in the background.  In particular, manual control is recommended for those device owners who have downloaded a lot of applications, while the capabilities of the mobile device are limited.  In addition, with manual installation, the user knows what he was doing, and if necessary, can solve the problem of how to cancel the update of applications on the Samsung Android or other smartphones. </p><p>  Among other things, constant downloads help to quickly reduce battery power.  After they are turned off, from time to time updates must be carried out independently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="storax.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to undo the last update of the application on android" class="if uuid-3181883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181883.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, you need: </p><ul><li>  Sign in to Google Play </li><li>  Click on the menu icon located in the upper left corner of the page; </li><li>  in the window that opens, select the line ‚ÄúMy applications and games‚Äù; </li><li>  then go to the "Installed" tab; </li><li>  next to the software for which there is an update, the "Update" button will appear. </li></ul><p>  Thus, the specific application is updated.  To download all the new applications, you must press the button "Update all".  After that, the installation of all available updates for utilities available on the phone will begin.  Depending on their number, the download time is determined.  The advantages of this method of working with programs are that the user chooses the time to install the upgrades, and they will not be downloaded at the wrong time, for example, when the battery level is low or traffic is limited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geek-nose.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to cancel the automatic update of applications on android" class="if uuid-3181878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181878.jpg"></div><h2>  If the application does not work </h2><p>  After updating the programs, it happens that some of them simply stop working.  The most affordable option is to clear the cache, reinstall or remove the latest application update on Android.  To perform the second action you need: </p><ul><li>  open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab and select ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù; </li><li>  then click on the line ‚ÄúApplication Data‚Äù; </li><li>  Find and select a specific application, and then click "Erase Data." </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="android-example.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the latest application update on android" class="if uuid-3181906" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3181906.jpg"></div><p>  Perhaps after these actions the program will work.  If the efforts undertaken did not help, you can try to reflash the device, download the backup copy, if any, reinstall the program or reset the settings to factory defaults.  In the article, we examined how to cancel the application update on Android. </p>
