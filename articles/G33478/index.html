    <h2>  Guest reviews: flaws </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the hotel guests note not only the benefits of relaxing in this place.  In their opinion, the complex has significant shortcomings that can ruin the impression of a vacation.  The guests believe that the hotel administration should eliminate the following shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  Internet in rooms is not working well.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãin the evening is very low.  At the same time, it is quite expensive. </li><li>  The coffee machine in the restaurant makes delicious coffee. </li><li>  Small rooms.  Nowhere to leave big bags.  The two in the room are very crowded. </li><li>  The restaurant has dirty tables and chairs.  However, the waiters immediately wipe them, if they indicate a dirty place. </li><li>  There is no shower spray in the bathroom.  The shower itself is a hose from which water runs under pressure. </li></ul>
