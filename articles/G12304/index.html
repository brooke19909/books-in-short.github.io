    <p>  Lovers of dumplings, whites, cutlets and other products using minced meat just need to get your own meat grinder.  After all, all these goodies are much more useful if they are made with your own hands. </p><p>  It should be noted that the choice of a meat grinder is by no means a simple matter.  It used to be in stores selling manual meat chopping tools that were of the same type.  Today, the mass of such kitchen appliances is presented on the market, and each manufacturer claims that it is his product that deserves the attention of the buyer. </p><p>  In order to still decide on a meat grinder, you need to answer some questions for yourself.  The first one is how much power should a purchased kitchen appliance have?  The answer to this question lies on the surface: the more, the naturally better.  It should be borne in mind that the power of the meat grinder can reach 450 and even 2000 watts.  Such devices include models: <span>BRAUN G 1300,</span> TEFAL ME 7011, as well as MOULINEX ME6051 and many others. <strong> </strong></p><p>  There is one more parameter to pay attention to.  The choice of the meat grinder should be carried out according to its type.  Of course, many are trying to keep up with progress and believe that buying this device separately from the combine is already yesterday.  However, they are mistaken.  Indeed, shock-type meat grinders are built into combines, and some work according to the auger principle. </p><p>  When wondering which meat grinder to buy, care must be taken to ensure that the device is reliably protected from overloads.  If, for example, hard meat is chopped, then a special system should work, which, in case of lack of power, will turn on the reverse movement.  All modern devices of the largest manufacturers, such as Tefal, Brown or Gorenie, are equipped with such a function.  We can distinguish such models: Gorenje MG2000S or, for example, Braun G3000. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The choice of a meat grinder may also be affected by its height above the dishes, into which the already prepared minced meat will fall. </p><p>  And finally, the most important thing is the quality of the knives.  They should be made of quality steel and require sharpening no more than twice a year. </p><p>  It is also very important to consider the completeness of the device.  For example, if molding lattices are included with the device, it is better if there are as many of them as possible.  As for the loading tray, which is attached to the neck for loading, it ensures safety when serving meat.  However, without a special pushing device, this tray does not provide complete safety for the owner.  Even such seemingly trifles can seriously affect the choice of a meat grinder.  After all, all these devices must be mandatory items in the configuration of the device.  As for the tray, the larger it is, the better.  Many manufacturers make pushers with trays of durable plastic.  However, there are also brands that prefer <span>stainless steel.</span>  This, by the way, is a very good option.  Among such models of meat grinders stand out such as the Moulinex HV10 ME850, <span>KENWOOD MG 510</span> and many others. </p><p>  Some meat grinders, in addition to chopping functions, can squeeze juice.  Well, what kind of owner will deny himself the pleasure of indulging in fresh?  In this case, it is worth choosing models such as Scarlett SC-4248 or, for example, Ariete 2921. Other interesting devices that are equipped with meat grinders include various nozzles for <span>cutting fruits and</span> vegetables.  It is also very useful when it comes to the time when many make their own blanks for the winter. </p><p>  And lovers of sausages meat grinder will be very welcome.  A special nozzle will help to make the most delicious sausages that you have ever tasted.  In the kits, nozzles for making <span>pasta, cookies</span> and other <span>flour products</span> can also go <span>.</span>  The following models have them: Scarlett SC-4248, Saturn ST-FP 1096, Gorenje MG 1800 TJW. </p><p>  This, perhaps, is all about the choice of meat grinders.  As you can see, there is nothing complicated about this, however, as emphasized above, this process must be approached thoughtfully.  Especially when it comes to such a home appliance as an electric meat grinder.  Reviews for any model can always be found on the vast expanses of various Internet resources, as well as numerous forums. </p>
