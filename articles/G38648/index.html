    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This hotel is located in <span>Phuket (Thailand),</span> 36 kilometers from the international airport.  So it will take you less than an hour to get to the hotel.  The city center can be reached by taxi or bike in 10 minutes.  The nearest Panwa Beach is a five minute walk.  However, it is of little use for swimming, so tourists go to Ao Yon or other <span>beaches in Phuket.</span>  In this regard, experienced guests are advised to rent a car or scooter to be mobile and to be able to visit all the places of interest.  By the way, a free shuttle service is organized several times a day from the hotel to Ao Yon Beach and to the city center.  But here you have to go back already yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the mangrove panwa phuket resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1130435.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Our compatriots who left 5 * reviews about The Mangrove Panwa Phuket Resort hotel, according to them, were very pleased with the work of the local restaurant.  So, since breakfast is included in the price, in the morning almost all guests ate at the hotel.  According to tourists, the food here is very tasty and satisfying.  Throughout the day, guests can also eat in the hotel restaurant for an additional fee.  A big plus, according to our compatriots, is the fact that many of the dishes on the menu are adapted to the taste habits of travelers. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As already mentioned, despite the fact that the ‚ÄúMangrove Panwa Phuket Resort‚Äù is located very close to the sea (literally five minutes walk), in order to swim, tourists will have to go a longer way.  This is due to the fact that mangroves are located near the hotel near the shore, making it difficult to enter the water.  The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the nearest swimming beach.  Despite the fact that many tourists liked it here, they still advise visiting other Phuket beaches. </p>
