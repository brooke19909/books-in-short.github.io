    <p>  Healing mud is a substance that is mineral sludge soaked in brine.  In appearance, this product looks like an oily thick plastic mass with a bluish tint.  At the same time, it smells of hydrogen sulfide.  Healing mud can be easily rubbed.  There is no sensation of sand.  This natural remedy sticks to the skin very tightly, and after the procedure is completed it is washed off with difficulty. </p><p>  The black color and plasticity of the dirt gives the colloidal hydrate of sulphurous iron and fatty substances.  After contact with air, the healing agent changes the consistency, color, becomes covered with a crust of brown-green color.  Such changes occur due to the formation of acetic, formic and other acids in the mud.  Contact with air causes a loss of ductility.  The dirt dries and begins to crumble. </p><h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  Sanatorium "Elton" (Volgograd region) sets the price of tickets depending on the comfort of the room and the number of days of stay.
