For example, many people know that there are protected <span>smartphones with a powerful battery.</span>  Among the latest devices you can also find such.  Unfortunately, these gadgets are not as many as ordinary smartphones.  This is due to the fact that, as a rule, it is important for manufacturers to add functionality, improve the power of the device and make the screen much more without sacrificing ergonomics and usability.  This all drains the battery a lot during the day, even in standby mode.  Accordingly, the reliability of the phone, its durability and safety - these are issues that almost no attention is paid to.  This certain number of users repels, because there is a special group of people who are interested in strength and security.  That is why a special kind of phones was created.  They differ in that they withstand the ingress of dust, water, strong shocks and a fall from a height.  In the article, we consider the most protected smartphones with a powerful battery. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Manufacturers are trying to make ordinary phones secure, but the measures that companies use are not suitable.  For example, <span>tempered glass is</span> installed on many phones.  The hardness is substantial, but the thickness leaves much to be desired - this part is too fragile.  For a smartphone that could become shockproof, this figure is slightly below the level.  Due to the use of OGS technology, the device can be very vulnerable if something happens.  Among modern and popular models, you can find those that use materials for the body, such as aluminum and titanium.  However, it must be said that the manufacturer does not say, such options are not successful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Currently known companies that specifically create such phones.  They focus on battery power, as well as the tightness of the case.  These devices will interest even athletes, tourists and others.  People who serve in the Ministry of Emergencies, the police, and so on, also look for similar devices for themselves.  Therefore, we can conclude that such a phone is suitable for those who have a dangerous job or extreme relaxation.  Further in the article we will consider shockproof and <span>protected phones.</span>  Only those with a good battery were included in the rating. </p><h2>  Buying a phone </h2><p>  Often, tourists and people on the road use secure smartphones with a powerful battery.  At the same time, manufacturers show that the device is as tight as possible.  It is important for travelers that the phone can not only withstand the adverse effects of external factors, but also slowly discharges.  It will be quite difficult to charge the device during the trip.  Also, if you need a walkie-talkie or radio, then you can purchase such models. </p><p>  A huge role in such phones is played by the option that allows you to save battery power - energy-saving.  Moreover, an additional function in the form of quick ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù will be quite good.  Then a person for a minimum period will be able to restore his device and use it further.  Before using such a device, you should read the instructions for the purchased or almost purchased model.  Given all this information, we present the rating of the best devices that have a powerful battery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  MANN ZUG 5s </h2><p>  This good rugged smartphone with a powerful battery can be known to many as AGM Stone 5S.
