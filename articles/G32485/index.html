Literally before our eyes, new roads, shopping centers, all kinds of offices, housing estates appear, what can we say about new residential complexes.  At the same time, several are being built in the capital.  One of them is the Generation residential complex.  Moscow is already so built up that there is no free span left.  Unless on the very outskirts, but in the places of the former industrial zones.  So developers decide where it is more profitable for them to build housing - away from the center and all transport interchanges or where industrial enterprises once worked, but in places with developed infrastructure.  FSK "Leader" chose the second option, having decided at the same time to ennoble the unsightly territory and build houses where it will be most convenient for residents.  So in the general plan appeared LCD "Generation".  Reviews about him can be seen different.  The main complaints to the construction site.  But the infrastructure, layout of apartments and their design are not satisfactory. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lcg generation reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1587711.jpg" width="494"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The new modern LCD "Generation" is being built in the NEAD of the capital, on the territory between two major highways - Altufevsky and Dmitrovsky.  Its official address is Signal Drive, 5. On the one hand, it is a great convenience for car owners, since this drive literally borders the territory of the future residential complex.  On the other hand, it is not very convenient for residents, especially those whose windows will face a very busy road, to which from the nearest houses there will be no more than a dozen and a half meters.  There are some developments to relieve the extremely busy Signal Drive, having arranged a multi-level flyover here, but it will not add to the residents of the peace complex.  Right behind the road is the Otradnoye railway platform, which is also not particularly pleasant for those who give priority to comfortable living, rather than the proximity of the location of the railway junction.  But the developer promises to install sound-absorbing shields so that everything complies with the standards.  About a kilometer from the future complex is the existing metro station "Vladykino", followed by the Botanical Garden.  In the direction of "Vladykino" about 350 meters from the LCD there is a stop of city buses.  It is located next to the Beta Center.  On the opposite side of the complex, about 300-350 meters away, another new metro station “Okruzhnaya” is being built, which they are obliged to hand over this year.  A pleasant bonus for those who buy housing in the "Generation" is a recreation area near the river Likhoborka, which flows no further than a kilometer from the residential complex.  Near it is also planned to open a metro station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Cleanliness of the area is the most important issue for investors of Generation residential complex.  The reviews note the concern that houses are being built where it was and remains industrial zone No. 50. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Signal Drive" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1587728.jpg" width="501"></div><br>  By the way, the building plot was rented back in 2006.  In our life, everything is changing very quickly.  Not more than a century ago, in Otradnoye, there was a summer cottage village, the actress Ermolova even lived here.  Then this piece of Moscow was swallowed up by industrialization, a fleet of vehicles, warehouses, a sausage factory, military enterprises and even a garbage processing plant were built here.  Now many of these facilities are closed, some at the reorganization stage.  Residents are assured that by the time of the commissioning of the residential complex, all nearby industrial facilities will be demolished, and a park will be broken in their place.  But these are only plans so far.  The only good news is that in the area of ​​residential buildings under construction no harmful waste was found in the soil, otherwise the construction would not be allowed to start.

Responses of residents note that they have a pleasant color scheme in beige and brown tones, classic and, at the same time, stylish forms.
