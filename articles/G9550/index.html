This fact has long been known; its indisputability has been proved and unconditionally accepted by scientists around the world.  It is surprising that the warmth and boundless love with which dolphins relate to people, it is almost impossible to recognize them with the human mind. </p><p>  Beautiful animals can communicate with each other at a distance verbally, but this is not the only thing that testifies to the uniqueness of these creatures.  Both their incredible communication and interaction with people lead to the fact that we see them as more than just animals who love to accompany ships in the sea. </p><p>  Those adults who were lucky enough to chat with dolphins see in them already a full-fledged friend.  But what about the children?  The experience of their communication with dolphins clearly shows that it has a positive effect and gives the children a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive emotions.  We know, and it is no secret to anyone, that a special method has been developed for the therapeutic treatment of children with disorders of the central nervous system and mental disorders, the meaning of which is simple interaction and close contact between the child and the dolphin.  It is recognized all over the world that this practice is very effective and efficient and helps well, for example, for children with cerebral palsy. </p><h2>  Description of an interesting establishment with sea animals </h2>
