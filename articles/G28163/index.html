  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is geography?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Opening the question of what geography (G.) is, we note that this is a fairly extensive system of sciences that deal with a detailed study of the geographic <span>shell of the Earth,</span> and also reveal temporal and spatial patterns.  Thus, she studies the geosphere (soil, biosphere, atmosphere, and so on) and geological systems (landscapes, biogeocenoses, etc.). </p><p>  The objects of study of this science are the laws of the location and establishment of contacts between the components of the geographical sphere, as well as their combinations at the state, regional, oceanic and global levels.  All this was the impetus for modern geography to be guided by the line of industry disciplines.  Thus, natural and social geographical sciences are distinguished.  The basis of the former is landscape science, which studies landscape complexes, and geography, which reveals the patterns of <span>geographic envelope.</span>  This includes such industry sciences as climatology, oceanology, hydrology and others. </p><p>  Considering what public geography is, it should be noted that it is studying the territorial organization of society.  This includes economic, political, cultural and social geography. </p><p>  In any case, any of the listed industry sciences has one goal - the justification of the methods of territorial formations of public groups, the definition of long-term tasks and goals for creating a safe ecological environment in which society will develop. </p><p>  The foundations of geography were laid back in the first century AD.  And already in the Renaissance, achievements in this area were rethought, cartography began to actively develop.  In the XIX century, A. Humboldt and <span>K. Ritter</span> laid the foundations of modern academic teaching.  Today it is a complex of seven sciences, such as: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  1. Mathematical G. - studies geodesy and astronomy, on the basis of the acquired knowledge maps are created in different projections. </p><p>  2. Geophysics - associated with the study of physics, geology and astronomy. </p><p>  3. Physical geography: oceanology, geology, climatology (meteorology) - synthesizes data on climatic differences on the Earth's surface. </p><p>  4. What is biological geography?  This science includes: </p><p>  a) G. animals (associated with the study of zoology); </p><p>  b) G. plants - has a connection with botany. </p><p>  5. Country studies - a detailed study of the history of the emergence of various countries. </p><p>  6. Anthropogeography - based on data from anthropology, statistics, ethnography, history, as well as biological and physical G. </p><p>  7. History of geography - examines information about the surface of the Earth, as well as geographical views and concepts. </p><p>  All these sciences are closely interconnected.  If we look at an example, we can see that the main task of a specialist in this area is to study in depth the regional geography, which is unthinkable without acquaintance with geography associated with private geography. </p><p>  If we talk about what geography is for modern society, and what role it plays in its formation and development, it should be noted that for many centuries this science has provided the connection of acquired knowledge with natural, social, economical processes, since there is close attention paid to the world of people, their relationships to each other and to nature, as well as to culture, life and other things. </p><p>  Thus, having considered what geography is, it is necessary to emphasize that this science has a large integration resource, it combines various branches of knowledge and <span>research methods</span> to provide assistance in solving the important problem of modern time - ensuring the sustainable development of mankind in different countries of the world. </p>
