  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quantum physics and its relationship with the reality of the universe</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many are interested in quantum physics and reality, these are such exciting minds of the field of science, where many try to find answers to questions about the origin of the universe itself.  Each modern cosmological theory also relies on quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of an atomic and <span>subatomic particle.</span>  Quantum physics has a fundamental difference from ordinary physics. </p><p>  Using classical physics, the behavior of a material object is described, while quantum physics and reality focus only on mathematical descriptions of observations and measurements.  Here we see the disappearance of material material reality from the field of view.  The Nobel laureate of V. Heisenberg said: ‚ÄúIt has become clear that now we will not be able to separate the behavior of particles from the processes of observation.  As a result, we must get used to the fact that the law of nature, which is formulated in mathematical form with the help of quantum mechanics, has a relation not to the behavior of an <span>elementary particle</span> as such, but only to our knowledge about this particle. ‚Äù </p><p>  In quantum mechanics, along with the <span>objects of research</span> and the research tool, the element of the analyzed patterns is observers.  But since <span>quantum mechanics are used</span> to describe the universe, this is fraught with serious difficulty.  Given the definition, each observer is part of the universe.  In general, we do not have the ability to imagine outsiders.  To formulate a version of quantum mechanics that does not need an outside observer, one of the famous physicists J. Wheeler decided to propose a model, given which, the Universe is capable of splitting into various copies all the time.  Each parallel universe has its own observers who can see these specific sets of quantum alternatives, and each of these universes is real. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The basic elements of quantum mechanics are a multitude of <span>integrated circuits</span> (active and passive components electrically interconnected) that perform a certain function, but the trouble of the scientist who used the method of materialistic reductionism does not end there.  It is not enough that the <span>theory of relativity</span> and quantum physics, when applied to cosmology, can lead to an absurd and fantastic model.  To assess the precariousness of the scientist‚Äôs hopes, once to find the answer to how the Universe happened, it is necessary to take into account that they use, more often than not, the unified field theory, whose task is to combine the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. </p><p>  Each of them hopes that with the help of this theory every force that is capable of acting in the Universe using one compact mathematical expression will be described.  During this, the theory of relativity is used to describe the general structure of place-time, and quantum physics is used to explain the behavior of a subatomic particle.  However, each theory is a contradiction to each other. The first step towards the mathematical integration of each theory is as a quantum field theory.  Using this theory, the behavior of an electron is described, and quantum physics and <span>Einstein's theory of relativity</span> are combined <span>.</span>  Such a combination of concepts, in principle, was a very successful idea. </p><p>  The second and most difficult step is the integration of the usual theory of relativity, coupled with quantum mechanics, but now no one has the slightest idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow this is done.  Even many recognized authorities, such as Nobel laureate S.P., Weinberg, agree that it will take a very long time to create the mathematical apparatus of the latest theory. </p>
