    <p>  The empirical level of knowledge in science to a certain extent corresponds to the sensory stage of research, while the theoretical one corresponds to a rational or logical one.  Of course, there is no absolute correspondence with honey.  It has been established that the empirical level of knowledge includes not only sensory, but also logical research.  In this case, information obtained in a sensual way, is subjected here to primary processing by conceptual (rational) means. </p><p>  Empirical knowledge, therefore, is not only a reflection of reality, formed experimentally.  They represent the specific unity of the mental and sensory expression of reality.  In this case, sensory reflection is in the first place, and thinking plays an auxiliary role subordinate to observation. </p><p>  Empirical evidence provides science with facts.  Their establishment is an integral part of any research.  Thus, the empirical level of knowledge contributes to the establishment and accumulation of <span>scientific facts.</span> </p><p>  A fact is a reliably established event, a fictitious incident.  This fixed empirical knowledge is synonymous with concepts such as ‚Äúresults‚Äù, ‚Äúevents‚Äù. </p><p>  It should be noted that the facts act not only as an information source and a ‚Äúsensual‚Äù <span>basis of theoretical</span> reasoning.  They are also a criterion of truth and reliability. </p><p>  The empirical level of knowledge allows one to establish facts by various methods.  These methods, in particular, include observation, experiment, comparison, measurement. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Observation is the purposeful and systematic perception of phenomena and objects.  The purpose of this perception is to determine the relationships and properties of the studied phenomena or objects.  Observation can be carried out either directly or indirectly (using tools - a microscope, a camera, and others).  It should be noted that for modern science, such a study over time becomes more complicated and becomes more indirect. </p><p>  Comparison is called a cognitive procedure.  It is the basis in accordance with which the distinction or similarity of objects.  Comparison allows you to identify quantitative and qualitative properties and characteristics of objects. </p><p>  It should be said that the comparison method is appropriate in determining the signs of homogeneous phenomena or objects that form classes.  As well as observation, this <span>method of cognition</span> can be carried out indirectly or directly.  In the first case, the comparison is made when correlating two items with the third, which is the standard. </p><p>  Measurement is called the establishment of a numerical indicator of a certain value using a specific unit (watts, centimeters, kilograms, etc.).  This method of <span>quantitative analysis has been</span> used since the advent of new European science.  Due to its widespread use, measurement has become an organic element of <span>scientific knowledge.</span> </p><p>  All of the above methods can be used both independently and in combination.  In a complex, observation, measurement and comparison are part of a more complex empirical method of cognition - experiment. </p><p>  This method of research involves setting the subject in clearly accountable conditions or reproducing it artificially to identify certain characteristics.  An experiment is a way to carry out active <span>empirical research.</span>  Activity in this case involves the subject's ability to intervene during the process or phenomenon being studied. </p>
