    <h2>  Lake Bled: how to get there </h2><p>  This natural pond is located in the northwest of Slovenia, in the Krajina region.  It is only forty-five kilometers from the capital of Ljubljana.  And Brnik International Airport is even closer - only 32 km.  On the shores of Lake Bled is located the eponymous town with a population of five thousand inhabitants.  Getting to this resort is no problem.  Nearby there is a railway line and a highway leading from Ljubljana to Villach.  Tourists advise getting to the lake by train.  Jezero Bled <span>train station is</span> almost on the shore.  The road is very beautiful, leading along the picturesque river Sochi.  Lake Bled (Slovenia) has a border position.  Only eight kilometers to the north - and you are already in Austria.  And if you go west, after 40 km you will meet sunny Italy.  And this pleasant neighborhood needs to be used - recommend the owners of the Schengen visa.  From the town of Bled, roads lead to the mountains: to Triglav National Reserve, to another natural attraction of Slovenia - Lake Bohinj (20 minutes ride), to the ski resort Kranjska Gora. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Bled Slovenia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/973518.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geography and climate </h2><p>  The reservoir is of glacial origin.  It is located at an altitude of five hundred meters above sea level, in the foothills of the Julian Alps.  Once, during the period of global cooling, the glacier crawled down the slopes and pushed with its mass a depression, which was then filled with melt water.  So Lake Bled was formed.  Now the reservoir is fed by cold mountain streams and hot springs, beating in its depths.  Sometimes these thermal keys are reserved for the pools of coastal hotels.  In winter, the lake freezes only in very severe frosts, which do not happen every year.  In summer, the water warms up to + 20-24 ¬∞ C. The bathing season opens here in June and ends in early September.  But this does not mean that the rest of the life at the resort freezes.  After a short lull, skiing begins on Lake Bled (Slovenia).  The resort has a unique microclimate with lots of sunny days.  The lake itself is not very big.  Its length is a little more than two kilometers and a width of one and a half.  But the pond is deep enough.  The maximum parameters are 30 meters.  In the middle of the lake is the island of Blejski otok. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake bled reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/973519.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  The resort began to develop at the end of the nineteenth century, when the town and Lake Bled (Veldeser See in German) were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Therefore, do not be surprised at the presence of a large number of old villas and hotels here.  The lion's share of hotels have three or four stars on their sign.  But enough at the resort and budget hostels, and luxury "fives."  The private sector offers a wide selection of accommodation, from modest apartments to villas.  Most hotels are concentrated on the east coast.  In the west of Lake Bled, there is only a campsite, the conditions in which reviews are touted.  If you are a lover of solitude, choose the southern part of the reservoir.  There are only a few hotels located in a distance from each other.  Tourists note that pristine nature - crystal waterfalls, deep gorges, mountains and the Pokljuk plateau - are combined with high-quality European service.  And, as all reviews say, a vacation on Lake Bled will cost you several times less than on Garda or Lago Maggiore in neighboring Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Bled photo" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/973520.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Summer resort </h2><p>  Most tourists come to the town of Bled in the warm season for swimming and sunbathing.  But only one hotel on the lake has its own beach.  This is the luxury spa hotel Grand Toplice.  There are two beaches in the town of Bled.  One of them is well equipped, but paid.  It is located opposite the Park Hotel.  Entrance to the second beach - at the Villa Bled hotel - is free.  True, one should not rely on some luxurious conditions there.  In addition to a beach holiday, ‚Äúsummer‚Äù tourists can sail to the islet in traditional ‚ÄúPleten‚Äù boats.  They look like Venetian gondolas - with a canopy from the sun.  On the island is the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.  If you strike the bell three times at this chapel and make a wish, it will certainly come true (at least, tourists say).  In summer, you can rent mountain bikes or go hiking.  A tourist train travels around Lake Bled.  Photos taken from such a train will be in gigabytes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake bled Slovenia reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/973523.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Winter resort </h2><p>  From late December to March, the town of Bled comes to life again.  In winter, it is transformed into one of the largest <span>ski resorts in Slovenia.</span>  Although, as warned by reviews, the speakers there will seem a little boring.  Trails are most suitable for beginners and those careful skiers who avoid extreme sports.  But the nearest track with two ski lifts (a saddle and a tow-rope) is located just one hundred and fifty meters from the center of the town.  Its length is 820 meters, and the vertical drop is 135 m (from 635 to five hundred).  A free bus runs through the resort, bringing skiers from all hotels to the lower lift station.  Tourists who come to Lake Bled in winter can purchase a ski pass that allows them to ride not only on the tracks of this resort, but also the entire Kranjska Gora area, which also includes Vogel and Koble.  A distance of twenty kilometers to the higher mountains will help to overcome the ski bass.  The ticket price includes not only passes to the lifts, but also the use of an ice rink at the Sports Palace, and a visit to Bled Castle.  The ski slopes are equipped with snow cannons and lighting in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest on Lake Bled" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/973525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Must-see </h2><p>  The main cultural attraction that glorified Lake Bled (Slovenia), reviews are called the castle of the same name.  It was built on top of a 130-meter cliff right above the <span>surface of the water.</span>  In written sources, the castle (originally called Feldes) was first mentioned in 1004.  Then Emperor Henry II granted this stronghold to Bishop Brixen of Albuin.  After the Battle of Sukhoi Kruty (1278), the castle, along with the entire province of Krajna, went to Rudolf I of <span>the Habsburg dynasty.</span>  As part of Austria-Hungary, the region remained until the end of the First World War.  Only briefly, from 1809 to 1816, the castle entered the Napoleonic Illyrian provinces.  When Krajna became part of Yugoslavia, Bled turned into the summer royal residence of the Karageorgievichs.  The socialist leader Josip Broz Tito also praised the beauty of the castle.  This medieval fortress, repeatedly rebuilt and expanded by subsequent owners, became a museum in independent Slovenia.  Reviews highly recommend visiting this castle.  You will not regret the eight euros spent.  The castle has two courtyards, which are located one above the other and connected by a staircase.  At the bottom are farm buildings, and at the top are living quarters and a chapel of the 16th century.  The castle is surrounded by a moat through which a drawbridge is thrown. </p><h2>  Be sure to try </h2><p>  No less popular than the medieval citadel and the church on the island, the local cake "flint rubber" enjoys.  This ridiculous name translates as "cut off a piece of souffle."  The local delicacy is a puff pastry with a layer of custard.  Arriving for a vacation on Lake Bled, be sure to try this cake.  The most delicious is served in the coffee house of the Park Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays on the lake Bled Slovenia" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/973527.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainments </h2><p>  Smooth boats and noisy motorboats or <span>water scooters</span> do not plow the expanse of the lake <span>.</span>  It takes care of the environment.  Lake Bled reviews are called "amazingly clean", "crystal", "pristine."  However, it annually hosts international <span>rowing competitions.</span>  There are so many fish in the waters of the lake that it fearlessly wipes itself on the bodies of swimmers.  The shores are dotted with tennis courts and golf courses.  For people far from sports, a concert hall, casino and entertainment center are built. </p>
