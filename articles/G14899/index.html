  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Night club "Indigo", Kiev. Description, Features, Location</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For those who love a quality and ambitious vacation in the capital of Ukraine, an amazing and unique night club was opened - Indigo.  In Kiev, he has no analogues - this is the very place where you can see the symbiosis of modern dance, music, relaxation and, of course, delicious European cuisine.  For those who have not visited this wonderful place, we have prepared the following information. </p><p>  First of all, we note that the night club "Indigo" in Kiev is four floors in the literal sense of the word.  On each of them there is one or another designated area for entertainment.  Let's start from the lower floors and go up. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="50.43502723302277" data-lng="30.490584569311523" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/9/3/6/15936.png"></div><h2>  Ground floor </h2><p>  Its entire space is occupied by a magnificent restaurant.  Aged in the best European traditions, and this applies to both service and cuisine, it is gaining more and more popularity every year.  Exceptionally high cuisine is presented here, many interesting recipes from the countries of Europe and Asia are borrowed.  With all this, the atmosphere of the institution adjusts to an intimate and secluded mood, allows you to relax as much as possible and enjoy the evening and delicious food.  The restaurant at the Indigo nightclub in Kiev is a place that both locals and visitors like to visit.  You can meet celebrities and very powerful people there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="tomato.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indigo Restaurant and Terrace" class="if uuid-3157718" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157718.jpg"></div><h2>  Second level </h2><p>  The lounge area is in its purest form.  It is presented to us as a hall in which the audience can sit on comfortable sofas for the sake of enjoying beautiful music and delicious cocktails.  A feature of this level - hookahs of the highest quality - how can a moment of true relaxation do without them!  Many visit the second floor of the Indigo nightclub in Kiev after enjoying the gastronomic delights on the first.  Here you can relax after a busy day (or week) and relax your body and soul. </p><div class="photo" data-original="topclub.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indigo lounge area" class="if uuid-3157726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157726.jpg"></div><h2>  On the third floor </h2><p>  Well, here the soul sings in the literal sense of the word.  This is a karaoke bar that is equipped to the latest standards and equipped with an incredibly extensive music library.  The atmosphere of this level of the club is simply amazing - here you can not only sing heartily, but also make "vocal acquaintances", sing in a duet or even in a choir.  At the same time, we note that karaoke at the Indigo nightclub in Kiev is not a ‚Äúcollective farm‚Äù establishment at all.  There is no place for fights and drunken antics - your vacation will be definitely civilian and enjoyable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="indigo-project.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indigo karaoke bar" class="if uuid-3157721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157721.jpg"></div><h2>  Dance until you drop! </h2><p>  Having risen to the very top of the Indigo nightclub in Kiev, it becomes clear why it is so popular among young people.  This is incredibly fashionable, innovative, atmospheric and simply amazing space for a night break!  It is worth emphasizing that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe club is relatively small - this is not a hangar where a million people can fit.  The club is quite comfortable and modest in size, which can not be said about its design.  It is decorated in white tones, and at the same time the violet-blue illumination creates the feeling that you are in a secret oceanic grotto, where the light is refracted from the water to the walls of the cave. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geometria.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indigo Night Club" class="if uuid-3157720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157720.jpg"></div><p>  The repertoire of the Indigo night club in Kiev is a special topic.  Nowhere are there such establishments that could please their visitors with such modern, dance and truly relaxing music.  The hall is also equipped with a stage where artists can perform.  Often in this institution are fashion shows. </p><h2>  Geolocation </h2><p>  In contrast to the pathos without due justification, which are located in the center of the Ukrainian capital, the Indigo night club is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe railway station.  In fact, from the station itself (south exit) you can walk to it in 5 minutes.  To be more precise, the address of the institution is 3 Kudryashova Street. </p><p>  So we found out where the Indigo night club in Kiev is located, what is its peculiarity and advantage, and why it is this institution that is chosen not only by local residents, but also by foreigners who leave very flattering reviews about it. </p>
