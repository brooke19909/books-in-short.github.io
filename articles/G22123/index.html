Ways, features of work and professional advice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Programmers are specialists who are in demand on the labor market.  It is not surprising that this particular direction is gaining unprecedented popularity among young people.  They are often hired by companies that develop software.  The question of how much programmers earn is of interest to many.  However, we will talk about this a little later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jobboerse-direkt.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="programmer in Russia" class="if uuid-3080543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080543.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  The range of work performed by programmers is so wide that all representatives of the profession were divided into several specializations. </p><ul><li>  system ones that work with operating systems; </li><li>  application programs that create various programs, including games; </li><li>  web programmers working on creating websites and all kinds of add-ons to ensure their smooth operation. <div class="photo" data-original="www.welt.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do programmers earn" class="if uuid-3080545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080545.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  In addition, when searching for vacancies in the list of requirements, one can often notice an enumeration of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat a potential candidate should speak.  By the way, it also depends on how much a programmer earns per month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The profession has two important features: </p><ul><li>  demand; </li><li>  ongoing training. </li></ul><h2>  Demand </h2><p>  The features of working as a programmer are such that this profession opens up quite attractive prospects.  It is not surprising that among modern applicants, many who wish to choose this direction.  The advantage of the profession, for example, is that the programmer is not tied to whereabouts.  He can remotely collaborate with large companies, even if he lives in the Russian outback.  Training can also be done remotely. </p><h2>  Ongoing training </h2><p>  Another feature is that programming knowledge quickly becomes obsolete.  That is why the employee has to constantly undergo additional training in order to prove his own professional suitability.  This pace of work is not suitable for everyone, so only the most persistent people continue to ask how to earn money for a programmer.  This profession does not tolerate random people. </p><h2>  How much does a programmer earn in Russia? </h2><p>  If you believe the average statistics, specialists earn seventy thousand rubles.  Given the fact that this indicator exceeds the average Russian salary by half, it is not surprising that this vacancy is highly demanded among applicants. </p><p>  However, much depends on the specific field of activity. </p><ol><li>  Application developers are paid an average of ten to twenty-five thousand rubles a month. </li><li>  Developers of sites and applications for them - from thirty thousand rubles. </li><li>  1C programmers earn from sixty thousand rubles. </li><li>  The salary of leading experts can amount to hundreds of thousands of rubles. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="copypast.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how programmers earn" class="if uuid-3080549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080549.jpg"></div><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  You need to understand that the salary of a programmer depends on many factors.  Among the applicants there is high competition.  For this reason, for high earnings, it is not enough to have a specialized education and to be well versed in computer technology.  This is the level of a novice specialist whose salary is unlikely to exceed twenty-five thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to earn a novice programmer?  When asking this question, you need to understand that for several years you need to build experience, giving income a secondary importance.  Even after three years of work, a programmer is able to double his own reward.  However, choosing the path of the pursuit of profit and not devoting enough time to gain experience, you can even at the same ten years be at the same income level as the novice specialist. </p><p>  When asking a question how to earn a programmer, it is important to consider his place of work.  Some experienced professionals prefer to work directly with customers, earning more than employees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="copypast.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="monthly salary" class="if uuid-3080551" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080551.jpg"></div><p>  Some of the most ambitious are developing their own projects, receiving high profits that are not available even to top specialists.  As an example, we cite the founder of VKontakte, whose monthly income is more than one and a half million rubles. </p><h2>  How to make money to a programmer? </h2><p>  Let's look at the most popular options available to specialists in this field. </p><ol><li>  Permanent job. </li><li>  Telework. </li><li>  Own project. </li></ol><h2>  Permanent job </h2><p>  This option is the simplest and available to absolutely all applicants who have a specialized education.  Even as a student, you can get an internship at a company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  So, the essence of self-employment is quite simple.  You can start a career with little-known companies and low pay.  Further increasing their own experience and value in the labor market, it is easier to choose employers with more loyal working conditions and wages.  Career growth can turn a novice specialist into a leader whose salary is several times higher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.spigo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="novice programmer" class="if uuid-3080552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080552.jpg"></div><h2>  Telework </h2><p>  This is one of the options for those who for some reason do not fit hired work.  However, in this case, you need to be prepared to independently search for orders, negotiate with customers, etc. </p><p>  For remote employees, reputation plays a big role.  That is why it is so important to carry out orders efficiently, collect reviews from satisfied customers and replenish the portfolio. </p><p>  It is equally important to be able to make professional contacts.  The more people know about you, the more orders can be attracted in this way. </p><p>  When choosing a remote work for yourself, it is important to decide whether you will fulfill one-time orders or want to have a permanent employer.  Each of the options has its own advantages.  In the first case, the employee receives more freedom of action, and in the second - the absence of the need to spend time and effort on attracting customers. </p><p>  Now you know how to earn a novice programmer.  After all, you can start to execute orders remotely even without a specialized education.  On the market, your real skills are appreciated, which some manage to get without a diploma of an educational institution. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.purus.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to earn a novice programmer" class="if uuid-3080554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080554.jpg"></div><h2>  Own project </h2><p>  This option is considered the most difficult.  However, it is he who, if successfully implemented, promises the greatest profit to the potential programmer. </p><p>  You need to understand that creating your own project has many pitfalls, which are best known in advance.  It is incredibly difficult to achieve initial success.  Indeed, at first the project requires impressive investments, while no one guarantees their payback. </p><p>  That is why true professionals who have enough experience and knowledge to implement it choose their own project.  Should I start my own project? </p><p>  Considering options for how to make money for a programmer, opening your own project seems the most profitable.  However, behind potential opportunities lies an impressive investment not only of funds, but also of time and effort. </p><p>  That is why it is better to start your own project, having some financial stability.  For example, in the form of the main place of work.  At the same time, you can do your own development in your free time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how programmers earn" class="if uuid-3080560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/3080560.jpg"></div><h2>  Potential risks </h2><p>  What you need to know before deciding to develop your own project? </p><ol><li>  Instability.  There are many offers from young specialists on the market.  The number of ideas abounds, so it is possible that competitors will be able to get around you.  And all costs will be in vain. </li><li>  Self discipline.  If your bosses control you in hired work, and if there are clear deadlines, then in the case of your own project there is nothing of the kind.  This creates the illusion that you can not work at all.  If you devote only free time to the project, you are constantly tempted to distract yourself from something.  That's why you need to have incredible self-discipline and be able to set priorities correctly.  If you want to succeed, set clear goals for yourself and try to complete them as quickly as possible. </li><li>  Financial difficulties.  If you do not have stable work and deal only with your own project, you must certainly collect the initial capital.  The first time the project requires costs, while not making a profit.  Not every programmer can afford such a whim. </li></ol><p>  Now you know how programmers earn.  The labor market is replete with offers.  However, do not forget about the high competition among specialists.  To be a sought-after programmer, you need not to stop your own training, even if you have long become a specialist.  That is why the profession of a programmer is not suitable for everyone, despite the fact that it allows you to earn in various ways, including the development of a unique project. </p>
