Photo, of course, will not convey the beauty of the landscape.  In terms of staffing, there were no complaints either.  Everything that is stated on the site is available in the room.  Many people note comfort, good furniture in the rooms of the Yalta-Intourist Hotel.  Reviews of dissatisfied vacationers bring their fly in the ointment in this idyll.

    <p>  Almost everyone likes food.  At least there were no negative reviews on the network.  People were delighted with the delicious dishes.  Even the parents of the little ones and ‚Äúnot well‚Äù noted that the children did not leave the restaurant hungry. </p><p>  Very few negative reviews about the work of hotel staff.  This is despite the large number of guests.  From the administrator to the maid - everyone is ready to help, tell what interests the guest.  Vacationers with children are very pleased with the work of the animators. </p><p>  Between September and December 2015, you can read reviews regarding repair work.  Constant noise from drills and rotary hammers is not the best accompaniment for relaxation.  Another reason for writing unpleasant reviews was a power outage in the Crimea.  People complained of outright fraud or misunderstanding between the hotel staff and guests. </p><h2>  Beach Hotels: reviews </h2><p>  The private beach of the closed type has the Yalta-Intourist Hotel.  The photo below demonstrates its staffing with umbrellas and sunbeds.  An interesting feature is the ability to go down to the beach with an elevator in 1 minute.  <span>Shade canopies,</span> sun loungers, toilets, changing rooms are included in the room rate. </p><p>  On the beach you can not only passively relax, but also have fun playing table tennis and slippery football.  Animation and a playground are developed.  Vacationers are recommended to visit the aquarium. </p><p>  Rental of water transport and equipment is open. </p><p>  In general, the impressions of the beach are positive: clean, well-groomed, with developed infrastructure.  Some people do not like the pebble embankment on the beach, but soon they promised to make a sand zone. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the hotel </h2><p>  Massandra Park leaves no one indifferent.  It is saturated greens and clean air.  The territory is constantly monitored: exotic trees and bushes are cleaned, trimmed, and vegetation is looked after.  Near the entrance to the hotel is a small pond with swans and large fish.  A little further there is a fountain.  At night, the building is beautifully lit. </p><h2>  Payment system </h2><p>  The entire territory of the Yalta-Intourist Hotel has its own payment system.  You can pay in bars and restaurants located on the territory of the hotel complex only with special cards or a chip built into the bracelet.  For many, this seems convenient.  However, there are those who consider this simply a waste of time upon arrival. </p>
