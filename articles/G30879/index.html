However, at the junction of the twenties and thirties, the aircraft fleet was composed of imported aircraft.  And Russian aircraft were represented only by the created ANT-2 and ANT-9 produced by the Tupolev Design Bureau.  The problems of aircraft of the Red Army in those days were: <br><br>  - outdated models of devices; <br><br>  - poor technical condition of the aircraft; <br><br>  - lack of uniformity (a large spread of models and brands did not allow to optimize the spare parts base).

The task of the Secretary General of Stalin to create <span>modern aviation was</span> carried out <span>.</span>  In the mid-thirties there were test flights of the first Soviet bomber, hidden under a civilian transport ship.  The first Russian aircraft, which then participated in the fighting of the Second World War, was prepared by such aviators as Levanevsky, Vodopyanov, Grizodubov, etc.

Also, M-25 engines with an air-cooled capacity of 715 <span>horsepower</span> and 750 M-horsepower M-100 engines using an aqueous cooling system were developed and put into operation.  The maximum flight altitude also increased and amounted to 14-15 thousand meters.  Aircraft acquired a more streamlined shape, the air resistance of the devices decreased.  The growth in production has spurred the introduction of stamping and stream casting. </p><p>  By 1941, of the fighter aircraft developed in the Soviet Union, Mig, Yak and LAGG were considered the most successful.  IL-2 was recognized as problematic, which was constantly modified.  According to the Clear Sky strategy, it was planned to release about 100,000 SU-2 aircraft, for which an unprecedented call was made into the air forces. </p><h2>  Start of war </h2>

In the first year and a half, German aviation dominated the Soviet.  Aircraft I-15, I-16 significantly lost the latest fascist ‚ÄúMesserschmidt‚Äù and ‚ÄúJunkers‚Äù.  Sometimes, even on outdated aircraft, it was possible to achieve victories in air duels.  In a month, Russian planes destroyed about 1300 German air units. <br>  After six months of hostilities, aircraft production fell almost four times.  This was due to the fact that the Germans came close to Moscow, and had to evacuate significant production facilities that were engaged in the production of parts for the aircraft industry.  Therefore, in 1941, the plan for the production of all types of military aircraft was completed only by 40 percent.

    <p>  With the launch of the evacuated enterprises, the situation improved significantly, and by 1944, about 100 military vehicles received airfields daily.  Upgrade received absolutely all models.  Of the improved ones, it is worth highlighting the Yak-3, LA-5, IL-10, PE-2, Yak-9. </p><p>  <span>The growth rate</span> can be tracked by year: </p><p>  - 1942 - 25,400 cars. </p><p>  - 1943 - 34,900 cars. </p><p>  - 1944 - 40 300 cars. </p><p>  By 1944, the Soviet Union surpassed fascist Germany in the number of aircraft 2.7 times.  One factor was the build speed.  The design of our fighters was significantly more primitive than that of German and American manufacturers.  Of course, the quality of manufactured aviation products was not always in favor of the Soviet aviation industry. </p><h2>  Russian planes of the Second World War.  SU-2 </h2>

Initially, the aircraft was called the ‚Äúnear bomber-1‚Äù and was produced with the M-88 engine with a capacity of 1,100 horsepower.  Su-2 was produced at three plants.  The flight speed of the Su-2 is over 490 km / h, and the flight altitude was 6000 meters.  On board were placed 6 machine guns.  The bomb load of the SU-2 varied.

    <p>  SU-2 is one of the first bombers to enter the war.  Carried out a variety of tasks.  Subsequently, it was modernized in SU-4. </p><h2>  Yak-9 </h2><p>  Of the fighters participating in the Second World War, it is worth highlighting this particular model.  Even if you compare the photo of Russian aircraft, the Yak-9 has its own external style.  It was developed in 1942.  The base was the Yak-7b fighter.  By replacing the wooden parts with aluminum, the weight of the fighter was significantly reduced.  The armament on board consisted of a <span>heavy machine gun</span> and one gun.  The aircraft had excellent aerobatic qualities, maneuvered well and was easily controllable.  He also beat previous models at <span>maximum speed</span> and range.  These figures were a record for all 1944 class aircraft.  All these properties made it possible to adequately fight the leading military aircraft of the enemy. <br>  The production of the aircraft was carried out several more years after the end of hostilities.  And in total about 16800 combat vehicles in several modifications were produced. </p>
