This is especially true for Apple phones and tablets.  This manufacturer has made sure that in case of loss or theft of devices, it is possible to reset data and lock devices.  Just not everyone knows how to cope with a similar task.  Usually, an Apple ID is used for this.  Unfortunately, a password and e-mail are required to work with this item.  And this information is sometimes forgotten by the owner of the "apple" device.  Today we will be interested in resetting Apple ID.  Why and when is this operation used?  What to do if a person has forgotten his Apple ID, password or answers to security questions?  How to fix the situation?  And is it possible to cope with such a task?  In the end, every owner of an "apple" device should be able to understand all this. </p><h2>  Apple ID is ... </h2><p>  But what is Apple ID?  This, as already mentioned, is an extremely important component for working with Apple products. </p><p>  Apple ID - The name of the apple account.  It is used to work with the options of Apple smartphones and tablets.  Without it, you can neither get to make a purchase, nor go to a cloud service, nor protect your device from theft. </p><p>  To work with Apple ID, you need to register a new profile.  It will store data and account settings.  To pass authorization in the system, you will have to use a password and e-mail.  Unfortunately, such data is sometimes forgotten.  And in such cases, you have to reset the Apple ID.  How to activate a similar option? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to reset security questions" class="if uuid-2882193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882193.jpg"></div><h2>  Reset reasons </h2><p>  The answer directly depends on the life situation.  Resetting your Apple ID may be required for various reasons.  The further algorithm of actions depends on them. </p><p>  Most often, the mentioned operation is performed if: </p><ul><li>  the person has forgotten the password of Apple ID; </li><li>  forgotten answers to security questions account; </li><li>  no access to e-mail from Apple ID; </li><li>  The phone has been lost or stolen. </li></ul><p>  In addition, resetting your Apple ID may come in handy for those who plan to transfer their mobile device to another person.  For example, before selling it.  Otherwise, the new owner of the "apple" device will have serious problems. </p><h2>  Ways to recover data and reset it </h2><p>  Resetting your Apple ID on iPhone can be done in different ways.  And the user always has to start from the situation that has arisen.  Otherwise, serious problems may arise with the implementation of the task. </p><p>  Here are all the ways to restore and reset Apple ID: </p><ul><li>  via iCloud (on the device); </li><li>  via iCloud and the option "Find iPhone"; </li><li>  using the password recovery form (by e-mail or security questions); </li><li>  By contacting Apple Tech Support by mail </li><li>  through the call center "Apple"; </li><li>  by re-linking the profile to another mail. </li></ul><p>  In reality, everything is simpler than it seems.  Next, we will try to learn all of the listed methods for resetting Apple ID.  Usually, the real owner of a phone / tablet does not have any problems with implementing the idea.  But the iPhone found in practice is impossible to reset.  Any attempts to achieve this will lead to the blocking of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  From phone </h2><p>  Resetting your Apple ID on iPhone is the easiest.  Usually it takes place when an authorization in another profile is required on the "apple" device.  For example, before selling a smartphone or tablet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="iwiki.su" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open password recovery form" class="if uuid-2882199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882199.jpg"></div><p>  To reset Apple ID, it is recommended that you proceed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the "Settings" main menu item. </li><li>  Tap on the line "iTunes Store, App Store ...". </li><li>  Click on the inscription Apple ID. </li><li>  Select the Exit command. </li><li>  Confirm the operation. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Now you can log in to your new account!  There is nothing difficult or incomprehensible in this.  A similar reset of Apple ID is not so common.  Usually you have to restore accounts due to forgotten authorization data.  This is a more serious task. </p><h2>  Change settings - work with the site </h2><p>  Resetting the Apple ID can be done by unlinking the account from the selected e-mail.  In this case, the old email is exempted from the "apple" identifier.  So, you can register Apple ID again at one or another address. </p><p>  To reassign Apple ID, you can use either the official Apple page or iTunes.  Let's start with the first scenario.  It is considered the least problematic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="iphonegeek.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reset Apple ID from phone" class="if uuid-2882197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882197.jpg"></div><p>  Instructions for changing Apple ID e-mail look like this: </p><ol><li>  Open the official Apple page in any Internet browser. </li><li>  Log in to your Apple ID. </li><li>  Click on the inscription "Manage ...". </li><li>  Scroll through your account settings and click on the "Change" link near the email address. </li><li>  Specify a new e-mail for binding. </li><li>  Confirm action. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it‚Äôs clear how email can be freed up for the new Apple ID. </p><h2>  Rebinding with iTunes </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Apple ID re-binding can be done using iTunes.  Usually, such an operation takes place if a person remembers the password and email address from the "apple" account.  In the course of the actions, Apple ID will be unlinked from e-mail.  This is a very useful and convenient option. </p><p>  In order to use it, a person has to: </p><ol><li>  Connect Apple device to PC.  For example, using a USB cable. </li><li>  Turn on iTunes and wait for the devices to sync. </li><li>  Go to the iTunes Store and choose one or another account. </li><li>  Click on "Details ...". </li><li>  Change the address of the email account used for authorization in the corresponding field. </li></ol><p>  As soon as the parameters are saved, you can use the new data for authorization in Apple ID.  This is a kind of reset "apple" account. </p><h2>  Recovery form </h2><p>  But what if you need to reset your Apple ID without a password?  Can this be done?  Yes, but you have to try.  Typically, this scenario is called resetting the account password or recovering data for authorization.  You can carry out the corresponding manipulations both from a smartphone and from a computer.  We focus on the second trick.  It is considered more convenient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="macnoob.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Authorization Issues with Apple ID" class="if uuid-2882198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882198.jpg"></div><p>  To reset your iPhone password (Apple ID), you will need: </p><ol><li>  Open the Apple homepage. </li><li>  Click on the link "Forgot your Apple ID or password?". </li><li>  Specify the email address to which the Apple account is associated. </li><li>  Choose a method of data recovery.  The system will offer to carry out the procedure by e-mail or through security questions.  Let's start with the first scenario. </li><li>  Open the mail that is used to enter Apple ID. </li><li>  Read an Apple tech support email.  It will contain a hyperlink with the words "Reset Password".  You need to click on it. </li></ol><p>  A new tab opens in the browser.  It will display the password reset form.  You need to specify a new password for the account and repeat it. </p><h2>  test questions </h2><p>  You will have to act a little differently if you need to reset your Apple ID through security questions.  Usually the user needs: </p><ol><li>  Repeat the first three steps from the previous manual. </li><li>  Check the "Security Questions" section. </li><li>  Give answers to several questions asked. </li><li>  Submit a processing request. </li><li>  Create a new password, and then write it twice in the recovery form specially created for this. </li></ol><p>  Fast, easy and very convenient.  Only such a technique is not used too often. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iphones.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Password reset using questions" class="if uuid-2882195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882195.jpg"></div><h2>  Reset questions </h2><p>  The data for authorization in Apple ID needs to be remembered.  Otherwise, the user will have serious problems, especially when trying to restore the account.  Resetting Apple ID questions is an operation we'll review later.  It will help to always support at least one way to restore the "password" if necessary.  There is nothing difficult to achieve the desired goal.  As with password recovery, Apple ID security questions are reset from both the phone and the computer. </p><p>  In order to achieve the desired goal using a PC, you will have to: </p><ol><li>  Look at the official Apple ID website and select the "Forgot your password?" </li><li>  Specify Apple ID. </li><li>  Check the box next to "I want to reset security questions." </li><li>  Click on the continue button. </li><li>  Enter your Apple ID password in the box that appears. </li><li>  Follow the onscreen instructions.  Appropriate actions will help establish the identity of the user. </li><li>  Select new control questions in the form that appears, and then give them one or another answer. </li><li>  Click the "Continue" button. </li></ol><p>  At this stage, you can complete the reset procedure for Apple ID questions.  If you did not succeed in identifying a person in the process of translating the idea into reality, you will not succeed in coping with the task.  This is quite normal. </p><h2>  Device recovery form </h2><p>  Resetting the Apple ID on the iPhone, as we have said, is a minimum of hassle.  It's hard to believe, but with a mobile device, you can restore the password and change the security questions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ipsillon.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Account Security Questions" class="if uuid-2882196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882196.jpg"></div><p>  To achieve the desired result, you need: </p><ol><li>  Open "Settings" on your smartphone or tablet. </li><li>  Take a look at the iTunes, App Store. </li><li>  Tap on the inscription Apple ID. </li><li>  Select the "iForgot" option. </li><li>  Indicate your Apple ID, and then select one or another team.  For example, "Reset Password" or "Reset Security Questions." </li><li>  Follow the instructions on the screen.  You can use the previously learned instructions. </li></ol><p>  But what if you need to reset your Apple ID without an iPhone?  This is a more serious problem, especially for those who do not know how to behave. </p><h2>  Option "Find iPhone". </h2><p>  For example, you can resort to the help of the service "Find iPhone".  If this option was initially enabled on a mobile device, a person will be able to remotely reset his identifier.  This technique helps to avoid data theft when losing your phone / tablet. </p><p>  Instructions for resetting Apple ID via iCloud looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to iCloud.com. </li><li>  Log in to the system. </li><li>  Click on the button that says "Find iPhone." </li><li>  Select your "apple" device in the list at the top of the screen. </li><li>  Click on the words "Erase ...". </li><li>  Confirm the action by entering the password for Apple ID. </li><li>  Wait for the operation to complete. </li></ol><p>  As practice shows, after that the data on the included device will be erased.  Nothing is clear, difficult or supernatural.  The main thing is to enable the "Find iPhone" function on your "apple" device in advance. </p><h2>  We write in support </h2><p>  Resetting an iPhone without an Apple ID is possible in practice.  Especially if you prepare for this operation in advance.  Suppose a person bought an ‚Äúapple‚Äù device and only then discovered that someone else‚Äôs account was enabled on the device. </p><p>  In this case, it is recommended to write Apple technical support.  For example, through the feedback form on the website or by email.  Consider the second sentence. </p><p>  To reset your apple account using support, you need: </p><ol><li>  Take a picture of the purchase of the device. </li><li>  Take a photo on which the smartphone / tablet will be displayed, as well as a box from it (sticker up) and a receipt for the payment of the device. </li><li>  Generate a letter for technical support, in the text of which you will have to describe the situation in detail. </li><li>  Upload the taken photos to the message. </li><li>  Send the reset request to Apple tech support. </li><li>  Wait for an answer. </li></ol><p>  Now it remains to expect a response letter from technical support.  Usually it comes within 10-15 days.  If you can prove that the phone belongs to the applicant, you can reset the Apple ID. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ibobr.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Full reset Apple ID" class="if uuid-2882200" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2882200.jpg"></div><h2>  Call center </h2><p>  But that is not all.  The last trick that can help in this situation is to reset the Apple ID on the iPhone through the telephone support service. </p><p>  To cope with the task, you have to: </p><ol><li>  Prepare a check and documents confirming the purchase of the "apple" device. </li><li>  Call Apple Technical Support. </li><li>  Wait for an answer and outline the situation for the operator. </li><li>  Identify yourself and wait for the reset of your Apple ID account.  Usually, the recovery / reset form is sent to the caller‚Äôs e-mail. </li></ol><p>  Resetting your Apple ID password as well as resetting your account as a whole is not so difficult! </p>
