There is no shortage of clean towels or hygiene products.  They also praise the kitchen - every day the tables literally burst with an abundance and variety of dishes, and each, even the most fastidious client, will be able to choose something suitable for himself. </p><p>  An undoubted advantage of the hotel is its direct access to the beach, which is considered a rarity in Antalya.  The beach here is really clean and well maintained, although the water in the sea is sometimes cold. </p><p>  On the other hand, not all hotel staff speak Russian, so it‚Äôs worth learning at least a few English phrases.  But even despite the <span>language barrier,</span> workers are always polite and willing to help. </p><p>  In fact, many tourists choose the hotel Maritim Hotel Club Alantur 5. as a temporary refuge. Alanya, Kestel in particular, is a great place for a relaxing family holiday and complete relaxation. </p>
