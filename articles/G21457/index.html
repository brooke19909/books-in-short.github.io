  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY doll clothes patterns, interesting ideas, recommendations and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For most girls, a doll is a toy and a loyal friend.  Which, like a person, needs care.  That is why the girls are trying to provide her with all the essentials: clothes, furniture, a house, a dog and even a handsome groom.  That's just all these delights are very expensive, and some parents can not or do not want to spend a lot of money on such nonsense, preferring to buy something tasty for the baby. </p><p>  However, such a circumstance does not force the doll to wear what it was brought from the store, or to sleep not in its own house, but somewhere on the floor.  After all, there are a huge number of detailed and very simple workshops that will help you independently do all the necessary things for your pet.  For example, in this article we will find out how to make clothes for dolls with our own hands. </p><h2>  What is important to know at the preparatory stage? </h2><p>  The first and probably the most important question that precedes an interesting creative process should arise at the preparatory stage.  After all, we all are well aware that people are significantly different in complexion.  But do not forget that dolls come in different models.  And the size of their clothes also depends on this.  For example, clothes for a Baby Bon doll will be very large for a Barbie doll.  In addition, the first type of darling is positioned by the manufacturer as a baby doll.  While Barbie is a fashionista with a model appearance. </p><p>  That is why, before proceeding to the study and execution of phased clothes for dolls with their own hands, we recommend spending some time and sorting out the dimensions of the pet.  So how do you measure the doll?  According to the reviews of beginner needlewomen, you can simply put your favorite on paper, outline its outline with a pencil, and then finally finalize the details.  However, this method is often used when sewing clothes for a baby doll or another, more like a child than an adult.  After all, every Barbie, like a real woman, has a decollete zone.  That is why the above method of taking measurements is not suitable for her - clothes may simply not fit. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For this reason, experienced needlewomen write different advice in the reviews.  If they are going to sew clothes for dolls with their own hands, they prefer to take measurements from their darling in the same way as they would do with a person.  And then we will tell you in detail how to still determine the size of the doll. </p><h2>  How to take measurements with a pet? </h2><p>  In order to identify the correct testimony, we will have to undress the doll.  After that, prepare a centimeter, paper and pen.  When all the necessary manipulations have been completed, we boldly move on to measuring our pet.  And you can do this together with your daughter.  She will certainly take part in such an interesting and previously unfamiliar process with great pleasure. </p><p>  So, we break to take measurements from the doll: </p><ol><li>  We put it on the back and measure the growth from the heels to the top of the head.  Then we write the resulting value on a piece of paper. </li><li>  Then note the distance from the heels to the neck, waist and base of the doll‚Äôs legs.  Each new testimony is necessarily transferred to paper, so as not to forget or confuse with the pattern of details of clothes for the doll with their own hands. </li><li>  Next we need to determine the length of the sleeve.  To do this, we measure, necessarily through the elbow, the length of the arm from the shoulder to the wrist.  And also write down the resulting figure. </li><li>  After using a centimeter, we reveal the width of the chest and back, as well as the circumference of the torso and waist.  The first two values ‚Äã‚Äãare obtained by measuring the distance between the hands of the pet, front and back.  The third - taking measurements from the body of the doll strictly under the arms raised up.  And the last - measuring the narrowest part of the pet's body. </li><li>  Do not forget to determine the circumference of the hips and the widest part of the leg.  And by all means we record readings on a piece of paper. </li><li>  Then go to the hand.  We measure the girth of the shoulder part (under the arm) and the wrist or, if the doll has splayed fingers or, conversely, fingers clenched into a fist, then the brush itself. </li><li>  The last value, which is also important to determine, is the girth of the head.  It should be measured by finding the widest part. </li></ol><h2>  We sew panties and a blouse for a big doll </h2><p>  We already said earlier that if you want, you can make absolutely any clothes for dolls with your own hands.  In the current paragraph, we offer the reader to cut and sew an interesting set that will decorate not only a large doll, but also a miniature Barbie.  Indeed, depending on what materials it will be made of and how it will be decorated, it will be happy to try on both a baby doll and a styled doll. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew clothes for dolls" class="if uuid-2461727" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461727.jpg"></div><p>  Make it very simple.  If you correctly take measurements from your favorite and fit the proposed pattern, you will be able to create a real masterpiece.  Moreover, many needlewomen in the reviews claim that it is not at all necessary to buy new material for him.  Interesting clothes for dolls, do it yourself easily from old clothes.  It all depends on the creative abilities of the needlewoman and the little helper. </p><h2>  We sew a dress for a doll </h2><p>  Of course, the most important clothing for any girl, including a toy one, is a dress.  Moreover, each fashionista should have at least four outfits of this kind: a casual option, a business one, for meeting friends and going on dates.  That is why, looking at patterns of clothes for dolls and with your own hands about to sew an outfit, you should not forget about the one that will help to sew the original dress. </p><p>  For this reason, we invite the reader to pay attention to the following picture. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="doll clothes at home" class="if uuid-2461728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461728.jpg"></div><p>  It presents a pattern of the simplest doll dress, which, if desired, can be complicated and supplemented with various decor elements, play with the theme of the outfit, and think over the color and small attributes.  So that the darling really looked in her own clothes for dolls Baby Bon, Barbie or Monster High, like a queen. </p><h2>  Dress in a retro style for an elegant Barbie </h2><p>  We have already repeatedly mentioned that Barbie dolls are real fashionistas.  That is why every pet can never do without a dress in retro style.  We propose his pattern further. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make doll clothes" class="if uuid-2461729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461729.jpg"></div><h2>  Sheath Dress for Barbie </h2><p>  Stylists insistently insist that the famous sheath dress must certainly settle in the wardrobe of a self-respecting fashionista.  That is why it should also be sewn for Barbie.  How to do it?  Very simple!  A detailed <span>pattern of clothes for dolls,</span> created <span>with your own hands</span> , presented below, will help to understand the technology. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="dress for barbie doll" class="if uuid-2461732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461732.jpg"></div><h2>  Business suit for Barbie </h2><p>  Most girls perceive their darling as a real person who needs various outfits.  After all, no one knows what situation the doll will fall into tomorrow.  Perhaps the hostess decides that it is time for her to get a job? </p><p>  That is why needlewomen in reviews recommend preparing an elegant business suit.  It can be made of traditional black color or sewn from fabric of bright colors.  For example, Barbie with blond hair looks interesting in a red suit.  For a red beast, a suit of green tone is suitable.  And for a brunette - rich blue. </p><p>  Regardless of what color the needlewoman will stop at, she will need a pattern of clothes for the doll with her own hands for beginners.  And we will introduce it further.  It remains only to consider and fit the pet size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern clothes for dolls" class="if uuid-2461733" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461733.jpg"></div><h2>  Jacket with a hood and boots for a doll </h2><p>  In the fictional world where Barbie or another doll lives and enjoys, the weather is also prone to change.  That is why the mistress cannot provide her pet with exceptionally light things.  Indeed, if it rains outside, the doll will either have to sit at home until the weather improves again. </p><p>  For this reason, in the current paragraph, we invite our reader to consider and sew the original autumn jacket for a Barbie doll, Monster High or another fashionista.  In addition to it, we recommend making boots so that the doll is not only warm, but also joyful at the beauty that is worn on it. </p><p>  So, the pattern and version of finished products can be seen in the photo below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes for dolls step by step" class="if uuid-2461734" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461734.jpg"></div><h2>  Elegant coat for a stylish doll </h2><p>  If we are talking about warm clothes for Barbie dolls, it is very simple to make it with your own hands.  And further it will also be possible to verify this.  Having carefully studied the proposed pattern of a fashionable coat, it will certainly be possible to sew it yourself at home.  You just need to show a little perseverance and do not forget to fit the pattern shown in the next photo to your doll. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="outfit for barbie" class="if uuid-2461731" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461731.jpg"></div><h2>  Casual outfit for a pet </h2><p>  What other clothes for Barbie dolls do you need to do with your own hands?  About this also in the reviews of needlewomen write a lot.  After all, we mentioned that the doll can go for a walk or go on a picnic with friends.  And to put on an elegant dress for this occasion will be completely wrong.  Firstly, it is inconvenient.  And, secondly, the beloved doll is a reflection of the girl herself.  In addition, as experienced needlewomen write in reviews, thanks to a game with a favorite, the baby forms her own taste, learns to divide clothes into home, everyday, business and other. </p><p>  For this reason, the task of the mother is to make sure that the darling of the daughter has an everyday outfit.  For example, an original loose-fitting T-shirt and bright leggings.  Pattern of both wardrobe items will be presented below.  And if you supplement them with beautiful sneakers that can be sewn by slightly finalizing the pattern of boots, then the doll will become the most fashionable and stylish Barbie among all her friends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="outfit for dolls at home" class="if uuid-2461735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461735.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, by the same principle it is very easy to sew clothes for textile dolls with your own hands.  Especially if the mother also made a favorite herself.  After all, then she can take the doll‚Äôs pattern as a basis and not suffer, taking measurements from her. </p><h2>  Monster High Doll Outfit </h2><p>  Recently, girls have been provoking intense interest in dolls that do not at all look like a beautiful, slender and well-groomed Barbie.  They differ in unusual skin color, strange hairstyles, unusual makeup.  And this is not surprising, because the Monster High dolls are children of famous monsters.  For example, Cleo de Nile is the daughter of a mummy, Lagoon Blue is a sea monster, and Gulia Yelps is a zombie.  That is why it‚Äôs a big mistake to choose for them the usual patterns of clothes for dolls (for beginners to create such outfits with their own hands). </p><p>  Therefore, further we propose to consider two interesting monster outfits.  For Amanita - the daughter of a rare flower and Neferu - the elder sister Cleo de Nile.  These stylish costumes will certainly be appreciated by both the daughter and her darlings.  Well, mom will be able to execute them thanks to a simple and detailed pattern of <span>clothes for Monster High dolls with her own hands.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes for monster high" class="if uuid-2461736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461736.jpg"></div><h2>  Bunny Costume for Baby Bon Doll </h2><p>  You can talk endlessly about how mothers like to dress their babies in costumes of various animals.  But each girl, even a very small one, also perceives her doll as a daughter or little sister.  I want to dress up so that none of those around me remain indifferent, and the girlfriends are completely crazy with envy. </p><p>  That is why experienced needlewomen in reviews insistently advise beginners to make clothes for the Baby Bon doll with their own hands.  And not ordinary, but interesting.  Perform the next set better with your daughter.  After all, any joint work brings together.  In addition, the baby will not be able to do anything at a time when her mother will be busy with creativity. </p><p>  So, you can make the bunny costume proposed below not only for the doll, but also for the real baby.  The main thing is to carefully study the pattern, correct it, and then transfer it to the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="baby clothes bon" class="if uuid-2461738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2461738.jpg"></div><p>  Well, here we come to the end of our article.  We hope that the information presented in it will help even inexperienced needlewomen to sew original outfits for dolls of different models.  And the question of how to make <span>clothes for dolls with your own hands will</span> no longer be perplexing, but will push mother and her little helper into hundreds of thoughts and original ideas. </p>
