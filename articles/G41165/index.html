    <h2>  Gemini Project: Origins </h2><p>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãNazi Germany was the purity of the <span>Aryan race.</span>  It was on this conviction that their inner and outer world, their faith and dreams, were built.  Therefore, it is not surprising that at that time of troubles many nationalist organizations began to appear, propagandizing this idea. </p><p>  One of them was the German Society for the Study of Ancient Germanic History, better known as Anenerbe (from it. "Ancestral Heritage").  The birth of this community came in July 1935, and it was headed by none other than Heinrich Himmler.  Thanks to his influence, Anenerbe quickly turned into a powerful force capable of manipulating the minds of the nation. </p><p>  As for the destination, the ‚ÄúAncestral Heritage‚Äù was to prove the historical superiority of German blood.  Later, the range of responsibilities expanded significantly and Anenerbe became a community studying science. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Angel of Death - Joseph Mengele </h2><p>  The Anenerbe organization conducted research in many areas, ranging from ancient history to genetics.  It was the latter that was of most interest to the Nazis, as it allowed them to change the world at their whim (at least, they thought so).  And one of the greatest minds working in this area was Joseph Mengele. </p><p>  This man had a developed intellect, able to solve the <span>most complex puzzles.</span>  However, this same mind allowed the scientist to kill people by the thousands, regardless of who they were.  Because of his cruelty, he got a place in Anenerb, since only such a person could conduct experiments on children and women without the slightest twinge of conscience. </p><p>  As a field laboratory, he was given <span>the Auschwitz concentration camp.</span>  There were constantly about 10-13 thousand prisoners who in the literal sense of the word were perceived as consumables.  And it was Mengele who decided who would go into the gas chamber, and who would face much worse fate ... </p>

    <h2>  The origin of a terrible project </h2><p>  The Gemini project was one of the first developments of the German Angel of Death.  Its essence was to use twins as experimental.  So, one became the "subject" for experiments, and the second - the control group.  In particular, this is precisely why the Gemini project got its name, because in Latin the word ‚Äútwins‚Äù sounds like gemini. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some historians do not agree with this name, because the Nazis did not like to use terminology taken from other languages ‚Äã‚Äãin their writings.  But this does not negate the fact that such experiments were conducted.  According to the data received, in five years at least 3 thousand twins passed through the Josef Mengele's laboratory.  Alas, no more than two hundred survived, most of whom are disabled. </p><h2>  Auschwitz Horror </h2><p>  In the head of the cruel scientist there were many ideas aimed at improving the Aryan race.  However, all of them required experiments that were not only very cruel, but also often caused the death of the subject. </p><p>  For example, Mengele dreamed of making all Germans have blue eyes.  Therefore, he developed all kinds of drugs that can change their color after birth.  He injected test formulations to the twins in order to see which one is better.  But all he could achieve was burning pain and blindness. </p>

    <p>  In addition, he often experimented with transplanting organs, body parts, and skin.  In his madness, he went so far as to begin to create Siamese twins surgically.  Such operations were very painful, so many died right on the table.  The rest awaited a worse fate, but ultimately death took them too. </p><p>  Because of this, historians consider the entire Gemini project to be anti-human, and its creator a monster.  At the same time, Mengele himself managed to escape punishment.  After the collapse of the Nazi regime, he fled to Brazil, where he lived until February 1979, until he was struck by a stroke. </p><h2>  History lessons </h2><p>  It is difficult to say how much horror the Gemini project brought to the world.  Is there an experiment like him now?  I want to believe that no!  People like Joseph Mengele should be immediately isolated from society.  Not a single good of the world can justify the sacrifices that such scientists are capable of making in the name of their science. </p>
