Russian history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The ambiguous personality was Catherine the Great, the Russian Empress of German origin.  In most articles and films she is shown as a lover of court balls and luxurious toilets, as well as numerous favorites with whom she once had a very close relationship. </p><p>  Unfortunately, few people know that she was a very intelligent, vibrant and talented organizer.  And this is an indisputable fact, since the political changes that occurred during the years of her reign belonged to <span>enlightened absolutism.</span>  In addition, the numerous reforms affecting the public and state life of the country are another proof of the eccentricity of its personality. </p><h2>  Origin </h2><p>  Catherine 2, whose biography was so amazing and unusual, was born on May 2 <span>(April 21),</span> 1729 in German Stettin.  Her full name is Sophia Augusta Frederick, Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst.  Her parents were Prince Christian-Augustus of Anhalt-Zerbst and his equal in title Johannes-Elizabeth Holstein-Gottorp, who was related to such royal houses as English, Swedish and Prussian. </p><p>  The future Russian empress was educated at home.  She was taught theology, music, dance, the basics of geography and history, and, in addition to her native German, she knew French very well.  Already in early childhood, she showed her independent character, perseverance and curiosity, preferred lively and outdoor games. </p>

    <h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  In 1744, Empress Elizaveta Petrovna invited the Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst together with her mother to come to Russia.  Here, the girl was christened according to Orthodox custom and began to be called Ekaterina Alekseevna.  From this moment, she received the status of the official bride of Prince Peter Fedorovich, the future Emperor Peter 3. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the exciting story of Catherine 2 in Russia began with their wedding, which took place on August 21, 1745.  After this event, she received the title of Grand Duchess.  As you know, her marriage was unhappy initially.  Her husband Peter was at that time still an immature young man who played with soldiers instead of spending his time in the company of his wife.  Therefore, the future empress was forced to entertain herself: she read for a long time, and also invented various amusements. </p>

    <h2>  Children of Catherine 2 </h2><p>  While the wife of Peter 3 had the appearance of a respectable lady, the heir to the throne himself never hid, so almost the entire court knew about his romantic predilections. </p><p>  After five years, Catherine 2, whose biography, as you know, was also full of love stories, started her first novel on the side.  Her chosen one was the guard officer S.V. Saltykov.  September 20, 9 years after marriage, she gave birth to an heir.  This event has become the subject of court discussions, which, however, continue to this day, but already in academia.  Some researchers are sure that the boy‚Äôs father was actually Catherine‚Äôs lover, and not her husband Peter at all.  Others claim that he was born of a husband.  But be that as it may, the mother did not have time to deal with the child, so Elizaveta Petrovna herself took care of her upbringing.  Soon, the future empress became pregnant again and gave birth to a girl named Anna.  Unfortunately, this child lived only 4 months. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After 1750, Catherine was bound by a love bond with S. Poniatowski, a Polish diplomat who later became King Stanislav Augustus.  At the beginning of 1760 she was already with G. G. Orlov, from whom she gave birth to her third child - the son of Alexei.  The boy was given the surname Bobrinsky. </p><p>  I must say that because of the numerous rumors and gossip, as well as the loose behavior of the wife, the children of Catherine 2 did not cause any warm feelings in Peter 3. The man clearly doubted his biological paternity. </p><p>  Needless to say, the future empress categorically rejected all charges made by her husband against her.  Hiding from the attacks of Peter 3, Catherine preferred to spend most of her time in her boudoir.  Corrupted to the extreme relationship with her husband led to the fact that she seriously began to fear for her life.  She was afraid that, having come to power, Peter 3 would take revenge on her, so she began to look for reliable allies at court. </p>

    <h2>  Accession to the throne </h2><p>  After the death of his mother, Peter 3 ruled the state for only 6 months.  For a long time they spoke of him as an ignorant and demented ruler with many vices.  But who created such an image for him?  Recently, historians are increasingly inclined to the idea that such an unsightly image was created by memoirs written by the organizers of the coup ‚Äî Catherine 2 and E.R. Dashkova. </p><p>  The fact is that her husband‚Äôs attitude to her was not just bad, it was clearly hostile.  Therefore, the threat of exile or even arrest hanging over her served as an impetus for preparing a conspiracy against Peter 3. The brothers Orlov, K. G. Razumovsky, N. I. Panin, E. R. Dashkova and others helped her organize the rebellion.  On July 9, 1762, Peter 3 was overthrown, and a new empress, Catherine 2, came to power. The deposed monarch was almost immediately taken to Ropsha (30 miles from St. Petersburg).  He was accompanied by a guard of guards under the command of <span>Alexei Orlov.</span> </p><p>  As you know, the history of Catherine 2, and, in particular, the <span>palace coup</span> arranged by her <span>, is</span> full of riddles that excite the minds of most researchers to this day.  For example, the cause of the death of Peter 3, 8 days after his overthrow, has not yet been precisely determined.  According to the official version, he died from a whole bunch of diseases caused by prolonged use of alcohol. </p><p>  Until recently, it was believed that Peter 3 died a violent death at the hands of Alexei Orlov.  The proof of this was a certain letter written by a murderer and sent by Catherine of Ropsha.  The original of this document was not preserved, but there was only a copy allegedly made by F.V. Rostopchin.  Therefore, there is no direct evidence of the murder of the emperor. </p>

    <h2>  Foreign policy </h2><p>  I must say that Catherine 2 the Great in many respects shared the views of Peter 1 that Russia should occupy the leading positions in all areas on the world stage, while conducting an offensive and even somewhat aggressive policy.  The proof of this can be a break in the union agreement with Prussia, concluded earlier by her husband Peter 3. She took this decisive step almost immediately as soon as she ascended the throne. </p><p>  The foreign policy of Catherine 2 was based on the fact that she everywhere tried to elevate her proteges to the throne.  It was thanks to her that the duke E.I. Biron returned to the throne of Courland, and in 1763 her protege Stanislav Augustus Ponyatovsky began to rule in Poland.  Such actions led to the fact that Austria began to fear an excessive increase in the influence of the northern state.  Its representatives immediately began to incite a long-standing enemy of Russia - Turkey - to start a war against it.  And Austria still achieved its goal. </p><p>  We can say that the Russian-Turkish war, which lasted 6 years (from 1768 to 1774), was successful for the Russian Empire.  Despite this, the internal political situation that has not developed in the best way inside the country forced Catherine 2 to seek peace.  As a result, she had to restore her former allied relations with Austria.  And a compromise between the two countries was reached.  Poland became its victim, part of the territory of which in 1772 was divided between three states: Russia, Austria and Prussia. </p>

    <h2>  Land accession and the new Russian doctrine </h2><p>  The signing of the Kuchuk-Kainardzhiysky peace with Turkey ensured the independence of Crimea, beneficial to the Russian state.  In subsequent years, there was an increase in imperial influence not only on this peninsula, but also in the Caucasus.  The result of such a policy was the inclusion of Crimea in Russia in 1782.  Soon, the St. George Treatise was signed with the king of Kartli-Kakheti, Irakli 2, which provided for the presence of Russian troops in Georgia.  Subsequently, these lands were also annexed to Russia. </p><p>  Catherine 2, whose biography was inextricably linked with the history of the country, from the second half of the 70s of the 18th century, together with the then government, began to form a completely new foreign policy position - the so-called Greek project.  Its ultimate goal was the restoration of the Greek, or Byzantine Empire.  Constantinople was to become its capital, and its grandson was the grandson of Catherine 2, <span>Grand Duke Konstantin</span> Pavlovich. </p><p>  By the end of the 70s, the foreign policy of Catherine 2 returned the country to its former international authority, which became even stronger after Russia acted as a mediator at the Teshen Congress between Prussia and Austria.  In 1787, the empress with a Polish king and an Austrian monarch, accompanied by her court and foreign diplomats, made a long journey to the Crimean peninsula.  This grand event demonstrated the entire military power of the Russian Empire. </p>

    <h2>  Domestic policy </h2><p>  Most of the reforms and transformations that were carried out in Russia were as controversial as Catherine II herself. The years of her reign were marked by the maximum enslavement of the peasantry, as well as the deprivation of even their most minimal rights.  It was with her that a decree appeared prohibiting the filing of a complaint against the arbitrariness of the landowners.  In addition, corruption flourished among the highest state apparatus and officials, and the empress herself served as an example for them, who generously endowed both relatives and the large army of her fans. </p><h2>  What was she like </h2><p>  The personal qualities of Catherine 2 were described by her in her own memoirs.  In addition, the research of historians, based on numerous documents, suggests that she was a subtle psychologist, well versed in people.  The fact that she selected only talented and bright people as her assistants can serve as proof of this.  Therefore, her era was marked by the appearance of a whole cohort of brilliant military leaders and statesmen, poets and writers, artists and musicians. </p><p>  In dealing with subordinates, Catherine 2 was usually tactful, restrained and patient.  According to her, she always carefully listened to her interlocutor, catching every sensible thought at the same time, and then used it for good.  With her, in fact, not a single noisy resignation took place; she did not exile any of the nobles and, moreover, did not execute her.  No wonder her rule is called the "golden age" of the heyday of the Russian nobility. </p><p>  Catherine 2, whose biography and personality is full of contradictions, was at the same time quite conceited and very valued the power she won.  In order to keep her in her hands, she was ready to compromise, even to the detriment of her own convictions. </p>

    <h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  The portraits of the empress, painted during the years of her youth, indicate that she had a rather pleasant appearance.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Catherine 2‚Äôs numerous amusing pastimes entered the story. In truth, she could well have remarried, but in this case her title, position, and, most importantly, full power, would be jeopardized. </p><p>  According to the prevailing opinion of most historians, over the course of her life, Catherine the Great replaced about twenty lovers.  Very often, she presented them with a wide variety of valuable presents, generously distributed honors and titles, and all this in order to be favorable to her. </p><h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  It must be said that historians do not undertake to unambiguously evaluate all the events that took place in the Catherine‚Äôs era, since at that time despotism and enlightenment went hand in hand and were inextricably linked.  During her reign, there was everything: the development of education, culture and science, the significant strengthening of Russian statehood in the international arena, the development of trade relations and diplomacy.  But, as with any ruler, not without the oppression of the people, who suffered numerous hardships.  Such a domestic policy could not but provoke another unrest, which grew into a powerful and full-scale uprising led by Emelyan Pugachev. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In 1860, the idea came up: to erect a monument to Catherine 2 in St. Petersburg in honor of her 100-year accession to the throne.  Its construction lasted 11 years, and the opening took place in 1873 on Alexandria Square.  This is the most famous monument to the empress.  During the years of Soviet power, 5 of its monuments were lost.  After 2000, several monuments were opened both in Russia and abroad: 2 in Ukraine and 1 in Transnistria.  In addition, in 2010 in Zerbst (Germany) a statue appeared, but not to Empress Catherine 2, but to Sofia Frederick Augustus, Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst. </p>
