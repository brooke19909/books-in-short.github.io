It took place in all respects and deservedly can be proud of it.  Today, Irina not only successfully trades herself, but also is engaged in training.  For many, it remains a mystery how in such a short time - a girl in trading is only 6 years old, which is quite a bit by the standards of Forex - she managed to achieve real success in trading.  Indeed, for many years they have been trying to saddle Forex or Forts, but they fail to do this, which then gives rise to a lot of negative reviews about the business as a whole. </p><p>  The fact that Forex is a trap, a deception, is already being said at all angles.  Bulygina Irina is a vivid example of the fact that a persistent, talented person who is not looking for easy ways is able to conquer even such a monster as the international financial market. </p>

    <h2>  From a chain store manager to a successful trader </h2><p>  Today, Irina continues to engage in trading and actively develop her business.  She organized Bulygina &amp; Co and successfully manages her assets.  The heroine of our article is another vivid confirmation that a <span>talented person is talented in everything,</span> because the girl did not come to trading from scratch - before that, she was the manager of a network of women's clothing stores.  Moreover, a fairly large network, whose annual turnover was more than $ 2 million.  But trading since 2012 began to bring more revenue than the position of manager, and Irina decided to completely immerse herself in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Her success in trading the stock market did not go unnoticed.  Since 2014, Irina Bulygina successfully manages investor accounts, that is, other people's money that people trust her.  In addition to the main work, he conducts several constant programs on YouTube, participates in the programs of the Russian channel RBC, speaks a lot in public and, of course, shares his knowledge in various courses and seminars. </p>

    <h2>  "Trading is the result of 100%" </h2><p>  This is Irina‚Äôs author‚Äôs workshop, which takes place online.  Intensive training, where they teach the skills of making trades within a day with maximum profit.  At the seminar, students are given a whole risk management system that will help to first save, and then increase the deposit. </p><h2>  "Practical trading skills with a stop" </h2><p>  In addition to theoretical knowledge, practical trading skills with a stop are given that help develop a habit.  Experienced traders know that this skill alone is very costly and can significantly improve trading results.  It also gives ways to develop a discipline that, in trading, is generally considered to be in the first place for success.  We are, of course, talking about financial discipline, and not about how much time and at what hours to sit at a computer. </p><h2>  "Ways to deal with stress" </h2><p>  Another important skill is stress management.  Psychology spoils life for many traders.  Everyone who has tried their hand at the Forex or Forts market knows very well how difficult it is to sit in a deal when it goes in the red.  A person begins to get nervous and makes one mistake after another.  The same thing happens when the deal is in positive territory - what if the price turns around now, maybe it is better to take what is?  And the trader does not receive the profit that could make his trade efficient.  At an online seminar Bulygina Irina teaches to set reasonable goals and calmly wait for their implementation. </p>

    <h2>  Training "Full reboot" </h2><p>  For three days, partly completed traders are intensively trained here.  Partly, because these are people who have been trading on the stock exchange for some time, they know a lot, but cannot boast of significant results or periodically lose their deposit.  Training will also be useful for those who want to look at the market from a different perspective - a fresh look will help improve their own strategy and thereby make their earnings more stable and increase income. </p><h2>  What is the training about </h2><p>  The training ‚ÄúFull Reboot‚Äù contains most of the practical information, based on the assumption that people who already know the basics of trading are present here.  He answers many questions, including the following: </p><ul><li>  What the first hour of the trading session says. </li><li>  How to determine the entry and exit points. </li><li>  How to see the first signs of a trend reversal. </li><li>  How not to jump into the trade ahead of time so as not to fall into the ‚Äúsaw‚Äù. </li></ul><p>  Irina Bulygina‚Äôs website also has a special ‚ÄúStart in Trading‚Äù course for those who are just starting their journey.  It's no secret that starting with an experienced mentor is more likely to be successful and much faster.  Irina herself admitted that Alexander Mikhailovich Gerchik, also a well-known person in trading circles, provided great help in her becoming a trader.  Irina Bulygina‚Äôs course for beginners from the very beginning will teach them to avoid the standard mistakes that all self-taught traders make, and will direct them on the right path. </p>

    <h2>  Video programs </h2><p>  On a regular basis, Irina conducts two permanent programs on YouTube.  On Wednesdays, this is ‚ÄúMidday Market,‚Äù where a successful trader analyzes the futures market in search of the best opportunities that he can give.  On Mondays, the Coffee Break show gives an overview of the main futures that are traded on the MICEX, discusses the main important events of the coming week, which may affect trading. </p><h2>  Irina Bulygina: reviews </h2><p>  Does it ever happen that everyone is equally happy with something?  On the activities of Irina Bulygina, reviews can be found on the Web are different.  There is a lot of criticism on Smartlab, including constructive as well as unfair, but most of the reviews are still positive.  It cannot be otherwise if a person is genuinely ill with his work.  Be that as it may, a young woman (Irina graduated from high school in Zaporozhye only in 2000) practically herself achieved serious results in an industry where many men retreat, having completely lost faith in their abilities. </p>

    <p>  In conclusion, a few tips from Irina herself.  According to her, sports helped her to become a successful trader.  She always takes a certain amount of time to exercise.  If the trade does not go well and several transactions in a row bring losses, it simply closes the terminal and leaves.  It is very important that the trader has the support of relatives and family members.  The path of the trader is complex and long - you need to be patient and persistent, there are no quick results here.  Be sure to periodically rest, and not sit around the computer for days on end, and make transactions even less in quantity, but of better quality. </p>
