    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Peninsula Resort &amp; Spa is located in the resort, which is known as Agia Pelagia.  It, in turn, is a 15-20 minute drive from Heraklion, the administrative center of Crete.  The airport closest to the resort is also located there.  By the way, you can get from there to this place by bus.  But he just walks four times a day, so tourists often call a taxi. </p><p>  This village is good because it is surrounded by the sea from the north, and the mountains from all other sides.

At its entrance is a chapel of the Byzantine era, striking the imagination with its frescoes.  The hotel can be seen from afar, because it is located on a hill.  And it is surrounded, by the way, with two beaches.  This is one of the main reasons why this hotel has become so popular. </p><h2>  Recreation and entertainment </h2><p>  Peninsula Resort &amp; Spa 4 * has a sun terrace, an outdoor swimming pool, a patio, a garden and a barbecue.

    <h2>  Guests staying at the hotel </h2><p>  Every year, many tourists come to Peninsula Resort &amp; Spa 4 * (Crete, Heraklion).  Reviews this vacation spot gets positive.  According to tourists, an excellent hotel in the Greek style, multi-level, towering like a palace on a rock.  It makes a good impression, which is subsequently repeatedly confirmed. </p><p>  Pleases the restaurant menu.  Every day you can try something new, because everything is served here: from fish to snails. </p><p>  The beaches are simple, but with a nice feature - there is no wind.  And accordingly, the waves.  Even in the windiest weather.  And all because the beaches seem to be mountains sheltered from the elements.  This is a huge plus, especially for spring or autumn, since at this time the wind is not uncommon. </p><p>  Guests give a recommendation - it is better to take rooms not at the lower level.  Because right above it is a scene where evening performances take place.  At night it can interfere.  Although there is a way out - close the balcony door to the room and turn on the air conditioning / fan so that it is not hot. </p>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  And of course, a couple of words in the end should be said about what is the relation to tourists here.  Since it really matters. </p><p>  Guests who have been here assure us that the people at the hotel are friendly and welcoming.  Among the staff there are several Russian speakers.  You can always turn to them if something happens - they will not refuse help.  If you accidentally settle in the wrong apartments that the client booked, you need to say this, immediately change without question.  A definite plus is that there is a free shuttle bus from the hotel to Heraklion. </p><p>  The hotel is more designed for people who want to relax in peace and quiet.  The vast majority of visitors are young couples.  And here is a really great place for a romantic vacation together.  It‚Äôs better not to go here with children: the hotel is on a hill, down the stairs to the beaches, and the layout inside is not quite ordinary.  In general, with small children and especially strollers will be uncomfortable.  Yes, and children can interfere with others to relax - still there is a place for a quiet holiday. </p><p>  Otherwise, this hotel is good.  If you want to relax in a place with good service at an affordable price, you should go here. </p>
