But the painstaking work with him is rewarded with the creation of truly unique products that can compete with jewelry.  The proposed material describes how to make earrings from beads with your own hands, while the task of the article is to: suggest the basics of <span>weaving from beads</span> and encourage your imagination to create your own, original products. </p><p>  <strong>A little bit about the basics of bead weaving</strong> </p><p>  To create earrings, not only beads, but also beads, bugles, natural ornamental and semiprecious stones are suitable.  There are many methods for creating jewelry.  Let us dwell on some of them.  So, if you want to make earrings from beads, you can use the technique of creating a mesh and its subsequent embroidery.  For a necklace, bracelet and earrings, a net of two or three rhombuses is woven.  Why twenty four beads are gathered on a fishing line, then the needle goes into the twelfth bead, five beads are gathered and the needle goes into the seventh, so to the end.  Three rhombuses, four beads in each, come out.  For the necklace it will be necessary to continue in width, and when making earrings from beads, we will dwell on creating a grid of nine rhombuses. </p><p>  The resulting grid can be embroidered in various ways.  It uses beads, beads, pebbles, and cutting.  Stitching is like ‚Äúfur‚Äù, ‚Äútwigs‚Äù.  First you need to fix the fishing line on the edge of the grid, go into the key bead.  Then, the master passes with a needle through the connected decor elements: a pebble, a bead and a bead, then returns through a bead and a pebble, makes a passage along the grid, and the new bead and stone are connected in a similar way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To create more traditional earrings, use a flat <span>semi</span> - <span>precious stone</span> or bead that is braided with beads.  For this, it is necessary to weave a grid into three rhombuses with four beads in each.  It should be shorter than the circumference of your pebble by two millimeters.  On the front side of the weave add finishing beads, put a pebble, skip a row of beads on the wrong side and pull this row so that the "net" fits the stone tightly. </p><p>  <strong>Options for creating earrings from beads</strong> </p><p>  Before making <span>earrings from beads,</span> it is necessary to prepare tools and material.  Need beads, beads, earrings, needles and fishing line for weaving.  Beads are a fairly convenient material from which you can create products of various shapes.  Consider the simplest of them.  For earrings, a net of three rhombuses is woven high and three wide.  Each of twelve beads.  That is, when collecting beads on a fishing line there will be twenty-four.  To open the mesh, small crystal beads are used, while passing the needle through the bead at the base of the rhombus, pick up two beads on the fishing line and pass the needle through the rhombus bead from the opposite side.  So bead earrings will be decorated on one side.  On the other hand, ‚Äúslingshots‚Äù of beaded ‚Äúfur‚Äù are gradually lengthening.  Why fix the thread in the fabricated rhombus at the bead, with which the embroidery will begin.  Then collect four beads, a bead and a finishing bead.  Go back along the bead and beads, collect two beads, a bead and a finishing bead.  Go back over the bead and four beads.  So it turns out "slingshot." </p><p>  Similar bead earrings can be decorated in a different way, and a new model is obtained.  At its base, the same grid as in the previous example, only the layout will be different.  To do this, use the following technique.  Fasten the thread in the grid and pass into the key bead to begin the embroidery.  Collect the bead, an elongated bead and a finishing bead, then go into the mesh bead and return to the bead and bead.  As a result, the alignment will fit snugly into the grid, while not violating the pattern.  To the rhombus of future earrings make pendants on three sides, they will consist of a combination of beads and large beads.  The pendants will be shorter from the edges, and longer in the middle.  At the end of the weaving of the earrings, attach the earring to them and the work is ready. </p><p>  If you want to use your imagination - feel free to dare those!  Perhaps a real work of art will come out of your hands. </p>
