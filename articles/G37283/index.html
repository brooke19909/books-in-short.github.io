Therefore, it is important to hold it so that it is remembered for a lifetime.  Many newlyweds go on a honeymoon.  How to make a voyage bright, unusual and romantic?  First you need to choose the right direction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.traveldailymedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeymoon" class="if uuid-2337670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337670.jpg"></div><p>  All newlyweds have different tastes.  Someone prefers extreme, and someone prefers peace.  But when the question arises, where to go on a honeymoon, the majority prefers the southern resorts. </p><h2>  Unforgettable days on the islands </h2><p>  For newlyweds, island resorts with their romantic atmosphere are ideal.  Palm trees, white sand, gentle ocean waves seem to be perfect for a honeymoon. </p><h2>  Maldives </h2><p>  They are very popular among newlyweds.  They are attracted by cozy bays, picturesque coral reefs, secluded bungalows and, of course, a high level of service.  Where to go on a honeymoon?  Reviews recommend it to the Maldives.  After all, this is an unreal, fabulous place that resembles that paradise as we imagine it. </p><p>  Of course, such an expensive pleasure as a vacation in the Maldives, not everyone can afford.  But self-organization of the trip will save a considerable amount.  Also, prices depend on the season.  From December to April, the Maldives enjoys great weather.  Therefore, prices during this period are quite high. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It‚Äôs not worth taking a lot of things with you to the Maldives.  All that will be needed will be provided in hotels.  Money is what you really need to take in large quantities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tedytravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeymoon where to go ideas" class="if uuid-2337671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337671.jpg"></div><h2>  Seychelles </h2><p>  Any island in the Seychelles archipelago is perfect for a honeymoon.  Here, both outdoor enthusiasts and tourists who seek solitude and tranquility will be satisfied.  <span>Seychelles</span> is a prestigious destination for beach tourism.  But if in the Maldives you can choose a relatively inexpensive vacation, then in the Seychelles it is unrealistic. </p><h2>  Mauritius </h2><p>  Mauritius is the pearl of the Indian Ocean.  It is one of the most popular destinations for honeymoon trips.  Clear water, picturesque coral reefs, white sands of beaches, tropical forests invariably attract tourists. </p><p>  But when preparing for a trip to this island, you need to consider that the weather changes very quickly on it.  Heavy rains and winds are not uncommon there.  At the same time, Mauritius has a high level of insolation both on sunny and cloudy days.  Perhaps the only unpleasant moment that tourists can spoil the rest here is an unplanned meeting with some local marine inhabitants, whose spikes and thorns leave painful wounds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.coraltravel.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeymoon reviews" class="if uuid-2337683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337683.jpg"></div><p>  Under the guise of a shell trade in Mauritius, narcotic herbs are sold on the beaches.  Its use and storage are punishable in this country by a large fine.  For this, they can even be sent from the country.  Therefore, you should be alert and alert. </p><p>  Unfavorable for relaxing on this island are considered windy and cool June and July.  But in August-September, the weather is amazing.  Where to go on a honeymoon in August?  Of course, to Mauritius! </p><h2>  Fiji Islands </h2><p>  Fiji Islands are located in the Pacific Ocean.  Tourists are offered beautiful hotels, excellent service, as well as diving, surfing and fishing.  According to reviews, a honeymoon trip to Fiji is an amazing adventure.  More than three hundred islands attract tourists with blue lagoons, magnificent beaches and evergreen forests.  Of these, only one third of the islands are populated by people, and the rest are uninhabited.  Fiji Islands fascinate with unusual flora and fauna. </p><h2>  Hawaii </h2><p>  The Hawaiian archipelago consists of 162 islands, of which only 7 are inhabited. It is the fiftieth US state and is located in the central part of the Pacific Ocean.  In Hawaii, beautiful nature, spacious beaches, wonderful weather and a humid tropical climate. </p><p>  Not a good idea where to go on a honeymoon from May to November is a trip to Hawaii.  At this time, tropical cyclones dominate there. </p><p>  There is no unbearable heat in the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> .  Another advantage of Hawaii is their diversity.  Horseback riding, volcanoes, swimming in waterfalls and original dishes invariably attract tourists.  Before you go to Hawaii, you just need to choose the right island that meets the interests of the newlyweds. </p><h2>  The Caribbean </h2><p>  In the Caribbean are more than fifty islands.  The Caribbean islands are unique nature and magnificent colonial mansions.  Here the sea is warm for a whole year, tourists are offered a grandiose selection of hotels and various entertainments: various kinds of sports, extreme sports, discos, night clubs, restaurants, fascinating excursions. </p><p>  The Caribbean is a favorite destination for honeymooners from all over the world.  Unforgettable adventures, exotic cities, gourmet dishes await here. </p><p>  Citizens of our country do not need visas to fly to countries located in the Caribbean, such as Jamaica, Grenada, Barbados, Turks and Caicos, Antigua and Barbuda. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.terra.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeymoon is much better" class="if uuid-2337696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337696.jpg"></div><h2>  Alluring Asia </h2><p>  You can go on a relatively inexpensive honeymoon trip to Asian resorts.  They are no less attractive and comfortable than island resorts. </p><h2>  Phi phi </h2><p>  Tourists call the Phi Phi Islands a natural phenomenon of Thailand.  Each island is unique and interesting in its own way.  Of the six islands, only one is inhabited.  Delightful yacht trips, extreme water activities, beach parties and amazing fire shows are especially attractive on these islands. </p><p>  Tourists call Phi Phi the budget Maldives.  It is best to visit these islands from November to April. </p><p>  Mangroves, turquoise lagoons, coral reefs, amazing grottoes and caves (including the famous Viking Cave) ... All these unique natural features will help make your honeymoon magnificent. </p><h2>  Sri Lanka </h2><p>  Travelers call Sri Lanka a kaleidoscope country.  The ideal form of route in this country is the ring. </p><p>  Here you can not find noisy discos, but there are magnificent beaches with picnics, fishing and barbecue.  Life in Sri Lanka flows slowly.  The island has a tropical climate.  The most favorable time to visit this resort is from November to May.  In winter, it is preferable to relax in the south and west of the island, since dry and sunny weather reigns there, in contrast to the east, where rains and winds rage.  It should be borne in mind that the height of the tourist season in Sri Lanka falls on New Year's holidays. </p><h2>  Bali </h2><p>  In Indonesia, there is a delightful place washed by the gentle waters of the Indian Ocean - Bali.  Tourists call this resort a paradise on Earth, because there dreams come true of a life full of enjoyments: fun beach parties, downshifting, coastal excursions, exploring volcanoes and rice terraces, amazing diving.  Bali is also yoga and meditation. </p><p>  This resort is one of the most popular resorts in the world, while not losing its exoticism and connection with ancient traditions. </p><p>  Bali has a tropical climate.  But in the rainy season (November - March), going there on a honeymoon is not worth it, because the local weather is very unpredictable.  It is best to go to this resort between April and June, as well as in September.  You can go in July-August, but these months are the most popular among tourists.  There are a lot of people at this time, and the prices are incredibly high.  This is not suitable for a honeymoon.  Therefore, it is better to choose a calmer season. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thejakartapost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="honeymoon" class="if uuid-2337702" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337702.jpg"></div><h2>  Vietnam </h2><p>  Vietnam is famous for its paradise beaches, wonderful diving, bustling cities, ancient temples of forgotten civilizations and amazingly beautiful bays.  It is best to go there in March and April. </p><h2>  Cambodia </h2><p>  Cambodia is a state lost in the jungle.  It is distinguished by exotic nature and wonderful hotels and beaches.  But the consequences of the guerrilla war are affecting: it is unsafe to walk in the country at night.  Therefore, safety precautions should be observed. </p><h2>  Travel to Europe </h2><p>  If the newly-married couple is not captivated by the exotic and secluded relaxation on the ocean, then there is another wonderful suggestion: a honeymoon to Europe.  Cities with a long history, full of secrets and legends, will be excellent decorations for the most romantic trip for young couples in love. </p><h2>  Prague </h2><p>  In Prague, among the charming old castles, you can feel like heroes of medieval legends.  The dream of all lovers is to meet the dawn on the Charles Bridge and make a wish there: it will become a reality for newlyweds.  In Prague you can wander around the old streets with their unique atmosphere around the clock, as well as explore the majestic central squares with old castles and magnificent parks. </p><p>  When the newlyweds compare the prices for honeymoon trips to this city, it turns out that staying in apartments is much cheaper than in a hotel.  But for those who intend to spend their honeymoon luxuriously, you can choose one of the famous hotels. </p><h2>  Paris </h2><p>  The famous city of love ... Probably everyone dreams of visiting Paris.  And the best time to fulfill your dreams is the honeymoon.  In this city you can get lost in the narrow streets, visit famous sights from your favorite books, take a boat ride on the Seine, enjoy delicious croissants with coffee, and taste the best wine in the world.  All this will become a real romantic adventure. </p><p>  In organizing a honeymoon, the best idea would be to choose a hotel on the right bank of the Seine.  There are reasonable prices and, most importantly, a gorgeous view of the Eiffel Tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.parisinfo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go on a honeymoon in august" class="if uuid-2337706" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337706.jpg"></div><h2>  Venice </h2><p>  Venice is one of the most romantic places not only in Italy, but also all over the world.  Tourists can ride a gondola, stroll along St. Mark's Square, feel the special charm of the Old Town.  There is a tradition that is mandatory for all newlyweds: sailing on a gondola under the <span>Bridge of Sighs,</span> you must definitely kiss, so that further family life is as tender and romantic as in a honeymoon. </p><p>  Also in Venice, great shopping. </p><h2>  Honeymoon in Russia </h2><p>  When the newlyweds face the question of where to fly on their honeymoon, then they should think about the fact that perhaps they should not fly abroad.  You can stay in Russia, while noting the beginning of family life is no worse than in foreign travel. </p><h2>  Trip to Lake Baikal </h2><p>  Fans of harsh Russian nature will like a trip to the amazing Lake Baikal.  Going there is preferable in the summer, because at this time you can freely explore the surroundings of the lake and wander through the taiga, as well as swim and even go diving. </p><p>  You can stay in the private sector or hotel.  Those who enjoy a wild vacation can live on the shore, in a tent. </p><p>  Extreme lovers who go to Lake Baikal in late autumn, winter or early spring will discover the delights of snowy Siberian nature.  But they risk falling into severe weather conditions. </p><h2>  Sochi </h2><p>  Sochi is the most popular resort in Russia.  This is an amazing city combining wonderful sea beaches and snow-capped mountain peaks.  Thus, if swimming in the sea and sunbathing are not a priority for newlyweds, you can go to Sochi in the cold season and focus on conquering mountain peaks and exploring local attractions. </p><p>  If you go to Sochi in the summer, you can enjoy plenty of beach vacations.  Also, vacationers are offered a variety of types of entertainment, including diving. </p><h2>  Yalta </h2><p>  The most difficult decision in organizing a honeymoon is where to go.  The choice is obvious: of course, it should be Yalta! </p><p>  Located on the southern coast of the Crimean peninsula, Yalta is its true pearl.  Not surprisingly, palaces and estates of the first persons of the Russian Empire were built in its vicinity.  Also in Yalta lived famous people who fled from the uncomfortable Northern capital.  Now the houses in which they lived are turned into museums. </p><p>  Yalta is picturesque bays, amazing vegetation, stunning mountain landscapes, fascinating boat trips, the gentle Black Sea and mild climate.  In Crimea, they say that Yalta is a city of happiness.  Therefore, a honeymoon to this marvelous city will give the newlyweds a lot of vivid impressions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="airlines-airports.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to fly on a honeymoon" class="if uuid-2337720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66686/2337720.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Wherever the newlyweds are going to go, they should take into account the possibilities of their budget, common interests and time of year.  The main thing is that in any journey they should be accompanied by love and mutual understanding. </p>
