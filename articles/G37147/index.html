Ways to raise money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, there is a ton of information on <span>how to attract money</span> and wealth.  There are enough books and articles on this subject.  However, as a rule, having studied the literature thoroughly, having bought the necessary <span>amulets and talismans,</span> you have to wait a very, very long time for the long-awaited money!  So in what ways can you speed up the process of obtaining them? </p><p>  <strong>You should follow some recommendations:</strong> </p><ul><li>  work, the purpose of which is to ensure well-being and receive money, is best done with a growing moon; </li><li>  perfect cleanliness and order in your home - this is one of the prerequisites for the successful raising of money.  Clean the house of dirt, throw out all <span>unnecessary things</span> (or give them to someone), get rid of cracked or broken dishes, bad clothes, sort out the accumulations of notes and papers; </li><li>  Before conducting a magic ritual, tune in to positive emotions, eradicate or suppress for a while all negative thoughts, envy or anger; </li><li>  do not start work if your health leaves much to be desired.  Your attitude is the main condition in resolving the issue of "how to attract money." </li></ul><p>  <strong>Equally important is your wallet</strong> </p><p>  Wallets come in a variety of soft suede and leather, all shapes and colors.  But they have one function - the storage of funds. </p><p>  If the old wallet is torn or you are just tired of it, then do not rush to buy a new one.  First, do not buy cheap wallets made from low-quality materials, as they carry the energy of poverty and debt.  In such a product there is practically no chance to linger on a large bill.  Choose not the most expensive wallet, but made solidly and having compartments for both coins and paper money.  Remember that a decent amount of money spent by you will come back after a while and even increase. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The color scheme in which the wallet is made also plays an important role.  Black and brown, yellow and all its shades, orange and gold - these colors should prevail in the design of your purse. </p><p>  Do not store photos of your loved ones in your wallet.  Firstly, the images of people seem to ‚Äúinterrupt‚Äù the energy flows of wealth.  And secondly, these same flows can affect your loved ones through photos, and sometimes not in the best way. </p><p>  <strong><span>How to attract wealth?</span></strong>  <strong><span>How to attract money</span> with horseradish?</strong> </p><p>  Everything is very simple!  Just put a piece of the root of this plant in your wallet.  Horseradish has the ability to collect huge amounts of <span>cash energy</span> .  It can be bought in a store, but it would be better if you grow it yourself, dig it, wash it, dry it, and then put a small piece in your wallet so that it does not get lost.  If you do not have the opportunity to buy or <span>grow horseradish,</span> then instead of it you can put cinnamon or a sprig of heather in your wallet. </p><p>  And do not forget to fold the banknotes so that they are placed in your wallet with the front side to one side. </p><p>  <strong>What do not like money?</strong> </p><p>  When you whistle at home, remove the crumbs with your hand from the table, recount the trifle in your wallet, take out the trash in the evening from Friday to Saturday, your wallet is empty, spend the money you just received and keep banknotes of different currencies in one place. </p><p>  <strong>How to attract money to the business with the help of a mascot?</strong> </p><p>  On the seashore or ocean, find or buy a large white shell in the store.  Then put a coin in its cavity and drip on it a drop of essential oils of basil, sandalwood and bergamot.  Light a green candle and tilt it over the shell so that molten paraffin or wax drips into it and fills its entire cavity.  After the wax has hardened, hide the sink with a coin in the place where you do business.  This talisman will attract new money and investment. </p><p>  You can still talk a lot about how to raise money.  But still, the main point in this matter is your <span>positive attitude</span> and hard work.  Good luck </p>
