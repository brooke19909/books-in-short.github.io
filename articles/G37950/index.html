They were divided into 3 generations.  We will not list here all the <span>names of the Greek gods, a</span> list of which is available in books on mythology.  Let us dwell only on the most powerful and colorful titans.  According to the legends, since the beginning of time, power has been in the hands of the supreme god - Chaos.  There was no order in the world, and then Gaia - the enterprising goddess of the Earth - married Uranus.  From their union came the first generation of titans. </p><p>  1. Kronos (Chronos) </p><p>  He tops the list of Greek gods.  He is the sixth and last son of Gaia.  Mother did not look for a soul in him, but Kronos‚Äôs waywardness and ambitiousness knew no bounds.  Seeing that Gaea was constantly giving birth to children, he oskranil Uranus and overthrew him from heaven.  The forecaster told the goddess of the Earth that one of the sons of Kronos would overthrow him.  When he decided to marry the gentle Rey, his mother told him about the prophecy.  Not wanting to lose power, he swallowed all his children.  Rhea went to the trick.  She secretly gave birth to little Zeus and gave him to raise forest nymphs.  When Zeus came of age, he overthrew Kronos, forcing him to burp all swallowed children. </p>

    <p>  2. Zeus </p><p>  This titan from the 2nd generation continues the list of Greek gods.  Like Kronos, he was destined to die at the hands of his own son, who, according to prophecy, was to lead the titans and overthrow the ruler of Olympus.  The only one who could help Zeus to maintain power is Prometheus, able to see the future.  But the titan hated Zeus for ill-treatment of people and was not going to help him.  Unable to see human life in the cold anymore, Prometheus stole <span>eternal flame</span> from Olympus and brought it to Earth.  For this, Zeus chained the titan and condemned him to eternal torment.  Prometheus could be released only by concluding an agreement with the Thunderer and telling him the secret of maintaining power.  So Zeus escaped marriage with a woman who, according to prophecy, was to give birth to the leader of the Titans.  No one else dared to encroach on the thunder of the thunder, even other <span>Greek gods, a</span> list of which is in books on mythology.  The power was fixed to Zeus forever. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  3. Poseidon </p><p>  Included in the list of Greek gods only as a shadow of his brother the Thunderer.  He was not cruel and always punished people deservedly.  He was non-conflict and tried to avoid squabbles and quarrels.  Periodically, Poseidon sent storms, but the sailors preferred to pray to him, and not to Zeus.  Before the sea voyage, not a single warrior left the harbor without prayer in the temple.  Altars in honor of Poseidon smoked for several days in a row.  The trident was a symbol of the unlimited power of this god on the expanses of water. </p>

    <p>  4. Hades </p><p>  The second brother of Zeus closes our list of Greek gods.  Some were even more afraid of him than the thunderer himself.  And Zeus himself felt fear when he barely saw his brother‚Äôs chariot <span>harnessed by horses</span> with demonic fire in his eyes.  When the thunderer shared power, he greatly offended Hades, giving him the kingdom of the dead.  Therefore, he constantly spoiled the life of Zeus, although he did not plan to encroach on the throne of Olympus.  Hades is the most cruel and vindictive of all the titans. </p>
