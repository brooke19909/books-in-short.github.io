    <h2>  Resort Benefits </h2><p>  The town of Kobuleti is small.  Only about 20-25 thousand people live here.  Judging by the reviews available on the Web, the townspeople are very friendly.  Not too clean, but not particularly littered streets - this is what, among other things, is characterized by Kobuleti.  Reviews of tourists about the appearance of this city are mostly good. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main advantage of the resort is not crowded.  Vacationers here are much fewer than in Batumi, and therefore, housing can be rented much cheaper.  Holidaymakers praise this resort also for a very clear sea.  As many tourists say, in Batumi it is much dirtier. </p><p>  Another advantage of the resort of Kobuleti, according to most vacationers, is the ability to inexpensively and at the same time have a tasty lunch or breakfast.  There are not too many cafes and restaurants in Kobuleti.  But in most cases, the menu in them is very diverse, and dishes are prepared with the freshest ingredients. </p><p>  Getting to the sea from almost any Kobuleti hotel is not too long.  The fact is that this town literally stretched along the coast.  And therefore, all the streets are located in close proximity to the sea. </p>

    <h2>  Chveni Ezo Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Hotel "Chveni Ezo" is also very popular among vacationers vacationing in Kobuleti.  Tourists respond about it as being very clean and comfortable.

Each room has air conditioning, shower, refrigerator, TV.  Wi-Fi is free throughout the hotel.  According to tourists vacationing in this hotel, linen in the rooms is changed every 3 days.

In Soviet times, Kobuleti, like many other settlements on the Black Sea coast, was considered a health resort.  There were just a huge number of sanatoriums and dispensaries here.  Kobuleti gradually turned into one of the best resorts in the USSR.  During the collapse of the Soviet Union, the affairs of the city, of course, fell into decay.  However, nothing stands still, and over time the tourist infrastructure of the resort began to develop again. </p>

Swimming and sunbathing on Kobuleti beach is relatively convenient.  The fact is that the coastline here is covered with small pebbles.  You can even walk on it barefoot, which is uncharacteristic for this part of the Black Sea coast.  For example, in the same Batumi, the coastline is strewn with rather large cobblestones, and it is simply impossible to walk along it without shoes. </p><p>  A small number of people on the beach is what, among other things, is characterized by Kobuleti.  Reviews on the coastline of this resort on the Net are mostly good.  Some vacationers find the city beach of this town only a little muddy.

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Unfortunately, according to many tourists, there are not so many interesting places worth visiting in Kobuleti itself.  Most vacationers prefer to buy excursions in Batumi.  However, in terms of the availability of various sights, the resort of Kobuleti is not such an uninteresting place.  Reviews about it are not bad due to the opportunity, for example, to visit the Cicinatela amusement park.  Also in Kobuleti you can buy a fascinating tour to the Mtirala nature reserve. </p><h2>  Amusement park: reviews </h2><p>  Translated into Russian, the word "cicinatela" means "firefly."  There is an amusement park in Kobuleti only at night.  Every evening, thousands of lights are lit here.  In this regard, the name of the park was chosen.  If you wish, you can ride here on a big Ferris wheel or on some fun merry-go-round.  Experienced tourists are advised to first go around the entire park and choose the most suitable attractions, and then return to the ticket office located at the exit and purchase tickets for each of them.  Walking to the gates every time you want to ride on one or another carousel will simply be uncomfortable. </p><p>  In general, the Tsitsinatela park has earned good reviews from tourists.  Spending time here is pretty fun.  It is best, of course, to come here with the whole family. </p><h2>  Mtirala Nature Reserve </h2><p>  Including the opportunity to visit this interesting attraction, I earned good reviews from tourists in Kobuleti.  The Mtirala National Park is located in the immediate vicinity of the city.  If you wish, you can get to it, including on your own - by minibus or taxi.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reserve is 6 km <sup>2</sup> .  In the middle of the park rises Mount Mtirala, whose height is 1,500 meters.  From its top the fog does not descend all year round.  Hence its name, translated into Russian as "crying."  On the mountain and around it grows many exotic endangered plant species.  In the middle of the park is a real living corner of history - a village where people live in houses built 200 years ago. </p><h2>  Peter Fortress </h2><p>  Many experienced tourists to vacationers vacationing in Kobuleti are advised to visit this interesting attraction.  Reviews about the fortress of Peter on the Net are extremely positive.  It is located in the Mtirala nature reserve in the territory of Tsikhisdziri village.  There used to be a land road in this place, connecting western Georgia with Persia and Armenia.  Therefore, it was here that Emperor Justinian built the fortified city. </p><p>  The fortress got its name because it is located almost on a steep cliff.  In Georgian, the word "Peter" is translated as "stone."  From the fortress a wonderful view of the Black Sea opens. </p>
