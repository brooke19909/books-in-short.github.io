Only 150 meters separates this complex from clear water and a spacious beach.  And quite a bit from the center of Kemer.  In general, the location is very favorable - Antalya is also nearby, only 45 kilometers away.  However, such a location is far from the only plus of this place. </p><h2>  Tourism Center </h2>
