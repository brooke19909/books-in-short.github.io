    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The three-star hotel with the beautiful name ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù is located in the large city of Falirnaki on the island of Rhodes, owned by Greece.  It is located almost in the city center, so guests can reach all the tourist infrastructure facilities in a few minutes.  Other major cities of the island - Rhodes and Lindos - are 14 and 30 kilometers away from the hotel, respectively.  You can get to them by bus (the stop is located opposite the hotel), by taxi or by rented a car.  The airport closest to Venezia Hotel 3 * is located in Rhodes, 12 kilometers from the hotel.  So, upon arrival at the air harbor, you can literally get to Venice in a quarter of an hour.  The peculiarity of this hotel is that it is removed from the beach by a sufficiently large, according to some tourists, distance of one and a half kilometers.  However, for most guests this is not a problem, since for them the ability to take short walks is only an advantage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews of Russians about the hotel itself, its territory and location </h2><p>  The territory of Venezia Hotel 3 * our compatriots found quite large and well-groomed.  There is an outdoor pool with a sun terrace.  In the lobby there is a small shop with everything you need.  The hotel itself is very clean and tidy.  Since it is located on a hill, from it (especially from the terrace of the restaurant) a gorgeous view of the sea and the surrounding landscape opens.  The rooms are small, but it is quite possible to comfortably accommodate.  Experienced travelers are advised to take apartments with sea views.  Many tourists were pleased with the presence in some rooms of the kitchenette with a set of dishes.  There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom.  The TV accepts several Russian channels, and also has a DVD player.  Air conditioning is available at an extra cost.  But the need for this is not always the case.  Also, guests note a good cleaning of the rooms and always a smiling, pleasant maid.  Sheets and towels are always fresh and clean.  The only negative was some guests considered small showers in the bathroom.  However, according to them, it is quite possible to adapt to them. </p><p>  As for the location, the Venezia Hotel 3 * hotel is removed from the sea at a sufficient distance (about one and a half kilometers).  So on foot to the nearest beach you can walk slowly for 20-25 minutes.  Since many tourists come here with their own cars or rent a car directly in Rhodes, this does not create problems.  In addition, you can always, if desired, get to the sea and by taxi. </p>

    <h2>  Travel Comments on Catering and Staff </h2><p>  As for the food at the Venice Hotel (Rhodes), according to the majority of our compatriots, it is of high quality and quite diverse for the three-star level of the hotel.  The restaurant always has meat and fish dishes, salads, various snacks and pastries.  True, the choice of fruits is not as great as some would like, but you can always pick something up to your taste.  On Sundays, a barbecue with music and dancing is organized. </p><p>  The staff of this hotel deserve special attention.  So, all the employees here are members of one large Greek family, to which Venice belongs.  So the hotel staff makes every effort to create a family friendly atmosphere.  All the staff here are very hospitable, polite, smiling and attentive.  However, some of our compatriots were a little embarrassed by the fact that no one at the hotel spoke Russian.  However, remembering the school curriculum of the English language, you can quite explain yourself. </p>

    <h2>  Impressions of a beach holiday </h2><p>  According to some tourists, from the Venezia Hotel to the beach to go far (about 25 minutes).  However, most travelers knew in advance about this location of the hotel and specifically chose it in order to at least do a little fitness during the holidays.  Indeed, both in this hotel and in numerous restaurants in Greece, the food is very tasty, so you run the risk of gaining a few extra pounds in a week or two.  Walking to the beach will allow you to burn at least part of the calories acquired during the rest. </p><p>  The beach strip in Faliraki stretches for four whole kilometers.  You can accommodate in any place you like.  Sun loungers and parasols are available everywhere at an additional cost.  Also on most beaches there is the opportunity to use equipment for water sports. </p>
