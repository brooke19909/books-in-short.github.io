It is located between the stops "Kozhuvskaya" and "Volzhskaya".  The Pechatniki metro station was opened in December 1995 and named after the district of the same name on the Lyublinsko-Dmitrov line. </p><h2>  Lublin-Dmitrov line </h2>

Its construction began in the late 1980s, and it was put into operation in the winter of 1995.  Currently, the Lublin-Dmitrov line includes seventeen functioning stations, including the Pechatniki metro station.  The operational length of the light green branch is almost twenty-four kilometers.  The average travel time on it is thirty minutes.  It is worth noting that the tenth line of the Moscow metro until 2007 in official documents was referred to as Lublin, and today only its southern radius and directly the central part are fully constructed.  The rest is at the construction stage and, according to the plan, should be put into operation in 2014.

In turn, the history of the latter is closely intertwined with the history of the St. Nicholas-Perervinsky Monastery, which was founded in 1380-1381.  Today in official documents you can find two options for the name of this area - Pechatnikovo and Pechatniki.  According to the first version, the name of the area came from the name of a certain Vladimir Pechatnikov, a servant killed in a Livonian campaign.  Mention of him is found in the annals of 1558.  According to another version, in the eighteenth century in the village, which was just at this very place, chintz were painted in large numbers.  To speed up the process, residents used a special wooden mold with a carved relief pattern, which was then painted with different colors.  Covering chintz with variegated color patterns, the masters seemed to ‚Äúprint‚Äù.  Subsequently, the whole area began to be called Printers.  As you can see, the versions are very different, but the essence of this does not change.

The latter means that this stop was built in an open way from unified prefabricated structures made of reinforced concrete.  The depth in this case is not more than five meters.  A distinctive feature of the station is the presence of several additional floor support, which are parallel to the enfilade axis.  The track walls are faced with black and gray marble, pink marble is used to design the columns.  As for the floor, it is laid out with multi-colored granite, which forms an ornament of the correct form.  Luminaires of an original design mounted in a wavy ceiling form the basis of lighting.  Of particular note is the large panel located in the lobby and made using a special technique of painting on metal.  The painting was made by artist V. A. Bubnov and is dedicated to the work and rest of Muscovites.  Outside, the lobby of the Pechatniki metro station (Pechatniki district) is decorated in red and white.

    <h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  Access to the city from this stop is via stairs through the east lobby.  From here, passengers can get to the streets of Polbin, Guryanova and Shosseinaya.  The western lobby is currently closed, but even under opening conditions, due to its small size, it can only be used as an exit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro printers district" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11964/392127.jpg" width="573"></div>  It should be noted that in the future the leadership of the Moscow metro is going to extend the Kakhovskaya line directly to the Kashirskaya station.  The corresponding transfer will be carried out through this unused exit of the western lobby of the Pechatniki metro station.  The construction of this interchange hub is planned in the very near future.  In addition, there are exits to the connecting branch (two ways) in front of the Pechatniki station in the electric depot, which currently serves the line in question.
