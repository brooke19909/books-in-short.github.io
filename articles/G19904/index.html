They are inextricably linked with emotions.  These two factors were the very first manifestations of human psychology.  A person cannot live without experiencing emotions.  Their expression occurs in the form of fear, joy, anger or tenderness.  <span>Human emotions and feelings</span> are a way of adaptation and a reaction to the influence of external factors. </p><p>  Feelings are called emotions associated with emotions caused by certain factors.  There are several types of such manifestations. </p><p>  The highest feelings of a person are the result of emotions that arise as a result of the realization or non-fulfillment of spiritual needs.  This does not include the lower sensations associated with the satisfaction of physical needs for food, heat, water, air, etc. </p><p>  Higher feelings, in turn, are divided into intellectual, moral and aesthetic.  They are inextricably linked with social life and express a person‚Äôs attitude to the events taking place around.  The highest sensations of a person are determined by upbringing and the prevailing worldview. </p><p>  The moral feelings include a sense of collectivism, duty and responsibility.  A sense of duty is laid in the <span>human mind</span> during the formation of the individual.  It differs from the simple knowledge of its duties by the presence of emotions and feelings. </p><p>  If the performance of certain actions gives pleasure, then the person experiences joy.  The comprehension of actions and their assessment are associated with the experience of such feelings as conscience.  Satisfaction with correctly performed actions causes a state of calm conscience. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mental activity causes <span>intellectual feelings.</span>  They are associated with the process of thinking and cognitive work.  Such feelings include doubt, surprise, satisfaction and confidence. </p><p>  In the process of his <span>activity, a person</span> learns new, unknown facts.  The first feeling he experiences is surprise.  This factor is an incentive to new knowledge.  In the process of studying, a feeling of doubt arises if some aspects do not correspond to the existing ideas.  This encourages verification and revision of data.  As a result, there is a feeling of confidence in their beliefs.  Well, as a result of the work performed, satisfaction arises.  Therefore, it is important to note that all these emotional manifestations are related to each other and make up a certain sequence. </p><p>  Aesthetics and understanding of beauty is an important aspect of a person‚Äôs psychological development.  Aesthetic feelings of a person are the result of the study and contemplation of works of art, architecture or advances in technology.  A strong manifestation of these feelings occurs in contact with nature. </p><p>  It is impossible to accurately answer the question of how many feelings a person has.  It depends on the moral education of everyone.  For some people, the manifestation of feelings and emotions is not so obvious.  Principal personalities are stable in the manifestation of their emotional qualities.  Emotionally unstable people often do not have constant beliefs and principles.  People are not the same in their psychological manifestations. </p><p>  There are also lower feelings, which are also inherent in people.  This is envy, greed, selfishness, etc.  The feeling of indifference to the <span>manifestations of the outside</span> world is also not the best emotional manifestation. </p><p>  People react differently to the situation.  For some, the results of activity give rise to the desire for excellence, improving their qualities, that is, they are an additional incentive.  Others fall into apathy, despair and frustration.  Feelings and <span>emotions of a person</span> form his character and manner of behavior in society. </p>
