Most often they use them to browse the Internet, read books, check mail and social networks, play.  For those who are interested in the last paragraph, this article is being written.  In it we will give a list that includes the best gaming tablets.  Before that, we will describe what exactly is required of the ‚Äúgaming‚Äù device, what features it has. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><p>  Since we are talking about <span>gaming computers</span> and tablets, it is logical that they are mainly designed to run games.  Of course, these are not the most basic ‚Äútic-tac-toe‚Äù or ‚Äúfilords‚Äù, but the most colorful and realistic products: Asphalt Urban, Dead Trigger2, Clash of Clans and others.  All these and many other games are cumbersome, because they require a significant amount of resources and high ability of the device‚Äôs graphics to transmit an image to play in the best possible way.  Only powerful <span>tablet computers</span> can provide them - that is exactly what we will be looking for as part of this article.  In addition, special attention should be paid to the battery.  This is a significant factor that determines how long your device can work. </p><h2>  Graphics </h2><p>  To begin with, what most ‚Äúcatches the eye‚Äù - with the image that the user sees.  Of course, the more colorful the game, the more interesting it is to play it.  Therefore, computers that are purchased to work with the appropriate type of content should demonstrate high graphics performance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most colorful displays are deservedly recognized as those installed on the "apple" devices.  Therefore, most likely, the industry leader in terms of image quality is the iPad Air Pro, which runs on Apple's video processor.  Together with these, these gaming tablets are equipped with the world-famous Retina screen, capable of transmitting the maximum number of colors.  Not surprisingly, playing on this device is a pleasure! </p><p>  Of course, there are other devices that can be classified as ‚Äúhigh-quality gaming tablets‚Äù in terms of graphics capabilities.  For example, this is the Korean <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Tab S, Sony Xperia Z3 and even the budget 2013 Google Nexus 7.  However, they all lag behind the Apple product (according to customer reviews).  In practice, it is difficult to compare some devices for the reason that different models of graphic chips and processors are installed on them. </p><h2>  Performance </h2>

    <p>  Another important component of the tablet, which will be considered ideal for playing games, is the processor.  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device ensures its smooth operation.  As expected, the TOP of gaming tablets includes devices that do not ‚Äúslow down‚Äù when switching between tabs or when the processor is under heavy load.  Their processing power, as a rule, is enough in order not to disrupt the game. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for which ‚Äúfilling‚Äù is used on the market, there are several options.  For example, on Apple, again, it has its own A7 processor.  Some tablets use Nvidia Tegra 4, others use developments from Qualcomm and MediaTek.  Finding out which processor is better is easy.  Pay attention to what clock frequency the gaming tablets Samsung, Apple and other brands are capable of showing.  The higher this number, the faster the device works.  In Chinese inexpensive models, it is an order of magnitude lower than that of the flagships mentioned above. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  When you think about how to find the best gaming tablets, think about the battery.  When you think about it for the second time, it will be too late to do anything, since the tablet will be in your hands.  Therefore, look in advance at the capacity of the battery that comes with the device.  It is measured in units of mAh (milliampere-hours).  The logic is simple: the higher this number, the longer your device will last.  This, again, depends on the charge consumption.  For small 7-inch devices that consume relatively little energy, 3.5-4 thousand mAh of charge will be enough;  while larger gaming tablets (10 inches) need higher rates. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  An important role is played by the OS with which the tablet works.  Obviously, now the market leadership (in terms of numbers) is held by Android - a platform on which more than 60-70% of all users of smartphones and tablets work.  Behind it comes Apple with its iOS - a less popular, but also very good operating system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In principle, the user has a sharp choice between these two alternatives.  There is still a Windows platform, but it is available on fewer tablets.  The number and availability of games in thematic directories (Google Play and Appstore) depends on which OS is used.  Not all games are published in both stores. </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  So, after analyzing the above information, you can make a kind of rating models, consisting of 10 tablets.  We sort it just in accordance with the criteria described above. </p>

    <p>  The first place is taken by the <span>Apple iPad Air 2</span> (more precisely, Air Pro may take its place now).  The tablet is equipped with powerful processors and a high-quality screen, playing on it is a real pleasure. </p><p>  Next is another flagship - Samsung Galaxy Tab S. The price is slightly lower, but the quality of the device allows us to say that it is a real gaming tablet: powerful, hardy in terms of battery and with a colorful screen. </p>

    <p>  Logically, the three should be closed by the <span>NVIDIA Shield</span> device <span>.</span>  You may not have heard of him, but this is a specialized platform for playing games.  It is presented in the form of a console with a joystick for control and a 5-inch display;  NVIDIA‚Äôs powerful Tegra 4 processor allows you to run anything without hovering.  The only problem is that the device is not as universal as tablets in the first two places.  Therefore, we place it only in the third position. </p><p>  In fourth place in our ranking, Sony's new product is the Xperia Z Tablet Compact.  Since the device came out recently, its price is quite high - this is the only minus.  For the rest, it is ahead of its competitors, as it has a colorful screen with sharp features (Bravia technology), a powerful processor, low weight and dimensions (which is also important).  Another thing worth mentioning is the waterproofness of the gadget. </p>

    <h2>  Continuation </h2><p>  On the 5th and 6th places of our rating are the development from HTC - the Google Nexus 9 tablet (which replaces the 7th generation Nexus), as well as the compact iPad Mini 3. Both devices have an attractive design and high performance, but place them in the beginning of the rating is impossible - the small size does not make them hardy.  Plus, again, the price of both the ‚Äúapple‚Äù and the new product from HTC is somewhat overpriced. </p>

    <p>  The 8th and 9th positions were taken by budget tablets: <span>Nexus 7</span> and <span>Xiaomi MiPad.</span>  The first is the older generation of Google Nexus, which was developed by Asus.  It is equipped with 4 cores, 2 GB of RAM and costs only about 200 dollars.  The same applies to MiPad, only this is the brainchild of a young Chinese company with an affordable price and even more powerful technical parameters.  Games on them just ‚Äúfly‚Äù, despite the low price of devices and small dimensions. </p><p>  Closes our ‚ÄúTOP‚Äù Lenovo Yoga Tablet - a well-known transformer with a special changeable body for working from different positions.  But not only makes this tablet gaming.  Again, a high-tech display and a high processor clock speed - this allows us to attribute it to such gadgets that make it possible to run any games without any problems! </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  Well, you say: yes, the article lists different gaming tablets (some of them are also present), but how to make a choice?  How not to miscalculate and purchase such a device that will best meet your requirements? </p><p>  First, pay attention to the price.  Still, the range of models is wide enough, you can find a gadget on any wallet.  Secondly, identify for yourself a couple of attractive devices and read reviews about them, see reviews.  Next, the choice will come by itself and will be obvious to you. </p>
