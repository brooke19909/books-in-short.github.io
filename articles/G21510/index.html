Age of Peter 1</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The history of Russia is diverse and interesting.  Peter 1 was able to exert a huge influence on her.  In reforming activities, he relied on the experience of Western countries, but acted on the basis of the needs of Russia, while not having a specific system and program for transformation.  The first Russian emperor was able to lead the country from the "troubled" time into a progressive European world, forced to respect the state and reckon with it.  Of course, he was a key figure in the formation of the state. </p><h2>  Politics and Board </h2><p>  Consider the politics and rule of Peter 1 briefly.  He was able to create all the necessary conditions for a wide acquaintance with Western civilization, and the process of abandoning the old foundations was rather painful for Russia.  An important feature of the reforms was that they affected all social strata; this history of the reign of Peter 1 was very different from the activities of his predecessors. </p><p>  But in general, Peter's policy was aimed at strengthening the country, introducing it to culture.  True, he often acted from a position of strength, nevertheless, he was able to create a powerful country, with the emperor at the head, having absolute unlimited power. </p><p>  Before Peter 1, Russia was far behind economically and technically from other countries, but conquest and transformation in all areas of life led to the strengthening, expansion of the borders of the empire and its development. </p><p>  The policy of Peter 1 was to overcome the crisis of traditionalism through many reforms, as a result of which modernized Russia became one of the main participants in international political games.  She actively lobbied for her interests.  Her authority grew significantly, and Peter himself was considered an example of a great reformer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the beginning of the reign of Peter 1" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/404271.jpg" width="360"></div>

Despite the reconstruction, the country did not get rid of the system of serfdom.  On the contrary, the economy rested on it, a stable army consisted of peasants.  This was the main contradiction in the ongoing reforms of Peter the Great, so the prerequisites for the crisis in the future appeared. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Peter 1 (1672-1725) was the youngest son in the marriage of Romanov A.M. and Naryshkina N.K. Learning the alphabet began on March 12, 1677, when he was not yet five years old.  Peter 1, whose biography has been full of bright events since childhood, later became a great emperor. </p><p>  Tsarevich studied very willingly, loved various stories and reading books.  When the tsarina found out about this, she ordered to give him history books from the palace library. </p><p>  In 1676, Peter 1, whose biography at that time was marked by the death of his father, remained on the education of his older brother.  <span>Roman Alekseevich Romanov</span> was appointed heir <span>,</span> but due to poor health, they announced the ten-year-old Peter.  The Miloslavsky did not want to come to terms with this, and so the Streletsky revolt was provoked, after which both Peter and Ivan were on the throne. </p>

The prince never received church and secular education; he existed on his own.  Energetic, very agile, he often played battles with his peers.

The beginning of the reign of Peter 1 was marked by a rebellion organized by Sophia, seeking to get rid of her brother.  She did not want to give power to his hands.  In 1689, the prince had to take refuge in the <span>Trinity-Sergius Lavra.</span>  He was joined by regiments and a large part of the yard, and Sister Sophia was removed from the board and imprisoned by force in the monastery. </p><p>  Peter the Great established himself on the throne. From that moment on, his biography became even more eventful both in his personal life and in state activity.  He participated in campaigns in Turkey, went as a volunteer to Europe, where he took a course in artillery, studied shipbuilding in England, and made many reforms in Russia.  He was married twice and had 14 officially recognized children. </p><h2>  Personal life of Peter I </h2><p>  <span>Lopukhina Evdokia</span> became the first wife of the king, with whom they were married in 1689.  The mother chose the bride to the great sovereign, and he did not feel tenderness for her, but only hostility.  In 1698 she was forcibly tonsured a nun.  Personal life is a separate page of the book, in which the story of Peter the Great could be described. Marta, the Livonian beauty, who was captured by the Russians, met on his way, and the sovereign, seeing her in Menshikov‚Äôs house, no longer wanted to leave her.  After their wedding, she became Empress Catherine I. </p>

    <p>  Peter loved her very much, she bore him many children, but when he found out about her betrayal, he decided not to bequeath his throne to his wife.  The king had a difficult relationship with his son from his first marriage.  The emperor died without having to leave a will. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hobbies of Peter I </h2><p>  As a child, the future great Tsar Peter 1 collected ‚Äúamusing‚Äù regiments from peers and launched battles.  In later life, it was these perfectly trained regiments that became the main guard.  Peter was very inquisitive by nature, and therefore he was interested in many crafts and sciences.  The Navy is another of his passions; he was seriously engaged in shipbuilding.  He mastered fencing, horse riding, pyrotechnics, <span>turning,</span> and many other sciences. </p><h2>  The beginning of the reign </h2><p>  The beginning of the reign of Peter 1 was a double kingdom, since he shared power with his brother Ivan.  After the deposition of Sister Sophia, Peter at first did not rule the state.  Already at the age of 22, the young king turned his eyes to the throne, and all his hobbies began to take on real shape for the country.  His first Azov campaign was undertaken in 1695, in the spring of 1696 - the second.  Then the sovereign begins to build a fleet. </p><h2>  The appearance of Peter I </h2><p>  From infancy, Peter was a fairly large kid.  Even as a child, he was handsome both in face and figure, and among his peers he was above all.  In moments of excitement and anger, the king's face twitched nervously, and this frightened those around him.  The Duke of Saint-Simon gave his exact description: ‚ÄúTsar Peter 1 - tall, well-built, a little thin.  A round face and a <span>high forehead,</span> eyebrows of a beautiful shape.  The nose is a little short, but not striking, large lips, dark skin.  The king has black eyes of a beautiful form, lively and very penetrating.  The look is very welcoming and magnificent. ‚Äù </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of Russia Peter 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/404268.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <h2>  Era </h2><p>  Of great interest is the era of Peter the Great, since this is the beginning of the growth and all-round development of Russia, its transformation into a great power.  Thanks to the transformation of the monarch and his activities, a management and education system was built over several decades, a regular army and navy were formed.  Industrial enterprises grew, crafts and trades developed, and domestic and foreign trade was established.  There was a constant provision of jobs to the population of the country. </p><h2>  Culture in Russia under Peter I </h2><p>  Russia changed dramatically when Peter ascended the throne.  His reforms were of great importance to the country.  Russia has become stronger, constantly expanding its borders.  It has become a European state with which other countries had to reckon.  Not only military affairs and trade were developed, but there were also cultural achievements.  The New Year began to be reckoned from January 1, a ban on beards appeared, the first Russian newspaper and foreign books in translation came out.  Career growth without education has become impossible. </p><p>  Having ascended the throne, the great emperor made many changes, and the history of the reign of Peter 1 is diverse and majestic.  One of the most important decrees stated that the custom of transferring the throne to descendants only through the male line was abolished, and any heir could be appointed by the will of the king.  The decree was very unusual, and he had to justify and seek the consent of his subjects, forcing him to swear.  But death did not give him the opportunity to put it into practice. </p><h2>  Etiquette in the time of Peter <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Significant changes occurred during the time of Peter 1 and in etiquette.  The courtiers wore European clothes, the beard could be preserved only by paying a heavy fine.  It has become fashionable to wear wigs according to the Western model.  Women who were not previously present at the palace receptions have now become obligatory guests at them, their education has improved, since it was believed that the girl should be able to dance, know foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand play musical instruments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="politics of peter 1" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/404272.jpg" width="523"></div>

    <h2>  The character of Peter I </h2><p>  The nature of the monarch was controversial.  Peter is quick-tempered and at the same time cold-blooded, wasteful and mean, tough and merciful, very demanding and often condescending, rude and at the same time gentle.  This is how they describe him who knew him.  But at the same time, the great emperor was a whole nature, his life was completely devoted to serving the state, it was to him that he dedicated his life. </p><p>  Peter 1 was very economical when he spent money on personal needs, but he did not skimp on the construction of his palaces and his beloved wife.  The emperor believed that the easiest way to reduce vices was to reduce his needs, and he should set an example for his subjects.  Two of his features are clearly visible here: one - the great and powerful emperor, whose palace in Peterhof is not inferior to Versailles, the other - the thrifty owner, setting an example of economical life for his subjects.  Parsimony and prudence were striking and European residents. </p><h2>  The reform </h2><p>  The beginning of the reign of Peter the Great was marked by many reforms related mainly to military affairs, often carried out by force, and did not always lead to the desired result.  But after 1715 they became more systematic.  They touched on the reform from the first years of the <span>Boyar Duma,</span> which turned out to be ineffective in running the country.  If we consider the reign of Peter 1 briefly, we can highlight several important points.  He organized the Near Office.  Many colleges were introduced, each responsible for its own direction (taxes, foreign policy, trade, courts, etc.).  <span>Judicial reform has</span> undergone radical changes.  A fiscal position was introduced for the control of employees.  Reforms affected all aspects of life: military, church, financial, commercial, autocratic.  Thanks to a radical restructuring of all spheres of life, Russia began to be considered a great power, which Peter 1 sought. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="era of Peter 1" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13346/405533.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Peter I: important years </h2><p>  If we consider the important dates in the life and work of the monarch, then Peter 1, whose years were marked by various events, at some time intervals was most active: </p><ul><li>  1700: Peace Treaty of Constantinople, Northern War, near Narva - defeat of troops. </li><li>  1721: Industrialists are allowed to buy peasants, the establishment of the Synod, Nishtadt peace with Sweden, Peter received the title of Great Emperor. </li><li>  1722: Caspian expedition and historical joining of the coast of this sea to Russia. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reign of Peter 1" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/404274.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><p>  The beginning of the reign of Peter 1 was from the very beginning built on the struggle for the state.  He was not called the Great for nothing.  Dates of the reign of Peter 1: 1682-1725.  Being a strong-willed, decisive, talented, not sparing neither time nor effort to achieve the goal, the king was strict towards everyone, but first of all to himself.  Often ruthless, but precisely because of his energy, determination, assertiveness and some cruelty, Russia has changed dramatically, becoming a Great Power.  The era of Peter 1 changed the face of the state for many centuries.  And the city he founded became the capital of the empire for 300 years.  And now St. Petersburg is one of the most beautiful cities in Russia and proudly bears its name to the glory of the great founder. </p>
