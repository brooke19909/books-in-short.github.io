  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Relax in a luxurious five-star hotel in a Chinese resort: myth or reality?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The vacation period, as you know, must be carried out exactly as you want a specific person.  Following this rule, many citizens prefer trips to foreign resorts.  In such a situation, it is very important to begin preparations for the upcoming trip in advance, choosing, for starters, the direction that the vacationer had dreamed of ‚Äúat five minutes‚Äù for the whole working year. </p><p>  What destinations are currently attractive to tourists?  When considering the list, you must specify Egypt, Turkey, Greece, as well as Thailand, Vietnam, China and much more.  Of course, the options differ from each other in terms of cost, so the selection is carried out taking into account the material capabilities of vacationers.  If you try hard and wisely approach the issue, it is quite realistic to save maximum material costs when choosing a direction.  However, for those citizens who do not want to infringe on themselves in something, almost endless possibilities are revealed.  But, so that the mentioned factors correspond to reality, this category of travelers should also not forget about preliminary preparation. </p><p>  What is included in the most important events?  First you need to take care of the choice of apartments for temporary residence.  For example, if you plan to visit resorts in China, a hotel can be an excellent option. <noindex>  <span>holiday inn sanya bay 5</span> </noindex>  .  It is located 15 kilometers from the city of Sanya, has a well-equipped private beach and an impressive adjacent territory.  The institution belongs to the five-star category, the presence in which, I must say, is quite justified.  To make sure of this is quite simple, just read the reviews of former guests, a significant part of which is exclusively positive in color. </p><p>  Some people still have associations with China and all of China as low-quality goods and services of low quality.  In fact, such an opinion is erroneous.  Of course, one cannot argue that the Celestial Empire is a country of contrasts (slums here border on luxurious and majestic areas).  But when it comes to the second category, travelers cannot but be surprised and not be amazed.  This also applies to the previously described hotel, able to satisfy the needs of even the most picky and sophisticated guests.  The institution has luxurious rooms equipped with everything necessary.  In addition, the infrastructure of the complex is also rich.  So, guests are invited to visit restaurants, a beauty salon, a thermal pool and much more <strong>.</strong> </p></div></article>
