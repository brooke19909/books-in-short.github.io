  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why the microphone does not work and how to deal with this problem</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, almost every Internet user uses video and audio communications.  Correspondence, although they remain relevant, but the convenience of a practically personal meeting is obvious.  The more programs are released, the more additional devices are required by the computer.  Those who are faced with the choice of a laptop know that 95% of laptops from the factory are equipped with a built-in microphone and about the same are equipped with a miniature video camera.  The manufacturer is well aware that sooner or later, but the computer will periodically use the camcorder and microphone as a means of communication.  With desktop computers, things are a little more difficult.  You have to buy <span>additional equipment</span> and get familiar with such concepts as ‚Äúmicrophone connection‚Äù and ‚Äúcamcorder setup‚Äù. </p><p>  The microphone connection does not end with the fact that you need to connect the ‚Äúpink‚Äù plugs to the connector of the same color.  Some tweaking is also required.  To do this, go to the ‚Äúcontrol panel‚Äù, then ‚Äúsounds and audio devices‚Äù and select ‚Äúmicrophone test‚Äù.  Suppose everything is correct there, but the sound is not removed.  Let's try to figure out why the microphone does not work.  Portable pickups, as a rule, have no defects in the wire.  The chance to buy a microphone with a broken line is incredibly small.  That is why initially check whether you did everything correctly.  The most common and commonplace mistake is when a hastily inserted plug does not fully enter the connector.  At first glance, the microphone indicator does not seem to be immediately noticeable, and now and then it shows that some sound is still being removed, but when listening, nothing is heard except for the low-frequency hum. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, we will understand in more detail in the settings.  Click ‚ÄúStart‚Äù - ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù and select ‚ÄúSound and Audio Devices‚Äù.  We go through the ‚ÄúSpeech‚Äù tab and select ‚ÄúVolume‚Äù.  We find in the window that opens and click "Options", "Properties" and check if the checkmark in the microphone volume settings box is checked.  If not, then with one click we eliminate this problem.  This is the first way to find out why the microphone is not working. </p><p>  If there is no effect from such manipulations, we proceed further.  A check mark confirms that the microphone is turned on, but you should also click the settings button in the window and find where you can turn on <span>the microphone gain.</span>  This function is necessary for budget and miniature sound pickups, since the level of their perception of ambient sounds is extremely small.  This function gives the sound card or computer processor the capabilities of an amplifier.  To check the result of the work done, go to the ‚ÄúSpeech‚Äù tab and click ‚ÄúCheck‚Äù.  If now you have not received the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy does the microphone not work‚Äù, then there are few options. </p><p>  The first is a problem in your computer.  The connector itself could break, or the <span>sound card</span> could be damaged <span>.</span>  The solution will cost from $ 5.  Either you buy a new card, or you get a microphone with a connection to a USB port.  Such microphones are detected by the computer automatically, if this does not happen, then the problem is solved quickly.  Through the same ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù in the properties of the microphone you need to change the device from which you want to shoot sound.  In the device selection column, select the microphone you purchased.  So simple, almost every user can figure out why the microphone does not work and how to deal with it. </p><p>  Whether it‚Äôs a built-in microphone.  No need to look for which one to buy: cheaper or more expensive, small or bigger, and the like.  Everything is included in the package and fits perfectly with each other.  But now, it turns out that it is not functioning.  Why the <span>microphone</span> selected and built in by the manufacturer <span>does not work is</span> more difficult to understand.  If you carried out the same actions as described above, but there is no result, then you have a direct road to the service center.  The built-in microphone, like any other, is replaceable.  Such a service is inexpensive, about $ 10 with work.  Inexpensive, fast and for a long time. </p>
