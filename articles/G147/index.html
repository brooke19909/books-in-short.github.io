    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A look into the past </h2><p>  The location of modern Bodrum is the territory of ancient Halicarnassus, which was founded in the ninth century BC.  In the fourth century, by decree of the satrap Mavsol, the city became the capital of Caria, in addition, six more settlements joined it.  All of them were united by a wall.  After the death of this ruler, a mausoleum was erected, which became one of the wonders of the world. </p><p>  The city was destroyed in 334 BC by the troops of Alexander the Great.  In the Middle Ages a fishing village appeared in its place.  In 1402, the construction of St. Peter's Castle began there.  For the construction, stones were taken from the Halicarnassus tomb. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Sixty kilometers from Bodrum is an international airport.  The Havas bus runs regularly to the city.  The trip will cost eight euros.  If you use a taxi, you will have to spend five to six times more. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  Bodrum (Turkey) - the most popular resort, providing the opportunity to soak up the gentle sun.  Most of the beaches are owned by hotels.  These are, as a rule, small areas covered with pebbles, or artificially created concrete platforms with fine bulk sand. </p><p>  The surroundings of Bodrum are famous for the presence of many bays, the most popular of them are Gumbet and Bitez.  Over the clear waters of the latter, the Blue Flag proudly flies.  As for Bitez, this is a great place for parties and dances until the morning.  In the towns of Gumyushluk and Ortakent there are many fish restaurants that stretch along the coast by an endless chain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since the shores are quite steep, descending in steps to the sea, in some expensive hotels there are special elevators that deliver vacationers to the beach. </p><p>  Lovers of solitude and romance are sent to Bitez, Turtugates or Torbu.  The beaches in these places are not as crowded as in Bodrum itself.  At the same time, the most remote of them is only an hour away from the city center. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  Bodrum (Turkey) - a resort that can boast of not so exhausting hot summers as in Alanya or Antalya.  Even in July and August - traditionally the hottest months - the thermometer rises no higher than thirty degrees of heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bodrum turkey prices" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/457983.jpg" width="500"></div>
