    <h2>  <span>We knit a plaid:</span> preparatory stage </h2><p>  We will perform this version of the product with a hook.  To make the blanket warm, the yarn must be thick.  The ideal thread in this case is 140 meters in 100 grams.  We take the hook under them No. 6. It is desirable that the composition of the yarn be a natural material: wool or cotton.  If you still want to take the thread with the addition of acrylic, then it should be no more than 50%.  <span>We will knit a plaid</span> with our own hands according to the following description with a simple pattern - columns with one crochet.  It looks beautiful, the structure of the canvas is smooth and quite dense.  The product can be made plain or striped.  In this case, pick up threads of any color, but their thickness should be the same.  A blanket made of melange yarn looks very beautiful and interesting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to knit a plaid with your own hands? </h2><p>  We crochet a chain of 120 air loops.  We knit with single crochet in straight and reverse rows the fabric of the size you need.  Remember that at the beginning of each row, the first column is replaced by 3 lift air loops.  When the product reaches the desired size, cut the thread and fasten.  Next, we perform a fringe along the edge of all sides of the plaid.  Cut the thread into pieces of 40 centimeters.  Add four elements together.  Next, bend the workpiece in half and stretch into each extreme loop.  The ends of the threads are tucked into the resulting loop and tightened.  Thus, we draw all the fringe brushes.  DIY plaid made of yarn.  Next, we consider the option of knitting a similar product from motifs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself crocheted plaid" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/364541.jpg?1396355212525" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Square elements as the basis of the original plaid </h2><p>  Next, we talk about how to make a knitted blanket using knitting needles and yarn from motifs.  They can be of different shapes: triangles, rectangles, circles.  But it is most convenient to create such a product from square elements.  We select yarn of different colors, but of the same thickness and footage.  As for the pattern, for the implementation of warm blankets, they often use shawl and <span>hosiery knitting, a</span> pearl pattern, and a ‚Äúcheckerboard‚Äù.  We perform a square pattern: we knit 20 loops with the selected pattern and measure the width of the resulting workpiece.  Then we execute the motive until its length becomes equal to the width.  Based on the obtained sample, we calculate the number of such elements necessary for the plaid.  Next, we knit the desired number of motives.  You can connect them together using the stitching method.  In this case, a <span>"mattress" seam is used.</span>  The places of bonding look invisible and smooth to them.  Those craftswomen who possess crochet skills can combine motifs with a "walk step".  A product decorated in this way will have a beautiful border-like structure around each square.  We carry out fringe as described in the previous master class. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY fleece blanket" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/364536.jpg?1396355251253" width="400"></div>

For work, we prepare the materials indicated in the list: </p><ul><li>  fleece fabric in two colors - 135 cm and 315 cm each; </li><li>  sewing machine; </li><li>  cotton and kapron threads (for quilting); </li><li>  tailor pins; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  <span>centimeter tape</span> ; </li><li>  iron. </li></ul><h2>  Steps for completing a fleece blanket </h2><p>  How to sew a plaid with your own hands, we learn from the instructions.  To make the back of the product from a larger piece of fabric, we cut one rectangular piece 92.5 x 115 cm. From the remaining flap we make 10 blanks of a square shape 25x25 cm. And we make exactly the same elements from another piece of textile.  We sew the squares together, alternating them in color.  Leave on allowances of 1.5 cm. We carry out 5 strips consisting of 4 elements.  On the wrong side, smooth the fabric and seams.  We sew the strips together.  The upper part of the plaid is ready.  We fold the back of the product (large cut) together with the front faces inward.  Having retreated 1.5 cm from the edge, we grind these parts together.  When a piece of 15-20 cm remains unstitched, we turn the blanket through this hole.  Iron the product, make out the hole with a <span>hidden seam.</span>  With kapron threads for quilting, we sew the seams of the front side of the plaid.  Everything, a blanket is ready to decorate your sofa or chair.  The size of the product is approximately 90x113 cm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a plaid do it yourself" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/364546.jpg?1396355295483" width="600"></div>
