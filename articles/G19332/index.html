    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  ‚ÄúBristol‚Äù is a hotel (St. Petersburg), which many liked.  It has a good location: the Frunze district in which it is located is convenient for seeing many sights of the Northern capital.  Another plus is the proximity of the metro.  A hypermarket is located opposite the entrance, and there is an excellent cafe nearby where you can dine inexpensively.  Many note the impeccable work of the staff, especially the reception staff at the Bristol Hotel. </p><p>  The reviews of those who lived in it with young children indicate that there is no additional charge for breakfast for babies. </p><p>  Another advantage is the availability of two elevators for a relatively small number of rooms.  The only drawback for those whose room was facing the courtyard was the not very beautiful view from the window. </p>
