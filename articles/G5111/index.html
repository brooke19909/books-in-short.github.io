    <h2>  Hane Sun 5 *: reviews, negative comments </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not a single hotel is insured against negative reviews.  A number of shortcomings and shortcomings are also in the Hane Sun ex Side West Resort <span>Hotel (Turkey, Side).</span>  Based on the comments of tourists, it is worth noting the following points: </p><ul><li>  in the attic rooms are very stuffy even with air conditioning on; </li><li>  room cleaning consists exclusively in the replacement of towels and bed linen (floors do not wash, do not wipe dust); </li><li>  waiters pay close attention to German tourists, and guests from other countries have to wait a long time for their order; </li><li>  no animation in Russian; </li><li>  for the use of beach towels you need to pay 1 euro; </li><li>  the cleaning of the hotel is very weak, and therefore there is a lot of garbage in public places; </li><li>  the hotel photographer is unprofessional; moreover, he does not very politely treat guests; </li><li>  many hotel employees persistently pretend that they do not know either Russian or English until they are given tips; </li><li>  in the wardrobe there is only a bar for hangers, and shelves are not provided; </li><li>  almost all the food in the restaurant is fat and spicy, and therefore it’s rather difficult to create a menu for the child; </li><li>  using a safe in the room is quite expensive, and therefore it is better to purchase special locks for suitcases; </li><li>  at the distribution in the restaurant there are always long lines; </li><li>  animation is sluggish and uninteresting. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  To understand the specifics of this hotel, you should first deal with the contingent of vacationers.  Most of the guests are pensioners from Germany (in general, the hotel is focused on Germans).  Thus, guests do not have to rely on vibrant and fiery entertainment.  Everything is very quiet, decorous and listless.  Thus, this hotel is chosen by lovers of a relaxing holiday.  For a family vacation with children, this option will not be the best, because there are not so many entertainments for kids, and the animation is only in German. </p><p>  The beach makes a good impression.  Despite the fact that it is located quite far from the hotel (approximately 10-15 minutes walk), your efforts will be fully justified.  You will be taken to the clean coast with soft sand.  A huge number of sunbeds located under a canopy eliminates unpleasant situations with a lack of places.  And in order to deserve the location of the staff and make employees remember the Russian language, it is enough to give a small tip, as well as smile.  Given the proximity to popular tourist sites, you won’t have to pay for excursions.  You can inspect all the most interesting objects on your own. </p>
