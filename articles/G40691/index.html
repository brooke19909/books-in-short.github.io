  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guilin: attractions, interesting places, city history, photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  China is gradually opening its borders to tourists.  One of the first such cities is Guilin, which could even earn the status of ‚Äúthe best under heaven‚Äù.  Although the locality has long been the pride of local politicians, foreign delegations carry here, it is one of the most environmentally friendly cities in China. </p><h2>  Peach blossom river </h2><p>  Guilin's main attraction is the Li River.  According to tourists, in order to see the beauty of the city in a short period of time, it is best to go on a river cruise.  During the voyage, you can see the most beautiful mountains, old and modern buildings that create a strong contrast due to the randomness of the buildings.  In the city and the district there are many gardens and small farms, where most residents work. </p><p>  The peculiarity of the river is that there are a huge number of peach trees on its banks, hence the name.  A picturesque pond at any time of the year, with a total length of 25 kilometers.  It flows in a calcareous bed, therefore it is crystal clear. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mumonthemove.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Li River" class="if uuid-2560878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2560878.jpg"></div><h2>  The mountains </h2><p>  The main attractions of Guilin are the mountains.  And the first one tourists are going to look at is the Elephant trunk.  Its shape resembles an elephant, which lowered its trunk into the river.  This is a kind of symbol of the village. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Between the "trunk" and the "body" of the mountain there is a cave - the Water Moon.  As tourists say, it‚Äôs better to come here on the full moon, from what you see you want to write poetry. </p><p>  The inner walls of the cave are strewn with ancient inscriptions, the most famous of which belongs to the local poet Lu Yu, who worked under the rule of <span>the Song Dynasty.</span> </p><p>  If you rise a little higher, another cave will appear, the so-called "elephant eye."  And at the very top of the mountain is a cylindrical pagoda. </p><p>  Mount Yao is the highest peak of the city, 909 meters.  It is recommended to come here in early March, when the flowering of azaleas begins.  This attraction of Guilin is located 10 kilometers from the city, on the east side.  On one of the slopes of the mountain is the Yao Temple, which was erected in the period from 221 to 206.  Opposite this building is the ‚Äúblessed field‚Äù, where under any weather conditions there is always a crop.  There are also two temples here: Bailu (600 meters) and Zhuzheng (200 meters). </p><p>  A cable car runs to the top.  There is also a tea institute near the mountain, where you can stay for a tasting after the tour. </p><p>  And to see the whole city at a glance, you should go to the mountain Folded brocade.  There is a steep stone climb up the stairs to the pavilions with a beautiful view.  And in the mountain itself there is a cave where 90 statues of Buddha are installed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uchinatravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Elephant trunk mountain" class="if uuid-2560880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2560880.jpg"></div><h2>  Spruce and Banyanovo lakes </h2><p>  Two other attractions of Guilin City, located in the very "heart" of the village on both sides of Zhongshan Zhonglu Street. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In ancient times, lakes were ordinary defensive moats (600-900 AD), but over time, as the city grew, moats turned into real lakes. </p><p>  Spruce Lake was named after the Chinese spruce growing on one of its shores.  And in the middle of the reservoir there are two pagodas: the moon and the sun. </p><p>  Banyan tree is named after the tree of the same name, which grows near the southern city gate on the lake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="amaiacuboviajando.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rong hu" class="if uuid-2560882" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2560882.jpg"></div><h2>  Caves </h2><p>  A huge number of mountains and ponds caused the appearance of many caves in the city.  The most visited is the <span>Reed Flute Cave.</span>  Pilgrims have come here for more than a thousand years.  It is located 4 kilometers from the central part, now multi-colored lighting is installed inside.  And the name of the cave is given because of the reed that grows at the entrance and the locals make flutes from it. </p><p>  Another attraction of Guilin, which tourists who visit the city recommend visiting, is the Longmen Water Cave.  The cave itself is located in the city of the same name, its length is 3 kilometers.  However, you should know that inside the cave you will have to crawl through all kinds of holes, rise and fall from the stalagmites, and even sometimes walk along rope ladders.  It‚Äôs not recommended to come here on your own, without a guide, in recent years several injuries have been recorded by negligence.  But as a reward - swimming in an underground waterfall. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lovethispic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Longmen Water Cave" class="if uuid-2560883" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2560883.jpg"></div><h2>  Ancient settlements </h2><p>  If you like the ancient buildings erected during the Ming and Qing Dynasty, go to the village of Jiangtou, which is 32 kilometers from Guilin.  A photo with a description of the attraction will not convey all the beauty that you can see with your own eyes.  An interesting fact is that about 90% of the entire local population has one surname - Zhou.  It is here that you can plunge into the atmosphere of the ancient Chinese settlement, see arched bridges, wood carvings and ancient wells. </p><p>  You can visit the town of Dasyu, which is more than two thousand years old.  Once the city was a shopping center.  The main attraction is the Longevity Bridge (Wanshaw), and the main street is 2.5 meters in length, with a width of 2 meters.  The city has 13 ancient docks, 5 of which are still operating today. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitourchina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Jiangtou Village" class="if uuid-2560887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2560887.jpg"></div><h2>  City parks </h2><p>  Good reviews from tourists about Guilin, and more specifically about its parks.  One of the most beautiful is the Seven Star Park.  It received its name in honor of seven mountain peaks, surrounded by a park zone.  On the territory there is a Hiding Dragon Cave and Flower Bridge, at the same time you can go to the mosque and the zoo. </p><p>  The second largest and largest park on the Western Mountain.  It is conditionally divided into three parts: </p><ul><li>  Western mountain, which is a Buddhist sacred place; </li><li>  West Lake </li><li>  Mount In. </li></ul><p>  The park has a museum dedicated to the history of the city, and a center of Sino-Japanese friendship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.topguilintravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Seven Star Park" class="if uuid-2560900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2560900.jpg"></div><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  The logical question is what to bring from the trip?  The city itself is small, the main concentration of shops on Zhongshan Street.  There are large shopping centers and small tents with handicrafts. </p><p>  Branded products include Sanhua liquor, bean curd, and chili sauce.  The city sells a unique fruit called lo-han-go.  Outwardly, it resembles an orange, small in size, in a hard shell of brown color.  Dried fruit for sale.  From the city you can bring unique porcelain and dishes, paintings by local artists. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.234479" data-lng="110.17995300000007" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/6/7/5/4675.png"></div><h2>  How to get to the sights of Guilin </h2><p>  There are no direct flights from Russia to this city, but it is possible to transfer to another plane in other cities of China, in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. </p><p>  The airport is 30 kilometers from Guilin, from which you can reach the village by taxi or shuttle, which runs every 30 minutes. </p>
