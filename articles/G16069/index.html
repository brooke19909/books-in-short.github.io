The Nazis saw this battle as a decisive stage in the process of the formation of the German monolith from the Atlantic to Siberia.  The USSR was a multinational country.  Different nations participated in the war.  The battles and the territory of Kazakhstan did not go around.  This republic at the time of the beginning of the battles had enormous natural and human resources.  Consider what role Kazakhstan played during the Great Patriotic War. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War" class="if" height="220" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880323.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  Summary of the historical pre-war period </h2><p>  Despite the fact that during the two previous decades it was not possible to fully realize the transition to socialism, a lot has been done towards this goal.  In particular, colonial and national oppression, medieval illiteracy and backwardness were eliminated as soon as possible.  Along with this, equality was established between women and men, peace and harmony among peoples.  Of particular importance in this was patriotic national traditions.  For many centuries, the Kazakh people successfully defended the borders of their steppes.  During the period of the colonial struggle, during the three revolutions on the construction sites of the five-year plans and on the fronts of civil confrontation, interethnic friendship was established and significantly strengthened.  Widespread anti-fascist propaganda also had a great influence on people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Briefly describing the state of the republic at the time of the Nazi attack, some statistics should be given.  In accordance with the results of the census conducted in 1939, 6.2 million people lived in the republic.  About 1.2 million joined the army. A special role in achieving the common goal - the liberation of the USSR from the aggressor - was played by Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War.  The photos presented in the article illustrate the willingness of people to defend their homeland.  The Soviet government, taking into account the experience of tsarism, created special construction detachments and a labor army.  They included representatives of the indigenous peoples of Central Asia and Kazakhstan.  In total, more than 700 thousand residents of the fraternal republics were mobilized. </p><h2>  The state of the economy </h2><p>  <span>The economy of Kazakhstan</span> during the years of World War II was at the stage of successful development.  Every fourth resident of the republic was sent to work in the defense industry and at the front.  However, this did not prevent the further development of the national economy.  High mobilization indicators were due to the agrarian nature of the economy, a large percentage of peasants among the population.  Of no small importance was the late reservation of labor reserves in the defense industry and machine operators from agriculture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880324.jpg" width="514"></div>

The bulk of the inhabitants joined the active Soviet army as a march replenishment.  In the republic itself, four cavalry and twelve rifle divisions, seven brigades, and about fifty separate battalions and regiments of various arms were formed.  Several of these units were created as national units.  Formed over the mobilization plan, these units were almost half composed of Komsomol members and communists.  Prior to the transition to the army, they were provided with uniforms and other necessary things and objects, and were kept at the expense of the republican budget, as well as voluntary contributions from the population. </p><h2>  Heavy period </h2><p>  Kazakhstan during the years of World War II (1941-1945) made a worthy contribution to the training of personnel and reserve officers for the navy and army.  More than 42 thousand young Kazakhs were sent to specialized educational institutions.  At that time, about 16 thousand officers graduated from military educational institutions in the republic.  During the years of World War II, Kazakhstan, like other regions of the country, rapidly shifted the economic sector to the defense sector.  In particular, civilian expenditures were minimized.  Most of the enterprises switched to the production of defense products.  For them, machine equipment, labor, materials were allocated. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Heroes of Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880325.jpg" width="285"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Evacuation of citizens </h2><p>  Kazakhstan suffered many difficulties during the years of World War II (1941-1945).  Only part of the deprivations that this people experienced during the confrontation can be briefly described.  At the beginning of the resistance, a shelter was found in the republic, a place in the ranks, and the work of more than 500 thousand migrants from the western regions.  About 970 thousand repatriated Germans and Poles arrived in Kazakhstan during the years of World War II.  Most of them settled in villages and villages.  In the urban area at that time there was a rather acute housing problem.  Its aggravation was at the very beginning of the war.  So, in 1940 there was no more than 5.1 square meters per citizen.  m., in subsequent years - 4.3, and in some cities even less. </p><h2>  Food crisis </h2><p>  Kazakhstan during the years of World War II experienced an acute shortage of products.  Their entry into the markets decreased by 7-15 times.  At the same time, food prices and necessities rose 10-15 times.  As a result, a card supply system for bread and other necessary products was introduced.  The food problem contributed to the expansion of individual and collective gardening, a network of farms.  Thanks to the joint efforts of the population and the leadership of the republic, the crisis was overcome.  As a result, abundance was not achieved, but citizens were able to receive a minimum of everything necessary to meet their primary needs. </p><h2>  Relocation of enterprises </h2><p>  The location of the evacuated industries was one of the key elements of rearrangement.  During the years of World War II, 220 factories, artels, workshops, factories and industrial plants were relocated to Kazakhstan.  Subsequently, 20 of these enterprises were re-evacuated.  A large share was made by food production, factories and factories of textile and light industry.  Their placement, as a rule, was carried out on the basis of republican enterprises.  Many evacuated industries were launched in a hurry, in unprepared rooms, and sometimes under awnings.  Under such conditions, production was being adjusted not only for previously manufactured products, but also for new defense products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War photo" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880326.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Rural Labor Administration </h2><p>  In the first few years of the struggle against fascism, as in the period of collectivization, political departments were formed on state farms, and political officers were formed in field-crop and tractor brigades.  The latter were often given fairly broad powers.  They could hold accountable those who maliciously did not comply with the norms, were considered disorganizers and loafers.  The tight administration of rural work, the mass involvement of children and women in labor, the decline in the technical equipment of state farms and collective farms, the reduction, and in some areas, the cessation of pay for workdays, the violent theft of livestock, and the introduction of taxes had a serious effect on the population.  Northern Kazakhstan during the years of World War II was starving.  To assist the population in the Aktobe region, government commissions were formed.  In accordance with the situation, the powers of the people's commissariats and their leadership were expanded and their responsibility for the situation in the industry was strengthened.  As a result, the number of meetings was significantly reduced, and efficiency and efficiency increased.  However, at the same time, administration began to lean towards excessively harsh measures.  This was facilitated by changes in inner-party life, widespread propaganda of the personality cult.  In addition, the practice of past years, encouraging the formation of unconstitutional bodies, also affected.  For example, emergency commissions and triples were created in the Akmola and Semipalatinsk regions.  They supervised the sowing, supervised the deployment of evacuated citizens, fire fighting, and so on.  Pavlodar, Karaganda regions, <span>East Kazakhstan</span> during the years of World War II worked under rather rough administration.  In some areas, methods of intimidating workers were used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan's economy during the great Patriotic war" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880327.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Social sphere </h2><p>  Necessary means and forces were not only preserved, but also developed healthcare, education, science and <span>culture of Kazakhstan.</span>  During the Great Patriotic War, nurses and doctors of the republic not only were able to provide a high percentage of return of sick and wounded to the system, but also prevented the spread of typhoid fever and typhus, and other diseases.  The educational system has practically not changed.  However, the number of students decreased markedly.  This was especially noticeable in rural areas.  Cultural institutions have been severely affected.  About a quarter of the clubs were transferred to hospitals and manufacturing facilities.  More than halved the number of libraries, and their book stock decreased by a third.  The number of theaters in the republic has remained the same.  However, a significant qualitative shift has taken place in the work of these institutions.  Especially outstanding were the results of filmmakers.  After the connection of the Alma-Ata, Leningrad and Moscow studios, Kazakhfilm was formed.  Of particular patriotic significance was national literature.  Heroes of Kazakhstan during the Great Patriotic War were praised by such masters as Auezov, Shukhov, Snegin, Dzhabaev.  Some authors themselves were on the front line. </p><h2>  Help front </h2><p>  Kazakhstan during the years of World War II formed the Defense Fund.  It included voluntary contributions from residents of the republic.  By October 1943, its size reached 185.5 million rubles in money and 193.6 million in value of bonds.  The campaign for the purchase of tanks and submarines has begun.  During the years of World War II, <span>Kazakhstan</span> allocated 480 million rubles to provide the <span>army</span> .  The total amount of the contribution of the republic, together with the cost of loans on bonds, lotteries and other receipts amounted to 4700 million rubles.  These funds could cover the direct costs of warfare for two weeks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan during the years of World War II briefly" class="if" height="203" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880328.jpg" width="360"></div>

    <h2>  The first blows of the enemy </h2><p>  From the very first days of the confrontation on all fronts, the Soviet army, in the ranks of which thousands of Kazakhs fought, waged fierce battles with the Nazis.  The border guards were the first to take the blow.  485 outposts, providing border protection, restrained the onslaught of the enemy.  Defenders of the Brest Fortress showed unprecedented stamina.  Representatives of more than thirty nations of the USSR attended the defended units.  The soldiers platoon of Lieutenant Naganov at the Tiraspol Tower fought bravely.  Turdyev and Fursov, the national heroes of Kazakhstan, proved themselves in this battle.  During the years of World War II, the national units that fought in the territories of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, stubbornly repelled the attacks of opponents. </p><h2>  Battle for Moscow </h2><p>  The Soviet army, overcoming difficulties, was able not only to withstand, but, having mobilized, inflict a crushing defeat on the enemy in a battle near the capital.  A special role in the confrontation was played by the 316th division under the leadership of Major General Panfilov and Commissioner Egorov.  The personnel heroically reflected the onslaught of tank formations of the enemy.  The whole world knows the immortal feat of fighters of the 105th regiment, which were able to destroy 18 enemy vehicles without passing it to the east.  It was then that political instructor Klochkov uttered a phrase that flew around the front: ‚ÄúRussia is a great country, but nowhere to retreat, Moscow behind.‚Äù  The soldiers of the 316th division fought bravely.  During the fighting, General Panfilov died.  Exceptional steadfastness and heroism in the battle for Moscow were shown by the soldiers of the regiment under the command of Karpov and the battalion under the leadership of Baurjan Mamysh-ula.  The battle went with the enemy, whose forces had fourfold superiority.  For a whole month, fierce battles were fought.  Panfilovites managed to defeat four German divisions.  The feat of soldiers did not go unnoticed by the country's leadership.  For the valor shown, the 316th division was transformed into the 8th Guards and learned the award - the Order of the Red Banner.  At the request of the soldiers, she was soon named for the deceased commander. </p><h2>  Feats of soldiers </h2><p>  Speaking of the battles near Moscow, one cannot but recall the heroism of Tulgen Tokhtarov.  Having burst into the headquarters of the fascist unit in the village of Borodino, he was able to destroy five German officers.  Tulgen Tokhtarov received the title of hero posthumously.  A group of machine gunners, commanded by Malik Gabdullin, were defeated by fascist tanks and the unit was withdrawn from the encirclement.  For the feat, the political instructor of the company was awarded the title of hero.  At a village near Serpukhov, on the banks of the Oka, Ramazan Amangeldiev died.  This machine gunner in the last battle in his life destroyed thirteen Germans.  Amangeldiev was a machine gunner as part of the 238th division.  For the strength in defense and decisiveness during the offensive, organization and discipline, this division received the Order of the Red Banner and was transformed in 1942 into the Guards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakhstan during the years of World War II 1941 1945 briefly" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/880329.jpg" width="383"></div>

    <h2>  The battles of Leningrad </h2><p>  Since the beginning of September 1941, the Kazakhs actively participated in breaking the blockade.  In particular, the 310th Infantry, and then the 314th Divisions, which were formed in Kazakhstan, fought.  The soldiers were able to inflict heavy damage on the enemy.  The soldiers participated in the liberation of more than twenty settlements in the Leningrad Region, in providing communications with the "big land", paving the "road of life" together with other soldiers.  During the battles, the party organizer Baimagambetov repeated the exploit of Matrosov.  For this, he was awarded the title of hero.  Courage and a high level of training were shown by fighters of the Baltic Fleet.  In his letter to the Kazakh people, the commander, <span>Admiral Tributs,</span> expressed great gratitude to the republic for the people whom it brought up, noted the heroism of the fighters, their courage and stamina.  Commander Koybagarov showed high professionalism in battles near the city on the Neva.  He was subordinate to the 5th division of the company of the 1236th regiment of the 372nd rifle division.  The soldiers were able to quickly move forward, make passages in the enemy‚Äôs obstacles and block the bunker.  Commander Koibagarov was the first to break into the trenches, dragging the rest of the soldiers behind him.  Near Leningrad, a third of Kazakhstan‚Äôs formations fought. </p><h2>  Partisan movement </h2><p>  Despite the courage and resilience shown by the soldiers of the front, the war in the early stages developed very tragically for the Soviet people.  From the first days of the battles a partisan movement arose.  Due to its mass character and excellent organization, as well as the subordination of the plans to the tasks of the Soviet command, it acquired special strategic importance.  There were quite a lot of Kazakhs in the partisan movement.  So, in Leningrad detachments there were more than two hundred, in Smolensk - more than two hundred and fifty, in Belarus and Ukraine - about three thousand. </p>
