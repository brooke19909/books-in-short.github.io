    <p>  NPF National is a typical representative of NPFs in Russia.  In it, the open contribution is not only preserved, but also slightly increased.  On this, all the activities of the company cease.  When the time comes, the organization pays cash to customers.  At any time, you can transfer the savings to another non-state pension fund. </p><h2>  Company Rating </h2><p>  What features of the company do potential investors pay attention to most often?  NPF "First National Pension Fund" receives mixed reviews for its place in the rating of NPFs in Russia. </p><p>  The studied company is located at approximately 17-18th place.  This is far from leadership.  Therefore, some potential contributors are skeptical of the organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is difficult to name the exact location of the fund in the rating of NPFs in Russia.  You can simply say that the organization is not among the top 10 leaders in the country.  But in the 20-30-ke it can be found. </p><h2>  Other rating </h2><p>  But that‚Äôs not all the organization has prepared.  The national rating agency NPF estimates on many indicators.  Basically, the list of leaders is compiled relative to the amount of pension savings.  But there are other components of the rating. </p><p>  The national non-state pension fund ranks 10th among pension funds for pension reserves, and also 14th in terms of capital.  The company has held such positions since 2014. </p><p>  We can conclude that the company does not have the worst performance.  Therefore, it should not be excluded from pension funds in which it is planned to invest funds for the formation of a pension in the future. </p><h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  An important factor is such an indicator as profitability.  Many potential investors pay attention to it.  After all, some are not satisfied that pension savings will be safe and sound.  I would like to multiply them a little more.  And the more, the better. </p><p>  National NPFs have good returns, according to statistics.  It is about 13.21% per year.  But customers say the opposite.  Some contributors note that NPF National is not suitable for increasing pensions.  The real yield here is about 5-8%.  Therefore, counting on a significant increase in savings is clearly not worth it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="national npf reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1549990.jpg"></div>

Some say they are satisfied with the increase in their future retirement, while others call the organization deceivers and scammers.  In fact, the discrepancy between the real situation and the statistics is easily explained by inflation.  With confidence we can only say that NPF National does not offer the highest profitability.  But the organization does not deceive its customers.  Pension savings are really increasing.  Though not as fast as we would like. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  Another important indicator is reliability.  It is sometimes also called the level of trust or trust.  The national rating agency rating of NPFs under the name "First National" in this area gives a high.  To date, reliability is rated A ++. </p><p>  According to statistics, the above trust indicators do not exist.  This means that the National Non-State Pension Fund will not be abruptly closed, the license will not be taken away from him, one can trust the corporation with pension savings and not be afraid for them. </p><p>  But many are repelled by the fund‚Äôs position far from leadership in the list of non-state pension funds in the country.  A reliable, stable organization with good profitability, but for some reason it is far from leading places.  Why?  What features of cooperation can be distinguished from the fund?  What are visitors satisfied or not satisfied with? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="npf first national pension fund" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1549988.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  About service </h2><p>  National NPF reviews are not the best received for the quality of customer service.  More precisely, it does not suit everyone.  Very often, customers say that employees are not attentive to their work.  No professionalism.  There are constant lines in the company‚Äôs branches, and sometimes confusion occurs with documents.  Sometimes there are even opinions about the illegal transfer of funds to the National NPF from state pension funds.  The organization refers to statements written by the investor personally, but in reality the person did not sign any such papers.  Similar reviews are not rare.  They are very common.  Because of this, credibility in the organization falls. </p><p>  Nevertheless, do not forget that all these statements are not supported by anything.  The ‚Äúfirst national‚Äù NPF is far from the worst organization.  Some opinions emphasize the attentiveness of workers and their courteous attitude towards visitors.  Yes, the speed of service leaves much to be desired, but similar claims can be found even with ideal funds. </p><p>  It is impossible to say with confidence how well the National NPF serves clients.  The organization does its job, fulfills all the promised functions.  But no one is safe from rudeness and unprofessional personnel.  This must be remembered. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing?  A national non-state pension fund is a not particularly distinguished non-state pension fund.  It offers standard services for insurance of pension savings and the formation of their funded part. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="national rating agency npf" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1549989.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The organization receives mixed reviews.  National NPFs are not scammers, but some negative aspects of service slip through cooperation.  Sometimes payments are delayed here, someone does not like the conditions, someone complains about department employees.  All these are standard complaints of NPF clients.  It is possible to consider the National Fund for the formation of deposits, but only if there is no suitable proposal among the leaders of NPFs. </p>
