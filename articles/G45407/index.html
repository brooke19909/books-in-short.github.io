The fact is that this device is significantly different from all other smartphone models.  If in the process of using everything it comes to automatism, then in the early days, not everyone can even put the phone on charge.  In the article you will find information about the nuances of charging and how to understand that the iPhone is charged. </p><h2>  How to put on charging? </h2><p>  The manufacturer of the device strongly recommends using only original or certified accessories by the developers for the mobile device.  You can charge your iPhone as follows: </p><ul><li>  the gadget is connected to the USB cable through the appropriate connector located at the bottom of the screen; </li><li>  the free end is connected to an adapter for an outlet, a computer, or other appropriate accessory (docking station, hub, etc.). </li></ul><p>  When the cable is connected, the user will notice that charging has begun.  Learn how to understand that an iPhone is fully charged by reading the information below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide-apple.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to understand that the iPhone is fully charged ios 10" class="if uuid-3137313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3137313.jpg"></div><h2>  Signs of the charging process </h2><p>  There are two ways to determine the charging process.  Each of them is noted in different situations when the iPhone is on or off: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The smartphone is on.  At the time of connecting the cable, a characteristic signal is heard announcing the beginning of charging.  If the device is in silent mode, the user will feel short-term vibration.  A lightning bolt will appear on the screen next to the battery icon.  How to understand that the iPhone is charged?  When the process is complete, the image of the lightning will disappear. </li><li>  The smartphone is turned off.  Here the process goes a little differently.  If the device is completely discharged, for the first 15-20 minutes it does not show any signs of functioning at all.  Users should know that this is not a malfunction - you do not need to try several times to reconnect the charging cable.  After this time, an image of an empty battery with a thin red bar at the bottom indicating the minimum charge level should appear on the screen.  If the device blinks from time to time, this is within the normal range.  After the battery is full, the image will turn green. </li></ol><p>  In the "iPhone" settings there is a function to display the charge level in percentage terms.  If it is installed, to understand that the iPhone is 100 percent charged can be understood by the corresponding indicator.  In the photo below you can see that the battery charge is 40%.  The lightning bolt is also visible, which indicates the need to connect the device to the network. </p><div class="photo" data-original="guide-apple.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to understand that the iPhone is fully charged ios 11" class="if uuid-3137304" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3137304.jpg"></div><h2>  How to understand that the smartphone is charging? </h2><p>  In case of blocking the mobile device, when connected to charging, a large image of the battery appears in the center of the screen.  After some time, when you press the Home key, you can see that the green part on the battery icon has increased, which means that the iPhone is charging. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the smartphone is completely discharged, it happens that the screen lights up and immediately goes blank, an empty battery or USB cable is displayed, after some time it is usually activated.  If the display remains black and even after a while nothing happens, then there is a malfunction in the charger or the gadget itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inewscast.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to understand that the iPhone is fully charged" class="if uuid-3137301" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3137301.jpg"></div><h2>  Why doesn‚Äôt the iPhone charge? </h2><p>  There can be many reasons for this; some of them can be easily eliminated on your own: </p><ol><li>  Lighting port is dirty.  Even the presence of a cover is not able to protect the smartphone from pollution.  Carrying it in your pockets, bag or careless attitude contributes to the accumulation of dust and foreign particles in the holes.  Over time, this leads to the fact that when the cable is connected, the device does not charge or is unstable.  To fix the problem, you need to take a toothpick and carefully clean the connector from dirt and dust effortlessly.  Then the port is purged and the cable reinserted. </li><li>  There is a problem with the charger.  With prolonged use of the charger, it inevitably fails.  To test it, the device is connected to another charging cable, if the iPhone began to charge, it's all about the cable.  Replacing it, the problem will be fixed. </li><li>  The problem is with the USB port.  Many users are accustomed to charging a smartphone in a car or workplace directly from a computer.  If the device stops charging in this way, while charging from the network, then the problem is with the USB port in the car or PC.  In some cases, installing drivers helps. </li><li>  Damage to iPhone components.  Even the highest quality device during operation and under the influence of time works worse: it heats up, quickly discharges, slowly charges, and so on.  To determine the cause of the breakdown, the smartphone must be taken to a service center, usually after replacing a particular part everything comes back to normal. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.mercurioinforma.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to understand that the iPhone is 100 percent charged" class="if uuid-3137316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3137316.jpg"></div><h2>  Why does the message ‚ÄúNo charge‚Äù appear or the gadget is not supported </h2><p>  If you cannot understand that the iPhone 10 is fully charged and you see a pop-up window with the notification ‚ÄúNo charging‚Äù, this indicates a lack of power from the charger or USB port to charge the iPhone.  Computers with low power can not provide a full charge of the smartphone via a USB cable.  Accessories not purchased from an official manufacturer also often lead to this problem. </p><p>  If an attempt to charge the device is accompanied by a message that the gadget is not supported, the reason may be: </p><ol><li>  Damage to the port for the charging cable or its contamination. </li><li>  USB cable malfunctioning. </li><li>  Not a certified charger. </li></ol><p>  The conclusion is as follows: in order to avoid such situations and other problems affecting the operation of the phone in the future, you must use original accessories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inewscast.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to understand that the iPhone is charged" class="if uuid-3137300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3137300.jpg"></div><h2>  How to understand that the smartphone is charged? </h2><p>  To understand that the iPhone 11 is fully charged, you need to pay attention to the screen after unlocking the gadget.  After charging is complete, the notification ‚ÄúCharge 100%‚Äù will appear on the screen for a moment.  Often users skip a message and don‚Äôt know.  Is it necessary to leave the smartphone plugged in?  In order not to miss the notification, you need to set the appropriate battery settings: display the charge in percentage terms. </p><p>  In other cases, a green battery image will appear on the display.  So you can understand that the iPhone is charged.  Different versions of the iOS operating system may notify you when charging is complete, but in any case, a full battery icon will appear in the upper corner of the screen. </p>
