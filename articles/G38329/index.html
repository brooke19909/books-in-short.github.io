  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technologies of ancient civilizations - description, history and interesting facts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are many supporters of the theory that modern civilization was by no means the first in the history of planet Earth.  That is why ancient technologies are treated with great attention, trying to establish whether really developed civilizations existed thousands of years ago. </p><p>  This article will focus on the most amazing and unusual objects that have haunted scientists for decades, indirectly confirming that our distant ancestors were much more developed than we think today. </p><h2>  Softening stones </h2><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Construction Saksayuman" class="if uuid-2976748" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976748.jpg"></div><p>  You have to deal with amazing ancient technologies when you learn about the existence of a developed society in Ancient Peru.  Scientists and archaeologists have long been racking their brains over how they managed to build the mysterious and mysterious Saksayuman building on the territory of a modern South American country.  This is an ancient fortress, consisting of giant stones, which are so heavy that it would be very difficult to move and install them, using even the existing modern construction equipment. </p><p>  The key to unraveling this ancient technology lies in the use of special equipment that the Peruvians used to soften the stone blocks.  Some researchers believe that the granite that was used in the construction of this fortress in Cuzco was exposed to high temperatures, as a result of which its outer surface became smooth and glassy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Scientists came to the conclusion that the ancient workers softened the stones, using some high-tech equipment.  After that, each block was carefully polished in accordance with the cutouts on the adjacent stone.  That is why today they are so close to each other. </p><h2>  Hal Saflieni </h2><div class="photo" data-original="steemkr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hal Saflieni Cave" class="if uuid-2976752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976752.jpg"></div><p>  Another example of the technology of ancient civilizations is the underground system of Hal Saflieni caves, which are located on three tiers, on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout five hundred square meters.  This is an underground megalithic sanctuary in the Maltese city of Paola.  In fact, it represents 34 rooms hollowed out in the thickness of limestone.  Since 1980 it is considered a World Heritage Site. </p><p>  This is another example of ancient construction technologies that has come down to us.  It is believed that its construction was started around 4000 BC or even earlier, since ceramics dating to the Ghar-Dalam period were discovered in the sanctuary itself. </p><p>  In this stone room you can hear absolutely incredible sound effects that have a significant impact on the human body.  For example, sounds made in one of the rooms begin to resonate throughout the room, as if piercing the human body through and through. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some scholars claim to have found the remains of more than seven thousand people on its territory, as well as a large number of crevices, deep holes and burial chambers.  It is believed that for many centuries a community burial ground could have been organized here.  The ancient inhabitants of this island cut down new grottoes and corridors in the breed, in which they buried their dead relatives and tribesmen. </p><h2>  Lycurgus Cup </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lycurgus Cup" class="if uuid-2976749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976749.jpg"></div><p>  The Lycurgus Cup is a unique artifact that serves as clear evidence that our ancestors were far ahead of their time, in fact, ancient technologies were highly developed.  The manufacturing technique of this vessel is so perfect that proves the familiarity of the masters with modern nanotechnology. </p><p>  This is a unique and unusual <span>dichroic glass</span> bowl that changes color depending on the surrounding lighting.  For example, it can turn from green to bright red.  A similar unusual effect occurs because the dichroic glass contains a large amount of silver and colloidal gold. </p><p>  On the walls of the cup is a scene of the death of the Thracian king Lycurgus.  For insulting the god Dionysus, he was strangled by vines.  According to one version, this cup was made in honor of the victory of the Roman emperor Constantine over Licinius, and after that it was transferred during the Dionysian libations.  In particular, it is believed that its unique coloring symbolizes the stages of ripening of grapes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The fate of the vessel can be more or less clearly traced since 1845, when it was in the hands of the Rothschild bankers.  On public display, the Lycurgus Cup was first exhibited at the Albert and Victoria Museum in London in 1862.  In the middle of the XX century, the cup was sold by the Rothschilds to the British Museum for 20 thousand pounds. </p><h2>  Baghdad Battery </h2><div class="photo" data-original="skeptoid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baghdad Battery" class="if uuid-2976751" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976751.jpg"></div><p>  Another <span>mystery of ancient civilizations</span> is the so-called <span>Baghdad battery,</span> which belongs to the Parthian period.  Following the discoverer Wilhelm Koenig (German archaeologist), she is considered the first galvanic element in human history that was created two millennia before the birth of Alessandro Volta.  Currently, the artifact is stored in the National Museum of Iraq. </p><p>  In 1936, he was discovered near Baghdad by railway workers.  It is believed that this is the first electric battery in the world, which was used around 200 BC.  It is a 13-centimeter vessel, the neck of which was carefully filled with bitumen.  A rod with traces of corrosion was laid through it.  Inside, a copper cylinder with an iron rod was discovered. </p><p>  The fact that the galvanization process was known two thousand years ago was confirmed by the German Egyptologist Arne Egghebrecht.  He proved it on the statuette of Osiris.  Using ten vessels that were similar to a Baghdad battery, as well as a salt solution of gold, he covered the figurine with an ideal layer of gold in just a few hours. </p><h2>  Chinese technology </h2><p>  Many of the technologies of ancient China still amaze and delight scientists.  For example, they regularly have to deal with examples of high-tech methods for processing large pieces of metal.  It turns out that these technologies were known long before our era.  Our ancestors had complex scientific knowledge in the field of metal processing, which they inherited from even more ancient civilizations.  This is proved by artifacts discovered in different corners of the planet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Column in front of the Quib Minar minaret" class="if uuid-2976754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976754.jpg"></div><p>  Ancient China became one of the first civilizations in which they began to produce cast iron, metallurgical technologies were familiar.  At the same time, they were able to produce iron, not subject to rust due to the high content of phosphorus in it, in Ancient India.  In front of the Quib Minar minaret in Delhi, one of these columns is installed weighing about six tons and a height of at least seven meters. </p><h2>  Paper in China </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper Production in Ancient China" class="if uuid-2976768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976768.jpg"></div><p>  It was in China that they first learned how to make paper.  For this, the remains of silk, fabrics, fishing nets and many other materials were collected, which were carefully crushed.  All this was mixed in a vat until a homogeneous mass was formed, and then it was shaken. </p><p>  At the next stage of papermaking technology in Ancient China, a bamboo mesh was taken, which was necessary to give mass to this composition.  With her help, the mass was removed, and the residue was left to dry.  And so the paper turned out. </p><h2>  "Ancient computer" </h2><div class="photo" data-original="madsystems.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Antikythera mechanism" class="if uuid-2976753" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2976753.jpg"></div><p>  A truly amazing find was discovered in 1900 in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe island of Antikythera, which is located 25 miles northwest of Crete.  This is a mysterious bronze object, the exact purpose of which has not been established so far. </p><p>  When the researchers pulled it out from under the water, they discovered parts of an incredibly complex mechanism consisting of a large number of gears. </p><p>  In addition, its parts were perfectly flat disks and the remains of inscriptions, which, apparently, corresponded to its main functions.  It is believed that this mechanism was an astronomical clock without a pendulum.  But not a single mention of such an ancient "computer" was found in either Greek or Roman literature.  An artifact was discovered next to the ship, which allegedly sank in the first century BC. </p><p>  The device, called the ‚Äúanti-Cheeter mechanism‚Äù, was used to calculate the motion of celestial bodies, and also made it possible to accurately determine the date of 42 astronomical events.  In 2017, it was found out that it was probably developed or used in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSyracuse and the island of Rhodes. </p><h2>  Gilding technique </h2><p>  Ancient jewelers who worked with gold and silver used mercury for gilding interiors and domes.  This technique was used in many countries of the ancient world.  This is a really complicated process. </p><p>  As modern researchers found out, all its subtleties were known to masters two thousand years ago.  They managed to cover the products with a strong and thin layer, which improved their durability and saved precious materials.  The level of competence of ancient artisans was so high that many modern technologies have not yet reached it. </p><h2>  Methods in Ancient Egypt </h2><p>  A large number of unique technologies in ancient Egypt still amazes scientists.  The processing quality of granite sarcophagi is at the level of modern machine technology.  Without special mechanical tools, achieving such a result is simply impossible. </p><p>  Another example that amazes scientists so far is a giant statue in the courtyard of the memorial temple of Ramses II.  This is a sculpture made of a single piece of pink granite 19 meters high and weighing about one thousand tons.  Its size and quality of performance does not fit into the capabilities of Egyptian masters known to us today. </p><h2>  Ancient Greece </h2><p>  The unique technologies of Ancient Greece include a prototype of a modern flamethrower.  The first such machine was used during the Peloponnesian War in the 5th century BC.  She was able to direct burning coals alternating with sulfur to the enemy. </p><p>  How advanced was ancient Greek medicine can be judged by the vaginal dilators that were found at the base of Olympus during the excavation of Dion.  These gynecological instruments date back to the 2nd century BC. </p><h2>  Ancient Russia </h2><p>  Impressive technology in ancient Russia.  Blacksmithing was the leader among artisans.  It was a difficult and prestigious occupation, it is not for nothing that the blacksmiths are the main characters of many tales. </p><p>  The construction technologies of our ancestors are also impressive.  They built houses and fortresses not of clay and stone, but of wood.  Logs were chopped with an ax, and nails were not used during construction, as they rusted over time and spoiled the wood. </p><p>  All these facts make us once again think about the existence of technology of the ancient gods.  Proponents of an alternative story, according to which a person did not come from a monkey, but all these technologies were introduced from somewhere outside, is becoming more and more. </p>
