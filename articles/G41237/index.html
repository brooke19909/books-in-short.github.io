Woolen paintings are visually similar to watercolors.  But when they are created, paints and brushes will not be required.  A colorful composition can be obtained using a correctly selected color gamut of threads used for sketching.  There is no need to have the skills of a painter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wool pattern" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462027.jpg" width="600"></div>  You can master the necessary knowledge to create paintings from wool by attending master classes held in many needlework workshops.  It is also easy to master the technique yourself, drawing on the necessary information from this article.

    <p>  You can create your own masterpiece by combining different colors of the source material available.  Making a picture with wool with your own hands is a rather meticulous and painstaking work.  But the result will exceed all expectations. </p><h2>  Product Features </h2><p>  Using wool as a material for creating a picture, you can get quite interesting and picturesque paintings.  Any needlewoman who at least once sees such a craft will be interested in how to create something like this.  Of the several working techniques, the simplest is laying out.  Images created using this method are striking in their diversity.  Fruits, flowers, animals and even portraits are laid out.  Even children can easily figure out how to make a picture of wool.  But there is one condition for the ability to engage in this type of needlework: you should make sure that there are no allergic reactions to wool.  Colored fibers are applied to a pre-prepared base.  Then the picture needs to be moistened, as a result of which it will become one.  Hence its similarity with watercolor.  Wool may appear in some places unevenly bright, so sometimes the product should be further developed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pictures of wool photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462028.jpg" width="600"></div>

These include the following: </p><p>  1. Laying dry non-spun material on the base.  In this case, needles and soap are not used.  Woolen fibers are laid out in layers.  The finished work must be framed under the glass. </p><p>  2. Creating a picture of woolen fibers in a wet way.  In this case, soap and water are used.  Such paintings are paintings and are called felted.  In this case, the wool fibers adhere to each other so that a uniform dense material is formed. </p><p>  3. The mixed way.  At first, the picture is formed by the method of <span>wet felting</span> wool in a canvas with the main color spots.  Then a more traced plot is applied to its surface (this is done with a needle).  Can be used as a base non-woven fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a picture of wool" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462033.jpg" width="493"></div>

    <h2>  How to quickly create a woolen picture? </h2><p>  To work with the described material does not require special training.  Everyone can master the technique.  It is recommended that it is recommended to perform wool patterns for beginners not in one sitting, but in several approaches.  In this case, it can take more than one day or a week, but in this way it will be possible to avoid fatigue from the habit and, accordingly, sloppiness in the performance of work.  Often in the first paintings made of wool, there are many oversights, as they are done on the run, wanting to complete the process as quickly as possible in order to enjoy the result.  As a result, it can turn out, for example, an unnaturally large flower in relation to the vase, besides it is crooked.  Of course, the creative process is interesting and exciting, and sometimes it does not make it possible to pay attention to errors.  But respite is simply necessary to evaluate one‚Äôs work with a fresh eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wool patterns for beginners" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462034.jpg" width="402"></div>

With it, you can timely detect errors in the work and correct them.  The final result of most woolen paintings is framed under glass.  Therefore, in the process of work, the guiding line is how they look under this transparent material.  In this case, glass serves as a kind of indicator of errors.  Applying it to the laid out layers of wool, you can see how tightly they fit together.  Also under glass it is much easier to consider the small elements of the work, and if necessary, correct the flaws.  Wool itself is a voluminous material.  When it is pressed against the glass, the details become flattened.  Due to this, they increase in size.  For example, it happens that a thin flower stem is laid out, and after applying the glass it becomes clear that it is too thick.  In the end, you need to reduce it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wool painting flowers" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462032.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <h2>  Is the picture amenable to correction? </h2><p>  Each picture of wool consists of objects that have glare, shadow, as well as dark and light sides and spots.  If they are not, then the details of the craft will not look voluminous.  When laying out wool, in any case, shade the elements of objects with appropriate shades in accordance with the palette.  You need to create, for example, glare on a vase so that it takes on a look similar to a natural one. </p><p>  Pictures from wool (animals, flowers or a landscape) come to life through the use of the play of shadows and lights.  You can always go back to the previous steps of the process.  Since the work is done with wool fibers, in order to correct the imperfections of the picture, you just need to remove the layer of material or its part in the right place.  In this way, failed parts are simply corrected or deleted.  The main thing is not to overdo it with alterations.  Otherwise, the picture will lose its lightness and freshness, it will look "tortured." </p><h2>  We represent the representatives of the fauna </h2><p>  To draw an animal, and even more so with the help of woolen fibers, not everyone can do it.  To facilitate the task, a sketch of the selected beast can be applied to a substrate (for example, a flannel).  Then, relying on the original picture, you need to lay out wool fibers in accordance with the specified colors.  To work out small parts, it is recommended to use a toothpick or needle.  It is most convenient to spread the wool with tweezers.  Work begins on the man-made product with the elaboration of the background. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="animal paintings" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462036.jpg" width="402"></div>

    <h2>  Wool paintings: flowers </h2><p>  Beginners are encouraged to learn the simplest forms.  A master class is offered to your attention, from which you can learn how to make a picture of poppies from wool.  These flowers, along with roses, are very popular among needlewomen to create or decorate different gizmos. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  The following materials will be required: </p><p>  1. Frame with hidden fittings of suitable size. </p><p>  2. Flannel or non-woven as a substrate. </p><p>  3. Scissors for cutting wool. </p><p>  4. Tweezers for laying out small parts. </p><p>  5. Woolen fibers of different colors.  Two are enough for a poppy - scarlet and dark red.  For stems, boxes and leaves of the plant you will need <span>green, lime</span> and brown.  How to determine the <span>background color?</span>  It can be chosen based on personal preference.  It can be one tone or several.  Perfectly poppies will look on a blue or yellow background.  This will create the illusion of sky or sun. </p><p>  Work on a small picture will take only a few hours.  In complexity, its implementation is equivalent to the initial level of skill.  Even an inexperienced needlewoman will cope with it quite easily. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY wool paintings" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11199/462035.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Laying out the background, the formation of stems and leaves </h2><p>  Any pattern of wool begins to be created by laying out the background.  For this, fibers selected at will or in accordance with the sketch according to which the work will be performed are laid out along or across the base in layers.  If one color is defined for the background, then the wool can be cut along the contour of the substrate, evenly evened out with a thin layer. </p><p>  How to form a poppy stalk?  You should take two strands of wool (2 shades of green) and twist them into peculiar sausages.  This completes the creation of the stalk.  Next, you need to bend it (optional) and put it on top of the background in the right place.  To draw carved leaves of poppy, it is enough to tear off short strands of wool and lay them with a ladder, connecting with the stem. </p><h2>  Create petals </h2><p>  To form petals for poppies, you need a medium thickness wide strand of scarlet wool.  From it you need to cut out the pieces of the required size and lay it out on the background.  To give each petal volume and clarity, it is necessary to highlight the lower part of the flower with dark red wool and draw the same vein with the same shade. </p><p>  You can add or change elements of each picture on your own.  The main thing - do not forget to apply glass to it for timely correction of failed parts. </p>
