Often the standard day of a typical city dweller turns into a cycle: work - home - work.  There is no time for rest, the beauty of the surrounding is not noticed at all.  Meanwhile, the city has many places where you can relax, where the soul can enjoy peace, and the eye - beautiful landscapes.  One of such corners is Natashinsky Ponds and the park of the same name. </p><h2>  The Creation of Human Hands: A Centenary of History </h2><p>  The history of Natashinsky ponds in Lyubertsy is simple and straightforward.  A little over a century ago, one of the local noblemen came up with the idea that it would be nice to buy a rather large plot of land, ennoble it and turn it into a summer residence. </p><p>  It is worth noting that initially the lands in question belonged to Konstantin Vladimirovich Tretyakov - hereditary merchant of the first guild, manufacturer and factory adviser.  The site itself was valuable only from the point of view of peat extraction for heating manufacturing enterprises. </p><p>  In 1901, Eugene A. Skalsky, being a rather successful businessman and industrialist, finally decided to carry out his project, and bought a rather large plot.  Its area was just over 423 acres (almost 700 hectares).  These were quite fertile lands with forest and land plots, ponds and swamps, and there were various kinds of buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vasily1986.livejournal.com" data-author=": deadokey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ducks at Natashinsky Pond" class="if uuid-2260241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2260241.jpg"></div><p>  The new owner had to invest a lot of money in the work of draining the marshes, cutting down plantations, and dividing the territory into separate plots.  Since 1905, he began to hand over the latter and sell it on fairly favorable terms to everyone.  The village formed from such separate plots was named Natashino (in honor of the beloved daughter of the industrialist).  By 1910, he already numbered more than 130 cottages. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Between 1905 and 1910, a park was established on the territory of the site, and ponds were also created.  And then the nobleman immortalized the name of his daughter.  So there were Natashinsky ponds with the same park. </p><h2>  The creation of ponds </h2><p>  Since the place under the ponds was previously a swamp, the bottom turned out to be muddy.  In order to open the three bases under the ponds, a crew of lomoviks and carpenters was hired.  The latter strengthened the bed and the shores with logs.  The Natashinsky ponds themselves were separated by bridges made of stone, and only after that they were covered with soil and rammed.  In such facilities, special dampers were arranged, with the help of which the water level in individual reservoirs and the total flow of water in a small stream were adjusted.  So in fact, the ponds were not conceived as local.  Yes, and they are constantly replenished with groundwater. </p><p>  There were initially three ponds.  They were located one after another.  Each following was not only smaller in area, but also lower by a meter relative to the previous one.  Immediately after completion of the construction of ponds, a promenade with benches was equipped.  In addition, a pair of baths appeared.  Along the embankment stretched alleys of a shady park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vasily1986.livejournal.com" data-author=": deadokey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alleys along Natashinsky Pond" class="if uuid-2260246" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2260246.jpg"></div><p>  In order to please summer residents - those who like to sit on the shore with a fishing rod, a fish was launched into the ponds.  The largest body of water inhabited crucian carp, the middle one was its red variety, and the small one received several species in the inhabitants at once - gudgeon, loaf and loach.  After that, the pond and park became, without a doubt, the favorite vacation spot for summer residents.  In 1911, the population in the village ranged from 1,000 in the winter to three thousand in the summer.  In 1934, it became part of Lyubertsy, and, accordingly, ponds with a park began to belong to this city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Further fate and reconstruction </h2><p>  In the post-revolutionary time, the park and Natashinsky ponds repeatedly changed their chefs.  The smallest of the ponds was filled up.  Despite everything, the territory was maintained in satisfactory condition. </p><p>  The entire park complex was especially hard during the Great Patriotic War.  All the trees went to heat the housing of local residents, in the place of alleys and glades, vegetable gardens were planted for planting potatoes, and fish were caught in ponds.  Thus, the land helped the Lyubertsians survive in difficult wartime. </p><div class="photo" data-original="otzovik.com" data-author=": Volka1971, "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from the water" class="if uuid-2260251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2260251.jpg"></div><p>  After the war, despite the general devastation, the park complex was gradually being restored.  The work was carried out within the framework of the state reconstruction program, and volunteer activists, and students of local schools, and Moscow students, and workers of Lyubertsy factories and large enterprises. </p><p>  The park has been completely restored, but the ponds are only slightly cleared of silt.  Therefore, all subsequent years, they are heavily overgrown with algae.  In summer, the depth of clear water was not less than 30 cm. </p><h2>  Ponds today </h2><p>  The last reconstruction of the reservoirs was carried out in the period from 2013 to 2014.  Silting was completely eliminated, the broken wooden formwork of the banks and the bed was restored.  On one of the ponds a fountain has been built, which operates in the summer.  Organized boat station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deadokey.livejournal.com" data-author=": deadokey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex scheme" class="if uuid-2260258" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47027/2260258.jpg"></div><p>  Periodically, fish are launched into the ponds.  This is done, as a rule, in anticipation of the holidays or regularly held fishing competitions.  Every day on the shores, late night fishing fans catch up with fishing rods. </p><p>  Today it is a favorite place for newlyweds photo shoots.  In the collection of many families there are photos from Natashinsky ponds in Lyubertsy.  Alleys are laid along the shores - the place of morning runs of people leading a healthy lifestyle.  On benches under shady trees you can simply enjoy the silence, and please the tired eye with pleasant landscapes. </p><h2>  How to get to Natashinsky ponds in Lyubertsy? </h2><p>  Getting to the ponds, as well as to the entire park complex, is not difficult.  It offers citizens a large number of options for urban public transport routes. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.69728960242631" data-lng="37.887689589410456" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/2/9/729.png"></div><p>  The stop "Natashinskie Prudy" can be reached: </p><ul><li>  by bus - 726, 453, 723; </li><li>  by minibus - 8, 10, 18, 539, 573, 888k. </li></ul><p>  You can go to the ponds and from the stop "Shevlyakova Street".  There comes a minibus at number 18. </p>
