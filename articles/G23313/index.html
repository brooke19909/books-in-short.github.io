It will be devoted to the device under the name HTC Desire HD A9191, reviews of which you can find at the end of this article.  But first, we will return to the origins, to the moment when the Android operating system just came into being and list the main characteristics of the device.  We all remember very well that then some companies began to work in this direction, remodeling the shell for their devices.  This also affected the HTC Desire HD A9191, reviews of which we give at the end of the article.  And how did he end up - this is the first flagship of the Taiwanese manufacturer? </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  The last flagship of the company, I remember, was the product under the name HD2.  It was built using Windows Mobile technology.  The communicator in question was a very, very expensive device at the time of its release.  Probably, it was precisely in its segment of devices that it was not more expensive.  Time has passed, technology has changed, a large number of models have appeared, but the HD2 communicator remains one of a kind. </p><h2>  Early premises </h2>

    <p>  In parallel with how the Windows Mobile segment devices were created, the Taiwanese manufacturer conducted active intelligence activities in relation to devices running on the Android operating system.  Meanwhile, the era of flagships was coming to an end.  HTC Magic has become, rather, a test option.  But not commercial.  His follower was the HTC Hero, which entered into truly mass production.  According to its characteristics, it was, of course, a rather average device.  But the efforts put into its creation paid off. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reference.

    <p>  Many users who remember how the successful career of a Taiwanese manufacturer began began, believe that the ‚ÄúHero‚Äù has rightfully become a model model of a smartphone equipped with the Android operating system.  In principle, such a solution has certain practical reasons.  In fact, if we try to understand the reasons for this decision, we will notice a lot of factors. </p><p>  These include the dimensions of the device, for example.  They are not so big, which has a positive effect on ease of use.  At the same time, the smartphone screen is also well-made.  It is easy to handle.  The battery dictates its conditions, of course, but in general, the operating time pleases users.  Among the advantages of the device can be noted good technical equipment.  Immediately after our ‚ÄúHero‚Äù by such characteristics was the Nexus One.  So what is the subject of our review of today equipped with? </p><p>  On board the device installed operating system version 2.2.  <span>The user interface of</span> HTC is 2.0.  The diagonal of the display is 4.3 inches.  Multi-touch function supported.  The device is equipped with a good camera, the resolution of which is 8 megapixels.  All the necessary communication interfaces are present, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.  Qualcomm processor clock speed is 1 GHz.  Available for use is about 800 MB of RAM. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The cost of the device is currently 7,500 rubles. </p><h2>  Continuation of the line </h2><p>  When the HTC Desire HD A9191 phone went on sale, it was always mistakenly confused with the previous model, namely, with the usual Desire.  In principle, there were all reasons for this, since the device externally differed only in the larger screen diagonal. </p><p>  In general, this situation looked quite logical.  Especially if we take into account the fact that both devices had practically identical names.  In fact, the name of the device was saved so that users could see the development of the product, its improvement.  That is, it turns out that the choice was absolutely deliberate.  Which again seems logical in view of the development of the product line of a Taiwanese manufacturer. </p><p>  However, be that as it may, but in fact the smartphone has become a device of a completely different category.  This is the first real flagship of the company, which entered mass production.  And we are talking about a device that was based on the Android operating system.  Well, it‚Äôs time for us to get down to business.  Next in line we have a review of the appearance of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  The appearance of HTC Desire HD is slightly different from the appearance of other devices of the Taiwanese company.  Still, we can note a combination of gray and black.  On the shape of the case, we can say that it is made in a simple style.  There are, of course, rounding.  But they are insignificant, therefore, this does not have the proper effect on the general parameter.  On the other hand, this style is not so bad.  Many times, many users noted that, using this approach, the Taiwanese company was able to achieve the beauty and ease of use of their creations.  Which, by the way, won the hearts of many owners of mobile devices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Design chip </h2>

    <p>  The company decided to apply one interesting feature to the device.  On the back of the smartphone you can see patches.  Many tend to criticize the manufacturer and designers of the company for using such a solution.  However, in fact, patches can only be attributed to benefits.  There is nothing wrong with their availability.  In general, with the rest of the case they look quite harmonious.  With tactile contact, no negative feelings arise.  Unless it looks somewhat unusual, but this is only the first time. </p><h2>  In general and in general </h2>

    <p>  The design, in principle, is typical for most models of the Taiwanese manufacturer of mobile phones.  We can say that it is even universal.  At the same time, the typical design, which in the subject of our today's review was diluted with the presence of special patches, did not even become a little worse.  They were not prevented from giving a positive assessment on this parameter and quite large dimensions.  But the simplicity, which was from the very beginning in HTC devices (meaning the simplicity of the design decisions), has remained in its place.  To lovers of the original appearance, this may seem like a clear flaw. </p><p>  As they say, each designer should have a special talent.  And here at the Taiwanese manufacturer, employees seem to have the talent to create almost identical products.  Nevertheless, to call this a drawback, which simply crosses out the possibility of using appropriate smartphones, is by no means impossible.  If we take into account the good hardware equipment of the devices, then in general we can say that they are not ashamed to get them out of your pocket. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  At the first time after the device was launched on the smartphone market, the manufacturer did not seem to think about making another color variation.  The only salvation was the case for HTC Desire HD A9191.  Thus, in the smartphone market, the device was available in only one design.  However, later on the network began to appear photos of the new smartphone, already in a different composition.  This is a white device.  This step can be called another reference to the Desire model, since it was exactly the same with it. </p><h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2><p>  On the front side, at first glance, a protective glass is enclosed, protecting the device from causing mechanical damage.  In fact, this is nothing but a special kind of plastic.  However, this still does not change anything.  No traces of damage (slight) remain.  In case of loose contact with sharp objects (including scissors, knives, keys), the screen will not be injured. </p><h2>  Battery HTC Desire HD A9191 </h2><p>  To ensure autonomous operation of the device, the model uses a source with a capacity of 1230 mAh.  The Taiwanese company has assured users that it will provide the opportunity to use the phone for 9 hours of voice calls.  The device will also withstand 17 days with complete inactivity.  However, tests showed that in reality everything is somewhat different.  All day without recharging, you can‚Äôt use the device in any way.  Although the company itself has repeatedly tried to prove that the HTC Desire HD A9191 is a high-capacity battery. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion and owner reviews </h2><p>  So, what can users who have purchased this smartphone model say?  To begin with, let's figure out for whom or for what needs it is generally suitable.  If you want to use the device after you arrive somewhere for a few more hours, listening to music during a long trip is highly discouraged.  The battery, of course, is rather weak, which simply cannot be ignored. </p><p>  In fact, the device can withstand about 6 hours of battery life.  And this despite the fact that it works in the second generation network.  If you set automatic switching to 3G, the operating time may be reduced even more. </p><p>  Dilute this disadvantage with benefits.  Among them is a good quality of communication and signal reception.  The interlocutor is clearly audible through the earpiece.  And the user himself, thanks to a high-quality microphone, is surely dismantled at the other end of the wire.  Note that a distinct signal does not disappear from the network. </p><p>  There is one interesting feature built into the device.  If the mode called ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù is activated, the first time you touch the phone (in case of an incoming voice call), the volume will be literally reduced to the minimum level.  A very useful thing for those who often get to business meetings, as well as meetings of various levels.  Pleased and vibrating alert.  He will not let you not hear an incoming call even when the device is in your pocket.  Well, and perhaps it's time to answer the question ‚ÄúHow to flash HTC Desire HD A9191?‚Äù, Which is so interesting for many users.  You can find software for the model on the official website of the company.  Firmware will require an appropriate program.  However, do not forget that you do all this at your own peril and risk. </p>
