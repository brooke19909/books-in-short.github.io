  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spain, Benalmadena: attractions, beaches, hotels and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Holidays on Spanish soil, which is not accidentally compared with a casket that holds many treasures, is a unique opportunity to immerse yourself in a fabulous atmosphere.  Residents of a sunny country, not hiding their feelings, enjoy every moment.  And tourists who find themselves in hospitable Spain do not hold back emotions.  Enchanting nature, sandy beaches, amazing architecture attract travelers who are sure that there is a place on earth where they are always waiting. </p><h2>  Hospitable resort </h2><p>  Due to its favorable location on the Costa del Sol (the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea), the colorful Benalmadena in Spain is incredibly popular among fans of beach holidays.  A multinational city located in the province of Malaga, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, offers its guests entertainment for every taste. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="36.5987966" data-lng="-4.516805599999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="13"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/0/5/2/4/10524.png"></div><p>  Benalmadena, whose population is 60 thousand people, began to develop as a fashionable resort in the 50s of the last century.  The picturesque city with a developed tourist infrastructure is suitable for families with children and youth. </p><h2>  Three areas of paradise </h2><p>  Charming Benalmadena (Spain) consists of three areas, each of which is unique in its own way.  True, their boundaries are very arbitrary.  Pueblo is a historical part of the resort that has retained its originality.  This is a quiet village, which is located on the slope of Mount Mijas.  The narrow streets, paved with stone, and snow-white cozy houses immerse into the atmosphere of past centuries.  The main attraction of the area is the 18th century square with a beautiful fountain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Historic Center Pueblo" class="if uuid-2915496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2915496.jpg"></div><p>  Benalmadena Costa is a popular area, representing a multi-kilometer beach strip along the sea coast.  Here life rages even at night, not quieting down even for a minute.  Many restaurants, pubs, clubs are concentrated in this part of the city. </p><p>  Arroyo de la Miel is recognized as the business center of the resort.  The Honey Stream is an area with typical Spanish neighborhoods that grew out of a fishing village. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Many travelers consider luxurious beaches to be the main attractions of Benalmadena in Spain, because they come here most often to sunbathe and swim in the warm waters.  It provides everything you need for sunbathing.  The beaches within the city are a continuous line along the coast, which is separated by high rocky ledges.  They are all municipal, and you do not have to pay for entry.  However, sunbeds and umbrellas are purchased for a fee. </p><p>  Among the vacation spots equipped with everything necessary, the following beaches can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Las Yucas. </li><li>  Arroyo de la Miel. </li><li>  Torre Bermeja. </li><li>  Torrequebrada. </li><li>  Carvajal. </li><li>  Santa ana <div class="photo" data-original="www.gites.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Luxurious beaches" class="if uuid-2915436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2915436.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  Marked by the international Blue Flag Award for the cleanliness of the coastal zone, they are always crowded.  And tourists who prefer silence go to wild beaches: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  La Morera. </li><li>  Tajo de la Soga. </li><li>  Arroyo Hondo. </li></ul><p>  They are rocky areas with small picturesque bays.  The beaches of Benalmadena, remote from noisy places, in Spain, whose photo does not convey even a fraction of its beauty, will appeal to lovers of pristine nature. </p><h2>  Enlightenment Stupa </h2><p>  Tourists, fed up with lazy pastime, are happy to go on exciting excursions to get acquainted with unusual architectural masterpieces.  As you know, the Spaniards are a friendly nation, tolerant of other people's faith.  And the main monument of Benalmadena in Spain is a monumental structure, set on a high rocky cliff.  A 33-meter high Buddhist Enlightenment stupa is located in the Pueblo area.  Built under the leadership of Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche (the great teacher of Buddhism) and symbolizing peace and harmony, it was opened in 2003. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tripkay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Enlightenment Stupa" class="if uuid-2915445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2915445.jpg"></div><p>  Stupa de la Iluminacion is Europe's largest <span>Buddhist stupa</span> .  An unusual attraction, decorated with 6 thousand clay images of the founder of the world religion, is painted with frescoes in the traditional Tibetan style.  Here are many artifacts brought from sacred places worshiped by pilgrims. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Butterfly garden </h2><p>  Next to the stupa, which serves as a place for meditation, is an exotic park, which has become the second home for butterflies.  About a thousand moths, differing in both the shape of the wings and the patterns on them, live in the garden.  A tour at Mariposario will be a great gift for adults and their children.  Children will see cocoons from which butterflies are born daily, and also admire beautiful caterpillars. </p><p>  A special pleasure for visitors is a walk through the flowering garden with a small pond.  Representatives of the flora, which are necessary for butterflies that drink flower nectar, are planted in the greenhouse. </p><h2>  Colorful castle </h2><p>  One cannot but mention the beautiful castle, which looks as if it had come down from the pages of fairy tales.  Colomares is a modern building erected in honor of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America.  Castillo de Colomares is an architectural fantasy that incorporates elements of a wide variety of styles.  The real work of art that appeared in 1994 is made of stone, concrete and brick, and some details are made of glass and wood.  The huge complex, which became a monument to the wanderings of Columbus, is located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1,500 m <sup>2</sup> . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The castle descended from the pages of a fairy tale" class="if uuid-2915447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2915447.jpg"></div><p>  The main place in the composition is occupied by the image of the ship on which the Italian navigator discovered new land.  A true masterpiece of architecture has no historical value, but this does not make it less attractive for tourists visiting Benalmadena (Spain).  Guest reviews are full of enthusiasm, because this is indeed a unique place where even an adult turns into a small child who believes in a miracle. </p><h2>  Puerto Marina - the sea gate of the resort </h2><p>  The small town is famous for the port, called "tiny Venice".  Built in the early 90s of the last century, it is a local attraction that attracts vacationers.  The sea gate consists of several bulk islands, which are connected by elegant bridges.  Only here you can admire a unique residential complex, built on artificially created land areas.  But getting inside a modern architectural ensemble, which is a private territory, is impossible.  To buy housing in the port area, you will have to pay at least a million euros, so very wealthy people become owners of the houses.  The guides enthusiastically say that several years ago the Spanish actor A. Banderas bought an entire island here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City port" class="if uuid-2915463" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2915463.jpg"></div><p>  The busy city port is also the harbor for yachts of local residents.  Bright ships ‚Äúpark‚Äù right at the door of luxury cottages.  One of the most visited corners of Benalmadena in Spain has gained fame thanks to a curious floating restaurant - a restored American steamer, on which anyone can cruise around the bay. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  Resort hotels are mainly located in the Benalmadena Costa area.  They provide decent living conditions and are distinguished by a high level of service.  Most of them are four-star, located near the beaches.  From the windows of comfortable rooms offer amazing views of the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="domovumore.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Hotels" class="if uuid-2915477" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2915477.jpg"></div><p>  Among the popular hotel complexes of Benalmadena (Andalusia, Spain), annually hosting guests, the following can be mentioned: </p><ul><li>  Arenal Golf. </li><li>  Hotel Casa Rosa. </li><li>  Apartamentos La Fonda. </li><li>  Casinomar. </li><li>  Select Benal Beach. </li></ul><p>  Many hotels belong to the so-called Best Hotels chain.  They are located on the first line of the beach, in the heart of the resort, and are more suitable for families. </p><h2>  Benalmadena Reviews </h2><p>  Travelers speak with admiration of the luxurious beaches, which are equipped with changing cabins, umbrellas, sun loungers, toilets.  And everyone finds the best vacation option for themselves.  Water activities also leave no one indifferent. </p><p>  Many vacationers admit that Spanish cuisine is something!  Restaurants offer national dishes, among which it is difficult to single out one or two.  But the biggest delight is caused by jamon, cold gazpacho soup and charcoal grilled fish.  And local wines are of the highest quality. </p><p>  In terms of security, this is a very prosperous city where you can safely walk even at night. </p><p>  Everyone can enjoy the full beauty of the resort.  It is enough to visit the amazing city, as if created for a relaxing holiday, which you do not want to part with.  This is a real fairy tale, embodied in reality, and the memories of her are some of the best in life. </p>
