Moreover, it is not difficult to perform it: you just need to purchase an LED strip and an adapter to it.  However, at the installation stage, beginners may have difficulties.  If the kit comes with a connector - good.  But what if there is none or a long ribbon is cut into 2 parts of the right size?  In today's article, we will talk about how to solder wires to an LED strip to connect it to a power supply or connect to another part of the strip. </p><h2>  The basic rules of the work, the necessary materials </h2><p>  To solder the LED strip, as in any other case, you will need rosin, solder or flux.  However, there are differences from the connection, for example, the usual twist.  It is possible to use only a soldering iron of low power.  Ideally, you should have a station with the ability to adjust the temperature, but not everyone has such a device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stevesmithsjewellery.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The soldering station is more reliable - it will not allow the tape to overheat" class="if uuid-3057432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057432.jpg"></div><p>  The temperature of the tip should be no higher than 320 ¬∞ C, and the contact time with the surface of the tape should be from 3 to 5 seconds.  Otherwise, the tracks will start to burn and instead of benefit, such work will do harm.  It is better to fix the light strip on a hard surface with tape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Getting started: Tinning contacts </h2><p>  Before soldering the wires to the LED strip, preparatory work should be done.  The main task on which the strength of the joint will depend is the correct tinning.  Gently melting the rosin with a soldering iron, it is necessary to apply it to the sites with a thin layer.  After this, solder is applied in a similar manner.  In this case, you should be extremely careful so as not to overheat the LED strip.  Similar actions must be performed with stripped ends of the wires, which can be 2 or 4, depending on the type of strip. </p><p>  Many people ask how to solder the wires to the LED strip without rosin.  There are several options.  The most interesting way can be called the use of pine resin, which provides an excellent connection of the copper pad with tin.  Also a very good option with a thin solder, inside which rosin is already contained.  However, sulfuric acid is the best, although not always affordable, option.  This is worth a little more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="do-daddy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="It is necessary to solder very carefully, without overheating the LED strip" class="if uuid-3057434" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057434.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the use of sulfuric acid </h2><p>  By itself, in its original form, it is unsuitable for soldering.  First you need to turn it into a solder, which will not so much corrode the surface.  Zinc tablets are used for this purpose.  The algorithm of actions will be as follows. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Zinc is thrown into a glass vessel with concentrated sulfuric acid, which reacts with it.  Tablets are added until the "boiling" stops.  Only after this, the solution can be called soldering acid and used as directed.  It is applied to the contact area with a clove or a thin screwdriver, after which you can immediately begin tinning.  Compounds are ultimately durable.  The ends of the wires are also processed before tinning. </p><p>  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to figure out how to properly solder the wires to the LED strip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.houselogix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="You can use the connector, but soldering is more reliable" class="if uuid-3057433" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057433.jpg"></div><h2>  Soldering the ends to the pad </h2><p>  For a tight connection, you must be extremely careful.  The work is not difficult, but it requires attentiveness and precise actions: there is nothing to do with shaking hands.  First, the tinned end of the wire is applied and pressed to the contact pad.  After that, it is heated by a soldering iron tip for 3-5 s and cools.  This procedure is performed several times until a dense and high-quality connection becomes visually noticeable. </p><p>  Important!  Before you solder the wires to the LED strip, it makes sense to decide on the color markings of the wires.  It is desirable that these be red (plus) and black (minus).  Otherwise, if several segments of the LED strip are connected to the power supply, the master may reverse polarity.  This is not dangerous, but it will be unpleasant if one of several parts after laying under the ceiling does not light up. </p><p>  The following video will demonstrate how such work is done. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="uKGqKni2MDU" data-url="https://youtu.be/uKGqKni2MDU" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/3/9/1/8/13918.jpg"></div><h2>  How to solder wires to LED strip in silicone </h2><p>  This work is practically no different from the previous version, with the exception of some points.  For its implementation, among other things, you will need a clerical knife and a heat shrink tube for subsequent waterproofing of the contacts. </p><p>  The first step is to remove the top layer of silicone across the entire width of the length of the pads.  This work should be done very carefully so as not to damage the LED strip.  Then a heat-shrink length of 2-3 cm is put on it, which is pulled a little further so as not to interfere.  Next, a normal soldering is performed, at the end of which the tube is pulled back so that the contacts are exactly in the middle of the segment.  It remains with the help of a hairdryer to ‚Äúprecipitate‚Äù the waterproofing material, which will tightly fit the open areas and prevent moisture from getting inside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="learn.adafruit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silicone should be carefully trimmed with a sharp knife" class="if uuid-3057431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057431.jpg"></div><h2>  RGB tape connection: nuances </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to figure out how to solder the wires to the 4-pin LED strip.  If the home master figured out the previous options, then here for him there will be no difficulties at all.  The only nuance will be that wires of 4 colors are required (marking of the contact is indicated in brackets): </p><ul><li>  red (R); </li><li>  green (G); </li><li>  blue (B); </li><li>  black (+ V). </li></ul><p>  This eliminates the risk that the wires will be mixed up when switching to the controller.  And here it is not a matter of the fact that the tape will not glow.  Just when you turn on the remote control of one color, another will light up, and this is completely unacceptable. </p><p>  In general, experienced craftsmen advise to always observe color coding.  After all, even if the fitter himself remembered the location of the wires and connected them correctly, where is the guarantee that tomorrow you will not need to repair the backlight, but he will not be at home?  Even a specialist will have to work hard, understanding such switching. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Here's what can happen in the end, subject to the rules." class="if uuid-3057436" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112910/3057436.jpg"></div><h2>  Final word </h2><p>  Every self-respecting home master should know how to solder the wires to the LED strip.  After all, even if such an experience is not useful at home, you may always need help from someone else.  For example, a pretty neighbor living in the same entrance. </p>
