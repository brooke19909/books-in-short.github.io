Akhtyr Cathedral</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 1773, on the site of the dilapidated wooden Nikitsky church, the Akhtyrsky Cathedral was founded.  By that time, the eagle was no longer a border fortress.  Initially, it was a cemetery church, but 13 years later, when the churchyard was moved to another place, it became a parish church.  Now it is the Akhtyr <span>Cathedral</span> with a majestic four-tier bell tower, which belongs to the Oryol-Liven Diocese. </p><h2>  Tradition </h2><p>  The appearance of this temple is hidden in the mists of time.  According to legend, at the beginning of the XVI century the Pyatnitskaya church towered in its place.  Thanks to her, the area adjacent to the church was called Pyatnitskaya Sloboda. </p><p>  As was established in those days, there was a graveyard nearby, as well as a small square on which local residents and peasants from nearby villages sold their goods.  But at the beginning of the XVII century, with the advent of the Time of Troubles, the Oryol fortress, like Pyatnitskaya Sloboda, was burned to the ground, and the places where life was in full swing before this came to complete desolation. </p>

    <h2>  Documentary confirmation </h2><p>  Over time, the fortress was restored.  Then Pyatnitskaya Cossack settlement was revived.  In 1678, a record was found in the census book of the courtyards of the courtyards, mentioning the Nikitsky church, erected on the site of the former, burned. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Pyatnitsky graveyard, in addition to the church, there was another building, near which a special service was held.  The fact is that the corpses of drowned, frozen and starved beggars were stored in it throughout the winter.  They stayed there until spring.  After Easter, on the 7th week on Thursday, people from all around came to this house.  Here the priests performed a funeral service over the bodies, after which all the dead were buried in a common grave. </p><h2>  The history of the construction of the Akhtyr temple </h2><p>  But time did not stand still.  By the beginning of the XVIII century, the borders of the Russian state were already far in the south, so the Eagle from the border fortress gradually turned into a more comfortable large settlement.  Towards the end of the century, the <span>Nikitsky temple was</span> very dilapidated, and it was decided to take it apart.  The city could not remain without a temple for a long time, so there was a need to build a new one.  Its construction was preceded by the following circumstances. </p>

    <p>  In 1773, a merchant from Orel, who traded horses, Konstantin Semenovich Pastukhov was on business in the city of Akhtyrka (Kharkov province).  There, he went into a local temple and prayed and received healing from a disease that he had suffered for a long time.  This happened thanks to the miraculous <span>Akhtyr icon of the Mother of God.</span>  By that time, her miraculous power was already known throughout Russia.  And in Akhtyrka specially in her honor a magnificent cathedral of stone was erected. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Returning to his hometown, the merchant Pastukhov immediately went to the diocesan leadership.  He asked for blessings for the construction of the church on Pyatnitsky graveyard in honor of the <span>Akhtyr Icon of the Mother of God.</span>  He received permission.  In the same year, the future Akhtyr Cathedral of Orel was laid.  After 2 years, in 1775, the construction of the temple was completed, and it was consecrated. </p><h2>  Improvement </h2><p>  The eagle grew more and more, and the church with the adjacent churchyard was already on the territory of the city itself.  The cemetery was closed, and the church received parish status.  13 years after the start of construction, he no longer accommodated everyone.  That is why the cathedral was expanded.  In addition, it organized a new chapel of the Holy Great Martyr Nikita. </p><p>  The following construction work in the Akhtyr Cathedral began in 1803.  Another aisle was built and consecrated in it - the Kazan Icon of the Mother of God, and the arches of the central altar were also raised. </p>

    <p>  After 20 years, a rather high bell tower was built, consisting of four tiers.  Initially, it was located at some distance from the cathedral.  But in 1870 they decided to lengthen the refectory and connect it to the bell tower.  The project of this construction was carried out by the architect I.P. Lutokhin.  In the same form, before us now stands the Akhtyr Cathedral (Oryol).  After 5 years, the church was fenced, but before the war itself it was dismantled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There were 2 priests in the temple, as many psalmists and a deacon.  In this parish there were 275 households, and this is more than 1 thousand people.  In the fall of 1897, thanks to <span>the churchwarden</span> M. M. Borzenkov, a parish school began to operate at the church.  It should be noted that training in it was absolutely free.  Classes for children were conducted by priest V. Leonov. </p><h2>  Post-revolutionary and war periods </h2><p>  After 1917, the Akhtyr Cathedral, like most churches in those turbulent times, underwent the so-called seizure of values.  All the icons were confiscated, and most importantly, a large cross poured from silver, which was the ancient shrine of the temple.  This relic was more than 500 years old. </p><p>  By the decision of the Executive Committee in Orel, in just 2 years, 17 churches and 2 monasteries were closed.  But the Akhtyr temple was lucky.  It was closed only in February 1938 by a decision adopted at a meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Oryol Region.  For 4 years it was used as a granary. </p>

    <p>  In March 1942, when the city was occupied by Nazi invaders, the temple was opened and since then the service in it has not stopped.  The following year, on August 5, during the liberation of this village, the church‚Äôs bell tower became the first building on which the red flag was hoisted.  In 1962, the Akhtyr Cathedral (Oryol), received the status of the cathedral.  In 2008, the department was moved to the Smolensky church. </p><p>  Now the Akhtyr Cathedral (Oryol), the photos of which are presented in this article, belongs to the <span>Oryol-Liven diocese.</span>  In 2009, he was returned to the status of the cathedral. </p><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  Since 1986, the church has undergone extensive <span>restoration work</span> to restore the interior: the main iconostasis, 14 meters high, was decorated with beautiful carvings and gilding, the artist F. Gladkov covered the biblical scenes with murals and laid marble floors on the floor.  In addition, they made repairs to the facade of the building, as well as restored the brickwork of all the drums of the four.  They returned the original shape to the bell tower spire and domes, and also covered them with sheet copper, after which they also gilded. </p>

    <h2>  Shrines of the temple </h2><p>  The miraculous icon of the Mother of God is considered the most revered icon in the Akhtyr Cathedral of Orel.  It is a list from the prototype, which became famous for its many healings.  In addition to it, there are icons containing particles of the relics of St.  Confessor George Kosov and the Great Martyr Nikita. </p><p>  For some time in this cathedral were the relics of St.  Tikhon Zadonsky.  The fact is that in 1919 they were removed from the monastery of the same name and given to the Yelets Museum of Local Lore.  In the 30s, the relics were transferred to the Orel Anti-Religious Museum, where they were stored until 1941.  During the occupation of the city, they were placed in the Epiphany Church. </p>

    <p>  In the 60s, persecution of the Church resumed and relics at the request of the then director of the Museum of Local Lore, were returned back, where they lay in storage rooms for 28 years.  When the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus was celebrated, this shrine was finally returned to the Church.  She was placed in the Akhtyr Cathedral of Orel. </p><p>  In 1991, in connection with the opening of the Zadonsk Monastery, the relics of the saint were returned to their place.
