The following modern socialization megafactors are distinguished. </p><p>  <strong>Space.</strong>  Distinguishing it as one of the main factors of socialization is based on the fact that man is not only a member of society, part of society, which includes the family, people and all of humanity, he is also part of the universe, the cosmos, which includes all existing creatures, standing on different steps of development.  The famous teacher of the early 20th century, K. N. Wentzel, introduced the term "space pedagogy".  He believed that if there is social pedagogy involved in the upbringing of a person as a member of human society, then space pedagogy should legitimately exist, in which upbringing is understood much more broadly and has different goals, as well as techniques and methods for achieving these goals. </p><p>  <strong>Planet, world</strong> .  A planet is an astronomical concept, a <span>celestial body,</span> our Earth, on which the world lives, is the totality of human society leading various forms of social life that have formed during evolution.  The organic relationship and interdependence between the planet and the world is obvious: first, the conditions on the planet gave birth to life and human society, and now in the process of development, the world affects the state of the planet, causing <span>global problems</span> in the form of environmental pollution, poverty, unemployment and crime.  <strong>The internet</strong> .  This is a worldwide computer network, which is accessed by people motivated by various motives: from searching for information, solving business issues and ending with entertainment, shopping and just chatting.  The influence of the Internet on the socialization of man is twofold.  On the one hand, its resources can help a person in cultural, spiritual development, and contribute to self-realization.  On the other hand, the Network can cause a user to become addicted, manifested in an attachment to communicating via the Internet, to gambling, to sex services, to shopping, and simply to an endless journey through the Internet.  It is clear that this dependence does not harm health as much as drugs or alcohol, but it also reduces the working capacity and quality of life in society. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Mesofactors of socialization are as follows: </p><p>  1) <strong>Regions</strong> .  Each country consists of several geographical and administrative regions.  Regions differ from each other not only in geographical position, climate, nature, but also in economics, cultural traditions, beliefs, spiritual life, which, of course, cannot but affect the socialization of the individual, the formation, change and maintenance of living standards.  2) <strong>Types of settlements</strong> (territories where people live directly, perform economic, cultural, social functions and others): </p><p>  - countryside.  The factors of human socialization in <span>rural areas</span> are the prevailing consciousness of the group (family, clan, village), and not the individual.  The stability of a <span>social community is</span> maintained when a person is aware and expresses himself against the backdrop of centuries-old traditions.  The socio-psychological atmosphere is determined by <span>social control</span> in rural areas. </p><p>  - town;  The characteristic conditions for the socialization of urban residents are caused by a number of signs such as the concentration of human <span>resources</span> in the city <span>, material</span> and spiritual culture, as well as countercultures in the form of religious, terrorist, criminal, political associations and, of course, the specific way of life of the city. </p><p>  - small town;  Factors of socialization in a small city: more than a hundred years old, the number of people not exceeding 50,000, a special psychological and social climate, non-agricultural employment. </p><p>  - village;  The factors of socialization of the inhabitants of the village have their own specifics due to the intermediate state of the village between the village and the city.  The village allows its residents to be socially mobile. </p><p>  3) <strong>Subculture</strong> .  It influences the <span>socialization of personality</span> spontaneously, but exactly to the extent that the group that is the carrier of the subculture, to which it belongs, is significant for a person.  That is, the more a person identifies his norms, values ‚Äã‚Äãwith the norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãof a subculture, the more this subculture affects him. </p>
