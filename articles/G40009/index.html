Therefore, when choosing clothes, preference is given to original and unusual models.  One of these is the interesting jacket "bat".  This thing applies mainly to women's wardrobe.  However, due to the popularity of the unisex style, fashion magazines sometimes show us guys dressed in this original little thing. </p><p>  If you would also like to have it in your wardrobe, we suggest crocheting a bat jacket. </p><h2>  Training </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweatshirt bat" class="if uuid-3180101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3180101.jpg"></div><p>  Bringing an idea to life is easy.  Craftswomen note that the ability to knit simple columns is enough.  In this case, you can diversify the fabric with unusual knitting threads.  Speaking of them.  There are no strict recommendations regarding the choice of yarn.  When crocheting "bat" sweatshirts, you can rely on your taste.  But still, it is worth considering the season for which the product is being prepared.  Accordingly, for the summer it is worth buying linen or cotton yarn, and for the winter - mohair, angora or merino wool.  It is also worth noting that the openwork should be done with a hook, the diameter of which is equal to the thickness of the thread.  But the effect of large loops can be made an instrument three or even four times thicker. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Taking measurements </h2><p>  Another important part of the preparatory phase involves measuring with a centimeter tape the parameters of a person for whom the design of a crocheted ‚Äúbat‚Äù jacket is planned.  Moreover, professional knitters are advised to do just that, and not use the standard parameters, which are abundantly presented on the Internet.  Otherwise, it is unlikely to be able to create a product that exactly fits the figure. </p><p>  To take measurements, you need an elastic centimeter, a paper sheet and a pencil.  Having prepared, we invite the model and measure certain parameters.  At the same time, it is important that the person is dressed in tight clothing.  Otherwise, the measurements will be incorrect. </p><p>  So, we are interested in the following values: </p><ul><li>  chest circumference (OG) (through the most convex points in front and behind); <div class="photo" data-original="howwwblog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit a bat jacket" class="if uuid-3180116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3180116.jpg"></div></li><li>  jacket length (DK) - from the lower edge to the intersection point of the neck and shoulder; </li><li>  neck base circumference (OSH); </li><li>  armpit level (UPV) - measure from the bottom edge; </li><li>  sleeve length (DR) - from the shoulder to the cuff. </li></ul><h2>  How to work with measurements correctly? </h2><p>  Quite often, novice masters encounter problems when knitting a conceived product.  The reasons may be different.  But the most common is that they knit, constantly checking with a centimeter tape.  However, often they are not even able to correctly dial the loop, let alone further work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, experienced craftswomen advise beginners who have decided to crochet a bat jacket using simple calculations to transfer centimeters into loops and rows.  How to do it? </p><p>  So that the reader does not have problems, we offer step-by-step instructions.  On it you can calculate the number of units of interest for knitting any other thing.  The principle is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We take prepared threads and a hook. </li><li>  We knit a chain whose length is 10 cm. </li><li>  Focusing on the selected pattern or knitting simple columns, we raise the canvas by 10 cm. </li><li>  As a result, we get a square of 10x10 cm. </li><li>  Now we count the number of loops (bottom) and rows (side). </li><li>  We divide both values ‚Äã‚Äãby 10. </li><li>  So we manage to calculate the number of units needed contained in 1 cm. </li><li>  Now we compare them with the taken measurements.  Multiply the loops by OG, OOSH and DR, and the rows by DC and UPV. </li></ol><h2>  How to tie a sleeve? </h2><p>  Since we are crocheting a bat sweatshirt from the bottom edge to the shoulder seams with the smooth addition of loops for the sleeve, we need to make a very important calculation.  Our task is to increase 1/2 of the chest circumference by two sleeve lengths.  How to do it? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=":  "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweatshirt bat scheme" class="if uuid-3180137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3180137.jpg"></div><p>  We again offer instructions: </p><ol><li>  Extra loops are the length of the sleeve, and rows for additives are the level of the armpits. </li><li>  Divide the first value by the second. </li><li>  We need to knit two sleeves.  Therefore, we multiply the resulting value by two, round to the nearest whole. </li></ol><p>  Thus, we calculate the size of the product in the units required for knitting. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  In order not to get confused when crocheting sleeves, the ‚Äúbat‚Äù sweater must be carried out according to the instructions: </p><ol><li>  The conceived product consists of two parts - front and back. </li><li>  We knit a chain equal to 1/2 OG. </li><li>  If desired, we knit a small cuff.  Or immediately begin to expand the canvas. </li><li>  Additional loops are air.  We knit them after and before the hem. </li><li>  Having reached the desired width, we knit the fabric in length. </li><li>  Close the loop. </li><li>  In the likeness, we knit the second part. </li><li>  We sew the product along the shoulder and side seams. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="guide.alibaba.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sweater bat crochet step by step" class="if uuid-3180241" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3180241.jpg"></div><p>  The linked model can be decorated at your own discretion.  Some craftswomen sew beads, others make a contrasting edging.  The main thing is that the product should look harmonious. </p>
