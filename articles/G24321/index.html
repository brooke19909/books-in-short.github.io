  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rating of phones with the best cameras: review of models, specifications, comparison, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Different magazines, experienced professionals, reliable stores are ready to present their mobile phone tops with a good camera.  All of them contain quite interesting models.  Consider several popular models with a good reputation, and also analyze the main important features of this technique. </p><h2>  What to look for? </h2><p>  Any manufacturer considers it almost an obligation to present to the market such a model that would rightfully be included in the ranking of mobile phones with a good camera.  This is logical - few modern users are interested in technology that does not allow taking high-quality pictures of the environment.  It is worth recalling the craze for selfies.  It is simply impossible to release a flagship model in our time, eliminating the possibility of taking photographs from it. </p><p>  Many buyers, choosing a suitable model for themselves, focus primarily on the quality of images, and only then evaluate the other features of the technique.  Modern powerful phones are quite multifunctional, so there is no need to infringe on yourself, choosing either a smartphone with a good camera, or with a reliable processor or a capacious battery - there are models that combine all the key positive features. </p><p>  The relevance of reviews of phones with good cameras is that many today have completely abandoned cameras.  They were superseded by smartphones - convenient, compact, allowing you to shoot the necessary scenes with sufficient quality.  Every year, the market is replenished with technical products.  Traditionally, the greatest interest of the public is caused by Apple's new products.  Korean Samsung and the Chinese giants of the technical market are not far behind the American Yabloko, as evidenced by the numerous ratings of phones with the best cameras.  There are some other reliable manufacturers.  However, first things first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to look for? </h2><p>  Many users have been studying the current (now, for example, compiled for 2018) mobile phone tops with a good camera for quite some time.  In 2002, such ratings were no less relevant than today, unless the manufacturers did not have the technologies that are available today.  When studying tops, the user should pay attention to the features of product testing.  It is advisable to look at those that are compiled based on the results of the operation of equipment in ordinary conditions. </p><p>  Of course, the best photo quality is obtained, for example, when using a tripod, but in reality few people use such an addition to a smartphone, so it is more reasonable to study the test results in which the stands are not involved, specific working conditions were not created. </p><p>  Choosing a suitable model for yourself, you should pay attention not only to the "stuffing" of the smartphone, but also the software that allows you to work with it.  In the ratings of budget phones with a good camera, you can often see models whose function management is not very convenient, and this always affects the real result of photographing in everyday life.  Choosing the right technique for yourself, you should responsibly treat this aspect.  The soundness of the software is one of the key differences between phones with equal technical specifications.  For some, the use process is designed in such a way that starting the camera is a real problem, while using other models is easy and convenient, and the interface is intuitive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to consider? </h2><p>  As you can conclude from the publications available to modern man, the rating of popular and reliable smartphones with excellent opportunities for high-quality shooting can be formed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Apple iPhone X. </li><li>  Huawei P20. </li><li>  Google Pixel 2 XL. </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. </li></ol><p>  Both the technical parameters and the cost of these smartphones are different.  Consider the features of these models in order to understand whether they are worth the money that shops ask for them. </p><h2>  Chinese giant </h2><p>  This is exactly what the model released by Huawei under the name "P20 Pro" can be called.  Many appraisers consider the smartphone to be almost the best in terms of the quality of the built-in camera.  However, the acquisition will cost a lot.  To find out for yourself how well a Chinese phone photographs, you will have to pay about 55 thousand rubles.  The company manufacturing these smartphones has long established itself as a reliable manufacturer, but the built-in cameras used to be not very good.  Only in the "P20 Pro" model did the manufacturer decide to take an impressive step forward.  A technical novelty is great for taking pictures in any lighting conditions, and the video recording quality is in no way inferior to other flagships of the market. </p><p>  ‚ÄúP20 Pro‚Äù was the first model equipped with three cameras at once.  The resolution of the main one is 40 megapixels, the telephoto lens is estimated at 8 megapixels, and the monochrome camera is half as weak as the main one.  The product is called the enterprise a neural processing smartphone, which also affected the quality of photography - the images are perfect, although the device itself selects the best option for the shooting mode and sets the process settings.  The entire set of parameters is selected based on external conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are tuning components that allow you to identify human faces, green spaces, sky and flowers.  If you don‚Äôt like the result of applying the standard setting, just click the cross marking this system.  If you cancel the application of the setting several times, the phone will remember the user's choice and will no longer offer such an option. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button phones a good camera" class="if uuid-2954825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954825.jpg"></div><h2>  About the pros </h2><p>  In the ratings of phones with the best cameras and NFC, ‚ÄúP20 Pro‚Äù occupies one of the leading positions thanks to a well-designed system that allows you to take high-quality images in the dark.  Of course, many manufacturers indicate the fact of the night mode in the technical specifications for their products, but it was the Chinese flagship who first released a unique model that keeps the shutter open for six seconds, which results in a fairly clear picture. </p><p>  A simple smartphone will give such an image only when equipped with a tripod, but Huawei developers have introduced a new data processing algorithm that allows you to take a high-quality picture in the night, even if the photographer has trembling hands.  An equally significant aspect that deserves attention is a five-fold increase.  Three times it works in conjunction with the main camera, so even when approaching, the picture will have high detail, significantly exceeding the results of applying the zoom on a simple smartphone. </p><p>  In the ratings of <span>phones with the best camera,</span> the P20 Pro model sometimes takes not the highest place due to the strong image processing.  Some consider this a virtue, others a lack of technology.  It seems different that the colors are too sharp and bright, unnatural, so the quality of the finished photo is reduced.  There is another opinion: the pictures taken on this phone are detailed, clear, dynamic, fully ready for publication without additional processing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobilesquare.com.sg" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phones good camera" class="if uuid-2954826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954826.jpg"></div><h2>  Apple iPhone X </h2><p>  In the ratings of phones with the best camera, this smartphone fully deservedly takes either the first place or one of the first three.  Its main drawback is its high cost, because the purchase will cost our compatriot no less than 80 thousand rubles.  The technique, which provides the possibility of photographing, is similar to the seventh model (a variation of ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù), but it has been slightly improved, therefore the quality is excellent.  There are two sensors with a capacity of 12 megapixels, one of them is equipped with a lens that allows you to double the image. </p><p>  Both cameras have stabilizers, and the system works when photographing, and when recording video.  Maximum video - 4K, 60 frames / sec.  A distinctive feature of the technique is the expanded aperture.  The American manufacturer has developed a unique lighting function that mimics the lighting in the studio.  Processing is applied after the initial shooting, you can try different settings for one photo.  It is possible to shoot slowly.  For this mode, the maximum resolution is 1080p, 240 fps. </p><p>  As you can see from the ratings of phones with a good camera and battery, the Apple development, released under the name iPhone X, is a model equipped with excellent front-end shooting capabilities.  The camera is 7 megapixels, designed according to the new TrueDepth technique, applicable for unlocking a smartphone.  With this phone you can take selfies in portrait mode with the appropriate lighting option. </p><p>  The convenience of managing the model is especially noted, since the number of settings and functions is minimized, and using a smartphone is as easy as shelling pears.  There are seven standard modes, of which one is equipped with additional settings - it is designed for photographing portraits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung best camera" class="if uuid-2954822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954822.jpg"></div><h2>  Good or not? </h2><p>  As noted in the ratings of phones with a good camera and battery, among the important positive qualities of the ‚ÄúiPhone X‚Äù is the excellent thoughtfulness of the internal system for choosing white balance settings, shutter speed and other important parameters.  The smartphone creates three frames with different exposure values ‚Äã‚Äãand combines them into one image, while the user does not need any specific actions. </p><p>  This mode can be canceled, you can configure the preservation of both the original pictures, and the finished combined.  Many experts pay attention to the quality of the zoom - the detail when using this Apple model is almost flawless.  However, the Chinese smartphone described above is considered by many to be better in this aspect, especially when it comes to shooting in darkened conditions. </p><p>  IPhone X is perfect for experiment lovers.  In the ratings of phones with the best cameras, they pay attention to excellent portrait lighting.  It seems to some that 7 megapixel selfie shots are not enough, but in practice, photos taken on this smartphone are more attractive in quality than the shooting results of almost any alternative.  The technique perfectly conveys shades, the image quality is excellent, the detail is very high, there is a portrait mode that allows you to blur the background. </p><p>  Among other Apple products, it is X that has the highest quality camera.  For lovers of this American manufacturer and fans of selfie models, it's better not to find models in stores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.apple.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="budget phones a good camera" class="if uuid-2954823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954823.jpg"></div><h2>  Korean developments </h2><p>  Samsung has held a reliable place in the ratings of phones with the best camera for more than a year.  If we talk about flagship models, then the new Galaxy series, released under the name S9 Plus, deserves special attention.  In stores, they ask for about 67 thousand rubles for this phone.  Justifying its price, the smartphone offers users an excellent quality main camera with a correcting aperture. </p><p>  This technology has been used for a long time in cameras, but it‚Äôs almost never been installed on phones before.  There are two modes between which the petals of the system switch.  With a lack of light, it is possible to provide a large supply of lighting to the lens, with bright sun you can get a sharper image due to covering the holes. </p><p>  The technical parameters of this model are in many respects similar to the iPhone X discussed above.  There are two cameras with a capacity of 12 megapixels, of which one is equipped with a double increase.  Both cameras manufacturer has stabilizers.  Shooting with a reduced speed is available at a resolution of 1080p and a speed of 960 fps. </p><p>  And in the ratings of the <span>best clamshell phones with a good</span> camera, and in the tops of modern smartphones, Samsung holds high positions due to its amazing reliability and stability.  The manufacturer offers customers quality products with parameters not inferior to competitors.  In particular, the C9 Plus model from the Galaxy series flawlessly shoots video.  True, you need to understand: the higher the resolution, the larger the file size, therefore, for maximum video quality, the duration is limited to five minutes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digit.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rating good camera battery" class="if uuid-2954831" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954831.jpg"></div><h2>  Convenient and reliable </h2><p>  In the ratings of phones with the best cameras, they definitely note the convenience of using the application built into the S9 Plus model for photographing.  It is possible to select the appropriate level of sensitivity to light, set the exposure time and aperture value.  The same options can be selected for movie shooting.  If the user prefers to take a minimum of responsibility for the choice of settings, Galaxy will not disappoint: there is an advanced mode of automatic selection of characteristics. </p><p>  The application through which you can use the camera is quite light and easy to use, although there are several features that significantly distinguish it from competitors.  According to some experts, there are too many functions and symbols, options and modes, which makes it difficult to use the program. </p><p>  Although Samsung has traditionally attracted the attention of users with its models included in the ratings of budget mobile phones with a good camera, the flagship C9 Plus deserves no less attention.  It is equipped with a portrait shooting mode that is equally effective for all cameras.  You can adjust the background blur level, as well as decorate the picture to your liking.  Blur can be adjusted on the finished picture. </p><p>  The finished picture is compiled from two made by two cameras, so the user can choose which of the images will be dominant.  According to experts, this device copes well with the photographing function, provides excellent contrast and good color reproduction, although it may be wrong in skin tones.  For those who do not like to decorate pictures, the function of a complete rejection of additional effects is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wccftech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phones rating best cameras" class="if uuid-2954832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954832.jpg"></div><h2>  The flagship of Google </h2><p>  In comparison with the models described above, the Pixel 2 HL phone could even be included in the rating of inexpensive phones with a good camera, if not for two ‚Äúbuts‚Äù: in comparison with other products of the smartphone market, the device still costs more, in addition, Our country is not officially sold.  The price of a product depends on currency fluctuations.  With a favorable ratio, the purchase will cost less than 50 thousand, with a change not in favor of the buyer it can exceed 55 thousand.  But for a Western client, this model rightfully represents almost the best option for a budget, affordable, high-quality phone with excellent photography capabilities. </p><p>  According to experts, already the first Google smartphone had an impeccable camera, and the new product has all the advantages of its predecessors, significantly improved by the company's engineers.  Compared with the previously described models, the phone is not equipped with a dual camera, but this does not prevent it from creating beautiful shots.  There is a background blur function on both cameras.  By default, HDR + mode is activated, which provides high quality images. </p><p>  The smartphone creates a dozen consecutive shots, which are then compiled programmatically.  Such an amount of source material guarantees a wide range of dynamics, a variety of parts.  The sharpness is excellent, the color reproduction is impeccable, there is practically no noise.  Image quality is comparable to the result of shooting with a reflex camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pocket-lint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="phones rating by the camera itself" class="if uuid-2954827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954827.jpg"></div><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  In the ratings of phones with good cameras, the Google model under consideration rightfully occupies one of the leading places.  At the same time, a drawback is noted: there is no telephoto lens.  Engineers have suggested a workaround to solve the problem through software.  A special control system capable of remembering textures is provided. </p><p>  She uses this information, enlarging the image and reproducing elements that are not enough when shooting.  In fact, this is a simple digital zoom, but significantly improved in comparison with the standard, so the results are impressive.  The program works best when photographing people, and incidents can occur if you remove the greens, look at the background.  There is a fairly good quality of pictures taken in low light. </p><p>  Optical stabilization is provided for video recording, so the finished file looks good.  The sound is recorded in mono mode, so the quality is somewhat lame.  It is possible to shoot at a reduced speed at a resolution of 1080p, while the user chooses between 120 fps or twice as fast.   ,     . </p><p>  ,   ,    .         .    ,     ,   , ,    . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forbes.com" data-author=": GORDON KELLY, "><img itemprop="image" alt="   " class="if uuid-2954828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47518/2954828.jpg"></div><h2>    </h2><p>      ,     <span>    .</span>  ,  ,  .  ,  ¬´¬ª       .    ‚Äì   ,       .        ,      ¬´¬ª. </p><p> In the ratings of <span>inexpensive phones with a good camera,</span> they are usually mentioned: </p><ul><li>  Meizu M6; </li><li>  Moto G5S; </li><li>  Nokia 6.1; </li><li>  "Sony" "Xperia XA1". </li></ul><p>  All these smartphones are quite affordable, so the acquisition of the model will not be a significant burden on the budget.  Of course, the cameras built into them are not as good as those of the options described above, but many evaluate them as fully justifying expectations. </p>
