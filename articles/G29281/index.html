    <h2>  Wilhelm Frick: biography </h2><p>  Born on the territory of the German Empire.  His father was a teacher.  According to some reports, Wilhelm‚Äôs childhood was filled with physical punishment.  Allegedly, the father constantly beat his son for the slightest misconduct.  In general, little is known about Frick's youth.  He graduated from high school and entered the police academy.  Already in 1901 he became the head of the department.  Engaged in search and investigation.  Unlike Hitler and his first associates, Wilhelm does not take part in the First World War.  He studies law and begins to write the first articles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wilhelm freak photo" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1586092.jpg" width="300"></div>  In the early twenties, he met with Adolf Hitler and his friends.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since then, Frick Wilhelm has become an active participant in the Nazi movement.  However, he does not speak out in public, but only patronizes the NSDAP.  He also communicates closely with the occult society of Thule.  He uses his powers as a policeman to help his associates.  However, his relatively low position cannot fundamentally affect the political process in Bavaria. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  In the fall of the twenty-third, the Nazis conceived an open speech.  In Bavarian land, they were quite popular.  Therefore, Hitler and his closest minions, including Frick, decided to openly rebel.  According to the conspirators, the speech would have taken power in the region, and then moved to Berlin.  Ludendorf, the famous commander who was popular in army circles, stood on the side of the Nazis.  Frick was responsible for supporting the police.  William was the head of the station, but could not persuade his fighters to rebellion.  In the same way that Lujendrof could not give the order to the military. </p><p>  On November 8, the ruling elite of Bavaria gathered in the pub to listen to the speech of their leader Kara.  At this time, the armed Nazis took the building in a ring.  Hitler captured the government of the land and announced the preparation of a campaign against Berlin.  Contrary to expectations, almost no one supported the performance.  Therefore, the rebels moved straight to the building of the Ministry of Defense, hoping that such a desperate step would cause contention in the ranks of the military.  However, instead of jubilant crowds, they were met by a detachment of armed policemen.  A skirmish ensued, as a result of which sixteen Nazis died.  Hitler, Ryom and other prominent figures were arrested.  Frick Wilhelm escaped arrest and became in fact the leader of the "legal" Nazis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The head of the party in parliament </h2><p>  Hitler and other Nazis were held in very acceptable conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is wilhelm freak" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1586094.jpg" width="380"></div>  They quietly got together and could discuss any issues.  Also had a connection with the outside world.  From prison, they led the party.  To represent her in parliament, Wilhelm Frick began to run for deputy.  In the twenty-fourth year he was elected to the Reichstag.  In one year, he managed to gain a foothold in his place.  Therefore, in the twenty-fifth joins the National Socialist Party and is placed at the head of the parliamentary faction.

    <h2>  Political games </h2><p>  Who is Wilhelm Frik, already knew all of Germany.  In the thirtieth year, he receives one of the key posts in Erfurt.  All this time he skillfully maneuvered between different factions and associations.  His task was to ‚Äúhold‚Äù seats in parliament until the NSDAP gained enough power to seize power in the country.  For a long time, the public leader of the Nazis was Wilhelm Frick.  The personal life of the politician was widely covered in the media. </p><p>  It was thanks to him that Hitler was able to obtain German citizenship.  To be elected president, Adolf had to take some kind of post.  And Frick appoints him a military adviser in the land of Braunschweig. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wilhelm freak biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1586097.jpg" width="402"></div>  In fact, Wilhelm played a key role in the rise of the NSDAP.  After his election, Hitler appoints him Minister of the Interior.

    <h2>  New orders </h2><p>  Reforms Frick radically change the structure of Germany.  Regional self-government is completely abolished.  Institutions of the federal states are being liquidated.  Strong centralization avoids the possibility of consolidating the opposition in certain regions.  Also, under Frick, the Social Democratic Party is banned, the first anti-Semitic laws are issued. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wilhelm freak personal life" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1586099.jpg" width="200"></div>  The NSDAP board sharply reduced civil liberties of the population of Germany.  For total control, it was necessary to think pragmatically over the program of surveillance and terror of those who were objectionable.  This was what the minister was doing.  His experience was taken into account in the forty-third year, when Hitler gives Frick a new position.

    <h2>  Protectorate </h2><p>  Two years before the end of the war, William Frick arrives in occupied Czech Republic.  Photos of the new tread are printed in all newspapers.  It was a signal to the underground that now orders will only get worse.  At this time, Czech partisans have already launched their activities.  From the territory of the USSR armed groups were thrown there, who sabotaged production and supplies to the front.  Frick carried out brutal punitive measures both against the underground and against the civilian population. </p><p>  A week before the end of the war, he was arrested by the Allied forces in Bavaria.  After his capture, he was transferred to the Nuremberg Tribunal.  Frick's case was one of the key.  On the first of October, forty-six, he was sentenced to death.  Fifteen days later he was hanged. </p>
