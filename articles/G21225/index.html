Medal for the liberation of Stalingrad</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The liberation of Stalingrad is a large-scale military operation of the Soviet troops in order to rescue the city from a large strategic German group.  It must be said that the battle of Stalingrad is considered the largest land battle in the history of all mankind. </p><h2>  The reasons for the battle of Stalingrad </h2><p>  April 20, 1942 ended a fierce battle for the capital - Moscow.  Initially, it seemed that the German troops were simply unstoppable and impossible to smash.  However, Soviet troops managed not only to defeat the enemy, but also to throw him 150-300 km from the capital of the Soviet Union.  The enemy suffered considerable losses, but was still strong, but even this did not help him attack on all sectors of the Soviet-German front at the same time. </p><p>  It must be said that the Nazis developed the Blue Plan.  Their goal was to conquer the oil fields of Grozny, as well as Baku, followed by an attack on Persia.  I must say that the Soviet command was not idle.  They were going to conduct an offensive in the zone of the Bryansk, South-Western and Southern fronts.  It is important that the Soviet troops were the first to strike at the German and were able to push them back to Kharkov.  However, the Germans managed to defeat the Red Army and go to the Don. </p>

    <h2>  Error for Hitler in the Blue Plan </h2><p>  It is important that at this moment Hitler did the irreparable for the whole of Germany.  He decided to amend the Blue Version, according to which Army Group South was divided into 2 parts.  He believed that the first group "A" was to continue the attack on the Caucasus, while group "B" was to attack and capture Stalingrad. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This city was very important for Hitler, because Stalingrad was a large industrial center.  However, there was another reason: the capture of Stalingrad was symbolic for him, because the city was called after the main enemy of the <span>Third Reich.</span>  The capture of Stalingrad would be a huge achievement for Hitler. </p><p>  The liberation of Stalingrad was a joyful event that has not been forgotten and will never be forgotten.  The courage and courage of the Red Army men are worthy of respect, because they defended their native land and were never ready to give it into the hands of the enemy. </p>

    <h2>  The superiority of the Nazis over the Red Army </h2><p>  It must be said that the number of German troops was many times greater than the number of Red Army soldiers.  The Nazis numbered 270,000 soldiers, while the number of Soviet troops was only 160,000.  There were also much fewer guns and military equipment than the enemy.  With such an unequal number of soldiers and equipment, the Red Army were forced to defend Stalingrad.  It is also important that steppe terrain was another problem, because enemy tanks could operate here in full force. </p><h2>  The attack on Stalingrad.  First stage </h2><p>  On July 17, 1942, the Nazi offensive began on Stalingrad.  By July 22, German troops managed to push the Red Army almost 70 km.  The German command hoped to take the city lightning fast, as a result of which it decided to create two strike groups that advanced from the south and north. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  July 23, the northern group struck and was able to break through the front of the defense of Soviet troops.  Already on July 26, the Nazis reached the Don.  The command organized a counterattack. </p><p>  In the territory of Kalach, the villages of Trekhostrovskaya and Kachalinskaya, fierce battles lasted until August 7-8.  The Soviet troops only managed to unblock the Nazis, but there was no question of their defeat.  The level of training and errors in coordination of actions affected the course of hostilities. </p>

    <h2>  On the 30th of August </h2><p>  The Soviet command ordered to strike at the German army in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Nizhne-Chirskaya no later than August 30.  The combat capabilities of the Red Army suffered from joining the battle on the move, but they still managed to oust the Nazis and even create a threat to their environment.  But the German army still managed to help their group.  They introduced fresh troops, after which the battles near Stalingrad became even fiercer. </p><p>  The liberation of Stalingrad is a battle that is rightfully considered the largest of the land battles.  For all the time she claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, because of her many tears of mothers, daughters and wives were shed.  The courage of the <span>Soviet army</span> will forever remain in the hearts of everyone. </p><p>  On August 16, Soviet troops retreated behind the Don, and already on August 23 the Nazis reached the Volga. </p>
