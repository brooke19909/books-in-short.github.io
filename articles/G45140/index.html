For those who want to send an email, the Yanais Hotel (Adler), how to get to it, we learn a little later, has its own mail address: yanaishotel@mail.ru. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  At this stage of its development, the project offers tourists a huge number of rooms of different categories, which are located on 5 floors of a 6-storey hotel.  Here you will find standard rooms for one person, and even huge rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 50 square meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Well, now let's discuss in more detail the rooms available for ordering on each floor of this tourist attraction.  We note right away that, unfortunately, there are no rooms at the first level of the draft, therefore we will begin our review with the premises located on the second and next floors. </p><h2>  Studio at 2-4 levels </h2><p>  In this case, anyone can stay in a comfortable studio room of the first category with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã27 square meters, which is designed for 2 people.  Here you will be available two twin or one double bed.  By the way, if you three arrived in Adler, then you can also rent this particular room, because especially for you, the hotel will make one more place on a folding sofa for an additional fee. </p>

    <p>  In the bathroom you will find a bathroom and a bidet, as well as a set of 4 towels per visitor.  In addition, the room itself has a TV, refrigerator, air conditioning, minibar, telephone, floor lamp, heating radiators and a hairdryer.  It is also worth noting that in studio comfort there are hygiene kits, the number of which depends on the number of residents.  These kits include shampoo, soap and slippers.  Please note that the room is equipped with fire and burglar alarms. </p><h2>  Family Room </h2><p>  The next room on the second, third and fourth floors is the family suite, which is 34 square meters.  In this case, two people can be accommodated in the main places and the same number of additional ones (folding sofa and chair). </p><p>  In the bathroom you can use the shower and toilet.  Each guest is given a personal set consisting of 4 different types of towels.  The room has a TV, fridge with minibar, telephone, floor lamp, hairdryer and other amenities. </p><p>  In addition, the family suite has hygiene kits for everyone living (shampoo, soap, toothbrush, shower cap, paste and slippers).  It is impossible not to note the presence in the room of a small kitchen, which offers a gorgeous view of the pool.  The premises are equipped with all necessary security systems. </p><h2>  Studio Suite First Category </h2><p>  Hotel "Yanais" (Adler), which is located, see the corresponding section above in this article, offers its guests to rent a first-class luxury studio with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã33 square meters.  Just note that in this one-room apartment only 3 people can stay, one of whom will rest in an additional place.  In this case, you will be available a double French bed or two separate.  Entering the bathroom, you will see the presence of a bathtub, hairdryer and bidet. </p><p>  In addition, it is worth noting that the administration provides a complex of 4 types of towels to each guest of the hotel.

    <p>  As in other rooms, there are hygiene kits for customers here, and an additional advantage will be the presence of a balcony, from where a breathtaking view of the sea or the pool will open.  By the way, it is also worth noting that there is furniture on the balcony, although it is exclusively plastic, but this is a trifle, is not it?  As for security systems, they all function perfectly. </p><h2>  Fifth floor </h2><p>  As you remember, earlier we noted that on the 2-4 floors of the project there are identical numbers, but on the other two there are some differences.  At the penultimate level, the Yanais Hotel (Adler), whose address you can find in the Contact Details section, has only two rooms: a studio suite of the 1st category and apartments.  We have already discussed the first, so now we will only talk in detail about the second. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p>  Three-room four-bed apartments are represented by 73 square meters.  It is logical that in such a large room there are additional places, of which there are 3 in this case: on the sofa and two <span>folding chairs.</span> </p><p>  The sanitary unit is equipped with everything you need, including a cheap booth and bidet.  As always, a set of four towels is available for each guest.  In addition, the room has two excellent TVs (one is in the bedroom, and the other is in the living room), a refrigerator with a minibar, a telephone, two air conditioners, heating radiators, floor lamps, a sconce and a hairdryer.  It is also worth noting the presence of hygiene kits in the apartments, each of which consists of soap, shampoo, shower caps, slippers and a toothbrush with paste. </p>

    <p>  Interestingly, have you ever dreamed of relaxing on a huge balcony with sea views?  If so, then you should definitely stay in the apartment, because this room includes a balcony with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã11 square meters.  By the way, there you will find plastic furniture (sun loungers, a table and chairs).  In total, the room has two exits to the balcony: from the bedroom and from the living room.  The apartments are equipped with the latest security systems. </p><h2>  Sixth floor </h2><p>  At the last level, ‚ÄúYanais‚Äù (hotel; Adler), reviews of which are almost always positive, is such a unique room as a luxury penthouse.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis room is 63.5 square meters, and it is represented by two rooms. </p><p>  So, let's immediately note that the living area is 40 square meters.  m., bedrooms - 19.9 square meters.  m., but the sanitary unit with shower - 3.6 square meters.  The penthouse is designed for 4 people and has two floors.  Three additional seats are available for order: two on a folding sofa and one on an armchair. </p><p>  In the room you can use two bathrooms at once, in one of which, as you already understood, there is a shower cabin.  Each person living here is given a personal set of 4 towels. </p><p>  The living room is very large, and there is a TV (plasma) with satellite TV, refrigerator, air conditioning, hair dryer, sconce, floor lamp and heating radiators.  It is also worth noting that in the room for each guest there are hygiene complexes, the composition of which you can find above in this article. </p>

    <p>  By the way, we also note that from all the windows of the luxury penthouse there is a bewitching view of the sea.  In addition, the room is equipped with the latest security systems. </p><h2>  Room rental prices </h2><p>  Below we list the rooms and the cost of their rent per day: </p><ul><li>  standard - from 1500 to 3000 rubles; </li><li>  Studio - from 2.5 thousand to 4.5 thousand rubles; </li><li>  apartments - from 4 to 8 thousand rubles .; </li><li>  family - from 2500 to 6500 rubles; </li><li>  penthouse - from 3 to 6.5 thousand rubles. </li></ul><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Yanais (hotel; Adler), where the balconies are really chic, is located very close to the sea, so getting to the hotel is not so easy.
