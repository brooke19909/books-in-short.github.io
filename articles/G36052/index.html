They liked the design of the complex and the quality of the service offered.  Although in the reviews, tourists indicate that the hotel also has significant disadvantages.  But first, we list the main advantages of this option for placement: </p><ul><li>  Fast check-in.  If the hotel has free rooms, then the administrators populate the tourists immediately, without waiting for the morning. </li><li>  Great location.  The hotel is located on a quiet street away from busy tourist destinations, so the area is always quiet in the evening and at night.  At the same time, the beach, restaurants and shops are within walking distance. </li><li>  Varied and delicious breakfasts.  It offers fresh yogurt, cereal, desserts and fresh seasonal fruits. </li><li>  Clean rooms that the maids clean up every day.  If you leave them a tip, they will decorate the bed with swan figures made of towels. </li><li>  There are monkeys on site, which are interesting to watch while walking in the garden. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel bar" class="if uuid-2958783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102891/2958783.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews about Krabi La Playa Resort 4 * </h2><p>  Of course, this hotel also has its drawbacks, although it is worth noting that they did not spoil the majority of tourists about their vacation.  As a rule, in their reviews, guests complain about the following service flaws: </p><ul><li>  The beaches near the hotel are quite dirty, and the sea is muddy.  Trash and algae also float in the water. </li><li>  Maids can pick up dirty towels, but not bring new ones.  They also replenish drinking water irregularly, so the administrator has to constantly complain about their work. </li><li>  Hotel administrators can be fooled by charging a fee for a minibar and service, so you should definitely carefully study the price before leaving. </li><li>  Be sure to close the windows of the room before leaving, because the monkeys can climb into the room and steal something of value. </li><li>  When problems are discovered, employees pretend that they do not understand English. </li></ul><p>  Thus, this hotel is suitable for tourists who are looking for a place for a secluded and relaxing holiday at sea.  This accommodation option has a lot of advantages, but you need to carefully monitor the staff, which sometimes can behave unprofessionally.  However, in the reviews, tourists note that the cost of the rest justifies itself, so they recommend coming here, especially with young children. </p>
