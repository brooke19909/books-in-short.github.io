Different categories of tourists come here - party youth, surfers, divers, families with children, people who crave privacy and want a variety of excursions.  And all of them are satisfied with their stay on Koh Samui.  But the island, though not to say that large, but not small.  And since everyone has their own concept of quality rest, it is necessary to choose the appropriate location for themselves on Samui. </p><p>  In this article we will tell you where to settle on the island for tourists who want to be in the epicenter of resort life and at the same time sleep in a quiet and relaxing environment.  Hotel Chaba Samui Resort 3 * (Thailand) positions itself as a youth and budget.  And how is it characterized by reviews of tourists?  In this article you will find not only a description of rooms, territory and services, but also real photos of this resort hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chaba Samui Resort (Samui)" class="if uuid-3217517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217517.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it worth going to Samui? </h2><p>  Do not unconditionally trust tour operators who say that it rains in Thailand only in the summer, and even then at night.  In some parts of the country, this statement is true.  But Thailand has a fairly large territory, so that in terms of climate everything was so unambiguous.  And on the islands, including Samui, the weather is completely different.  For example, the rainy season is still ongoing here in December.  Showers stop somewhere around Christmas (12/25), but they can affect the beginning of January. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  High season lasts February, March and April.  But mid-spring is no longer a good time for a European.  It's getting too hot.  But in March, the weather in Thailand is almost everywhere clear and sunny, and the sea is calm.  However, no one is immune from the violence of the elements.  For example, in March 2011, after the earthquake that caused the tsunami in Fukushima, floods began in Thailand due to heavy rains.  In summer, Samui is cloudy, and this softens the heat a little.  It rains often, but indeed in the evening and at night.  But autumn for Samui is the wettest season. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chabasamuiresort.th-thailand.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samui in March" class="if uuid-3217522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217522.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The largest and most popular resort on the island is Chaweng.  It is here that all the entertainment of Samui is concentrated, there are the largest shopping centers and famous entertainment venues.  In Chaweng, in fact, in the very center of the town, there is a lake.  You can‚Äôt swim in it, but the water here is fresh.  It is near this lake that the Chaba Samui Resort hotel is located.  The hotel address says a lot about its location: Beach Road, 19. And here we are not talking about the lakefront, but the sea promenade. </p><p>  The hotel is located in a narrow strip leading from the lake to the central beach.  All the activities of Chaweng are within walking distance.  Nearby is a pier, to which ferries arrive from the mainland.  But the minus of this location is the proximity of the airport.  But Samui Air Harbor does not accept flights at night.  Many tourists even liked to consider planes diving overhead. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="9.5261006" data-lng="100.05953679999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/4/2/7/17427.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  In 1996, a small hotel was opened on the lake.  Two years later, the hotelier, having earned money on the first guests, bought the land on the first line and built a new building there.  Accordingly, the old began to be called Lake Wing (Lake Wing), as opposed to Ocean Wing.  In 2016 and 17 years, overhaul was completed in both buildings.  Refurbished not only buildings, but the entire territory.  What is the Chaba Samui Resort (Samui) now? </p><p>  The road, and quite busy, no one can remove.  She still divides the hotel into two halves - Lake and Sea.  The narrow passage to the beach is very well equipped.  Everywhere there is greenery, a beautiful shady alley has been laid, and at the Ocean Wing building there is a pond with goldfish.  There is a pool between this building and the beach.  There is also a playground and a beautiful gazebo.  What are the disadvantages of the territory: </p><ul><li>  Lake.  It is all in duckweed and smells of it is not too pleasant.  This is a mosquito incubator. </li><li>  Road.  The movement of cars along it is quite busy, but there is no transition. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chaba Samui Resort service" class="if uuid-3217519" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217519.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Based on the above, it becomes clear that the Lake Wing building is less popular than the one located on the very sea.  Its only advantage is that there is a lobby with free Wi-Fi.  The rest is just inconvenience.  The view of the standing and slightly fetid lake does not inspire to open the window.  There are no balconies in this building.  Therefore, all rooms in the building by the lake are cheaper than those in Ocean Wing.  Guestrooms at Chaba Samui Resort (Samui) fall into the following categories: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Deluxe (available in both parts of the hotel); </li><li>  Junior suites (by the lake); </li><li>  Family rooms (also in two buildings); </li><li>  Sunrise Suites (by the sea). </li></ul><p>  All rooms at Ocean Wing have balconies (on the upper floors) or terraces with street access from the first.  The last two categories of rooms for guests are two-room.  There are rooms decorated in hi-tech style, and there are - with a cute Thai decor. </p><h2>  Chaba Samui Resort: room description </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel has only three stars on its sign, it is not inferior in terms of comfort and quality of services, or even gives a head start to the ‚Äúfour‚Äù.  Even the lowest category rooms offer bathrobes and slippers.  Every day, supplies of drinking water, sanitary and hygiene supplies, tea bags and coffee are replenished.  After arrival, guests will find a fruit basket in the room.  If we talk about the technical equipment of the rooms, then it is up to par. </p><p>  There is a new design air conditioner ‚Äúclimate control‚Äù, a TV broadcasting satellite channels, a minibar that can be used as a refrigerator, electronic safe, telephone, electric kettle.  Tourists warn about the nuances of filling the minibar.  It is, of course, paid.  But two bottles of Evian water are on the coffee table.  Tourists take them for a free service, and only later find out that they cost 240 rubles.  Maids put drinking water in 300-milliliter bottles without labels in the gap between the minibar and the table. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chaba Samui Resort: room description" class="if uuid-3217525" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217525.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast is already included in the price at the Chaba Samui Resort (Samui).  The restaurant is located in Ocean Wing and has an open terrace with views of the pool and sea.  The restaurant is open not only in the mornings, and if you wish, you can buy half or full board at the hotel.  The hotel has a beach bar with drinks, cocktails and snacks.  T </p><p>  The hotel also has a Bakery Corner confectionery, where you can drink aromatic coffee with delicious pastries.  The price tag in a hotel restaurant, of course, is higher than in cafes on the street.  But the food there is very tasty, and the quality service.  In the evenings, live music is played there.  Directly at the gates of the hotel is the "Rock Cafe".  In general, in the center of Chaweng there will be no problem finding a catering point for every taste and the possibility of using a bank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chabasamuiresort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chaba Samui Resort: (Thailand)" class="if uuid-3217526" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217526.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Most of the guests at the Chaba Samui Resort (Samui) were limited to breakfast, and were dining throughout the day in cafes outside the hotel.  Morning meals are mostly positive.  This is a "big English brackest", and the British, as you know, love to eat tightly in the morning.  So in the restaurant hall, served in the buffet format, you will find not only oatmeal, but also sausages, bacon, beans, eggs in different forms (they are cooked directly by you), pancakes, pancakes, yoghurts, juices, several jams on selection, cheese and sausage slices, various pastries. </p><p>  Tourists note the presence of fresh vegetables and fruits.  There have always been pineapples and watermelons plus something else.  The waiters are quick, pour tea / coffee, so there is no need to go around the hall with glasses.  Many succumbed to the temptation and dined at the hotel.  Moreover, tables are laid in the light of candles and torches right on the beach. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Chaba Samui Resort 3 * - hotel of the first line.  But in Thailand, the beaches belong to the king de jure, and the public de facto.  That is, hotels do not have the right to restrict access and passage of people along the coast.  Since the Shaba Samui Resort hotel is located in the very center of Chaweng Bay, traders of all sorts of things are constantly scurrying along the beach.  But, on the other hand, you can have a cheap lunch without leaving the sunbed.  After all, macaroons go to the beach with their braziers. </p><p>  Sun beds and umbrellas are reserved for hotel guests and are provided to them free of charge.  Guests will find beach towels in their room, they are changed once a day along with others.  Maids are cleaned while guests have breakfast.  The hotel's large freshwater pool is lagoon-shaped.  It is located between Ocean Wing and the beach.  According to tourists, there are almost no people near the pool, although the water in it is very clean.  This tank has a shallow compartment for bathing children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.chabasamuiresort.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Chaba samui resort" class="if uuid-3217521" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217521.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  Service at Chaba Samui Resort is fully consistent with the three-star status of the hotel.  There is a free gym, a playground, a small spa with sauna and massage services.  The reception is open around the clock.  Kayaks and snorkelling equipment can be rented on site.  Babysitting services are also available.  The hotel has a tour desk, laundry and dry cleaning services.  Despite the fact that the buildings of the buildings have only four floors, they have elevators.  Parking at the gates of the hotel is free for guests' vehicles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelocity.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Chaba Samui Resort" class="if uuid-3217524" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3217524.jpg"></div><h2>  Chaba Samui Resort: reviews </h2><p>  Opinion about this hotel among tourists has been mixed.  All vacationers claim that saving on a room in Shaba Samui Resort is not worth it.  Indeed, life next to the foul-smelling lake (and hordes of mosquitoes) is difficult to call relaxation, and no comfort in the room can improve it.  The closer to the sea, the more spacious and better are the guest rooms.  No noise is heard from the road there, and a wonderful view of the water surface opens from balconies and floor-to-ceiling windows.  Basically, free Wi-Fi is available in all rooms.  But he catches well only at the reception, in the lobby.  The rooms are cleaned normally, and tips do not affect the quality of maid service. </p><p>  The conclusion of tourists is this: the Shaba Samui Resort hotel is suitable for youth recreation and for those who spend days on excursions.  Those who want to spend all their time in a hotel, it is better to look for another place to stay, with a larger territory.  But Samui will not let you relax.  There are so many interesting things around: elephant and monkey farms, waterfalls, Buddhist monasteries, sea fishing.  It is worth taking a sightseeing tour of the island, and see the bizarre cliffs of Lamai, the temple of the Big Buddha and much more. </p>
