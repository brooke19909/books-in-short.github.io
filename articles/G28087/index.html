Detailed instructions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Pillowcases are sewn in different ways.  This is a pillowcase with a smell familiar to the inhabitants of our country, a product on various fasteners - a snake, buttons, ties or Velcro.  There are pillowcases sewn with an envelope that are buttoned on the back in the center on the button. </p><p>  Decorate a pillowcase in various ways.  Add a frill or folds around the perimeter, lace inserts or combine materials.  There are pillowcases with ‚Äúears‚Äù in which after the seam 5 cm is left for the free location of the fabric. </p><p>  How to sew a pillowcase yourself, you can find out by reading our article, which describes in detail different ways of sewing.  The presented photographs will help you navigate in a wide variety of styles and choose the most desirable. </p><h2>  Standard wraparound </h2><p>  To sew a pillowcase for a pillow with a smell, you need to measure the length and width of the product and add the length of the spare part.  It can be different, but usually it is 15 cm. In the drawing of the pattern it is clear how to sew a pillowcase on a pillow with a smell.  A long rectangle is cut out, while it is necessary to add 1.5 cm on each side to the hem of the fabric.  Then the fabric is turned inside out and the fold lines are attached at the beginning and at the end of the pattern. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern of pillowcases with a smell" class="if uuid-2322107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2322107.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to stitch the smelling part on one and the other side.  The material is rotated to the opposite side and the edges of the length of the pillow are sewn together.  When everything is ready, the pillowcase is turned on the front side.  If there is an overlock or an overlock foot, then the internal seams can be processed.  If not, it is recommended to stitch the edges on all seams again on the front side.  Then the inner seams will hide and the threads will not come out after washing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The smell in the middle </h2><p>  How to sew a pillowcase with a smell around the edge, sorted out, but there are options for products where the smell is located exactly in the center of the pillowcase. </p><p>  To sew it, you will need to cut the fabric into three parts.  The first one corresponds to the size of the pillow with additional allowances for the seams.  And the other two are parts of the back side of the pillowcase, which will be smelled in the center of the product.  To find out their length, you need to divide the length of the pillow in half and add 10 cm on each side to smell. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cutting fabrics for pillowcases" class="if uuid-2321690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321690.jpg"></div><p>  When everything is cut out correctly, you can start assembling.  How to sew a pillowcase with such a smell?  We start with two identical parts.  They turn inside out, and one edge of the halves is hemmed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abeautifulmess.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sewing pillowcases with your own hands" class="if uuid-2321691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321691.jpg"></div><p>  When the edges are prepared, the pillowcase is assembled in the necessary order, as in the photo above.  Edges are pinned so as not to sew stitches together manually.  Using the overlock, the inner edges are processed along the perimeter of the pillowcase.  Then everything is attached along the perimeter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.livelovediy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="middle wrap pillow" class="if uuid-2321694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321694.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to turn the product on the front side and iron all the seams through a damp cloth with a hot iron. </p><h2>  Pillowcase with "ears" </h2><p>  Such products have small borders and are called Oxford pillowcases, or products in the Oxford style.  To figure out how to sew a pillowcase with the so-called ears, you need to calculate the sizes for the pattern.  On each side of the future pillowcase you need to add 5 cm. This is the usual size of the ears adopted in sewing pillowcases of this type.  The size of the rectangular pillowcase itself varies from 70 cm x 50 cm to 60 cm x 40 cm for children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="na.soboutique.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pillowcase with &quot;ears&quot;" class="if uuid-2321708" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321708.jpg"></div><p>  It is more convenient to always make such pillowcases with a zipper on the snake.  Be sure to think about how many centimeters you need to leave on the hem of the fabric at the seams and for sewing on the zipper.  At least 5 cm more must be added to the size of the pattern. </p><p>  We assemble the product as follows.  First, the edges of the ‚Äúears‚Äù are sewn together, then we turn them on the front side and embed the curbs along the planned line at a distance of 5 cm from the edge. </p><h2>  Drawstring Pillowcases </h2><p>  To understand how to sew a pillowcase on a pillow with ties, you need to carefully consider the image in the photo below.  The pillowcase is sewn exclusively to fit the pillow.  Only a couple of centimeters is added to the hem of the fabric.  A rectangle of double pillow length is cut out plus two centimeters.  Separately, the ties are sewn. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marymarthamama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawstring pillowcase" class="if uuid-2321710" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321710.jpg"></div><p>  When all the seams are finished, the stitches are sewn at the site of the tissue incision.  You can make them from the same material, or you can choose contrasting ones, or adapt thin ropes. </p><h2>  Ruffled pillowcase </h2><p>  Square items are often used as sofa pillows, for which pillowcases can also be beautifully decorated.  Now let's share the secret of how to sew a 50x50 cm pillowcase with frills and eye-catching ties in the center. </p><p>  Sewing such a pillowcase consists of several stages.  First you need to cut the fabric for the pillowcase itself.  It is divided into three parts.  The first is an even square with a side of 52 cm (2 cm will go to the seams), the second and third are the front two components of 27 cm each. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hgtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pillowcase with frill" class="if uuid-2321715" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2321715.jpg"></div><p>  Before stitching parts, you need to stitch a shuttlecock to the back half of the pillowcase.  Then the product is turned on the wrong side, and two front parts, pre-processed on the central cutout, are attached.  Halves close in contrasting color ties.  This is the front side of the product, because thanks to the bright ribbons, the pillow becomes spectacular. </p><p>  The article describes only a few simple options for sewing pillowcases with a smell and ties.  It is possible to diversify tailoring by alternating fabric.  For example, for the front side, a bright color is selected, and the back side can be plain and modest.  In sewing, you need to take into account the rest of the bedding so that the pillowcase on the bed looks harmonious. </p>
