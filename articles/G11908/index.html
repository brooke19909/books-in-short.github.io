    <h2>  Sports and leisure activities </h2><p>  Fans of a relaxing holiday will find here a huge library, which contains a variety of literature.  But usually active counselors do not allow anyone to sit out with a book for a long time.  Each day of arrival is a small adventure that will be remembered for a lifetime.  There are small walking excursions with picnics in the fresh air, rallies and hikes, competitions and sports days.  Fitness classes with interesting contests and relay races diversify the day, and evening is the time for the most significant events.  The real Olympic Games are held here, with ceremonial lighting of fire.  There are many other traditional holidays - ‚ÄúDay of Neptune‚Äù, ‚ÄúInitiation into captains‚Äù, etc. </p><p>  The most striking events are usually timed to the end of the season, then the final competitions in seven sports are held.  They begin to prepare for the pearl festival at least a week in advance.  It includes a bright carnival procession, many events, and with the onset of twilight - a star ball and a luxurious salute.  Children remember this last evening for the whole year.  If we talk about the best places for children's recreation, then in the first place is the "Pearl of Russia" (Anapa).  The price of a ticket for a full race is about 33,000 rubles, but children's health is worth it. </p>
