    <h2>  Verification Methods </h2><p>  Interested in tax debts of individuals?  How to find out about the presence of a particular debt?  In Russia, there are many answers to this question.  You can choose any of them.  The main thing is to take into account the characteristics of each. </p><p>  Today, tax verification is carried out: </p><ul><li>  personally by a citizen through the <span>tax service</span> ; </li><li>  through the portal "State Services"; </li><li>  through the page of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  using the bailiff site; </li><li>  through electronic wallets; </li><li>  using online banking; </li><li>  through third-party verification services. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you can receive notifications by mail.  This is the most common scenario. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  By mail </h2><p>  Why?  Tax debts may vary.  Among them are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  payments that must be paid by a certain date; </li><li>  overdue taxes. </li></ul><p>  This fact is important to consider.  After all, <span>tax notifications</span> received by mail to a citizen, as a rule, indicate the need for settlements with the state.  Just wait a little and a notification from the Federal Tax Service will be placed in the mailbox asking you to pay the tax.  The same goes for debt cases.  But what if the notification is lost?  Or do you want to know in advance what kind of tax debts a person has?  In such situations, it is recommended to start an independent check.  Next, we will talk about all the scenarios in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax debts check" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1655278.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Personal visit to the Federal Tax Service </h2><p>  100% reliable information on debts and taxes paid can be obtained using the regional department of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation.  A citizen must come to the appropriate organization (by registration) and submit a request of an established form.  It is usually sufficient to simply ask an employee to report tax debts. </p><p>  With him, a citizen must bring: </p><ul><li>  identification; </li><li>  TIN (if available); </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  It is advisable to carry documents establishing the rights to a particular object.  For example, a certificate of ownership of the apartment.  This will help establish the legality of tax assessment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  A personal visit to the Federal Tax Service is by no means the most common occurrence.  Most often, tax debts to be checked are decided independently.  This can be done using the Internet. </p><h2>  FTS website </h2><p>  For example, using the website of the Federal Tax Service.  The presence of a "Personal Account" here greatly facilitates the task.  You must contact the service "Debt Check".  Working with him is easier than it sounds.  This feature allows using TIN to obtain information on tax arrears of a citizen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax debts of individuals how to find out" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1655277.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What needs to be done to translate ideas into reality?  Required: </p><ol><li>  Visit nalog.ru website.  If you have an account, then go through the authorization in the "My Account".  In the absence thereof, click on "Registration" and create a profile. </li><li>  After completing the authorization in the "My Account" fill out a citizen's application form.  Be sure to specify the TIN. </li><li>  Refresh the page and study the information on debts to tax authorities.  You can find the service "Debt Check", enter the TIN of the debtor and study the results. </li></ol><p>  Quick, easy, convenient.  The disadvantage of this method is the need for registration, as well as waiting for profile activation.  It takes 3 days.  You can get a password to enter the "Personal Account" on the website of the Federal Tax Service only at the tax inspection of the village.  Therefore, tax debts can be checked by other methods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Portal "Public services" </h2><p>  For example, use the service "State services".  This is another good option that can quickly and accurately issue information on debts to the state.  To translate ideas into reality, you must have an active profile on the service.  If there is no account, it is recommended to choose any other verification method.  After all, activation will take about 14-15 days. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the availability of registration at the State Service provides access to all services of the service.  Informing a citizen does not require payment.  To find out tax debts in this way, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Go to Gususlugi.ru.  Log in to the portal. </li><li>  Visit the section "Popular Services".  Select "Informing Individuals on Taxes" there.  You can type this feature into the search bar and search for it.  Or go to "Services" - "Federal Tax Service" - "Information". </li><li>  Read the information about the service and click on the "Get the service" button. </li><li>  Examine the information displayed on the screen. </li></ol><p>  Important: a citizen must have a TIN in his profile.  Otherwise, it will not work to realize the idea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tax debts of individuals how to find out by last name" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1655276.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Another way is to study "My Account".  It on the "State Services" will display all the information on the public debt of a citizen.  If necessary, you can immediately pay bills. </p><h2>  Bailiff site </h2><p>  It is proposed to check tax debts of individuals by last name without registration through the bank for executive office work on the website of the bailiffs of the Russian Federation.  This is a very common way.  But it will be possible to bring it to life only if there is a big debt, when a citizen is sued. </p><p>  To verify you will need: </p><ol><li>  Go to fssprus.ru/iss/ip. </li><li>  Choose a way to search for debt information.  Individuals can learn about debts using personal data. </li><li>  Fill in the fields that appeared after the previous step.  Pay attention to the items marked with a "*".  They are always filled. </li><li>  Click on "Find." </li><li>  Examine the data displayed on the screen. </li></ol><p>  If the search yields no results, this means that the clerical work has not yet begun.  Do not despair!  After all, the check is not over yet! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Individual tax debts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1655275.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Third Party Services </h2><p>  Interested in tax debts for individuals?  How to find out the TIN about them?  For this, there are a huge number of third-party services.  Sites offer using the TIN or F.I.O. of a citizen to issue information about all debts. </p><p>  Often, scammers are found among third-party services.  Therefore, it is recommended to use only reliable sources of information.  Without registration, you can check the data on debts by searching through the site "Payment of public services".  This is the safest solution! </p><h2>  Banking and Wallets </h2><p>  There are several more options that will help you study the tax debts of individuals.  How to find out by the name of the debtor about them?  For example, use Internet banking or e-wallets.  There you can not only get information about debts, but also pay on bills. </p><p>  For example, in Sberbank Online it is proposed to act as follows: </p><ol><li>  Register on the service.  Log in to Sberbank @ Online. </li><li>  Go to the "Payments and Transfers" section. </li><li>  Click on the "Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation." </li><li>  Enter information about the citizen.  Usually we are talking about F. I. O. or TIN. </li><li>  Click on "Search". </li></ol>

    <p>  You can study the information and pay the bill.  Similarly, they work with electronic wallets.  There, the algorithm of actions changes somewhat.  After all, a citizen should: </p><ol><li>  Go to your electronic wallet. </li><li>  Visit the "Services" section. </li><li>  Find the "Tax Check" service.  For each Internet wallet, this inscription will change, but the meaning will remain the same. </li><li>  Enter information about the person.  Most often this is personal data, SNILS or TIN. </li><li>  Click on the "Search" or "Find" button. </li></ol><p>  Done!  Tax debts are available for review and further payment.  How to act in a particular case?  Everyone decides for himself independently! </p>
