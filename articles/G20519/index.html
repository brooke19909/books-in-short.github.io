Advice to borrowers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When making a consumer loan, the bank plays a key role.  The lender is responsible for the terms of the loan, including the interest rate.  Not wanting to overpay, borrowers are looking for the most profitable bank for a loan.  Depending on the type of loan, the leaders in the lending market differ. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bkn.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="profitable bank" class="if uuid-3268441" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/3268441.jpg"></div><h2>  Characteristics of loans </h2><p>  To determine which of the lenders is better, you need to assess the need for financial resources.  Credit products of banks differ not only in interest, but also in terms of repayment, speed of registration and degree of approval of the application. </p><p>  To get a loan on favorable terms, you need to know the most profitable banks for loans in each category of loan.  For analysis, loans were considered: </p><ol><li>  For the acquisition of real estate, or mortgage contracts. </li><li>  Plastic media - credit cards. </li><li>  Business development - for entrepreneurs and organizations. </li><li>  Different purposes - classic consumer loans. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most profitable bank for a loan" class="if uuid-3268395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3268395.jpg"></div><p>  The analysis will reveal the leader in each category, since there is no bank in the Russian Federation whose loan products fully satisfy the needs of 100% of borrowers.  The distribution of leaders in the lending market creates competition and develops the banking sector in Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Factors of the analysis of creditors of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  To determine the best lender of Russia in each category were taken into account: </p><ol><li>  Interest rate.  This is the main reason why customers opt for a bank of a less well-known brand or arrange refinancing. </li><li>  The speed of clearance.  The loyalty of the borrowers depends on whether the client will have to spend 2-4 days collecting documents or the money will be transferred within 30 minutes from the moment of sending the application via the Internet. </li><li>  The percentage of approval.  Citizens do not want to waste time filing an application with a bank that will refuse in 9 out of 10 cases. </li><li>  Repayment conditions.  The more ways to pay a debt, the less risk there is to be late. </li><li>  Customer reviews.  Independent comments are taken into account on the financial portals Banki.ru and Compare.ru. </li></ol><p>  The most profitable bank for a loan includes at least 3 points in each category of loans. </p><h2>  Best Mortgage Bank </h2><p>  When purchasing housing, borrowers are looking for a bank not only with minimal interest, but also with reliable partners.  The purchase of real estate under construction is associated with the risk of running into bankrupt developers; in the secondary market, customers are afraid of sellers dishonesty. </p><p>  Borrowers prefer to choose a reliable lender who will help get a mortgage for the purchase and sale transaction with minimal risk and on favorable terms.  In the field of mortgage lending, the most profitable bank for a loan is Sberbank PJSC. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most profitable bank for a loan" class="if uuid-3268387" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3268387.jpg"></div><p>  Benefits of the lender: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Interest rate - from 6% per year.  Since 2018, Sberbank has been offering families at the birth of their 2nd child to purchase a loan for housing at a record low rate. </li><li>  13 lending programs in 2019. </li><li>  Collaboration with trusted licensed developers without financial difficulties. </li><li>  The mortgage market share of the Russian Federation is more than 51% in 2018. </li></ol><h2>  Credit card: where is it best to apply for? </h2><p>  Credit cards are gaining popularity.  All bank cardholders with a grace period can use the bank limit without interest.  In the field of the credit card market, the best in the Russian Federation are 2 banks - Tinkoff and Alfa Bank. </p><p>  Advantages of Tinkoff credit cards: </p><ol><li>  Interest rate - from 12% per annum. </li><li>  The speed of receipt.  Clients can get and take out a loan on a bank card within 24 hours. </li><li>  No commission for registration. </li><li>  The limit is up to 300 thousand rubles.  The amount increases to those who regularly use a credit card without delay. </li><li>  Return points for purchases of up to 30% from partners. </li></ol><p>  Tinkoff customers can obtain the most favorable loans from Russian banks on plastic media anywhere in the country.  Delivery is carried out by courier free of charge. </p><p>  Alfa-Bank credit card has gained popularity thanks to the most favorable grace period in the Russian Federation - up to 100 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="old.cbw.ge" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which bank has the most favorable consumer loan" class="if uuid-3268392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3268392.jpg"></div><p>  Product Description "100 days without%": </p><ol><li>  Record grace period.  In the process of using the card within the period, the holder must pay only a regular payment, so as not to be late. </li><li>  The limit is up to 500 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Minimum documents.

Attractive conditions for lending to legal entities in the Russian Federation are offered by the Otkrytie group of companies.  Since January 1, 2019, it includes the Binbank brand known to the Russians. </p><div class="photo" data-original="russiabusinesstoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the most profitable banks for loans" class="if uuid-3268394" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3268394.jpg"></div><p>  What offers the most profitable bank for consumer loans to individuals and legal entities: </p><ol><li>  Commission from 9% per year. </li><li>  5 financing programs.

Special conditions are available for salary clients, retirees, payers with a good credit history and public sector employees. </p><p>  Every year, lending conditions at banks in Russia change.  If a client applies for a loan and finds a more attractive offer, he can make a refinancing procedure: lower the interest rate so as not to overpay the lender.  Refinancing is available in almost all major banks. </p>
