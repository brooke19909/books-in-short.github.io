  <section class="page js-page"><h1>City of Pavia, Italy: description, attractions, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Unfortunately, Russian tourists do not know anything about this charming town founded by the ancient Romans.  But this is a real treasure, which boasts a colorful Italy.  It is no coincidence that Pavia, immersed in a special atmosphere, leaves an unforgettable mark in the heart of everyone who meets her. </p><h2>  Quiet town with a rich history </h2><p>  The picturesque corner, several centuries bearing the status of a campus, is the center of the province of the same name in the northern region of Italy - Lombardy.  It is located on the coast of the fast Ticino river, near its mouth, 35 kilometers from Milan. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.1847248" data-lng="9.158206899999982" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/9/9/2/11992.png"></div><p>  Now it is a small town with a population of not more than 70 thousand people.  It is hard to imagine that a calm and quiet place was once in the center of turbulent political events. </p><p>  Waterways passed through Pavia (Italy), thanks to which the city received good dividends from trade.  It is no coincidence that he often became the bone of contention between different states, passed from hand to hand, destroyed by invaders and rebuilt.  For more than 450 years, Spaniards, French and Austrians have been bossing here, which has not had the best effect on its economic development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A treasury holding unique historical monuments </h2><p>  The former capital center of the Lombard kingdom holds many unique attractions that have been perfectly preserved to this day.  To get lost in the streets paved with small cobble stones, where the true spirit of Pavia is hiding, is simply impossible.  Stone-paved roads do not always lead to ancient monuments, but no one will be disappointed with the walk. </p><h2>  Temple of Science in Pavia </h2><p>  The main attraction of the Italian pearl is its university, where a thousand teachers and more than 20 thousand students study.  The Temple of Science, graduated by the famous Christopher Columbus, makes a very pleasant impression.  Teaching is conducted not only in Italian, but also in English. </p><div class="photo" data-original="today.uconn.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University of Pavia" class="if uuid-2974021" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974021.jpg"></div><p>  One of the oldest scientific institutions in the world was founded in 1361, and it owes its appearance to the Visconti family, an aristocratic family whose representatives ruled during the Middle Ages.  The prestigious university in Pavia (Italy) is complemented by a cozy courtyard with tall columns, marble sculptures and picturesque loggias. </p><p>  Of particular interest are student dormitories (campuses), which are more reminiscent of luxurious palaces.  However, to be among those who are granted the right to live in them, you will have to pass difficult exams.  Tourists are not allowed to enter here, but sometimes students participate in various concerts.  Bright posters appear at the dormitories, and a cultural event guarantees complete immersion in the world of beautiful music.  Entrance for all comers is free. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  City of a hundred towers </h2><p>  Numerous towers were once considered the symbol of Pavia in Italy.  Wealthy residents erected them to demonstrate the wealth of their family, and the construction turned into a kind of competition between local moneybags.  Now there are very few magnificent structures that keep the passage of time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nemo2015.nemo-ieee.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Three towers in the square" class="if uuid-2974032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974032.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the university there is an ancient square named after Leonardo da Vinci.  It is on it that there are three towers built in the XI century.  Revitalizing the urban landscape, they have become a real decoration of the Italian pearl. </p><h2>  Covered Bridge - Pavia's Business Card </h2><p>  Even in the Roman era, there was a bridge over Ticino, built under the emperor Augustus.  In the XIV century, on the ruins of an ancient crossing, a new semi-arch structure appeared with galleries and towers, which housed the soldiers guarding the city.  It originally had a fortification value.  In the middle of the structure connecting the banks of the fast river and two parts of the city, a chapel of St. John of Nepomuk, the Czech martyr, was built. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Covered bridge" class="if uuid-2974020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974020.jpg"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the city's visiting card, the bridge, was seriously damaged by the bombing of American soldiers.  Three years after it, local authorities decided not to rebuild, but to blow up the Ponte Coperto covered bridge over Ticino.  And only in the 50s of the last century the construction of the crossing began, which already had not seven arches, but five.  The construction is almost completely recreated according to old drawings and drawings and executed so masterfully that it creates a sense of the Middle Ages, and not a remake.  It is also covered: its powerful roof rests on granite columns.  The automobile bridge with two pedestrian zones located on both sides of the roadway is a delight for everyone who sees it for the first time.  Amazing attraction, reflected in the river, harmoniously fits into the picturesque landscape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Religious monument </h2><p>  The city cathedral, in the design of which Leonardo da Vinci himself participated, does not amaze with amazing beauty, but also does not disappoint travelers going to a spiritual place.  It began to be erected in the 15th century, and only four centuries later the construction was completed, although the uniform style of the cathedral, which gained a reputation as a historical long-term construction, was preserved. </p><p>  Dedicated to St. Stephen, it is located in the very center of Pavia.  His main relics are the thorns of the crown of thorns of Jesus and the relics of St. Cyrus, who is the patron saint of the city. </p><h2>  Temple of San Michele </h2><p>  On the square of St. Michael the Archangel, there is another attraction of Pavia in Italy - the basilica of the same name, the construction of which was interrupted at the beginning of the XII century by a terrible earthquake.  Its walls are decorated with frescoes on religious themes created at different times, and the columns are decorated with bizarre ornaments that arouse the curiosity of visitors.  Here is stored an ancient crucifix made of silver, as well as a fragment of the inscription that was on the cross of Jesus Christ. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": Paolobon140, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of San Michele" class="if uuid-2974039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974039.jpg"></div><p>  It was this temple that became the prototype of the basilica of St. Peter and St. Theodore in Pavia. </p><h2>  Castle Castle Visconti </h2><p>  Visconti Castle is a particularly popular tourist destination - an insanely romantic place.  A powerful structure, more reminiscent of an impregnable citadel, appeared in the XIV century.  Its walls were protected by a deep moat filled with water and drawbridges.  Residents claim that under the construction are tangled underground labyrinths.  Later, numerous dwellings were added to the Visconti castle in Pavia (Italy).  The residence of the family, famous for its exquisite interior, after the death of Filippo Maria, Duke of Milan, which broke off the dynasty, is gradually declining. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Visconti Castle" class="if uuid-2974026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974026.jpg"></div><p>  Now there is an art gallery famous for its rich collections, and a city museum where you can find out the history of Lombardy in Italy. </p><h2>  World-famous monastery </h2><p>  To get acquainted with this architectural complex, located 8 kilometers from the city, many travel to a sunny country.  The Pavian Certosa, which served as the burial vault of the Dukes of Milan, is an old Catholic monastery that has been built for over a hundred years, and therefore traces of various styles can be found in its architecture.  Founded in 1396, it continues to this day. </p><p>  Hermits, preaching patience and compassion, like many centuries ago, live in solitude, almost without leaving the walls of the monastery and not communicating with the outside world.  Such selfless service to Christ attracted many Italian aristocrats who during their lifetime donated huge sums for the construction of a gigantic complex.  After their death, next to the tombs of the righteous appeared tombs of the mighty of this world, wishing to be closer to God. </p><h2>  Popular tourist attraction </h2><p>  A true work of architectural art, protected by UNESCO, is decorated so richly that not every palace can compete with it in beauty.  Everything is amazing here: the size of the abbey in Pavia in Italy, and its decoration.  At the sight of a facade decorated with sculptures and bas-reliefs, a luxurious marble altar, multi-colored stained-glass windows, well-preserved frescoes decorated with gold stars of a blue vault, visitors are breathless.  The most famous and most talented masters of their time worked on the interior design.  The monastic cells reminiscent of tiny houses with a hearth and a courtyard for walks are of great interest. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": Kekko73, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Certosa Abbey" class="if uuid-2974025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974025.jpg"></div><p>  For many years, Certosa Abbey, in which all members of the ruling Visconti dynasty are buried, has been a popular tourist attraction.  Continuous pilgrimage interferes with the recluse of hermits.  Now it is open for visiting only a few hours a day, and only at that time you can go into the territory and admire the amazing facade and interior decoration, not spoiled by inept restoration.  But lingering longer with tourists, unfortunately, will not work. </p><h2>  Reviews for Pavia (Italy) </h2><p>  Guests who have visited a campus full of young and cheerful people are happy to recall their vacation.  They notice a striking contrast between the fun atmosphere prevailing here and the austere background of local architecture.  There are no fashionable boutiques, like in Rome or Milan, and expensive pathos restaurants. </p><p>  On the one hand, it is a youth city, happy students from Italy and other countries enjoy every day.  They take to the streets, throw incendiary parties, celebrate graduation noisily, walking until morning. </p><p>  On the other hand, there are a lot of pensioners who understand the desire of young people to have fun, but live in a relaxed, calm rhythm and are not going to change anything - this is a serene and very safe corner, the inhabitants of which are in no hurry. </p><h2>  Pavia instantly disposed to itself </h2><p>  The original town has retained its flavor and charm of the Middle Ages.  Numerous ancient buildings and street layout make it recognizable.  It is best to spend a few days getting to know him to better see the most famous sights of Pavia.  The city, having lost its former economic and political significance, has turned from the capital into a cozy province, however, it always makes a strong impression on the guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colorful town in Italy" class="if uuid-2974040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2974040.jpg"></div><p>  If you want to be where it is very comfortable and calm, buy tickets to Italy and go on an exciting journey.  The hospitable Pavia, characterized by a very warm atmosphere, instantly attracts tourists.  After visiting her, the guests do not even doubt that this city has a soul. </p>
