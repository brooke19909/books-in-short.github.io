  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What you need to create unusual earrings with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, earrings are one of the most popular and favorite jewelry.  Many women wear them from early childhood, and men have not recently neglected this wonderful accessory.  The materials used for them are very different - from precious metals to wood and plastic.  You can even make earrings with your own hands. </p><p>  But the story of earrings is very long and rich.  Some even believe that it begins with the times of Adam and Eve.  It is perfectly known that about seven thousand years ago, in ancient Asia, earrings were already made.  Initially, their wearing was a privilege exclusively for men.  Earrings have always symbolized the affiliation of the person who wore them to a particular social layer or class, and their significance varied greatly depending on the period in history and territorial location.  For example, in ancient Egypt and Assyria only representatives of the nobility wore earrings, and in ancient Rome only slaves.  In the Middle Ages, the fashion for earrings either left or returned.  There was even a period of time when the <span>Catholic Church</span> forbade <span>piercing ears,</span> however, such categories of people as gypsies, thieves and pirates continued to wear earrings, despite the prohibitions.  In Russia, people also did not neglect to wear earrings, moreover, from the material from which the jewelry was made, one could learn about the social status of a person.  Wood and copper were signs of a commoner, and earrings with rubies and emeralds were the inheritance of members of princely families. </p><p>  Jewelry lovers can find in the stores a lot of interesting options for earrings, but if you try to make earrings with your own hands, you can get a beautiful exclusive jewelry that you can wear yourself or give to a friend.  For lovers of this type of creativity, ordinary and online stores offer a large selection of materials that are useful in work - you can limit your own imagination to nothing.  As a rule, in order to make earrings with your own hands, beads made of wood, glass or plastic are selected.  The pins and rings made of soft metal needed to create a jewelry frame and fasten its parts can be found in various specialized stores, and the hooks, thanks to which, in fact, the earring is held in the ear, can simply be taken from old unnecessary or broken earrings.  In addition to beads, depending on the initial idea, ribbons, pieces of leather, feathers, accessories - whatever your heart desires, can be used.  Of the tools, nippers and pliers are useful.  Well, then you can let go of your imagination and enjoy the process.  As a result, you can get jewelry of varying degrees of complexity, for any outfit from the wardrobe. </p><p>  If you master such a wonderful material like plastic, you can make earrings with your own hands, without even thinking about where to find suitable beads.  They can also be fashioned, and, of any shape, size and color.  The plastic itself is very similar in properties to ordinary modeling clay.  However, under the influence of high temperatures, this synthetic material hardens, after which it keeps its shape very well.  At home, for the desired effect, a plastic product is enough to burn in the oven.  Plastic of various colors and various brands can be purchased at any art shop.  Having also pins, hooks and rings, you can create very beautiful <span>plastic</span> earrings <span>with your own hands.</span>  Material under the influence of hand heat becomes very malleable and soft, and it can be given any conceivable and inconceivable form, therefore, again, the result depends solely on the author‚Äôs imagination.  In addition to the fact that plastic can be of all kinds of colors, after heat treatment it can be additionally painted.  Knowing <span>how to make earrings from plastic,</span> you can always look original and bright and realize any of your fantasies. </p>
