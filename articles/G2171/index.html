The main thing is to show imagination.  One of the simplest solutions is to create a saucepan from such a shell.

    <p>  For the above purpose, you need to choose a large symmetrical coconut.  From it you need to cut off the top.  It is convenient to do this with a hacksaw, as the shell is quite hard.  You can also use a jigsaw.  Throw away the top is not necessary.  After all, in the future it will play the role of the lid of the saucepan. </p><p>  All the flesh must be thoroughly cleaned from coconut.  Further, its inner part needs to be thoroughly dried.  The walls should be cleaned with coarse-grained, and later polished with fine-grained emery paper. </p><p>  From the tree you need to cut the side handles of the saucepan.  The latter can be attached to the shell using superglue or planted on small bolts by drilling the corresponding holes in the walls of the coconut.  Similar operations must be done with the pan cover. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Wineglass </h2>

Making a glass from a shell looks like a pretty simple task.  To do this, you need to pick up a coconut of the smallest size in the store.  Cut off the top from him.  Then the pulp should be cleaned.  In order for the glass to be stable, the cut off top must be glued from below to the main part of the man-made container.

For children it will not be difficult to make an original candle from the shell.  To cope with the task, it is necessary to cut the coconut in half and clean its inside.  The outer walls of the shell can be polished and varnished or left as is. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Next, you need to pick up a large candle, divide it into several parts and carefully remove the wick.  The wax should be heated and melted inside the coconut halves.  In the course of work, it is necessary to keep the previously acquired wick in the central part of the improvised container. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Everything, the candle is ready, and you can use it.  The main thing is to wait until the wax completely hardens in the shell.  In conclusion, you can decorate the walls of the shell with a pattern or with some small accessories. </p><h2>  Flower pot </h2><p>  What can I make do-it-yourself coconut crafts for the kindergarten?  It will be easy for children, as well as their parents, to make a pot for indoor plants.  The work must be performed in the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  choose large coconut; </li><li>  split the shell in half with a hacksaw or a jigsaw; </li><li>  clean the flesh; </li><li>  drill holes on the edge of the shell half in 3-4 places; </li><li>  thread a strong <span>decorative cord</span> through the holes <span>,</span> connecting its ends at the top. </li></ul><p>  At the final stage, you can begin to fill the man-made pot with soil.  Then it remains only to plant a plant in the resulting container and hang the product in any convenient place. </p><h2>  Lamp </h2>

An interesting idea is to create a lampshade from a shell lamp.  It will require imagination, drawing skills, polishing and carving.

      <p></p>
    <p>  To make an original lamp, it is enough to choose a coconut of the correct, rounded shape.  It must be carefully cut in half, and then clean all the flesh.  Next, grind and polish the inner and outer shell surfaces.  It is recommended to process the obtained blanks with varnish, which will give the finished lamp an attractive look. </p><p>  In one half of the future crafts from coconut, it is necessary to cut a round hole, the size of which corresponds to the parameters of the base of the bulb used.  Then, on the surface of the shell, you should draw any pattern of your choice.  It is desirable that it be made of thin lines.  The latter will act as a contour along which you need to drill equidistant holes with a thin drill.  Thus, when the bulb is turned on, light will pass through the holes, which will ‚Äúdraw‚Äù the previously depicted pattern on the walls of the room. </p><p>  Next, in the shell you need to insert the base with a bulb and fix it in any convenient way.  An electric wire must be soldered to the cap, at the end of which there is a plug.  In conclusion, it is enough to glue the coconut halves and connect the lamp to the network. </p><h2>  House for the inhabitants of the aquarium </h2>

The shell of a large fruit must be cut in half.  One of the parts can be thrown away.  The remaining half should be cleaned of pulp.  Next, a saw on a tree needs to be made along the edges of the sawdust shell.  A jigsaw should be placed here and a part of the shell cut in a semicircle.  Thus, you can get a hole, which in the future will serve as an entrance for the fish or crustaceans that inhabit the aquarium. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  In conclusion, it remains only to process the coconut against decay.  To do this, the product must be boiled several times in a pan with salt water, periodically draining it.  As soon as the water stops coloring, the coconut house can be immersed in the aquarium.  After some time, the inhabitants of the artificial reservoir will begin to inhabit the shell. </p><h2>  A bracelet </h2><p>  An excellent option for crafts made from coconut would be a bracelet.  Tinkering it is not difficult.  It is only necessary to cut out the ring from the shell in such a way that the wrist tightly fits into it.  The sharp edges of the resulting product must be smoothed and sanded for convenience.  You can do this with an emery cloth.  The surface of the bracelet should be decorated by gluing beads and other small accessories on it.  If desired, the product can be threaded. </p><h2>  Handbag </h2>

To realize the idea, it is necessary to cut two tops of the same size from the shell.  At the edges of the latter, you should drill holes where you want to sew the zipper.  In conclusion, it is enough to attach handles made of decorative rope or any other material to your shell at your own discretion.  That's all you need to do to create a miniature handbag for the summer. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  As for the second method, similar actions should be performed here, with the only difference being that the coconut shell must be divided in half into two equal parts.  At the edges of the resulting blanks, it is also worth drilling holes for fastening the zipper.  If desired, lacing can be used to connect the halves of the shell. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  As you can see, a whole mass of decorative or practical crafts can be made from coconut shells.  To give the received products an attractive look, their surface can be wrapped with fabric, treated with patterned thread or cord, glued beads, beads, other accessories that are used in needlework.  Crafts from both unpeeled coconut and polished shell with all kinds of drawings, carved motifs look attractive. </p>
