How to sew a DIY pencil skirt</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is simply inconceivable that there should not be a skirt in the wardrobe of a modern woman.  And depending on the style of this garment, you can create completely different images.  It is in the skirt that the female silhouette acquires such refined and sophisticated outlines that so attract the eyes of others.  Moreover, the variety of models allows you to choose exactly the style that will emphasize all the advantages of the figure and hide possible flaws. </p><p>  However, it also happens that the physique makes the choice of a much needed garment difficult.  Often, owners of wide hips and an <span>aspen waist</span> or just big ladies face it.  How to be in this situation?  Abandon the skirt or decide on individual tailoring?  You can order a skirt in the studio, but if you have at least some skills in working with the sewing machine, then this task is easy to cope on your own.  It is about how to <span>sew a skirt</span> with your own hands, and we will discuss further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a skirt with your own hands" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/499717.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a template </h2><p>  The first step in the work is to build a skirt template, with which you can simulate any style.  So, in order to develop the main pattern, it is necessary to take the following measurements from the figure: waist volume, hip size and product length.  Further, all measurements must be transferred to paper or construction film.  The back and front panels of the skirt are built separately.  To create a pattern, you need a long ruler and a marker that will draw well on polyethylene or paper. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY a pencil skirt" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/501805.jpg" width="375"></div>

One of the sides will be equal to the length of the finished product, the other to half the measure of hip circumference.  On the bottom line of the future pattern, the side is divided in half and, adding two centimeters to the obtained value, put a point on the line.  The same should be done along the waist line and connect the dots.  This straight line will be a side seam in the product, most of which will be the back panel of the skirt, and the smaller part will be the front. </p><p>  After that, 18-20 cm should be measured down from the upper horizontal and a hip line should be drawn parallel to the bottom and waist.  To sew a <span>straight skirt</span> with your own hands, you need to finish the pattern, and for this, it remains only to make the top on the template.  Along the hips, each of the panels is divided in half and, after calculating the difference between the volume of the hips and the waist, distribute this value to the design of the tucks and the side seam.  To <span>sew a pencil skirt with your own hands, you</span> should step down along the side seam 5-6 cm from the thigh line and draw a straight line to the bottom of the template, step back from the main line 3-4 cm. The side seam should be narrowed down on both parts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sew a skirt with your own hands patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/501809.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  In fact, a <span>straight skirt pattern</span> is the main pattern that professional cutters use to design new styles.  And here the question arises of <span>how to sew a skirt</span> with your own hands with all kinds of reliefs, folds and model lines, having only a blank for a simple cut.  And the whole secret lies in modeling, in which all the necessary nuances are noted on the blank for a direct product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  For example, in order to have model seams on the product, they are first marked on the template, and then the whole pattern is cut along the contour.  If folds are planned on the skirt, then the part is also marked, cut, elements are pushed to the required distance and the pattern is fixed in this position.  In the same way, the seams with the expansion of the product wedges are modeled downwards.  To do this, outline relief lines, cut the pattern into elements, and make appropriate additions at a certain height under the desired degree. </p><p>  To build a pattern of a tulip skirt, the incisions are made on the waist line to the bottom of the product and cut them, not reaching the edge of about 0.5-0.7 cm. After that, the incisions are extended to the depth of the fold.  It is worth noting that such clips can be designed at different angles, which allows you to simulate a tulip skirt, making it more interesting. </p><p>  The simplest modeling option on the main pattern is the construction of a skirt, narrowed down.  The features of its cut have already been mentioned earlier.  Even an inexperienced craftswoman should be able to cope with such a product, because it is very simple to sew a pencil skirt with your own hands. </p>

    <h2>  How to choose a fabric </h2><p>  The choice of material from which the skirt will be made is one of the most important and important stages of the whole process, because the appearance of the product depends on the fabric.  Accessories play an important role, namely, you should purchase a special skirt zipper and a pair of flat buttons for fasteners. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The fabric should be selected based on the style and season in which the product will be worn.  So, for example, for the manufacture of skirts in a simple crease, you can use both dense costume and light fabrics, but for a ‚Äútulip‚Äù cut, you should use dense fabric that will hold its shape well.  For a model from wedges widened downwards, the so-called year, it is necessary to select a fabric that fits well with waves and folds, and for a simple skirt, materials with interesting weaving of threads or patterns should be preferred. </p>

    <h2>  How to sew a baby skirt </h2><p>  Sewing a skirt for a girl with your own hands is quite simple.  There is no need to take a huge number of measurements, because, as a rule, all little girls have a rounded shape of the tummy and the hips do not stand out, so you only need a waist circumference and the length of the finished product.  The most successful model for a child's figure is a skirt with a small yoke at the waist and voluminous folds on the main panels. </p><p>  Cutting such a skirt will not cause difficulties.  The coquette should consist of two parts equal to half the waist volume + 3 cm for loose fitting and 2 cm for allowances for seams with a height of about 15 cm (a twist is already included in this size to form the elastic at the top of the product).  The lower part of the product should be twice as wide so that beautiful folds can be laid.  They can be bow, one-sided or counter.  Any of the options will look good on a little girl. </p><h2>  Other styles of children's skirts </h2><p>  A straight fit will sit well on a child only if the skirt is sewn with numerous pockets and various decorative seams, like on jeans.  Also, the child can sew a sun skirt with his own hands and collect it at the top with an elastic band.  To build this model is simple, the main thing is to draw two circles on the fabric.  The smaller perimeter should be equal to the waist circumference, and the second must be positioned at a distance equal to the length of the skirt.  With such a cutting, the product will be without seams, you only need to sew on the top of the belt with an elastic band and process the bottom.  Another good option for a child is a tiered skirt with numerous frills. </p><h2>  How to sew a tutu skirt </h2>

    <p>  With your own hands you can make such an interesting product as a tutu skirt, which, of course, will appeal to any girl.  For her, you will need to purchase a wide elastic band, equal in length to the waist of the child, and about 10 meters of tulle.  First of all, the elastic is sewn together, closing it in a circle, and then they proceed to cutting the fabric.  It is worth considering that when attaching the material to the elastic, it will stretch a little, so you should make the waist volume about 5 cm less than the baby‚Äôs measurements. </p><p>  The opening of tulle consists in the fact that all the material should be cut into strips 15 cm wide and a length equal to the height of the finished product, multiplied by two, + 4 cm. After the whole mesh is cut, you can begin to form a skirt.  The joining process consists in the fact that strips of tulle need to be tied around the elastic band so that the free edges are the same length.  It should be noted that the knot should not be too tight, the elastic band should not bend and deform, but at the same time the fabric should be firmly fixed. </p><p>  Knowing how to sew a skirt with your own hands, you can create beautiful creations with a combination of different colors.  A bow from a satin ribbon or a textile flower will look great on the belt of such a skirt. </p><h2>  Sewing Stages </h2><p>  How to sew a skirt with your own hands, having a ready-made pattern?  Regardless of the model, you should know some basic rules, which are as follows: </p><ol><li>  When cutting, it is necessary to add allowances for the seams (at the edges - 1-1.5 cm, for bending the bottom - 4 cm). </li><li>  All parts can be assembled only when all work has been done with the front and rear panels, i.e., you must first sew in the zipper and arrange all the pockets and other shaped elements. </li><li>  Before proceeding with the design of the side seams, they need to be overcast on the overlock. </li></ol><p>  Sewing a skirt with your own hands, patterns of which are made independently, is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance.  And if you managed to draw a template, then the sewing work itself should not cause difficulties.  The main thing is not to stop halfway. </p>
