It is simply unrealistic to describe all the sights and features of this corner of the planet in one article, so at the moment we will confine ourselves to its hot regions, in which the warm sea and soft sand allow you to relax and forget about all the problems.  The description of the resorts in Spain should be started from the famous Costa Brava, which is located on the northern lands of the province of Catalonia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of Spain Resorts" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/215474.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Translated into Russian, this beautiful name sounds like a "rocky shore."  The blue bays of the sea here are bordered by high and picturesque cliffs, and the villages themselves are located on hills and rocks.  The only drawback of this vacation spot is that the beach season here ends quickly, as already in late September the air becomes cool and the water in the bays cools.  Description of the resorts of Spain, which are located in Catalonia, would not be complete without mentioning Barcelona - one of the largest cities in the country.  In summer, every tourist will be able to fully enjoy a paradise vacation and swimming in the warm sea, and in winter it will be interesting to visit the main attractions of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Spain Resorts Description" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/215475.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moving south along the Mediterranean coast, it is worth mentioning the recreation area called Costa Dorada, which is included in the category of ‚Äúthe best resorts in Spain‚Äù.  Here, the maximum number of hotels is concentrated, in which families from different countries prefer to relax with children.  The main natural feature of the region is the golden sands that make all the beaches of the Costa Dorada cozy and attractive. </p><p>  When compiling a complete description of the resorts of Spain, we must not forget about the remote provinces, because they are the places where you can enjoy the summer at any time of the year.  Among these are the Balearic Islands, which are located off the country's east coast, in the Mediterranean basin.  Here there are both large land plots with large cities, and tiny islands where you can retire and enjoy all the colors of nature away from noise.  It is funny that in this region the national traditions of the Spanish ethnos, which are full of diversity and energy, and the silence inherent in the east are perfectly interwoven. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best resorts in Spain" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/215476.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Continuing the description of Spanish resorts, which are located far from the country, we will ‚Äúsail‚Äù to the Canary Islands.  They occupy their place of honor in the waters of the Atlantic.  The infrastructure in the region is developed at the highest level, the number and variety of hotels, shops, restaurants and other institutions will drive any vacationer crazy.  Therefore, to find what you like, every tourist can.  The main attraction in the Canaries is the <span>black sand,</span> which these Spain's resorts are strewn with. </p><p>  The description cannot be considered complete without Asturian beaches, which are located in the very north of the country and washed by the waters of the oceanic bay.  Of course, warm weather is only here in the summer months, and it is during this period that this place is incredibly beautiful.  There is no big influx of tourists in the region, so if you want to relax in silence and fully enjoy the traditions of this country, Asturias will always welcome you. </p><p>  The description of the resorts of Spain does not end there; you can have a good time in this country at almost any point in it.  The main thing is to find the most suitable option for yourself and enjoy plenty of rest. </p>
