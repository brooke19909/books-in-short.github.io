    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  As our compatriots, who have repeatedly visited other countries popular among our tourists, note that the territory of Rita Resort Resident is quite large for a <span>hotel in Thailand.</span>  However, by the standards of hotel complexes in Turkey and Egypt, it can be called quite compact.  Be that as it may, the area is very well-groomed, green.  There are a lot of funny figures, statues.  In a word, it is very pleasant to stroll here, besides you can find many places for a photo shoot as a keepsake. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  According to hotel guests, Rita Resort Residence 3 * is perfect for those tourists who do not plan to spend all days on the beach, but prefer an active vacation.  After all, you will have to walk about 15-20 minutes to the sea from the hotel.  Therefore, if you are mainly interested in beach vacations, then it makes sense to find another hotel.  However, most travelers were aware of this feature, so no complaints were made on their part.  In addition, Rita Resort is located very close to the main entertainment places in Pattaya.  So, you can drive to the famous Walking Street in tuk-tuk in just 5 minutes.  Also in the vicinity of the hotel there are a lot of cafes, bars, shops, souvenir shops, currency exchange offices, tour agencies, car and motorbike rental offices, etc. </p><p>  In addition, next to the hotel there is a large beautiful park in which there is a statue of Buddha.  Nearby is an observation deck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya Pattaya Rita Resort Residence 3" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1069732.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in this hotel includes breakfast only.  In the mornings, according to tourists, the food here is very good.  So, breakfasts for the most part consist of familiar foods and dishes.  However, you can also try something from Thai cuisine, for example, soup.  Rita Resort guests can also have lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant for an additional fee.  Cooking here, according to our compatriots, is very good.  However, many preferred to eat during the day in Pattaya's cafe or in those places where they went on excursions.  In addition, tourists are advised not to be afraid to buy food at mobile stalls.  She, they say, is inexpensive and very tasty. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As already noted, the Rita Resort Residence 3 * hotel is located far off the coast.  Walk to the nearest beach for about 15-20 minutes.  Many travelers solve the issue of movement very simply: they rent a motobike.  It is inexpensive, but at the same time you can independently explore all the interesting places, see the sights, visit any beaches. </p>
