The visiting card of the <span>largest city in Turkey is</span> visited by millions of tourists annually.  Despite the fact that there are several thousand mosques, it is this one that attracts the close attention of vacationers admiring the most beautiful architectural monument.  In our article we will tell the story of the appearance of the main attractions of the city, find out its architectural features and give important advice to tourists.  In addition, we will tell you what the name of the Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul is and why. </p><h2>  Popular area among tourists </h2><p>  The symbol of the colorful city is located on its main square in the historical center.  Sultanahmet district in Istanbul is the most popular tourist destination.  Protected by UNESCO, it got its name thanks to the mosque of the same name, about which the story will go.  A charming corner with many attractions is ideal for hiking along the old streets.  It is from this lively part of the city that the guests of Istanbul begin their acquaintance with it.  All famous architectural monuments are next to each other, and therefore they can be bypassed on foot. </p><h2>  Sultanahmet Camii, or Blue Mosque </h2><p>  Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul, located in the city center, appeared at the beginning of the XVII century, when the ruler of the Ottoman Empire, Ahmed I decided to build a religious monument.  The sultan, who inherited the throne as a teenager, wanted to leave a mark on himself, so it was important for him that the new mosque became a symbol of his beloved city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sultanahmet istanbul" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2134527.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the great Ottoman Empire lost its power and power, and troubled times came in the country, and the ruler turned to heavenly forces, hoping for the help of Allah. </p><h2>  The legend of the fateful mistake of the architect </h2><p>  According to legend, during the construction a terrible scandal erupted that could have ended very badly for an architect who misinterpreted the words of Ahmed I. The ruler wished to decorate the minaret with gold (in Turkish it sounds like ‚Äúaltyn minare‚Äù), and the architect decided what was required of him erect six towers from which they call for prayer ("alti minare"). </p><p>  By that time, only one mosque in the whole world could boast of so many minarets - Masjid al-Haram (Forbidden), located in Mecca.  And when the Sultanahmet appeared in Istanbul, which contradicted all religious canons, the imams of the city took up arms against the ruler, accusing him of pride.  Ahmed I made a wise decision: he did not punish the architect, because he really liked the construction.  And the seventh minaret was completed to the greatest shrine of the Islamic world, and the sultan fully paid for its construction.  True, historians believe that this is only speculation, and it is worth treating them accordingly. </p><h2>  Name entered in the story </h2><p>  The construction of the mosque lasted seven years, and in 1616 it finally accepted the first parishioners.  Unfortunately, <span>Ahmed I</span> did not long admire the amazing beauty.  12 months after the Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul was completed, he died at a young age.  It so happened that his name went down in history not because of military victories or the development of the economy.  Despite this, the ruler, who was buried in the mausoleum at his brainchild, is remembered to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultanahmet district in Istanbul" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2134548.jpg"></div>

Four minarets, decorated with three balconies, are located, as it should be, in the corners of the mosque.  And the remaining two, equipped with two balconies, at a distance, at the end of the square.  The height of each tower is 64 meters. </p><p>  Thanks to the skill of the architects, the Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul looks light and airy.  A high dome and a large number of windows create a feeling of floating in the air. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the name of the Sultanahmet mosque in Istanbul" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2134537.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe huge religious complex, which includes a Muslim school, kitchen, hospital, without a spacious courtyard is approximately 4600 m <sup>2</sup> .  Unfortunately, most of the buildings in the XIX century were destroyed, and only a school (madrassah) has survived to this day, which is used for its intended purpose. </p><h2>  What is another name for Sultanahmet in Istanbul </h2><p>  The magnificent mosque impresses with its interior.  It is decorated with white and blue ceramic tiles handmade.  That is why it is often called the Blue Mosque.  And this name has become much more popular than the original.  Tourists visiting the attraction for a long time remember the name of the Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is another name for the sultanahmet in Istanbul" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2134544.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Visitors inside admit that they were primarily struck by the unusual lighting, reminiscent of the glow of burning candles.  At first it seems that it is muffled, and the light is dim.  Surprisingly, it is enough for luxurious tiles to play with saturated colors.  The volumetric effect is achieved due to the huge number of windows that are covered with stained-glass windows. </p><h2>  Architecture features </h2><p>  The walls of the mosque and its dome, which are supported by five wide columns, are decorated with ornaments with floral patterns.  Here you can read the various sayings of the Prophet Muhammad and the lines from the Koran.  A soft carpet of a muted purple hue acts as a floor covering. </p><p>  A prayer niche carved from a whole piece of marble makes the Sultanahmet Mosque (Istanbul) unique.  On the mihrab lies a black stone imported from St. Mecca. </p><p>  In the west of the building is the entrance, which was used only by Ahmed I. When he entered the gate on a horse, he always bent down, thus showing his worthlessness to Allah. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel in istanbul sultanahmet" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2134569.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Rules for visiting a religious monument </h2><p>  Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul, with a capacity of 10 thousand people, is the most visited building in the city.  Along with Muslims, tourists who profess different religions can enter it.  Entrance to the building is free, but since it is an existing religious institution, you can enter it only in appropriate clothing.  Men are forbidden to wear shorts, and women are obliged to cover their bodies and put on a scarf or wrap, which is free of charge.  Before entering, you need to take off your shoes and put your shoes in a disposable transparent bag. </p><p>  During religious holidays and prayers (from 11.15 to 14.15 hours), visitors are strictly prohibited.  It is not recommended to visit the architectural complex on Friday, because on this day a lot of believers come to pray, and in the morning its doors are closed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultanahmet Mosque in Istanbul" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2134534.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The opening hours of the mosque depend on the tourist season: in winter, it receives visitors until 17.00, and the rest of the year from 9.00 to 21.00. </p><p>  To get inside, you have to defend a long line, which on average takes about half an hour. </p><p>  Taking pictures inside is allowed, but only without using the flash. </p><p>  In the afternoon, there is an influx of tourists, so it is best to postpone other things and visit Sultanahmet early in the morning. </p><h2>  Istanbul Hotels </h2><p>  Tourists who want to settle in the main square of the city can pay attention to the following hotels located in the historical center.  However, one must be prepared for the fact that living in this area will cost a pretty penny. </p><p>  <em>Arena Hotel</em> - the owner turned the Ottoman-style building into a luxury hotel.  The spacious rooms delight with rich d√©cor and elegance throughout.  This is a true example of Turkish hospitality. </p><p>  <em>Alaaddin Hotel</em> is famous for its picturesque rooftop terrace with stunning panoramas.  In addition, this is one of the few hotels where there is heating, and even in the harsh winter, no one will freeze in the room. </p><p>  <em>Ararat Hotel</em> is located opposite the Blue Mosque (and we have already figured out how the Sultanahmet is differently called in Istanbul).  It is not very spacious, but comfortable rooms decorated in the Byzantine style. </p>
