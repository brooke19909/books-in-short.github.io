    <h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  <span><span>The first branch of the company appeared in 1998. Then in</span> <span>Moscow, the Companion insurance company</span> opened its head office.</span>  <span>However, initially the company was called the “Middle Volga Transport Insurance Company”.</span>  <span>But over the 6 years of the organization’s existence, it has gained not the best reputation.</span>  <span>Constant structural changes and improperly composed papers led to the fact that during this time the company got a bunch of dissatisfied customers.</span>  <span>The most rational solution in this situation was to change the name again.</span>  <span>So the SOK enterprise appeared, and the next step was the renaming into “Companion”.</span> </p><h2>  Name change </h2><p>  <span><span>After rebranding, the company’s business went uphill.</span></span>  <span><span>Another central office</span> <span>of the Companion insurance company</span> <span>was opened</span> <span>in Yekaterinburg</span> , Samara and dozens of branches in other cities.</span>  <span>Also in 2007, the company began to actively advertise under a new name, while huge amounts of money were allocated for promotions.</span>  <span>These events worked, and after some time, crowds of customers burst at the door of the UK.</span>  <span>As a result, for 2013, <span>CASCO of Companion insurance company was</span> in great demand among car owners.</span>  <span>At the same time, this office was included in the rating of the most popular insurance service providers.</span>  <span>Of course, the growth of positions was primarily associated with the registration of policies "motor citizens" for motorists.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span><span>A little later</span> <span>, the Companion insurance company</span> began to provide services to legal entities, which in turn also increased their position.</span>  <span>As a result, over 400 offices were opened throughout Russia.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="companion insurance company reviews" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1918139.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span><span>Initially, the company’s customers were very pleased with the insurance business.</span></span>  <span><span>Payments are regular, conditions are quite acceptable.</span></span>  <span><span>During this period,</span> <span>reviews about the Companion insurance company</span> were extremely positive.</span>  <span>At the same time, IC entered the RSA and was a member of the most famous insurance associations.</span>  <span>Of course, the company's tacit confidence index was pretty high.</span>  <span>However, everything changed in 2015, when a seemingly successful company unexpectedly loses its license.</span> </p><p>  <span><span>Initially, customers did not even know about upcoming problems.</span></span>  <span><span>The first days, the</span> <span>phone of the Companion insurance company</span> did not answer, but no one attached any importance to this.</span>  <span>However, a little later it turned out that the problems are far from being connected with the work of the hotline, but with the fact that insurance policy holders will not be able to get their money back.</span> </p>
