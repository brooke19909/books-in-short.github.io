We have to find out what we will deal with, as well as learn how to connect and disconnect it.  After all, it is these simple actions that any cellular communication client should be trained.  They will help you to avoid unnecessary headaches about spending and ways to refuse (start using) services.  In fact, there are quite a few different ways that are sure to suit you.  The main thing is to know the algorithm of actions.  And then you can easily and simply choose for yourself what is convenient specifically for you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="option all russia megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875826.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  The first thing that we should talk about is about what we have to deal with today.  After all, the tariff option ‚ÄúAll Russia‚Äù (Megafon) helps customers stay connected even when roaming.  And it is precisely aimed at roaming. </p><p>  The thing is that all incoming calls will be absolutely free for you.  With all this, you will pay for an outgoing contact to Russian numbers at 3 rubles.  The same goes for SMS messages. </p><p>  The option "All Russia" works in the whole country.  With rare exceptions.  This is the Crimea and Sevastopol.  There it is simply impossible to use this opportunity.  In addition, it is worth considering another rather important point - this option has a <span>monthly fee.</span>  She, of course, is not very big - only 5 rubles a day.  Nevertheless, a quite substantial amount comes out per month.  But even this does not scare customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, if you decide to use our today's "object" in roaming, then you should study all possible approaches to connecting and disconnecting it.  In fact, it is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance.  The main thing is to know where to go and what to click. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone option all Russia connect" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29559/878390.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  Well, you decided to use Megafon in roaming (the option "All Russia").  It can be connected, as a rule, by many methods.  But it‚Äôs worth starting with the most simple and well-known approach.  This is nothing more than a personal visit to the mobile operator‚Äôs office with a mobile phone and a request for connection. </p><p>  In fact, this scenario is very good.  The thing is that this will save you from unnecessary trouble that may arise during the connection of the option.  It is enough to present a passport to an office worker, and then inform about your intentions.  Next, you will need to tell the details of the connection.  The initial cost of the service is 0 rubles.  If you need the option "All Russia" again, then its connection will cost only 30 rubles. </p><p>  As soon as you give your consent, hand over your mobile phone to an office worker.  He will do a little manipulation, during which you will be connected to an additional package of services.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough just to dictate your number to use the services of the help of a communication office.  That's all the problems are solved.  But even this is far from all the methods that can be used.  The thing is that it is customary for a modern client to provide a wide range of opportunities for independent connection / disconnection of services.  Let's find out more about them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet option all Russia megaphone" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/877515.jpg" width="320"></div>

And not only this.  You can start using new service packages, refuse them, get all contact information, and also change the tariff plan in principle.  Of course, we are talking about a regular call to the operator. </p><p>  Dial 0550 on your mobile phone and then wait for an answer.  Now inform the employee that you are interested in the option "All Russia" (Megaphone).  Ask to connect it.  They will tell you all the details regarding this feature, as well as warn about the availability of a monthly fee and the cost of connection.  Agree with everything that you are informed, and then you will have to (in most cases) give your personal data.  As a rule, they ask for a passport.  These are initials, registration, year of birth.  Occasionally they may be asked when the passport was issued.  After confirming your rights to the phone number, it will be enough to wait a few minutes.  You will receive a notification that the tariff option "All Russia" (Megaphone) is connected successfully.  That's all.  You can start using it. </p><p>  Only this is far from all.  The thing is that calls to the operator are slowly ceasing to be popular.  After all, now you risk getting on an answering machine.  Then any process of connecting options can drag on for 10-15 minutes.  Not very happy.  It will be faster to go to the nearest cellular office.  Thus, we move with you to other ways of connecting the service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disabling options all Russia megaphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/875823.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Teams </h2><p>  For example, you can use special USSD commands.  These are the numbers that are dialed on the phone and ‚Äúdialed‚Äù.  During this process, the request is processed with the subsequent connection / disconnection of services.  This is the most suitable option for those who want to cope with the tasks on their own. </p><p>  The option "All Russia" (Megaphone) is connected using a small and simple combination.  Dial * 548 * 1 #, then press the call button.  You will be sent a request.  After some time (usually after 10 minutes) you will receive a notification that will tell you about a successful connection.  Otherwise, it will indicate the reasons for the denial of the opportunity and troubleshooting instructions.  That's all, the problems are solved. </p><p>  The "call" for this USSD-team is absolutely free.  The only expense you can incur is the cost of reconnecting the tariff.  He is, as already mentioned, 30 rubles. </p><p>  There are several more options how to use the services of the operator Megaphone.  The option "All Russia", which we have already tried to connect, can be activated by several more methods.  Which ones?  Let's try to find out. </p><h2>  Internet to help </h2><p>  The Internet can also become an assistant.  The option "All Russia" (Megaphone) is also connected using the official web page of this mobile operator.  True, only Megafon subscribers have such an opportunity.  After all, she will have to go through authorization. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff option all Russia megaphone" class="if" height="212" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/877514.jpg" width="320"></div>

    <p>  Visit the official website of the operator, and then log in to the so-called personal account.  There, go to the "Services" section and find the opportunity we need.  Now just click on it, and then click on the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù label.  You can wait for the result. </p><p>  However, if you can‚Äôt log in, then you can try using another method.  Go to the operator‚Äôs official website, and then find there "Services".  Go to the "Roaming" section and select "All Russia" there.  Next, click on the "Connect" button.  You will see a window where you can dial a mobile number.  Do this and confirm your actions.  All problems are resolved. </p><h2>  Help messages </h2><p>  The last approach that can help you in the implementation of the task is the use of so-called SMS requests.  Each operator has them, and they are also free.  How to use this method?  Just send any text in the message to 0500975, and then wait a while.  As a rule, Megafon has the option "All Russia", which we are trying to connect now, is activated within 10-15 minutes.  As a result, you will receive a notification about the successful start of using the opportunity. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Today we have learned with you several simple and very useful approaches to solving the issue of connecting the "All Russia" special opportunity with the operator Megafon.  As you can see, this is not a big deal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting options all russia megaphone" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/877513.jpg" width="600"></div>
