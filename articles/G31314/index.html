    <p>  In 2003, <span>American scientists</span> discovered beyond Pluto another - tenth - planet orbiting the sun.  She was called Eris.  This was made possible thanks to the development of modern technologies, a few decades ago, scientists did not know about such interesting facts about space and planets.  Later, it was also possible to determine that other natural <span>space objects</span> are located beyond Pluto <span>,</span> which, according to the decision of experts, together with Pluto and Eris, began to be called transplutonic. </p><p>  Scientists' interest in newly discovered planets is determined not only by the desire to <span>study outer</span> space in close proximity (by cosmic standards) to planet Earth.  It is very important to determine if a new planet can accept people if necessary.  It is also important to evaluate the dangers of the new object for the continuation of life on Earth. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Some space researchers believe that interesting facts about space in general and the study of the features of the tenth planet in particular can help solve puzzles related to unidentified flying objects, the presence of grandiose structures on the earth's surface, and giant circles in the crop that could not find a real explanation. </p><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  Is the Moon, well-known to all earthlings, keeping many secrets?  Indeed, the most interesting facts about space indicate that the satellite of the planet Earth is fraught with a lot of mysteries.  We list only a few questions, the answers to which do not yet exist. </p><ul><li>  Why is the moon so large?  There are no more natural satellites in the solar system comparable in size to the moon - it is only 4 times smaller than our home planet! </li><li>  How can one explain the fact that the diameter of the moon’s disk during a total eclipse ideally covers the solar disk? </li><li>  Why does the moon rotate in almost perfect circular orbit?  This is very difficult to explain, especially if we keep in mind that the orbits of all other natural science satellites known to science are ellipses. </li></ul><h2>  Section 3. Where is the double of the Earth </h2><p>  Scientists claim that the Earth has a double.  It turns out that Titan, which is the satellite of Saturn, is very similar to our home planet.  There are seas, volcanoes and a dense air shell on Titan!  Nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan is exactly the same in percentage terms, as on Earth - 75%!  This is an amazing similarity, which undoubtedly requires a scientific explanation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, there is no evidence of intelligent life on Titan.  But perhaps the search for primitive living things on this planet is not hopeless.  Studies show that under the surface layer with a high degree of probability is the ocean, 90% consisting of water.  Apparently, interesting facts about <span>space exploration are</span> yet to come! </p><h2>  Section 4. The Secret of the Red Planet </h2>

    <p>  The red planet of the solar system is known to be called Mars.  Suitable conditions for life - the composition of the atmosphere, the possibility of the presence of water bodies, temperature - all this indicates that the search for living beings on this planet, even in a primitive form, is not promising. </p><p>  It has even been confirmed by science that there are lichens and mosses on Mars.  This means that the simplest forms of complex organisms exist on this celestial body.  However, to advance in its study is very difficult.  Perhaps the main problem factor is the large <span>distance from Earth to Mars,</span> which is a natural obstacle to the direct study of this planet - the flights of astronauts are still very limited due to imperfect technology. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Many interesting facts about space flights are related to our natural satellite.  The Americans landed on the moon, it is explored by Russian and Eastern experts.  However, puzzles still remain. </p><p>  After a successful flight to the moon and landing on its surface (unless, of course, these facts really had a place to be!) The program for studying a natural satellite was practically curtailed.  This turn of events is bewildering.  Indeed, what is the matter? </p><p>  Perhaps some understanding of this problem comes, given the statement of the American <span>astronaut Armstrong,</span> who visited the moon, that this <span>cosmic body is</span> already occupied by such a form of life, in the fight against which mankind has no chance to survive.  Unfortunately, the general public knows almost nothing about what scientists actually know. </p><p>  Despite the fact that flights of spacecraft with astronauts to the moon have ceased, the secrets of this extraordinary satellite invariably attract the attention of researchers on Earth.  The unknown has attractive power, especially if the object is in close proximity, by cosmic standards. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 6. Space toilet</strong> </h2><p>  To create life-support systems that function effectively in zero gravity is a very difficult task.  The sewage system should work smoothly, providing storage of biowaste and their timely unloading in normal mode. </p><p>  When the ship starts and goes into space, there is nothing else to do but to use special diapers.  These funds allow you to provide temporary, but very tangible comfort. </p><p>  Interesting facts about the first manned space flight indicate that the creation of plumbing fixtures for astronauts was initially given great importance.  Particular attention was paid to the individual anatomical features of the crew members.  Currently, the approach to equipping the sanitary zone of the spacecraft has become more universal. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 7. Superstition on board</strong> </h2>

    <p>  It should be noted that interesting facts about space and astronauts cannot but affect such everyday moments for ordinary life as, for example, traditions and beliefs. </p><p>  Many say that astronauts are very superstitious people.  For many, such a statement is puzzling.  Is this really so?  In fact, the astronauts behave in such a way that it seems as if they are very suspicious people.  Be sure to take a flight of wormwood, the smell of which reminds of their native Earth.  At the start of Russian spaceships always include the song "Earth in the porthole." </p><p>  Starts on Monday Sergey Korolev did not like and even postponed the launch to another date, despite conflicts over this issue.  He did not give clear explanations to anyone.  When the astronauts started to start on Monday, a fatal coincidence caused a series of accidents (!). </p><p>  October 24th is a special date related to the tragic events in Baikonur (the explosion of a ballistic missile in 1960), therefore, as a rule, no work is now being conducted on that day at the cosmodrome. </p><h2>  <strong>Section 8.

    <p>  The history of the development of Russian cosmonautics is a vivid series of events.  Remarkably, scientists, designers and engineers managed to succeed.  But, unfortunately, there were tragedies.  Space exploration is an extremely difficult area associated with work in extreme conditions. </p><p>  For those who cherish the history of space exploration, information is also valuable on significant achievements in the development of the space industry, and on seemingly small, and even valueless facts. </p><ul><li>  How many people know that the monument to Yuri Gagarin in Star City has one interesting feature - a chamomile is held in the right hand of the first astronaut? </li><li>  Surprisingly, the first living creatures that went on a space journey were turtles, and not dogs at all, as is commonly believed. </li><li>  To mislead the enemy, in the 50s of the 20th century 2 cosmodromes were built - a wooden imitation and a real structure, the distance between which was 300 km. </li></ul><h2>  <strong>Section 9.

If you imagine that you can conduct an experiment with its immersion in water, then you can observe how this amazing planet will float on the surface. </li><li>  The size of Jupiter is such that inside this planet you can "place" all the planets that rotate in their orbits around the Sun. </li><li>  A little-known fact - the first star catalog was compiled by the scientist Hipparchus in the very distant from us 150 BC. </li><li>  Since 1980, the Lunar Embassy has been selling plots of the lunar surface - to date, 7% of the moon's surface (!) Has already been sold. </li><li>  In order to invent a fountain pen that could be written in zero gravity, American researchers spent millions of dollars (Russian astronauts use a pencil to write in flight conditions of a spaceship, and no problems arise). </li></ul><h2>  10. NASA's Most Unusual Statements </h2><p>  At the NASA center, you could hear statements that were perceived as unusual and surprising. </p><ul><li>  Outside the conditions of gravity, the astronauts suffer from a “cosmic disease”, the symptoms of which are pain and nausea due to the distorted functioning of the inner ear. </li><li>  The fluid in the astronaut's body tends to the head, so there is a blockage in the nose, and the face becomes puffy. </li><li>  Human growth in space becomes larger, as pressure on the spine decreases. </li><li>  A man snoring in terrestrial conditions in the conditions of weightlessness in a dream does not make any sounds! </li></ul>
