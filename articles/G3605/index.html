    <p>  After that, you can tell that the world of chess is magical, so it is located on a special board.  It is drawn in the form of black and white cells that follow each other.  Then gradually explain how many cells are on the board, why they are needed, their location, etc. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the best effect, you can purchase one of the books on chess subjects and study it with your child.  You need to remember that you can not overburden the child, because in this case the game will quickly bother him.  On the day of chess (the initial stage) should be given no more than half an hour.  You can teach your child to play chess from scratch, but for this you need to interest him. </p><h2>  Learning the names of chess pieces </h2><p>  After the child has understood the principle of the game board, it is necessary to proceed to the next stage of training.  Chess pieces are unique, and each of them has certain opportunities for progress.  But before you figure it out, you need to study the names of the pieces and their location on the board.  This stage is very important, there is no need to rush here.  Each chess piece needs to be pronounced aloud several times and put on the board. </p>

    <p>  When the child learns the name of the figures and their location, you can move on.  The next step will be to study the rules of the course of each figure. </p><h2>  Rules for the progress of chess pieces.  Pawn </h2><p>  Particular attention should be paid here, since the moves of the pieces are the most important stage in answering the question of how to teach a child how to play chess.  Many famous chess players are still arguing about which piece to start training with: a pawn or a king.  Based on practical experience, it was found that starting a process with a pawn is more efficient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The pawn move is one of the simplest, but this piece is considered one of the most complex.  First you need to put one pawn on the board and show the child how she can walk.  We must not forget that a pawn, in addition to moving one square forward, can pass two cells under certain circumstances (the first move).  Next, you need to tell that a pawn can only beat diagonally, as well as about its magical transformation.  If the pawn reaches the end of the board, it will transform into any other piece (except the king).  Chess teachers recommend teaching children with rhymes. </p>

    <p>  After the child begins to confidently play with one pawn, slowly you need to add two, three, etc. As a result, you get eight pawns, and for children this is a big army with which you can capture the enemy kingdom.  It is necessary to teach the child to be more careful during the game and not be distracted by downed enemy pawns.  Only after the child has learned to play confidently with all the pawns can one move on to other pieces. </p><h2>  Rules for the progress of the remaining pieces </h2><p>  Chess pieces are diverse, and each of them moves should be studied in a certain sequence.  To get the most effect when answering the question of how to teach a child to play chess, you need to use the following order: rook, elephant, queen, horse.  Here we have the principle ‚Äúfrom easy to complex‚Äù.  The rook move is quite simple to explain to the child, the children better understand the direct moves.  The most difficult figure is a horse. </p>

    <p>  Here you can not do without textbooks and recommendations of experienced teachers.  The chess section will be an excellent choice for parents if you can‚Äôt train this child on your own.  Next, go to the king and immediately explain that this is the most important and main figure.  It cannot be brought down, but only captured.  The king‚Äôs move is simple, and the children quickly remember him.  At this point, it should be said that the king cannot go into battle and cannot beat a figure that is protected. </p><h2>  What is checkmate? </h2><p>  After a child remembers the names and moves of chess pieces, learning to play chess goes to a new level.  Here it is necessary to explain to the child that these concepts are very important, and to tell their meaning.  It is necessary to teach how to escape from the shah in various ways, and also to train to checkmate - the final result of the game. </p>

    <p>  After this, the child gradually begins to understand the meaning of the mat and will try to put it.  Usually the first mate of a child is placed with two rooks.  When the child has already delved into the essence of the game, you can find out from him what are the strongest pieces on the <span>chessboard</span> and why.  This move will give the desired effect, as the baby will consciously talk about it, knowing about the pros and cons of each figure. </p><h2>  Castling </h2><p>  The final stage in answering the question of how to teach a child to play chess will be an explanation of the principle of castling.  It is a double move that can only be done once per game.  This move causes certain difficulties in children, since it can be performed only under certain conditions. </p><p>  It must be explained that only two pieces are involved in castling - the king and the rook.  The goal of the double move is to secure the main chess piece.  The correct execution of castling is very important.  With her, the king can go once through one cell, thereby enclosing himself from the attack of an opponent. </p><h2>  The moral component of learning </h2><p>  Oddly enough, in the learning process, the behavioral factors of both the teacher and student are very important.  You can instill in children a love of chess in many ways.  For example, compose poems, fairy tales about them, sculpt figures.  In the process of playing and having fun, children better perceive information and show the greatest interest. </p>

    <p>  In the process of learning to play at the board, one should not forget about physical breaks.  At an hour, at least ten minutes must be given to the child so that he is a little distracted and digests the information.  It is necessary to teach the child not to scream, not quarrel, but to be more calm about the game.  Chess is a slow game where each move must be carefully considered. </p><p>  Summarizing all of the above, there are several conditions that can help explain how to play chess.  Rules for children: </p><ul><li>  devote no more than half an hour to training per day; </li><li>  teach the child perseverance and respect for the opponent; </li><li>  explain that you can not scream, quarrel, swear because of the game; </li><li>  to teach using fairy tales and rhymes. </li></ul>
