A crochet knit coat is especially popular.  The product outline has several simple patterns or individual motifs, due to which the result is visible faster than when knitting.  By the way, even beginners can create a thumb out of simple patterns, only you need to correctly select the threads, model, which we will talk about in more detail. </p><h2>  Varieties of Women's Coats </h2><p>  In fashion at the moment, knitted coats (crochet) are relevant.  The scheme of authors-designers was not disclosed, nevertheless it is exclusive.  But in appearance, you can choose a number of patterns, the combination of which creates a unique originality.  And the easiest way in fashion magazines is to look for a similar model for the right size with ready-made instructions for knitting, making patterns. </p><p>  There are summer and warm coats.  The former play the role of an additional decorative element.  For this purpose, openwork, loin, mesh patterns, large motifs are more suitable.  Such a coat is somewhat reminiscent of a long cardigan, as it can be without a collar, buttons. </p><p>  Openwork coats even of <span>thick yarn</span> will not work for frosts.  Here you need a lining of fur, on a synthetic winterizer or felt.  Those who do not know how to sew and are just beginning to master knitting, it is easier to refresh your old coat.  Create the top layer from openwork or motive patterns, and then sew it to the side sections of the thing. </p><h2>  Possible mistakes </h2><p>  Many needlewomen do not knit coats due to the fact that long items stretch faster.  This may be due to improperly selected threads, ignoring the preparatory work with yarn, weak knitting, rough washing.  When buying skeins of thread, pay attention to their properties.  If it is written that delicate washing is required, then the same requirement applies to future knitwear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat crochet pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602261.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Density can be determined from a given sample.  Tie a ten-centimeter square, compare with the recommended parameters.  If it turned out less, then you have a tight knit, if more, then weak. </p><p>  Both that, and another is inadmissible as the product will turn out either heavy, or extended.  Work with a sample to train your hand, or crochet children's coats (take the patterns according to your model).  Then it will be easier for you to see your mistakes. </p><p>  In addition to taking into account the density of knitting, it is important to find out the properties of yarn.  For these purposes, the knitted sample is washed, dried, and the shrinkage is calculated.  Without this calculation, the product can sit, fade, lose its luster, and stretch. </p><h2>  What threads are suitable for a coat? </h2><p>  Each yarn has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Consider several types of material. </p><ul><li>  Acrylic (polyamide, prelana, nitron, PAN fiber).  These threads are obtained from natural gas, they are called artificial wool.  In its pure form, acrylic yarn is not found, it is usually mixed with natural materials.  The main advantage is the brightness, variety of color shades.  Clothing made of acrylic and wool will be warm, bright, and will not lose its good appearance for a long time, since the yarn does not roll, does not fade and does not deform.  The lack of acrylic is expressed in low hygroscopicity.  Therefore, it is not suitable for tops and swimwear, but it is possible to crochet a coat from acrylic yarn (schemes will suit both with a dense pattern and with an openwork pattern). </li><li>  Alpaca.  Natural camel hair.  It is expensive in its pure form, so more often knitters choose mixed yarn (for example, with acrylic).  Clothing made of this material does not slip, does not wrinkle, retains heat, and has a rich color range.  The specified type of wool cannot be stored with mothballs, it is better to use a sachet with lavender, tobacco or cedar. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted coat scheme" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602262.jpg" width="280"></div></li></ul><h2>  Angora, viscose, merino yarn </h2><ul><li>  <span>Angora.</span>  Rabbit fluff <span>yarn</span> .  Products from it turn out soft, fluffy, can last several years.  But over time, the entire fluff comes out even when mixing different fibers.  Clothes from Angora are cleaned only in dry cleaning.  Therefore, this material is better not to use for crocheting a coat (a dense pattern will not be able to prevent fluff crawling out). </li><li>  Viscose.  Artificial yarn obtained from cellulose.  It is mixed with cotton, wool, acrylic.  This yarn, like wool, soft to the touch, hygroscopic, does not accumulate electricity, like acrylic, has a wide variety of colors.  But viscose clothing requires gentle care and delicate washing, as it can deform and stretch. </li><li>  <span>Merino wool.</span>  Yarn obtained from a special breed of sheep.  This is an expensive material that has all the advantages of natural wool.  Hypoallergenic, therefore suitable for children's things.  It requires gentle care when washing and drying. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet knitted coat with patterns" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602263.jpg" width="274"></div></li></ul><h2>  Mohair, cotton, wool </h2><ul><li>  Mohair.  Yarn obtained from the wool of goats.  This material, like Angora, is always mixed for strength with other fibers.  Products from it are obtained by air, but when washing require special delicacy. </li><li>  Wool.  Yarn containing different types of natural fibers (sheep, camel, goat, dog, etc.).  In combination with artificial materials can cost less than one hundred percent wool.  But such yarn rolls, wrinkles, loses its shape.  Choose a thick yarn for a coat crochet (a scheme with a dense pattern for products without lining and with an openwork pattern for models with lining is the most optimal). </li><li>  Cotton.  Cotton yarn.  It can be in pure form or mixed with acrylic, wool.  Cotton allows the skin to breathe, is resistant to washing, is easily dyed, easy to use, but loses its wear resistance when exposed to direct sunlight. </li></ul><p>  Each type of yarn has its advantages and disadvantages.  Before knitting, consult with the seller or rely on the instructions.  If you purchased an unfamiliar yarn, do all the preparatory work to study its properties, and only then proceed with the process of creating a new thing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat for girls crochet patterns" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602266.jpg" width="200"></div>

This model fits in the type of change-over vests in a circle, only with sleeves.  The product scheme will be as follows (each row begins with lifting loops (PP) and ends with a <span>connecting column</span> (CC)). </p><ul><li>  A chain of four air loops (VP). </li><li>  3PP, * 1 double crochet (CH), 1VP * - repeat 7 times. </li><li>  3PP, 1VP, * 3, knit over the column of the previous row, 1 * - 7 times, knit 2 at the base of the loop, from where the lifting loops begin. </li><li>  3PP, 1VP, * 2CH, knitted in one loop of the base (slingshot), 1CH, slingshot, 1VP * - 7 times, tie the slingshot, 1CH and the second branch of the slingshot into the same loop, where the lifting loops come from. </li><li>  The picture is the same, only between 3 slings you knit 3CH. </li><li>  Next, between the slingshots do 5CH. </li><li>  The subsequent rows are also increased by 2CH between the slingshots until you reach the desired coat length for the girl (crochet). </li></ul><p>  The model diagrams show the place for knitting sleeves (you create them separately).  The edges of the coat are tied with an arched pattern.  Sew on volumetric buttons, and get the original model! </p><h2>  Unusual thing </h2><p>  Interesting coats from motifs.  If the elements are small, then the model may be monochrome.  A product made of small motifs is suitable for almost all women and children, but of large elements - only for extravagant slim girls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baby coat crochet patterns" class="if" height="346" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602267.jpg" width="600"></div>

Sleeves are created by ordinary knitting from crocheted columns.  Further, the entire coat at the edges is tied with crochets, the lock is sewn.  If you choose a model from the motives, then use <span>melange yarn</span> or take a coat of several colors, then you will get an original coat crocheted. </p><p>  Patterns of flower squares: </p><ul><li>  A chain of 12VP. </li><li>  4PP as an element of a cone (2 columns with two double crochets (C2H) in one loop of a warp), * 5VP, a cone * - 12 times (that is, there should be twelve cones and arches). </li><li>  The next row starts from the middle of the arch of the previous row with a single crochet (RLS), 3, the cone is knitted in the next arch, 5, cone, 3, then the RLS goes to the next chain, 5 and RLS are knitted in the middle of the next arch.  Further, everything is repeated with knitting cones. </li></ul><h2>  Strapping </h2><p>  Knit motifs on a pattern, connect them with single crochet columns.  You create each part of the product separately, and then sew it into a single whole.  Next, tie the edges, neck, sleeves of the coat according to the drawing. </p><ul><li>  1 row consists of RLS. </li><li>  2 row alternate CH and VP (* CH, 4VP, CH *).  Note that the number of air loops corresponds to the number of skipped loops of the previous row. </li><li>  3 row consists of RLS. </li><li>  4 row alternate RLS and VP (* RLS, 4VP, RLS *).  The rules for knitting are the same as when creating the second row. </li><li>  5 row consists of RLS. </li></ul><p>  Sew on the buttons, get the original coat crocheted.  Patterns of a motive flower can be increased by building edges from double crochets.  In this case, connecting all the elements will be easier.  If you do not want the product to consist entirely of flowers, knit ordinary squares of double crochets of the same size.  Then, on the pattern, first distribute all the motives, and then connect strictly according to the drawing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet coat scheme" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602264.jpg" width="353"></div>

    <h2>  Summer coat of motifs </h2><p>  If you take mixed yarn from viscose and cotton, you get an elegant crochet summer coat.  Beginners will not have problems with patterns and patterns, if we take a straight silhouette as the basis.  Draw a pattern, apply motives to it.  Next, connect the elements of one part, see how many centimeters it took to tie.  Varying elements of different sizes or shapes, you get an exquisite coat.  Here is an example of a triangular and square motif: </p><ul><li>  Chain of 6VP. </li><li>  Alternation of 12 CH and 5VP between the columns. </li><li>  Alternation on the arches of the RLS and cones with VP (* SBN, 4VP, cone, 4VP *). </li><li>  Over the RLS of the previous row, knit * CH, then 6VP, RLS over the bump, 6VP, CH, 3VP, fan (4CH, 3VP, 4CH), 3VP *. </li></ul><p>  Square motif </p><ul><li>  A chain of 8 VP. </li><li>  16 sc. </li><li>  Alternation of 8 cones and 5 VP between them. </li><li>  Alternating RLS over the bump and 10VP between them. </li><li>  Alternation of two patterns on each arch: * 5,  in the middle of the arch, 5 * and * 5, 5, 5 * </li><li>  Over the arch between the double crochets, knit * 5, 3, 5, then 4, , 6, , 4 VP *. </li></ul><h2>  Final stage </h2><p>  Next, connect all the square motifs to each other, at the neck you place triangular elements.  So we <span>crochet a</span> coat <span>.</span>  <span>The layout of the</span> bottom, sleeves and neck is as follows: </p><ul><li>  Alternate 5 CH and 3VP. </li><li>  Above the five posts in the middle, knit * 3CH, 2VP, a slingshot with 3VP between them in the middle of the arch of the previous row, 2VP *. </li><li>  * 1CH over the three columns of the previous row, 1VP, in the slingshot arch, knit 4 bumps with 2VP between them, 1VP *. </li><li>  You tie an arch with cones on the sc and pico (3VP in one base loop) over each arch. </li></ul><p>  The summer coat is tied with a cord at the waist.  The same patterns can be taken for the winter version.  Just buy thick yarn and adjust the pattern with the collar.  Such a model will require lining. </p><p>  Novice craftswomen can tie a straight silhouette coat with continuous single crochet or with one crochet with yarn of yarn (these threads are dyed in 5-6 colors with a smooth transition, which allows you to create an extraordinary pattern) or in stripes, combining skeins of two or three colors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coat crochet patterns and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/602259.jpg" width="326"></div>

    <h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  Crochet coats are now in fashion.  With schemes, many models for slender girls are presented.  But any product you like can be adjusted to fit your shape.  To do this, make a pattern for individual measurements in full growth.  Then knit a sample of yarn, calculate how much material is needed.  The knitting should be of medium density, since free weaving does not hold its shape, and a dense coat becomes heavy in weight, the threads are deformed.  In this case, experiment with different hooks to get into the given parameters of the sample. </p><p>  It is better for beginners to train on children's or puppet things in order to understand the essence of the preparatory work with yarn.  Start a diary and write down the properties of threads there, then when knitting any product it will take less time to prepare. </p>
