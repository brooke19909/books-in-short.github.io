It is the second largest island of the Saronic Gulf.  According to legend, the beautiful Aegina was kidnapped by Zeus.  This happened on one of the islands that was formerly called Aeona, and today is called Aegina. </p><p>  Comparison of the island with the pearl in the crown of the argosaronic archipelago is completely justified - it is difficult to find another similar paradise on our planet. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In the distant past, Aegina was much richer than the ancient state of Piraeus (the main port of the Greek capital) and even Athens.  The convenient strategic position of the island (between Attica and the Peloponnese) gave Aegina a number of advantages that the locals used very successfully. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.keytours.gr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegina, Greece" class="if uuid-2576516" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576516.jpg"></div><p>  Historians claim that for several centuries BC, about a million people lived on Aegina - a figure unheard of at that time.  In the ancient state of only slaves, there were more than 400 thousand.  Aegina could not feed the population on her own and imported part of the food from outside. </p><p>  Naturally, such a comfortable existence could not go unnoticed by neighbors, and the state was at the epicenter of regional battles almost constantly.  Most successful Aegina haunted the rulers of Athens, and they made numerous attempts to seize this territory.  During the rule of the Romans, the island was transferred to each other by the Roman emperors, as a passing banner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Byzantine period, Aegina was part of Hellas.  Then the island was conquered by the soldiers of the Ottoman Empire.  During the Liberation War (1821-1832), which ended with a peace treaty signed in Constantinople, the island of Aegina in Greece, like other regions of the country, gained independence.  Interestingly, the Greeks became the first of the peoples conquered by the Ottoman Empire and gained independence. </p><h2>  Aegina Location </h2><p>  Aegina island in Greece (you can see photos of picturesque landscapes in this article) has a triangular shape and is located between Attica and Argolis in the Saronic Gulf, 27 kilometers from the capital of Athens.  Near Aegina there are smaller islands: Agistri, Hydra, Poros and Spetses. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="37.7408815" data-lng="23.501421299999947" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/7/2/4872.png"></div><p>  Aegina Square - 88 square meters  km, the coastline is 57 km.  Administratively, the island is divided into territorial units: Ayia Marina, Vaya, Perdika, Suvala and Marathonas. </p><h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  The rich history has made Aegina one of the most interesting and frequently visited islands of Greece.  We are unlikely to be able to introduce you to all the interesting places, but we will present the most significant of them to you. </p><h2>  Aegina city </h2><p>  In our opinion, it is logical to start exploring the sights of Aegina island in Greece with its main city, which bears the same name.  Beautiful bright neoclassical buildings were built on the streets of the capital.  Walking around the city, go to the house in which he wrote his novel about Zorb Kazantzakis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The writer had very warm feelings for this island, and therefore decided to settle here to work surrounded by beautiful landscapes.  Today, the writer's house can be visited by tourists. </p><h2>  Promenade </h2><p>  The beautiful boulevard is also made in the neoclassical style.  It has many cozy taverns, bars and restaurants.  And on the waves, moored boats and yachts sway on the waves.  This is the most populous part of the city, especially in the evenings, when tourists choose to take a walk and breathe in the sea air. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegina city in Greece" class="if uuid-2576522" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576522.jpg"></div><p>  In the afternoon, ordinary everyday life goes on here - ships and ferries call and sail from the port, tourists arrive on the island and cheerfully cheer, fishermen offer to buy their catch. </p><h2>  Church of St. Nicholas </h2><p>  This church of Aegina in Greece, located almost on the pier of the island, is one of the oldest and most unusual on the island.  Tourists are the first to see her and the column of the Temple of Apollo, sailing to the island. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Nicholas" class="if uuid-2576531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576531.jpg"></div><p>  The temple belongs to the post-Byzantine period.  It was erected in honor of St.  Nicholas Sea, who is the patron saint of sailors.  Built on the donations of sailors and sailors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  St.  Nectaria and the monastery </h2><p>  One of the main attractions of Aegina in Greece.  The magnificent complex includes a women's Orthodox monastery and temple.  It is located six kilometers from the promenade.  The monastery was founded by St. Nectarius of Aegina in 1908 and named it Holy Trinity.  Here he lived until his death (1920) and was buried in the monastery. </p><p>  The main monastery church is a magnificent building, built recently (1973).  The grandiose building is made in the Neo-Byzantine style and skillfully decorated with amazing mosaics.  A steep staircase leads up to the hill from the church leading to the monastery complex itself. </p><p>  Here is the church of the Holy Trinity - the oldest temple of the monastery.  In a small chapel, a marble sarcophagus is preserved, where the body of St.  Nectaria, and nearby is a source of holy water.  The monastic cell, in which the saint spent the last years, has survived to the present day.  Today it is open to the public.  The main shrine of the monastery are the miraculous relics of St.  Nectaria. </p><h2>  Temple of Athaeus </h2><p>  The Temple of Athaeus in Aegina (Greece) forms an isosceles triangle with the Acropolis of Athens and the temple of Poseidon in Sounion.  This idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúsacred‚Äù triangle is not new - it is a vivid example of how the Greeks could use knowledge in the field of astronomy in the construction of religious buildings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hopin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Temple of Athaeus" class="if uuid-2576548" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576548.jpg"></div><p>  The temple was built in the northern part of the island in 480 BC.  e.  The area where it is located is covered with pine trees, and it offers stunning views of the sea.  The structure is pretty well preserved for its advanced age - from 34 columns of the temple today you can see 24. </p><p>  According to legend, the beautiful Afei was a poor peasant girl, whom Minos, the king of Crete, fell madly in love with.  Trying to escape from his harassment, the unfortunate jumped from a high cliff into the sea, but fell into a fishing net.  Her beauty did not leave indifferent the fisherman who saved her, and he invited the beauty to stay in the fishing hut.  The girl managed to escape from him into the forest, located in the depths of the island.  Being exhausted, she fell asleep right on the grass, and when she woke up, she realized that she had become invisible. </p><p>  This miracle was performed by Pelasgian gods, thus hiding from people unprecedented beauty in these parts.  Later, the inhabitants of the island of Aegina in Greece began to deify the girl and called her Afei, which translates as "Invisible." </p><h2>  Archaeological site of Kolonna </h2><p>  This is the acropolis of an ancient city located on an island in the neighborhood of modern Aiginio.  Its name is due to the fact that the only column from the temple of Apollo located here was preserved.  Ancient traces of man discovered in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis Aegina attraction in Greece date back to the Neolithic period. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.archaeology.wiki" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Architectural monument Kolonna" class="if uuid-2576563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576563.jpg"></div><p>  During the excavation, the remains of the fortress walls were discovered, which experts attribute to the III-II millennia BC.  From the 7th to the 5th centuries, Aegina was the most important trading center of the Aegean Sea.  An ancient temple, which, according to experts, was built from the end of the VI to the beginning of the V century BC.  e., eloquently testifies that in those days the city experienced a heyday. </p><p>  The Attalids religious monument, which appeared here at the end of 210 BC, has been preserved on the western side of the building.  e. when the island was conquered by the Pergamum dynasty.  In the Roman (later) period, all pagan shrines were destroyed. </p><p>  In the Byzantine period there was a defensive fortress: this fact is confirmed by discovered fortifications dating back to the 11th century. </p><h2>  Oikia Karapanou </h2><p>  House built by Dimitrios Vulgaris in 1850.  The history of the area where the building and the gardens surrounding it are located dates back to the end of the 18th century.  Georgios Vulgaris, who is the founder of the family, bought a plot here in 1785.  Several generations of prominent political figures who played an important role in the formation of the state, lived in this villa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yip.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oikia Karapanou" class="if uuid-2576637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576637.jpg"></div><p>  In 1967, Maria Vulgaris-Karapanou, one of the owners of the house, died.  The building was empty until 1990, when her great-granddaughter entered into inheritance rights.  Today, this house with access to the sea, with shady alleys is a hotel complex. </p><p>  It can accommodate up to twenty guests.  They are offered seven double rooms, one triple and one single.  In the garden there is a campsite where you can settle in tents.  On the top floor there is a spacious and bright hall with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã40 square meters.  m. The windows of the hall overlook in all directions. </p><p>  Huge, an area of ‚Äã‚Äã300 square meters.  m, a platform in front of the building, closed from outsiders, allows you to conduct various events here. </p><h2>  Paleochora </h2><p>  It is the former capital of Aegina island in Greece.  The Paleochora was built in the 9th century as a refuge in which the population could hide from pirates.  Once the city did not cope with the task assigned to it - in 1537 it was destroyed by the raid of the pirates Hayreddin Ryzheborodogo, who in the West is better known by the name of Barbarossa. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saronicmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paleochora in Greece" class="if uuid-2576654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576654.jpg"></div><p>  Residents left Paleochora in the years 1826-1827.  Since then it has been deserted, but the image of this ghostly settlement is very attractive.  You can reach it by car - after passing the St. Nectarius Cathedral, turn left, and after 400 meters you will find yourself in place. </p><h2>  Museums </h2><p>  The island of Aegina not only inherited numerous ancient riches.  Its inhabitants were able to keep them in museums, whose expositions are always of interest to tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aegina Museums" class="if uuid-2576664" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2576664.jpg"></div><p>  On the island is the first Archaeological Museum in Greece, located in the house of Kapodistrias.
