Adults will be interested in wandering the streets, especially because of the small size of the city, visiting a museum, getting to know the culture of this country. </p><h2>  Where to go with children </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Ajman is much smaller than Dubai and Abu Dhabi, there are several places where you can entertain young children.  This is the case with the "Magic Planet" in the center.  This is the place where young children can play in the playground.  Quite conveniently, next to this park you will find a food court to order food while the kids enjoy the rides. </p><p>  Another great place to take your children if you find yourself in Ajman is the Fun City Safeer Mall with an area full of fun video games, with a playground with balls, slides and attractions.

Is breakfast included. </p><h2>  What tourists say </h2><p>  Ajman hotels have different reviews.  Most tourists do not recommend ‚ÄúAjman Beach‚Äù for visiting, the main complaints that arise during the rest are poor noise isolation, not very good quality of service, dirt in the rooms, loud noise from the street that interferes with sleep.  Sources of noise - a bar and a nightclub, bring inconvenience to visitors who have windows facing the street. </p><p>  Hotel "Ajman", according to tourists, is much better in terms of service, quality of rooms and their maintenance, the only thing is more expensive compared to "Ajman Beach".  Rating 3 and 5 stars.  But when you consider that for your money they will offer a first-class royal rest, the extra couple of hundred are trifles. </p><p>  Holidays at Ajman hotels can be an ideal option to spend time with your family, whether you want to know more about this exciting region or simply enjoy the year-round sun with your loved ones. </p>
