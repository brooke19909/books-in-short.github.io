It is, in its way, the only river that crosses the Urals, thus extending across Europe and Asia. </p><p>  Rafting on <span>the Chusovaya River</span> is one of the most unique and favorite among tourists.  More details about this and much more will be discussed below. </p><h2>  A little bit about the origin of the name of the river </h2><p>  There are several options. </p><p>  Most likely, the name is made up of the words of the Komi-Permian “Chus” and “wa”, meaning “fast” and “water” - “chusva” (“fast water”), respectively. </p>

    <p>  1. Chusovaya means “sentinel”.  In the XVIII century, this version was put forward during the expedition to the Urals by Academician I.I.  Lepikhin.  He considered that the name was changed, and that the river used to be called “Sentinel” because of the expectation of the time (hour) when it would be possible to launch ships.  But the name was formed long before the launch of ships on these waters. </p><p>  2. The word "Chuoshi" in Komyak language is a "sacred river." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3. There is a more fantastic version.  According to her, the name of the river consists of four words, with four different languages ​​with a similar meaning: from the Tibetan "chu", Turkic "su", from the Komi-Permyak "wa" and the Mansi "I".  They all mean the word "river."  It turns out that the name of the river, according to this version, should mean four times translated "river". </p><p>  5. Version put forward by AS  Krivoshchekova-Gantman (a researcher of the Komi-Permyak language), the following: "Chus" - Komi-Permyak archaic word, which means "deep ravine", "gorge" and "canyon".  "Chusva," in her opinion, is either a "river of gorges," or a "river in a canyon." </p><h2>  Chusovaya: general description </h2><p>  To see all the unique beauty of these places, you must make rafting on the Chusovaya River.

Many rocks have interesting outcrops in the form of stratification and brown color from streaks of iron oxide or spots of yellowish-red color of <span>lichens scale.</span> </p><p>  There are small caves and grottoes in the rocks, but karst is not very active here, so there are no particularly large caves. </p><p>  In general, the rocks on the Chusovaya River are called stones, and those on which it carries a stream into large water are called fighters, because barks with products from plants were often broken here during rafting in the spring.

Mom’s Siberian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chusovaya river rafting 2014" class="if" height="395" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1165253.jpg" width="600"></div>
