For six years of titanic work, the company has gained worldwide fame and can compete with Samsung and Apple, companies recognized around the world, not to mention less famous rivals.  Xiaomi's model range in recent years has expanded significantly due to the number of announced devices.  Sometimes it is not even clear how some Xiaomi smartphones differ from each other.  Let's get to know more closely one of the representatives of the budget line of the company - the Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32gb smartphone. </p><h2>  Unpacking and Scope of Delivery </h2><p>  So, we have a nice white box with a proud 4X inscription in the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lid.  Opening the package, we find the usual set for the device class: a smartphone, a clip for opening the SIM / microSD slot, a documentation kit with instructions for Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb, a USB cable and a power supply. </p>

    <p>  Headphones are not included.  You can talk about the controversy of this decision for a long time, although if you think about it, it's better to buy decent headphones on your own than to overpay for the dull cheap "tweeters" included in the kit. </p><h2>  Design and materials </h2><p>  Alas, the smartphone can not boast of any new design decisions in the execution of the case and the appearance.  Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb, according to reviews, its appearance is very similar to the model of the third generation Redmi line.  The very design of the case and the quality of performance do not cause any complaints.  The case of the gadget is metal, only the lower and upper ends of the device are made of plastic.  All faces are neatly rounded and smoothly transition into 2.5D glass on the front panel.  The device is very convenient to hold in your hand.  If desired, you can use Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb with a case. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the back of the device are a fingerprint scanner and the main camera with a flash.  The scanner has a convenient location.  If you take the phone in your hand, then the index finger just hits the scanner window.  The camera perched at the upper edge of the case and, together with the LED flash, is shifted to the left edge. </p>

Depending on the modification, the device can have from 2 to 3 gigabytes of RAM.  The amount of internal memory varies from 16 to 32 GB.  You can increase the available memory with microSD cards, but then you will have to remove one of the SIM cards. </li><li>  Navigation.  Supported navigation on GPS, GLONASS, Beidou satellites. </li><li>  Wireless interfaces  There are Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi 802.11n modules. </li><li>  Sensors  Of the sensors there is an accelerometer, a gyroscope and an ambient light sensor. </li><li>  Additional "chips".  The device boasts the presence of an infrared port, a fingerprint scanner, an FM receiver.  NFC support is not provided. </li><li>  Battery.  The device is equipped with a non-removable battery with a capacity of 4100 mAh. </li></ul><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display on the smartphone has a diagonal of five inches with HD resolution.  The IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãused, the screen does not have an air gap.  Ten touches are supported simultaneously.  The Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb screen, according to reviews, gives out rich colors, bright and pleasing to the eye.  With strong sun at maximum brightness, the image remains easily perceptible.  Fans of reading in the dark are also not offended: at the minimum brightness, information is perceived comfortably, the eyes do not strain.  <span>An oleophobic coating</span> avoids screen contamination.  Fingerprints still remain, but are easily cleaned.  For its price, the screen is very decent.  Some models of smartphones at a higher price have a worse quality screen. </p><h2>  CPU and performance </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb mobile phone received an 8-core Shapdragon 435 processor and an Adreno 505 graphics accelerator. One should not forget that the smartphone belongs to the class of budget devices.  Waiting for some superpowers from him is not worth it.  Heavy games at maximum settings on the device will most likely not function normally.  However, with average specifications on Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb, any modern gaming application will launch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  According to synthetic tests, the hero of the review has very good performance and, thanks to a more modern processor, looks more productive than the gadgets of its competitors, for example, the same company Meizu.  The device left a pleasant impression on itself.  The performance of its processor is enough to perform any everyday tasks.  Perhaps the device will not suit fans of serious mobile games, but it does not strive to be ‚Äúahead of the rest‚Äù.  The device fulfills its price by 100 percent. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The main optical module of the device with a resolution of 13 megapixels, as expected after reading reviews of Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb, did not bring any surprises.  With good lighting or in clear weather on the street, photos of good enough quality are obtained.  Naturally, when the conditions for shooting deteriorate, the quality of the resulting photographs decreases.  Not surprising for a budget-grade gadget camera.  The advantages of the camera include fast focusing and a convenient application for working with the optical module.  The main camera allows you to shoot video with FullHD resolution.  The front camera Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb, according to the characteristics, is ordinary, has a resolution of 5 megapixels and is no different from competitors. </p><h2>  Wireless Modules, Navigation and Communications </h2><p>  Of the wireless interfaces, the Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb smartphone has Bluetooth 4.2 and Wi-Fi 802.11n.  NFC, unfortunately, is not supported by the device.  Wireless modules are standard here, while working with them there were no nuances.  The device supports navigation on GPS, GLONASS and Chinese BeiDou systems.  The device very quickly finds satellites and does not lose connection.  Everything works at the highest level. </p>

    <p>  Of the features can also be noted support for 4G networks (LTE).  The communication quality is good, maybe the sound from the speaker is a little distorted.  The MIUI application built into the shell allows you to record all calls. </p><h2>  Autonomy of the device </h2><p>  With this option, according to reviews, Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb is all right.  The device received a very good battery with a capacity of 4100 mAh, which is a good indicator for a representative of the budget segment.  Of course, the device did not set a record for autonomy, but it proved to be a strong decent middle peasant in terms of time. </p><p>  With the usual intensity of use, the Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb mobile phone will live peacefully for a day, and if you save a little, then two.  This result is possible, first of all, thanks to the capacious battery, as well as the screen resolution.  Also, do not forget about the many energy-saving applications of Xiaomi's proprietary software shell - MIUI.  However, with a ‚Äúheavy‚Äù game, a smartphone can be set in 6-7 hours.  With continuous video viewing, the device will last a little longer - about 13-15 hours.  But given that the device is positioned as a budget device, these indicators can be called quite acceptable. </p><h2>  The "chips" of the gadget, unique to Xiaomi </h2><p>  The most important feature of the device, the pride of Xiaomi, is the software shell of its own production MIUI.  This firmware has many built-in useful applications.  But there is a slight nuance.  A person who previously used a smartphone with the usual Android system, at first it will not be easy to deal with the MIUI shell.  The usual menu items on Android may be in the most unexpected place, or even completely absent. </p>

    <p>  Also, the device boasts the presence of an infrared port.  At first, many are perplexed why this anachronism was even stuck in a modern smartphone?  This is actually a well-thought-out marketing move.  Using a special MIUI shell program and an infrared port, you can turn a smartphone into a control panel for almost any TV or set-top box.  Very interesting thing. </p><p>  I would also like to talk about the built-in program for managing sound reproduction through headphones.  You can choose the type of headphones from a rather extensive list, as well as adjust the equalizer to give the sound the necessary frequencies.  When playing through the headphones, a very good and deep sound is obtained.  Of course, a music lover with a musical ear may not like the sound, but the average user should like the sound. </p><h2>  And in the end I will tell‚Ä¶ </h2><p>  There isn‚Äôt much to talk about.  Xiaomi has released another successful unit.  And although it is practically nothing but a design, it does not differ from its predecessor, but somehow it has already managed to take hold of the hearts of users.  Due to some non-budget features, Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb enjoys well-deserved attention of a wide audience of users.  You can not discount the attractive price-quality ratio. </p>

    <p>  The Xiaomi Redmi 4X 32Gb case (and there are enough accessories on sale for this device) will give a certain charm to the device.  The device has its own characteristics, which some users consider to be disadvantages.  Not everyone will like MIUI specific firmware.  Someone will not want to buy a Chinese, albeit excellent, device, but will give preference to less productive devices of famous brands, for example, Samsung, for the same money.  There is nothing to be done, everyone has the right to their own opinion. </p>
