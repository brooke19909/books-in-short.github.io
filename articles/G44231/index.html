    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  Guests who were in Elmi Suites Hotel Apartments 4 *, reviews are left exclusively positive.  The hotel leaves a good impression - the territory is large and clean, well-groomed, the hotel itself is close to the sea (this is noted by the attention of all guests).  The rooms are not only soundproofed, but also cool.  In them, even at the height of the summer season, there is no stuffiness - some say that the air conditioning did not have to be turned on.  And there are no insects - fumigators are not needed. </p><p>  The restaurant has plenty to choose from, the dishes are universal: there is something that will appeal to vegetarians, children and even people who follow a diet. </p><p>  The staff is also given special praise.  The guests here are treated with the utmost cordiality and friendliness.  Even in the event of a late check-in, they quickly register so that the guests do not wait, tired of the road.  If the profits are earlier than the set time, they can also be populated.  But only if there are available rooms.  In the summer this can hardly seem possible, since the hotel is popular and the apartments are almost never empty.  For the same reason, it is worth booking an apartment a couple of months before the trip. </p><p>  To summarize, we can confidently say: this is a wonderful hotel in Crete, which is suitable for people who want to relax in good conditions and for little money.  Numerous reviews only confirm this fact. </p>
