    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Muong Thanh Grand <span>Nha Trang Hotel 4 *</span> is located in close proximity to Nha Trang Bus Station.  Namely - 500 meters from it.  It is very comfortable.  Anyway, well-developed transport links have always been appreciated, especially by tourists who come to unfamiliar places. </p><p>  Although many visitors from Russia have understandable associations: if not far from the station, then you should not go there.  But this complex is by no means “forecourt”.  This can be understood even by its appearance.  The building looks very stylish and fits extremely well into the surrounding landscape.  And the service with service is decent here.  Therefore, you should not adhere to stereotypes, but it is better to consider all the advantages of the hotel in more detail. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel is also located five kilometers from the center of Nha Trang.  And there are the best night clubs, shops, shopping centers, <span>restaurants, cafes</span> and other entertainment establishments.  The train station, by the way, is also nearby.  Camran Airport is only 50 kilometers away.  A lot, of course, but not 100 km, in addition, a significant plus is that the noise of the aircraft will not interfere with the rest of the guests.  In general, the location of the hotel is not bad.  But this is just one of many benefits. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
