One of Europe‚Äôs most luxurious architectural masterpieces is located just half an hour from Amsterdam, in the province of Utrecht.  De Haar Castle, which survived wars and natural disasters, acquired a modern look only at the end of the 19th century. </p><h2>  Castle De Haar - a neo-Gothic masterpiece </h2><p>  The first mention of the fortress, surrounded by a moat with water, dates back to the XIV century, when its owners were representatives of the noble family De Haar, who expanded the territory occupied by the defensive structure.  Since the last owner did not have children, the powerful citadel soon passed into the hands of the aristocratic family of Van Zeilen, whose heirs now own a beautiful castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle de haar" class="if" height="294" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1758896.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the XV century, the fortress was destroyed and burned during the hostilities, and two centuries later the castle was damaged by a powerful tornado that damaged buildings in the town of Utrecht, located in the province of the same name.  Having changed many masters, De Haar Castle is gradually declining and represents only ruins.  At the end of the XIX century, the owner of the ruins successfully marries a representative of the Rothschild dynasty, which invests a fortune in the restoration of the family nest, which lasts about 20 years.  A delightful neo-Gothic masterpiece that served as a summer residence, was equipped with modern technical innovations.  So the dream of the heir to a ruined family to recreate the former greatness came true. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Giving a second life </h2><p>  All that can be seen now is the work of the famous architect P. Kuipers, who restored many historical monuments of Holland.  He gave a second life to an ancient building, which has become the most luxurious in the country.  Despite the fact that outwardly the castle De Haar (Netherlands) looks like a medieval landmark, inside it is a well-equipped house suitable for living.  The architect, using multi-colored bricks, smoothed out the difference between the new walls and the old ones, carefully restored the hanging bridges, numerous towers and even unique sculptures, and soon a real work of architectural art in the Neo-Gothic style appears. </p><h2>  The luxury of interior decoration </h2><p>  Amazing not only the appearance of the most beautiful buildings, but also the magnificence of the interior decoration in the spirit of the Middle Ages.  Kuipers, who restored the beautiful De Haar castle, was engaged in the restoration of interiors.  He decorated all the halls in the estate, but the mistress did not trust him to decorate the bedrooms, believing that the gloomy style was unacceptable here, and ordered the headsets in an English company. </p>

    <p>  In the mansion, everything was thought out to the smallest detail, ranging from the luxury of bedrooms and halls to the design of furniture and utensils that were created exclusively for the castle.  Even the royal family lived much more modestly than the owners of the estate.  It is striking that the architect, who kept pace with progress, thought out the system of electricity and steam heating, as well as in the building with a centuries-old history, elevators now work. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Garden and park area </h2><p>  An integral part of the architectural ensemble is a colorful garden and a wonderful park, laid out around the castle.  In order to have a lovely <span>green area,</span> occupying more than 135 acres of land, it was necessary to sacrifice a family-owned village: it was moved several hundred meters further, and new houses were built for residents, where they moved in at the end of the 19th century.  Adult shrubs and trees from different parts of the country were imported into the territory.  Works in the "little Versailles", designed in the classic English style, were carried out day and night. </p><p>  In the amazing flower garden, hanging bridges are built over the figured ponds, winding paths for walks are laid.  In wartime, the park and the rose garden were abandoned, vegetables were grown in the garden, and rare species of trees were used as firewood for heating.  And only in the 50s of the last century the green oasis was restored in its original form and decorated it with romantic gazebos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle de haar the netherlands" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1758889.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Manor open to the public for 11 months </h2><p>  For a long time, the monument, which is under the care of a special fund, was inaccessible to tourists.  And only after the Second World War, the owners of a magical corner of the Middle Ages opened a spectacular park for guests, and 17 years ago the castle De Haar, whose photo delight all connoisseurs of beauty, received the first visitors.  The owners set a strict condition, which has been strictly observed for many years: in September, the owners leave the villa in France and arrange receptions in a luxurious atmosphere, inviting aristocrats to join the celebration.  At this time, the architectural complex for public visits is closed. </p><p>  Famous people once visited the mansion: singer <span>Maria Callas,</span> actors Roger Moore, <span>Gregory Peck,</span> Brigitte Bardot. </p><h2>  <span>The ancient castle of</span> De Haar: how to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to the main attractions of the country from Amsterdam by train.  The desired station is called Utrecht Centraal Station.  Next, you need to transfer to the bus at number 127, departing once an hour, and get off at the Kasteel (Brink) stop, from which the path to the castle takes 15 minutes on foot. </p><p>  Tourists who have purchased tickets for the tour will reach the estate by transfer bus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="castle de haar how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1758877.jpg" width="600"></div>
