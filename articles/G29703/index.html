    <h2>  What is included in the delivery </h2><p>  This gadget comes with the following items: </p><ul><li><p>  The device itself. </p></li><li><p>  Interface cord for exchanging data with a PC or for charging the battery. </p></li><li><p>  Charger. </p></li><li><p>  User's manual.  It also has a warranty card. </p></li><li><p>  Battery with a nominal capacity of 3000 mAh. </p></li></ul><p>  Now about what is clearly lacking in this list.  Case for the phone LG G3 will clearly not be amiss.  Unlike its predecessor - G2 - this device is equipped with a slot for a flash drive, but here it is also not in the list of supplied accessories and it will have to be purchased separately for an additional fee.  Also, the <span>protective film</span> on the front panel of the gadget will not be superfluous.  Of course, the 3rd generation Gorilla Eye with an oleophobic coating protects the screen well, but additional protection is never superfluous.  And finally, it is worth noting that LG has not been equipped with stereo headsets for a long time.  This accessory, like all the ones mentioned earlier, will need to be purchased separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><p>  The design of the G3 has much in common with the G2.  Only in size, the latter is slightly smaller.  The front panel, as noted earlier, is protected by 3rd generation Gorilla Eye glass.  The side faces and the back cover are made of plastic with a matte surface that looks like aluminum.  On the lower side are wired interface ports (microUSB and a 3.5 mm audio port) and a thin hole in the conversational microphone.  An infrared port is displayed on the upper edge of the device (an economical version of the flagship is the LG G3 Stylus phone <strong> </strong>  has a similar hole, but there is no infrared port) and a microphone, which is responsible for suppressing noise.  The power button of the smart phone and the volume control swing are displayed on the back of the smartphone.  There is also a main camera, LED backlight and a laser guidance system for the main camera.  A loud speaker is displayed at the bottom of the back cover, the sound quality of which is impeccable.  Managing this device with a display diagonal of 5.46 inches with one hand is not difficult.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  The only thing the new owner of this device should adapt to is the unusual arrangement of the physical control keys.  Otherwise, problems should not arise. </p>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The LG G3 is equipped with one of the most powerful CPUs to date - Qualcomm's Snapdragon 801.  It consists of 4 core architecture Krait 400, which in peak load mode operate at a frequency of 2.5 GHz.  Of course, this is not the most advanced development of Qualcomm, but the hardware resources of the gadget are enough to run all the applications on this gadget even now.  Asphalt 8, GTA: San Andreas and other resource-intensive applications on this masterpiece of engineering and now run without problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Graphics and cameras </h2><p>  One of the best graphics cards is the basis of this device - Adreno 330. Its resources are quite enough to solve all tasks without exception today.  The diagonal of the display in this gadget, as noted earlier, is a decent 5.46 inches.  It was built on the basis of IPS technology.  Another feature of the device is that there is no air gap between the front panel and the display.  Such a constructive solution provides the maximum image quality today and viewing angles as close as possible to 180 degrees (while the image is not distorted at all).  The main camera in this device boasts a 13 megapixel touch device.  In addition, it is equipped with LED backlighting, a laser-guided system, autofocus and an automatic image stabilization system.  In general, the quality of photos and videos is better than that of the closest competitors.  <span>The front camera is</span> based on a 2.1 MP sensor.  Of course, the quality of the photo and video is worse by an order of magnitude than that of the main one.  But for a "selfie" and video calls it is definitely enough with the head. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  Quite an interesting situation with this gadget with a memory subsystem.  There are two modifications to this unit.  One of them is equipped with 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB is the capacity of the built-in drive.  This is a more economical version of the LG G3.  Price <strong> </strong>  its is 430 dollars.  A more advanced modification is equipped with - respectively - 3 GB and 32 GB.  Her cost, in turn, is $ 530.  Of course, the last version of the device in terms of purchase looks clearly preferable, but even a more modest modification is able to solve all problems.  Also in this device there is a slot for installing an external memory card.  It is allowed to install a drive with a maximum capacity of 128 GB. </p><h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  One of the most controversial decisions of designers in this smartphone model is the capacity of the complete battery - 3000 mAh.  This is kind of impressive value at the moment.  But here the diagonal of the screen, as noted earlier, is 5.46 inches.  Add to this a productive, but non-energy-efficient 4-core CPU.  As a result, it turns out that the battery will have to be charged every 2 days at best.  With a more active use of this gadget, this figure can be reduced to 7-8 hours.  And this is provided that the smartphone is used for no more than 3 months.  In the future, the degree of autonomy, of course, will deteriorate. </p><h2>  Software part </h2><p>  The LG cell phone of this model functions, of course, under the control of the most popular platform for mobile devices - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  Initially, this version of the smart phone is preinstalled with its modification ‚Äú4.4‚Äù.  But the first time you connect to the global web, an update will occur - there will already be a version of OS "5.0".  A proprietary shell of the manufacturer was installed on top of the operating system.  Otherwise, the set of applications is familiar.  These are typical social utilities, and a set of programs from the Google company, and embedded applications. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  All necessary communications are equipped with the LG G3 phone. <strong> </strong>  This list contains ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù (with its help it is best to send and receive files of several megabytes or gigabytes in size), ‚ÄúBluetooth‚Äù (it allows you to connect a wireless headset to a smart phone or exchange information with similar mobile gadgets), all types of mobile networks that are available today, GPS, microUSB and 3.5-mm.  There is also an infrared port that allows you to easily turn your smartphone into a remote control. </p><h2>  Current gadget price </h2><p>  Among last year's flagship models, the LG G3 boasts the most modest cost.  The price for it, as noted earlier, is $ 430 for the simplified version of the device (2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of integrated memory) and $ 530 for the most advanced modification of the gadget (32 GB of RAM and 32 GB, respectively).  Even the most modest modification of this smartphone allows you to solve all problems at the moment.  And a similar situation will persist for the next 2 years for sure.  And then instantly this gadget will not become obsolete. </p>

    <h2>  Owners opinion </h2><p>  The LG cell phone of this model, in fact, has no weaknesses.  The only thing that causes certain complaints is the small capacity of the complete battery.  But, on the other hand, due to this parameter, the weight of the smartphone has not exceeded the "symbolic" 150 grams.  If there are problems with autonomy, then they can be quite simply solved by buying <span>an external battery.</span>  And so in this smartphone everything is perfectly matched and balanced.  And the processor, and the screen, and the memory subsystem. </p><h2>  Economy flagship versions </h2><p>  Not everyone can afford even the most modest version of the flagship device.  Therefore, a more simplified version appeared on the market - the LG G3 S mobile phone. It has smaller sizes - 5 inches versus 5.46, a weaker processor (Snapdragon 400) and a less efficient video accelerator <span>(Adreno 305).</span>  Well, the capacity of the internal drive is reduced to 8 GB.  There is an even more modest version of the flagship - the LG G3 Stylus phone.  She has even more modest parameters (for example, the processor - MT6582).  But there is a special pen (it is also called the "stylus" - hence the name of the model) for handwriting. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Phone LG G3 can rightfully be considered the best offer in its segment.  Its price is lower than that of competitors.  But the technical characteristics in some places at the level (for example, the <span>central processor),</span> and in some places it is much better (for example, the screen and its resolution).  All in all, the perfect app in the premium smartphone segment.  Well, for those who can not afford to shell out $ 430 for such a device, the South Korean giant released the LG G3 S. <strong> </strong>  If you need a phone with handwriting support, then pay attention to the LG G3 Stylus. <strong> </strong>  His specifications will be more modest than the LG G3 S, but he has a special pen for such input. </p>
