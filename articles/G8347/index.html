The traditional <span>route to Crimea</span> by rail through the Perekop Isthmus has become extremely problematic, due to the fact that most of it passes through the territory of Ukraine. </p><h2>  Via Rostov </h2><p>  The answer to the seemingly simple question of how many kilometers is from Rostov to Crimea is not entirely clear.  The thing is that you can get to the Crimea through Rostov in two ways.  One of them runs directly along the northern shore of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov, and the other runs parallel to its eastern coast towards Anapa and Port Kavkaz.  In the past, the northern route was considered optimal, and it was possible to overcome it in less than eight hours, even if there were inevitable traffic jams on the highway.  The length of this route - from Rostov-on-Don to Yalta - is 754 kilometers.  The eastern route is much shorter.  The port of Kavkaz is separated from Rostov by 430 kilometers.  But this path was not particularly popular in former times, since it led only to the coast of the <span>Kerch Strait.</span>  And travelers expected a ferry to the peninsula and a loss of time in line for it.  Therefore, most of the tourists chose the route Rostov - Crimea, going along the northern shore of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov in the direction of Perekop.  It has traditionally been considered more reliable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how many kilometers from Rostov to Crimea" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/408519.jpg" width="499"></div>

The popular tourist route Rostov-on-Don - Crimea is not an exception.  The distance between them remained the same, only the circumstances of overcoming it changed.  The traditional northern route suddenly began to pass through the zone of real hostilities.  And even despite the fact that so far no one has officially blocked the border with Ukraine for tourists, there are not very many people wishing to seek adventure along this path.  The northern route to the Crimea from Rostov is no longer safe.  The entire economic life of the Crimean peninsula is based on the reception and service of tourists.  Therefore, before the start of the tourist season, the search for alternative routes has become so important. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov on Don Crimea distance" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/408520.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Through the Kerch Strait </h2><p>  The route through the <span>Port Kavkaz,</span> located on the eastern coast of the Kerch Strait, was not considered the optimal route option to the Crimea in former times.  And since the spring of this year, the load on it has increased several times.  The possibilities of a ferry <span>crossing the Kerch Strait</span> were on the verge of exhaustion.  The very question of how many kilometers from Rostov to Crimea lost its meaning.  What does it matter that the way through Port Caucasus is the shortest if you have to wait more than a day in anticipation of your turn for the crossing?  I could not fundamentally change the situation and the urgent commissioning of reserve ferry capacities.  They could not cope with all the increasing traffic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov Crimea distance" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/408522.jpg" width="492"></div>

As a reasonable alternative, a new version of the ferry service from the port of Anapa to the Crimean peninsula has been launched.  Two modern ferry vessels have already been put into operation, which regularly operate on the Anapa-Kerch route.  It is planned to carry out direct ferry services from Anapa in the direction of such major <span>cities of Crimea</span> as Theodosia, Yalta, Yevpatoriya, as well as to Sevastopol.  From summer, from the river station in the city center, from Rostov-on-Don, a motor ship route in the direction of Yalta will pass on a regular basis this summer.  Travel time will be less than a day, and passengers will sail along the picturesque Crimean coast.  The route can be considered as a tourist one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="growth route Crimea" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/408521.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Strait bridge </h2><p>  After about five years, the final answer to the question of how many kilometers from Rostov to Crimea should be given.  There will be 432 of them forever. This will happen after the capital bridge over the Kerch Strait is built.  They plan to build it in the narrowest part, where the Kerch ferry crossing is now unable to cope with the flow of passengers and cars.  The bridge project is currently under development.  Its implementation is fraught with significant difficulties of the financial and technical order.  This is due both to the wide width of the strait and the need to ensure unhindered navigation on it.  In addition, the strait is characterized by difficult ice conditions in the winter. </p>
