The main criteria due to which the model is in demand: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  A dark case that makes the device invisible (especially at night). </li><li>  An internal memory of 224 MB, designed to record clips in 3 minutes 44 seconds in the highest resolution.

Interruptions of 1-3 seconds were observed.  The issue is solved by installing files that are downloaded from the official website of the company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Before installation, you need to fully charge the battery for the DVR, turn off the battery saving mode and the standby function.  From the set you will need a microSD flash drive, a card reader, a charger and an unzipped file. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": Vanek163, "><img itemprop="image" alt="DVR &quot;Kakram QX2&quot;" class="if uuid-2658131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2658131.jpg"></div><h2>  Installation process </h2><p>  Installing the DVR firmware occurs according to the following algorithm: </p><ul><li>  remove the microSD card from the gadget; </li><li>  insert into the card reader, format and transfer the file to it; </li><li>  return the card back to the registrar; </li><li>  connect the charger; </li><li>  turn on the product and wait for the download to finish (about 5 minutes); </li><li>  turn off and remove the flash drive. </li></ul><p>  The process is completed.  It remains only to turn on, do the screen calibration, set the previous settings and be sure to delete the firmware file before using the flash card in the gadget. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Buyers note that the device is so good that it can be used as a full-fledged video camera.  In particular, according to the comments, customers like the high quality of shooting (even numbers are read), a well-functioning turning mechanism in case of communication with the police inspector, a user-friendly interface, and an intuitive menu. </p><p>  Recording occurs without breaks, files can be protected from erasure.  Motorists who are driving mainly in the dark, focused on high-quality image in night mode, a convenient screen and reliable mounting of the device.  It is indicated that it does not shake when driving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": Vanek163, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Karkam QX2 with memory card" class="if uuid-2658134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2658134.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Buyers note that in general, the line of models is characterized by quality and reliability.  However, the benchmark is not QC2 CARCAM, but Q2.  Most often there are reviews that defective models come across and it is not always possible to replace them. </p><p>  A number of buyers noted that the first negative impression arose due to the bracket that quickly failed: the mount is not as reliable as stated.  In addition, the product fails or freezes after two years of use.  It should be noted that the problem is very serious, because the freezing of the image can be recognized only by careful observation of the gadget's screen, which is unacceptable, since the driver needs to watch the road.  The battery for the DVR quickly sits down. </p><p>  Car enthusiasts note that such model behavior leads to negativity, because freezes interfere with the recording of important details of a traffic accident.  In addition, customers complain about the external design of the product: the reset button is located in a very inconvenient place.  This causes difficulties during the initial operation of the product.  An experienced user will not have difficulty finding a key, but a beginner will have to try if the gadget suddenly freezes. </p><p>  Buyers are indignant because of the lack of necessary customer support.  For example, a number of reviews indicate that drivers are denied the replacement of devices after they fail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vesta-unona.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DVR with bracket" class="if uuid-2658187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41999/2658187.jpg"></div><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Summing up, it should be said that KARKAM QX2 is not a certain know-how of the domestic market of video recorders.  Motorists are inclined to buy, based on reviews and reviews about the product, personal finances and preferences. </p><p>  In general, the KARKAM line is in good demand, but consumers who encounter situations of video recording freezing at the time of a traffic accident refuse QX2 and choose more reliable gadgets.  Often the choice falls on the options with a built-in accident sensor (with a G-sensor or an electronic accelerometer), which automatically starts recording when the load on the car increases and puts the file on a separate memory stack with overwrite protection. </p><p>  An example is KARKAM M1.  At a price that comes out more expensive, the QX2 is roughly doubled, but it fully justifies its money.  Therefore, you should decide on the functions that are required from the DVR, decide how much it is convenient to spend, and after that make a choice of a device that will last a long time and become a reliable assistant. </p>
