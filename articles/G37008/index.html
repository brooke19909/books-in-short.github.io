  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monthly child allowance up to 3 years: what will change by 2013</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  For every woman <span>on maternity leave, the</span> urgent issue is raising the level of material state assistance.  Of course, women with children under 1.5 years of age receive monthly payments, the minimum amount of which is constantly indexed.  As of April 1, 2012 it amounts to: 2 326 rubles for one child, 4 651 rubles for the second and subsequent ones.  But, after the termination of payments, many women are forced to go to work.  However, in many regions of Russia it is quite difficult to get a child in a preschool. </p><p>  Today, up to 40% of children across the country at the age of 5 do not attend a <span>preschool.</span>  The reason is the lack of space.  Of course, now there are so-called private kindergartens.  But, unfortunately, most parents can not always afford them.  For example, in Moscow, payment for such a kindergarten ranges from 10 to 50 thousand rubles, depending on the "elite".  In provincial cities, payment for visiting a private garden varies from 5 to 8 thousand rubles.  with an average salary of 15 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In connection with this rather acute problem, the State Duma of Russia is considering a bill under the number 558761-5, which increases the terms for paying a monthly allowance until a child reaches 3 years of age. </p><p>  What do officials expect after the bill?  Of course, paid leave for care will allow: </p><ul><li>  stimulate the birth rate of children; </li><li>  increase the prestige of large families, increase the importance of family values; </li><li>  reduce the current problem - lack of places in preschool institutions, allow mothers to engage in raising children and receive monthly child allowance up to 3 years. </li></ul><p>  It is worth noting that previously such an attempt was unsuccessful.  To extend the child allowance to 3 years was supposed back in 2009, but officials rejected it, arguing the crisis in the country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2012, it is planned to extend the child allowance to 3 years gradually.  This is necessary in order not to provoke a crisis in the regional and federal budgets. </p><p>  It is worth recalling that as of April 1, 2012, the amount of benefits up to 3 years is 50 rubles. </p><p>  According to the bill, it is planned to divide all the subjects of Russia into 3 main groups, in the regions of which the situation with the lack of places in preschool institutions is most acute. </p><p>  It was planned to introduce a child allowance of up to 3 years in 2012 in the following regions: </p><ul><li>  Republics of Buryatia, Altai and Tuva; </li><li>  Red Army and Kamchatka Territories; </li><li>  Omsk, Astrakhan, Tomsk, Kaliningrad, Arkhangelsk, Sakhalin, Kurgan, Volgograd, Ulyanovsk, Moscow, Irkutsk, Yaroslavl and Jewish regions; </li><li>  Khanty - Mansiysk, Nenets and Yamalo - Nenets Autonomous Okrug. </li></ul><p>  It was planned from 2013 to introduce changes in the following entities: </p><ul><li>  In the republics - Adygea, Karelia, Udmurtia, Mari El, Karachay ‚Äì Cherkessia, Kalmykia and Sakha (Yakutia); </li><li>  Altai, Transbaikal, Krasnodar, Stavropol and Primorsky territories; </li><li>  Kostroma, Smolensk, Kemerovo, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Pskov, Kursk, Ivanovo, Voronezh, Sverdlovsk, Tver and Novosibirsk regions. </li></ul><p>  It was planned to introduce a child allowance of up to 3 years in the following entities: </p><ul><li>  In the republics - Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Mordovia, Ingushetia, Dagestan, Komi, North Ossetia and Kabardino - Balkaria; </li><li>  Chuvash and Chechen Republics; </li><li>  Primorsky and Khabarovsk Territories; </li><li>  Chukotka Autonomous Okrug; </li><li>  Amur, Tyumen, Penza, Murmansk, Bryansk, Kirov, Belgorod, Magadan, Orel, Novgorod, Kaluga, Orenburg, Vladimir, Leningrad, Saratov, Vologda, Tula, Lipetsk, Chelyabinsk and Tambov regions; </li><li>  Moscow and St. Petersburg. </li></ul><p>  It was supposed to consider and adopt this bill as early as 01.01.2012.  During the first reading of the bill, which took place on February 15, 2012, several items were identified that required improvements, in particular, the determination of the source and procedure for financing costs for this project.  Therefore, the question of <span>children's allowance</span> up to 3 years remained unresolved.  2012 is unlikely to change anything.  According to available information from unverified sources, if a bill is adopted, it will enter into force only from the following, i.e.  2013. </p>
