    <h2>  SIM card purchase </h2><p>  If you are thinking about the question: ‚Äú‚Äú Bit ‚Äùon MTS - how to connect?‚Äù, Then you can try one rather new and interesting approach.  For example, buy yourself a brand new SIM card.  At the moment, many MTS mobile phone stores are holding promotions in which you get a bonus - the ‚ÄúBit‚Äù function for buying a ‚Äúnumber‚Äù. </p><p>  Just insert the SIM card into the phone and start using it.  Everything will already be connected right away.  Only pay the service fee on time.  Otherwise, you will not be able to make calls and send messages.  That's all the problems are solved.  Thus, the Bit service on MTS can be automatically connected. </p><p>  But this scenario does not suit every client.  Why do we need to buy a new SIM card if we are used to the old one?  If there is no urgent need for this step, you will have to brainwash a little to achieve your goal.  Let's try to figure out what other approaches can be proposed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Personal visit </h2><p>  We thought about the question: "Bit" on MTS: how to connect the service?

    <p>  Personal visits, to be honest, have recently begun to enjoy separate popularity.  It is obvious - the number of salons is growing, they are often served faster than when calling the hotline, so everyone also has the opportunity to get answers to all questions. </p><p>  Take along your phone and passport (just in case).  Next, go to the operator and inform that you would like to connect yourself a new service.  Here you should be told about the "Super BIT" on MTS, as well as explain all the advantages of possible Internet tariffs.  Decide on the choice and announce it to the operator.  Next, transfer your mobile worker to complete the work.  Typically, the process takes about 2 minutes.  And that's all, no problem.  Leaving the mobile phone salon, you no longer have to think about the topic: "" Bit "on MTS - how to connect?"  But we have another very interesting approach.  Which one?  Let's get to know him soon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Combinations </h2><p>  For example, you can do without personal visits to mobile phone offices, as well as without buying new numbers.  Instead, each client of any operator has a number of numbers that connect services, as well as refuse them.  And this particular approach will now be studied by us. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart bit on mts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/858824.jpg"></div>

These commands will help you get rid of our today's question.  As you can see, everything is extremely simple and clear.  To answer the question: "" Bit "on MTS - how to connect?", Even the most novice user can.  But now we should talk a little about the denial of services.

    <h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  For example, you can disable <span>Bit Smart</span> on MTS (or any other tariff) using the official website of your mobile operator.  Through the so-called personal account.  To do this, you will have to go through a small registration of your number with the assignment of an access code.  After that, it will be possible to think about solving the problem further. </p><p>  Go to the MTS website, and then in the "My Account" section, enter your login (number) and password.  Next, you will be taken to the main page of your own profile.  There you have to find the "Service Management".  In this section, find "Internet" or the name of your tariff.  After - click on the necessary line.  You will see a list of possible actions.  Just click on "Disable" and confirm your actions.  That's all.  The problem is resolved.  But only a personal account is not a very popular move.  After all, most users do not particularly like to go through such registrations.  And for this reason, we can use other approaches.  Which ones?  Now we find out. </p><h2>  Short numbers </h2><p>  Disable Bit Smart on MTS (or any other tariff) using a special command.  It is entered from the telephone.  To do this, it is enough to know your Internet tariff, and then dial the necessary function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="super bit on pay" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/858822.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In order to refuse ‚ÄúBit‚Äù on MTS, you will have to call * 252 * 0 #, ‚ÄúSuper Bit‚Äù - * 111 * 628 * 2 #, to refuse ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù it is suitable to write an SMS message containing a combination of 8649 and sent to number 111. That's all the problems are solved.  As you can see, nothing is difficult.  It remains only to wait for SMS alerts about the successful processing of the request.  And no problem.  Now you know another approach to the rejection of cellular services. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, today we learned with you how you can connect, and also disable the ‚ÄúBit‚Äù tariff on MTS for the Internet.  As you can see, there are a lot of options.  Only not all of them are suitable for each client. </p><p>  In addition to all the above methods, you can also use the call to the operator at 0890. Only here you will have to wait a considerable amount of time - either until a live person answers you, or until "talking with a robot voice" brings you to the right combinations.  For this reason, it is better to go to the nearest MTS mobile phone salon once.  This is a faster and more reliable version of the development of events. </p>
