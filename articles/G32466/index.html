Let's say right away: this is not even a hotel, but a whole wellness center.  In addition, "with a name."  At least the fact that the hotel belongs to the Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts line testifies to the high quality of services.  Many tourists may know its former name - Hilton Dahab Resort. </p><p>  The current name of the five-star hotel appeared only at the very beginning of 2014.  The hotel is located on the first line.  The hotel has its own beach on the Red Sea.  Like many hotels in Dahab, this one specializes in hosting divers and windsurfers.  The hotel even has a school for teaching these sports.  But it is not necessary to dive into the depths of the sea.  Even the most lazy tourists in Dahab Resort 5 * will have an unforgettable vacation.  This is evidenced by those who have already been there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dahab resort 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1064190.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dahab: resort features </h2><p>  The small town, to which the Dahab Resort 5 hotel is administratively located, is located a hundred kilometers from Sharm El Sheikh.  ‚ÄúDahab‚Äù from Arabic translates as ‚ÄúGolden‚Äù.  This is what he is for fans of surfing.  The fact is that mountains that are close to the Gulf of Aqaba create the effect of a wind tunnel.  As a result, a fresh wind always blows on the beach, which only surfers benefit.  But due to the small size of the bay, there are no waves either.  And this is good for divers (and other lovers to see the colorful world of coral reefs).  The main attraction of Dahab‚Äôs athletic youth is the Blue Hole.  This is a sheer coral wall a hundred meters deep.  There are not only a lot of fish, but also the remains of ships.  And the second name of the ‚ÄúBlue Hole‚Äù is ‚ÄúDivers Cemetery‚Äù.  The climate in Dahab - compared to Sharm el-Sheikh - is drier and hotter.  But, on the other hand, winter nights are colder (plus twelve Celsius).  So, going to the resort, grab a warm sweater or jacket. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dahab resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1064192.jpg" width="600"></div>
