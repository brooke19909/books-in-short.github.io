From the Far East and Siberia, from the Central part and the Urals - everyone wants to relax at sea.  The most convenient way to get there is, as before, railways, even if the journey takes several days, such as a trip along the Chelyabinsk-Adler route. </p>

    <h2>  Why go to Adler </h2><p>  Adler is one of the most famous resorts in Russia, which is why so many people flock here in season.  In this city you can not only relax, but also get good spa treatment.  The resort offers all kinds of extreme sports, and there are opportunities for outdoor activities.  Here is the beautiful <span>mountain Akhun,</span> with which you can not only admire the beautiful views, but also find various nature reserves and zoos.  Moreover, before the Olympics in this area, construction was going on rapidly, so the city now has the most developed infrastructure.  And, of course, the Black Sea is nearby, which is so dreamed of in distant Chelyabinsk! </p>

    <h2>  Direct train "Chelyabinsk-Adler" </h2><p>  In fact, there are two Chelyabinsk-Adler trains, but none of them travel regularly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Train "Chelyabinsk-Adler" No. 477U is only a seasonal train.  He walks only from spring to autumn.  So, in May and September, the train travels 4 times a week - on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays.

    <h2>  Other trains "Chelyabinsk-Adler" </h2><p>  In addition to direct flights, Chelyabinsk citizens can also choose another Chelyabinsk-Adler train, the route of which does not begin or end in these cities.  In total, there are about 10 such trains per season, and they run in such a way that at least one arrives in the city every day.  They can travel from Yekaterinburg or Krasnoyarsk and have not Adler as their final destination, but, for example, more distant points.  We will only talk about some of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, the train "Krasnoyarsk-Adler" No. 127.  He is good at arriving at the terminal station the fastest: in 2 days and 11 hours.  However, this structure goes 2 times a week. </p><p>  There is also a train from Nizhny Tagil No. 364E.  This train is the longest, travel time is 2 days and 21 hours. </p><p>  In addition to these 10 trains, in the summer even more trains can go.  Moreover, there is always the opportunity to choose not the Chelyabinsk-Adler train, but, for example, go first to Moscow and only then to Adler itself, although it will cost more.  So there are more than enough options. </p>

    <h2>  Route </h2><p>  As mentioned above, the Chelyabinsk-Adler train runs in different ways.  Routes No. 477 and No. 343 have virtually no identical stops. </p><p>  Of the large cities, No. 477 passes Ufa, Samara, <span>Saratov, Volgograd</span> and Rostov, and No. 343 - <span>Orenburg, Samara,</span> Syzran, Saratov, Volgograd and Krasnodar.  Usually in these cities, the train costs about 20-40 minutes, so travelers have the opportunity to go out to breathe fresh air.  The remaining stops take only a couple of minutes.  Different routes of trains provide the opportunity to get to the right place of rest, because it is not necessary to go to the terminal station. </p><p>  A total of 3,090 km passes the Chelyabinsk-Adler train.  Photos of the train and route can be found without problems. </p>

    <h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of tickets on the route can vary depending on the class, train and time before departure, however, in general, the seats are approximately the same. </p><p>  So, a ticket to the <span>reserved seat car</span> will cost travelers from 4,500 rubles, and a place in an ordinary compartment - from 7,000 rubles per person.  Also, the trains have a compartment with increased comfort, a stay in which will cost from 15 300 rubles. </p><p>  As with all trains, some categories of citizens are eligible for a discount, and a ticket can be purchased 45 days before departure.  Do not forget that many people want to go south in the summer, so you should worry about tickets in advance. </p><h2>  How else can you get from Chelyabinsk to Adler </h2><p>  In addition to the train, there are alternative travel options.  Firstly, you can fly by plane.  It will not cost so much: prices start at just 4,000 rubles.  per ticket.  However, there are few direct flights, therefore, as with the train, you can choose a flight with a change in Moscow.  The journey time without transfers will be only about 3 hours.  This option can really compete with train travel. </p><p>  For those who like to travel on their own, there is the option of traveling by car.  However, in our opinion, if you do not have friends in each city, then such a trip will be very impractical.  The distance between the departure and arrival points on the highway is 2734 km, which means that you have to go 34 hours.  Without stops, no one can handle this distance, so there will be additional costs for overnight and meals.  Together with gasoline, such a road will cost much more than trains and aircraft, so traveling by car is an exclusively amateur option. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The best way to learn more about the formulations is to read the reviews.  The Chelyabinsk-Adler train has collected quite negative travel descriptions.  Everyone complains about the eternal problems of our trains: dirt and inoperative air conditioners, as well as the poor condition of the bathrooms.  However, a good attitude of the conductors, who sincerely try to fulfill their duties, is noted. </p><p>  Before the trip, it is better to find out the train schedule at the station, read the reviews.  The train "Chelyabinsk-Adler" No. 477, although it runs constantly, but not every day, not to mention No. 343, which does not have a stable schedule.  So the residents of Chelyabinsk need to prepare for the train ride in advance. </p><p>  Passengers who choose the Chelyabinsk-Adler train, this route is considered one of the most unpleasant, because among all the options there is not a single company train, and this is a big problem.  The situation with seasonal trains is especially bad, because they are assembled from existing cars, and most of them are in poor condition. </p>
