    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since today the Internet is very firmly entrenched in the life of almost every person, many tourists are interested in the question of the availability of the hotel, where they plan to stay on vacation, Wi-Fi.  After all, this will allow you to always stay in touch with your family and friends who have remained at home, and also, if necessary, to solve work issues or have fun.  I must say that Sunrise Beach will not disappoint its guests in this regard.  After all, according to compatriots who have been here, the entire territory of the hotel (including rooms) perfectly catches wireless Internet.  In addition, Wi-Fi from the hotel can be used without problems on the beach. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  When booking a room in Sunrise Beach, many tourists choose the Half Board option.  It includes breakfast and dinner included in the price.  A big plus is the fact that you can always change dinner for breakfast if you wish (for example, if you plan to go on an excursion in the evening). </p><p>  In many reviews, you can find a mention that the hotel's restaurant offers magnificent views of the sea.  So you can enjoy your meal and enjoy the azure surface.  As for the choice of dishes, according to the guests, their assortment is not as great as, for example, in Turkish hotels offering buffet meals.  However, all the food is cooked very high quality and delicious from the freshest products.  In addition, the menu is constantly alternating, so you do not have to eat the same thing every day. </p><p>  So, for example, vacationers recall that they gladly ate cheese of various kinds (Roquefort, Dor Blue, Mozzarella), sausage slices, Greek salad, shrimp salad and others, seafood, meat of different varieties (in including lamb).  You can always taste delicious fresh pastries and great desserts.  Tourists also recall a large selection of various fruits and vegetables.  In a word, it is impossible to stay hungry here.  Former hotel guests are warned that drinks are chargeable during dinner.  However, their prices are quite affordable, and the quality is very decent.  Tourists are advised to definitely try the local varieties of wine. </p><p>  In the comments of former guests of Sunrise Beach, you can also find a mention that there is no children's menu in the hotel restaurant.  But tourists who came to rest with children, without problems, got out of the situation.  Young travelers enjoyed various side dishes, soups, fruits and vegetables.  However, parents need to keep this situation in mind, as in most restaurants in Cyprus (not only in the hotel) meat dishes are served with a large number of different spices, which may not appeal to children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunrise beach 4 cyprus" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1347828.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  As you know, most travelers staying in Cyprus, expect a great beach holiday.  Judging by the reviews of our compatriots, the four-star Sunrise Beach Hotel will not disappoint its guests in this regard.  As already mentioned, the hotel is located on the seashore.  Only a promenade separates it from the excellent public beach.  Moreover, the hotel has a large number of comfortable sun loungers, so guests do not need to pay extra for the rental of sunbeds on the beach.  By the way, upon arrival at Sunrise Beach 4 * (Protaras, Cyprus), you will be secured with sun loungers and a parasol, so you will not need to take up space.  As for <span>beach towels,</span> they are given to guests here for free.  You can change them as often as you like. </p><p>  As for the beaches, there are two of them near the hotel.  Moreover, both of them are considered one of the best in Cyprus.  In addition, they are assigned a blue flag.  We are talking about the beaches of Sunrise and Fig Three Bay.  The hotel is literally a dozen meters from the first.  Fig Three Bay Beach is approximately 300 meters away.  You can reach it by a convenient boardwalk.  Near the beaches there are restaurants, cafes, playgrounds, shops and even an amusement park.  The beaches themselves are very clean, with lots of sunbeds.  True, their rent requires additional payment. </p><p>  The sea in this place, many vacationers call truly fabulous.  Experienced tourists claim that it is prettier only in Cuba or in the Dominican Republic. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  According to the guests, most of the time, of course, they spent at sea.  Here you can not only sunbathe and swim, but also engage in various water sports (for an additional fee).  Also, many tourists enjoyed spending time by the pool. </p><p>  Travelers accustomed to an active lifestyle did not refuse to play tennis, visit the gym, walk around the surroundings and, of course, go on various excursions, the choice of which in Cyprus is very large. </p>
