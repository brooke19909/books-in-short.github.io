Smartphone cameras continue to improve, so there are significantly fewer buyers of budget compact camera models.  There are not many <span>good inexpensive cameras</span> left.  Meanwhile, entry-level SLR cameras feel serious competition from mirrorless models, and users with good financial capabilities can choose from the best compacts with large image sensors, mid-size cameras with interchangeable lenses or semi-professional superzoom that allow you to take clear close-up photos from a long distance. </p><p>  This article provides an overview of the best cameras in various price categories. </p><h2>  Pocket cameras: entry-level compacts </h2><p>  It's no secret that smartphones have seriously damaged the demand for cameras for non-professionals.  In online stores there are many models of unknown manufacturers worth up to 6 thousand rubles, but none of them is worth the money if you already have a good smartphone.  However, if you increase the price bar by 2 times, you can find good cameras for the amateur from Canon and Nikon. </p><p>  These thin cameras differ from smartphones in the presence of a zoom lens, but, according to user reviews, they often use the outdated CCD technology of the image sensor, limiting the image quality at high ISO settings and the maximum video resolution of 720p format.  However, those who are looking for a small camera to relax or walk in nature can still find some inexpensive alternatives to a smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Transition to the price category up to 25 thousand rubles.  will allow you to purchase cameras with more modern CMOS image sensors and very long zoom lenses (currently the standard is 30x).  For the most part, video quality does not exceed 1080p.  You can find models with small electronic viewfinders, the ability to shoot in Raw format and very fast autofocus.  Photos from such devices are obtained better than from smartphones.  Some models in this price range are protected from moisture and dust. </p><div class="photo" data-original="player.fm" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Olympus TG-5" class="if uuid-2383371" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383371.jpg"></div><h2>  Best basic cameras </h2><p>  Good <span>cameras for beginners</span> are not only compact models.  Photographers who want a simple and inexpensive image capture device can achieve what they want with a SLR or mirrorless camera.  According to experts, the best models for those who are more interested in obtaining high-quality images and less in learning how to use the lens aperture scale are the Sony A6000, Canon T7i and Olympus TG-5. </p><p>  But there are other options.  Users often recommend the Canon G9 X, a relatively inexpensive handheld model that, compared to a smartphone, offers tangible benefits in terms of image quality and a convenient touch interface.  Nikon D3400 with its help mode is one of the best low-cost cameras of the mirror type, and the Canon EOS M100 is considered the best representative of mirrorless models.  <span>Nikon D3400 is</span> equipped with a 24.3-megapixel sensor, can shoot high-definition video and transfer photos to a smartphone via a Blutooth connection.  The Canon EOS M100 is a very compact camera with an 24-megapixel APS-C sensor.  It features fast autofocus and a burst speed of 6.1 fps.  It has an inclined touch display, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For users who decide which good and inexpensive camera to choose, experts are advised to decide what exactly they want to get.  You should evaluate the appropriate size, because the camera is no good, if it can not be used only because of the very large size.  You should also check the connectivity - you will probably need to quickly transfer the picture to your smartphone.  Ease of use these days is not a problem.  Almost all cameras have an automatic mode, and models with interfaces that provide assistance to the user will allow you to take better pictures without having to master the technical jargon. </p><h2>  Old school: film cameras </h2><p>  It is not necessary to have a digital camera.  Film models are still available, and cameras that allow you to take instant photos are still in demand.  They relieve the difficulties associated with the manifestation of the film, and make it easy to share photos with friends and family immediately after shooting.  Entry-level models cost about 4 thousand rubles, and the cost of the film is usually about 500 rubles.  The best cameras of this type, according to user reviews, include the Fujifilm Instax Mini and Lomography Lomo'Instant lines. </p><p>  You can also buy a new 35 mm or <span>medium format camera.</span>  True, there are not so many options for the manifestation of film and photo printing, as before.  If in a big city you can still find a laboratory, then in small cities you have to resort to mail services. </p><p>  You can still find film SLR cameras and compacts in stores.  If you want to buy a new model, then user reviews recommend Lomography products.  It produces a variety of models - from Sprocket Rocket, which allows you to take panoramic pictures along the entire length of the film, to the medium-format high-level camera LC-A 120. The latter model is quite compact and has a clear wide-angle lens with minimal distortion, an integrated light meter and 4-zone focus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="ilovecybershopping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fujifilm Instax Mini 9" class="if uuid-2383446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383446.jpg"></div><h2>  Small camera, large sensor: elite compacts </h2><p>  Many will be surprised to see a compact camera with a fixed lens, sold at a price of 25 to 60 thousand rubles.  After all, at the same price you can find a model with interchangeable optics.  But these small high-end devices are designed for experienced photographers who already have a mirrorless or SLR camera with a set of optics, but who want something small as an alternative. </p><p>  For a long time, the best models were equipped with 1 / 1.7 ‚Äù(7.6 x 5.7 mm) sensors, which gave them modest advantages over the more common 1 / 2.3‚Äù type (5.76 x 4.29 mm ) used in entry-level cameras and the best smartphones.  Sony changed this in 2013 with its revolutionary RX100, which made the 1-inch class (13.2 x 8.8 mm) the center of attention. </p><p>  Such a sensor has about 4 times larger area than the chips installed in the best smartphones and basic level cameras.  The result is a significantly sharper image, especially at high ISO.  The industry settled on a resolution of 20 megapixels for this type of sensor.  It provides an excellent balance of image quality and noise control. </p><p>  With a larger sensor, a shorter zoom appears.  For the most part, models have a 2.9-fold increase (24-70 mm) or slightly longer - 4x (25-100 mm).  These lenses capture a lot of light over the entire range of focal lengths, and the optics responsible for this require a large front element and a short zoom range. </p><p>  Now longer zooms are beginning to appear in this category, but with a narrower aperture and lenses that provide 10x zoom (25-250 mm).  Cameras with a small aperture do worse with low light levels, but these are the best cameras for traveling when you need a pocket model with a wide zoom range.  The size of the 1-inch sensor usually provides reliable quality up to ISO 3200 and even up to ISO 6400 when shooting in Raw format, so shooting in dim light is possible. </p><p>  There are also models with even larger image sensors and shorter zooms or no zoom at all.  You can purchase a small camera with an APS-C sensor that can be mounted on digital SLR cameras with a fixed focal length, they even have a couple of options with large full-frame matrices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ephotozine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Canon Powershot G7 X Mark II" class="if uuid-2383385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383385.jpg"></div><h2>  Transitional Models </h2><p>  Cameras with a fixed lens are produced, the size and shape of which resemble mirror analogs.  These models, as a rule, have very long optics (up to 83x), a 1 / 2.3 ‚Äùsensor and an electronic viewfinder, sync contact and tiltable display.  If zoom is what you need, then a transitional type camera may be the best choice, although it is not as effective in low light conditions as a SLR camera. </p><p>  There are also high-end models with larger 1-inch sensors and shorter zooms.  They are significantly smaller than digital SLR cameras with comparable magnification.  It is enough to imagine that in the case of the latter you have to wear a set of two or three interchangeable lenses to cover a range of 24-200 mm, 24-400 mm or 24-600 mm.  They are usually more expensive than SLR cameras and transition type cameras with smaller sensors, but they do better with higher ISO settings and faster aperture optics.  If compactness and versatility is required, which is offered by a long zoom, then it is worth considering the possibility of acquiring a model with a 1 ‚Äùsensor.  But you need to be prepared to pay the maximum. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the best transitional cameras are Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10, Canon PowerShot SX60 HS, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000, Leica V-Lux, etc.  The DSC-RX10, for example, is equipped with an impressively sharp 24‚Äì200 mm lens and features high speed burst shooting (10 fps), fast focusing, customizable controls, a clear electronic viewfinder, tilted display, multi-interface sync contact and integrated Wi-Fi modules with NFC </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": Josh Miller/CNET, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony RX10 III" class="if uuid-2383380" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383380.jpg"></div><h2>  Travel Cameras </h2><p>  Not surprisingly, transition models are typically ideal for travel enthusiasts.  They have a wide zoom range, so you do not need to bother with changing the lens.  If you choose the best camera with a 1-inch sensor, you can take pictures in different lighting conditions.  But the traveler may want to have another type of camera. </p><p>  If you need something miniature, then a compact can come up.  But you need to be prepared to invest in a decent device.  For a noisy company, the Olympus TG-5 will be the best compact camera.  It has a fast lens with 4 optical zoom (24-100 mm) and a robust assembly.  In addition, with it you can dive to a depth of 15 m. The device allows you to capture Raw frames and shoot excellent video in 4K resolution. </p><p>  According to owners, the best choice for video enthusiasts is the GoPro action camera. </p><p>  For a relaxing holiday, good quality cameras are the Sony RX100 III and <span>Canon G7 X</span> Mark II, which will allow you to take great pictures in the form factor. </p><p>  If the user is not looking for any frills, then the best option would be a high-quality mirrorless camera (and several lenses), which will allow you to take photos and shoot videos that will not be embarrassing to show to family and friends.  The Sony A6000 remains the best option available, but there are alternatives, such as, for example, the more stylish Fujifilm X-E3. </p><h2>  Mirrorless and SLR camera: which is better? </h2><p>  According to user reviews, they are disappointed that the features specific to mirrorless models, including tilted touch displays and wireless communications, did not immediately appear in SLR cameras.  For example, despite the fact that Canon‚Äôs best cameras have significantly improved video capture, consumers are better off working with an inexpensive mirrorless camera if they want fast autofocus when recording moving images. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pastemagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D3400 Camera" class="if uuid-2383426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383426.jpg"></div><p>  The mirror directs light from the lens to the optical viewfinder.  Getting rid of it allows you to get a finer design with fewer moving parts, as well as more accurate autofocus.  At the same time, the latest digital mirrorless models autofocus is fast.  So fast that the desire to return to the SLR camera does not arise. </p><p>  If the user is ready to work without a viewfinder and use the LCD for visualization, then you can find reliable mirrorless models with a complete lens for less than 30 thousand rubles.  As with digital SLRs, different manufacturers support different optical formats.  For example, when buying a Sony mirrorless camera, the user is attached to Sony E and FE lenses, and if you choose Fujifilm, you will have to deal with the X system. </p><p>  The exception is the Micro Four Thirds system, which is a format shared by Olympus and Panasonic, as well as more specialized devices such as Blackmagic.  The format of the MFT sensor has an aspect ratio of 4: 3, not 3: 2, like most SLR cameras. </p><p>  According to experts, Canon, Nikon and Pentax offer the best entry-level SLR cameras with traditional optical viewfinders.  Sony continues to support the A mount, which originates from Minolta AF lenses, but has switched to electronic viewfinders in its Alpha SLT series.  The design with a fixed mirror and EVF allows the video focus system to use the same sensor as for still images.  This ensures the efficiency of AF at the level of mirrorless cameras. </p><p>  Traditional DSLR cameras have difficulty managing video autofocus.  Contrast methods require the focus to move slightly above the point of sharpness and come back for fixation.  This can lead to errors when tracking a moving object.  Manufacturers worked to solve this problem using optics with pulsed or stepper motors, quieter and smoother during focusing, but still not up to the level of most mirrorless cameras. </p><p>  According to user reviews, this effect is also observed in the simplest digital mirrorless models, which fully rely on contrast focusing.  But they are not as noticeable as SLR ones, and mid-range devices that match the cost of entry-level DSLR cameras use the phase detection method on the image sensor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikon D850 Camera" class="if uuid-2383363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383363.jpg"></div><h2>  High-end mirrorless and SLR cameras </h2><p>  Immediately after overcoming the price barrier of 60 thousand rubles.  the area begins where the user should be well versed in which camera best suits his preferences.  When buying a device in this <span>price range,</span> you need to seriously look at the optics and accessories available for each system, and weigh the pros and cons of different image sensor formats. </p><p>  In recent years, mirrorless cameras have advanced significantly in autofocus tracking.  The best cameras monitor objects and take pictures as fast as comparable SLRs.  For each system and type of shooting, you can find quite adequate optics. </p><p>  MFT cameras allow you to mount Olympus or Panasonic lenses.  These include optics such as fisheye lenses, ultra-wide-angle, telephoto and zoom lenses.  Fujifilm is releasing a powerful kit, including 100-400mm zoom, which can be combined with a tele-converter for even greater coverage.  Sony cameras can use both APS-C (E) and full-frame (FE) lenses up to 300 mm, but longer telephoto lens options are not currently available. </p><p>  But all of the optics listed are not as extensive as in the Canon and Nikon systems.  According to experts, there are many excellent third-party options from Sigma and Tamron.  With such types of SLR lenses as Sigma 150-600 mm F5-6.3, mirrorless cameras cannot be compared in cost.  There is also access to exotics, for example, to the AF-S Nikkor 800mm f / 5.6E FL ED VR, which is simply not available in mirrorless format. </p><p>  For photographers who want to shoot remote objects and use telephoto lenses, users are encouraged to take advantage of the flexibility that APS-C and MFT sensors provide.  There are also a number of full-frame amateur-centric models.  The full-size size is called so because it corresponds to the physical dimensions of a 35 mm film, and is a good choice for shooting landscapes, portraits, reporting of events and reporting.  A large sensor combined with a fast lens provides greater control for depth of field. </p><p>  Anyone who needs interchangeable optics in the price range of 60-150 thousand rubles can find many options.  Perhaps too much.  Models in this price range are very close in characteristics, performance and image quality. </p><p>  When initially choosing a system or in the absence of a large investment, the first thing to do is determine which lenses are needed and consider their cost when making a decision.    ,        ,         . </p><p>      .         ,      APS-C,      .          ,              ,     . </p><p> Choosing between an optical or electronic viewfinder is another question that needs to be answered.  Modern EVF sights are really good - they update quickly, allowing you to track movement.  Users who have not used them for several years will be surprised how far they have come.  But for some photographers, there is nothing better than an optical viewfinder.  In this case, a SLR camera would be preferable to a mirrorless one. </p><p>  According to experts, the best SLR cameras are Nikon D850, D5, D500, D750, Canon EOS 5D Mk IV, Rebel T7i, 80D. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gadgets.ndtv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Phase One XF 100MP" class="if uuid-2383416" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40269/2383416.jpg"></div><h2>  Professional Features: Full Format </h2><p>  The best cameras for professional photographers are Canon or Nikon digital SLR systems, but there are some very functional counterparts.  There are reasons why most professionals choose one of these two popular brands.  These include a solid base of professional housings and lenses, user assistance and the convenience associated with years of use.  But this does not mean that you cannot go the other way.  For example, Sony manufactures the highest-class SLR cameras and several mirrorless models that are not inferior to them in quality, which are also suitable for professional photographers. </p><p>  Which cameras are best suited for sports?  It is worth saying that such devices do not require high resolution SLR cameras, which are used for shooting weddings and other events, but they must capture frames at a much higher speed, usually about 10 fps, with continuous tracking and exposure.  Sony has a great model in the mirrorless subspace - the A9 camera.  The camera is lighter and cheaper than competing digital SLR models, but it focuses and shoots at an incredible speed of 20 fps and records video in ultra-high definition. </p><h2>  Medium Format Digital Cameras </h2><p>  This is an option for those who, for whatever reason, have full-frame cameras not enough resolution.  On the best days of film cameras, the medium format indicated sizes exceeding 35 mm, but smaller than 8 √ó 10 cm. This is a fairly large range.  Good digital cameras are equipped with 33x44 mm sensors that are used in most professional cameras, including Pentax and mirrorless models from Fujifilm and Hasselblad. </p><p>  In the upper part of the spectrum of medium-format models, you can find a sensor measuring 54 x 40 mm, which approximately corresponds to the size of a 6x4.5 cm film. An example is the insanely expensive Phase One XF 100MP.  It offers the capture of Raw images with a resolution of 100 megapixels, which is more than redundant for the vast majority of photographers. </p>
