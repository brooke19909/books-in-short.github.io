    <h2>  General mortgage conditions </h2><p>  Large overpayments on a mortgage loan hit hard on the wallet.  Therefore, many think about its early repayment at least partially.  The main factors are contractual interest, inflation and exchange rate fluctuations, affecting the amount of payments. </p><p>  It is most beneficial for the bank to receive monthly payments.  Especially the profit goes in the first years, when only interest on the loan is covered.  The amount of the loan itself begins to be repaid only in the middle of the term.  With timely payments, the mortgage loan is automatically closed on the last day of payment. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Is <span>early repayment of a mortgage</span> possible <span>?</span>  At Sberbank, some customers who have a large and stable income are willing to meet them.  In this case, it is allowed to pay the debt by differential payment.  As a result, the monthly loan amount is divided into equal parts.  The interest is charged on the balance of the debt itself.  It turns out that the amount remains unchanged.  Only the percentage converted every month changes.  Therefore, paying off a mortgage in advance is not difficult.  Although there is a nuance: the entire freight payment will be at the initial stage.  For this reason, the bank very carefully checks such a client for solvency.  The presence of financial stability will allow for full early repayment of mortgages at Sberbank ahead of schedule. </p>

    <h2>  Methods of early repayment of a mortgage </h2><p>  Any bank will be against early repayments.  Indeed, their plans include for many years to receive a monthly income from a mortgage loan.  This is often the main source of income for the bank.  Therefore, early settlement is unprofitable for him, because he loses a large amount of interest under the contract.  It is impossible to prohibit closing a debt ahead of time.  According to the civil code, any citizen with a loan at the bank can close the debt ahead of schedule.  To exercise their rights, the client needs to notify the bank and its employees in advance about this decision.  Often the term is 30 days or more.  It is installed in the bank at the conclusion of the mortgage agreement.  A statement is written without fail, indicating the reason for the early repayment of the mortgage. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Is it worth it to repay a mortgage debt ahead of schedule? </h2><p>  If you pay on schedule for a long time, then you should consider whether it is worth paying off your mortgage loan ahead of schedule.  Those for whom monthly payments are not a burden should wait a bit.  Indeed, for early repayment, you will have to collect the necessary amount, which means that you squeeze yourself in the budget.  On the contrary, when a mortgage is a burden, you should look for options to improve your life: early close the debt or reduce the amount of payment by partially closing the debt. </p>
