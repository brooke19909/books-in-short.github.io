    <h2>  Briefly about the main thing </h2><p>  The reservoir is the largest in the Chelyabinsk region.  It serves as the main source of drinking water for the regional city.  The hydroelectric power plant itself, due to which the need arose for the construction of the Argazinsky reservoir, is currently not functioning.  However, the regional authorities plan to restore its performance.  The exact dates are unknown. </p><h2>  A few words about sizes </h2><p>  In length, the reservoir stretches for 22 km, in width it is half smaller, which is about 11 km.  The total area is 113 square meters.  km  Such large sizes of the Argazinskoye reservoir became possible due to the lake, which it ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù.  The average depth varies within 12 m. Under water, good visibility, from about 3 to 4 m. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Argaz reservoir fishing" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1167978.jpg" width="600"></div>

Strong vibrations are observed along its perimeter.  Especially poorly defined coast in the eastern part of the reservoir.  The water level in the pond is constantly changing.  Part of this is precisely the difficulty in determining the coastline. </p><p>  The bottom of the Argazinsky reservoir is different.  You can stumble upon small pebbles, sand, as well as silt.  Small islands are scattered throughout the reservoir, some of them are flooded.  The most famous is called Linden.  And, most interestingly, it really grows limes.  This island is even declared a natural monument.  Landscapes around Argazi should also not leave anyone indifferent.  On the one hand, the pond is bordered by hills on which coniferous and deciduous forests grow.  And on the other - the rocky Iset Mountains are visible. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather at the Argaz reservoir" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1167977.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To the reservoir for fish </h2><p>  The people call the reservoir simply Argazi.  It is home to many species of fish.  There are pikes, ides and zander.  Also, sturgeon species are sometimes found, sometimes swimming in a reservoir from the Bolshoi Kialim River.  It flows into Miass a little upstream.  Very close to this place is the Argazinskoe reservoir. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fishing is one of the most common activities in the pond.  It is here that a lot of people come who prefer to spend their holidays with a fishing rod.  They say that the bite on Argazi is inactive, but the size of the catch does not upset.  The reservoir is actively stocking.  In this regard, it becomes possible to catch both small fish and trophy specimens.  The problem for catching fish can only be that it has something to feed in the pond.  Therefore, she does not show much interest in ordinary bait.  Fishermen will have to show imagination in choosing bait. </p><h2>  <span>Recreation facilities</span> on the Argazinskoe reservoir </h2><p>  On the shore of the reservoir there is an excellent recreation center "Birch".  The services she provides include equipped places for cooking barbecue, a good beach.  It is also possible to melt a real Russian bath, and then play billiards. </p><p>  Excellent conditions are also created for fishing enthusiasts.  There are places for storing boats, including motor boats, for storing gear.  The Argazinskoe reservoir is considered by many fishermen to be the best place for fishing. </p><p>  Based on several housing options.  The rooms are single and double.  It is also possible to rent a fireplace.  It is offered complete with single and double rooms, the choice of tourists.  The recreation center has parking for cars.  Water is supplied to the rooms from the well. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation facilities on the Argaz reservoir" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1167976.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For many residents of surrounding cities, this reservoir is associated with childhood memories.  Some parents were brought here in the very very earliest childhood, when this reservoir was still just a lake.  Everyone has good impressions of the rest here, since in summer the weather on the Argazinskoye reservoir pleases tourists with the sun and a gentle breeze.  Many come here on the coast and put up tent camps. </p>
