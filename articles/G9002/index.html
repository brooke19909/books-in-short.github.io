Is it a lot or a little for the birth, development and transformation of the city?  Perhaps, on the scale of world history, two and a half centuries is a grain of sand in vast space. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.23571369999999" data-lng="39.701505" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/6/5/1/13651.png"></div><p>  And maybe this is quite enough that, having survived many events, wars, destruction, the city could be reborn, becoming even more beautiful.  From the first year of its foundation, Rostov-on-Don, relying on its internal resources, primarily human resources, became a leader, entering the top ten cities of Russia in economic development. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúGateway to the Caucasus‚Äù or ‚ÄúPort of the Five Seas‚Äù </h2><p>  Stamp expressions, which are often used to characterize this city, absolutely accurately reflect its location, ideal for the development of the economy.  The intersection of land and water roads, favorable natural conditions made it possible for the city to be in the thick of historical events and the economic growth of the state from the day Rostov-on-Don was founded. </p><p>  If at the dawn of its birth the city was a merchant and merchant, today it is the largest industrial center of the Azov region.  If in the pre-revolutionary period it was possible to go through the <span>port of Rostov</span> to the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov and the Black Sea, which is already a lot, then after the construction of the Volga-Don Canal Rostov conquered three more seas: the Caspian, White and Baltic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The presence of a large transport hub, water and rail, aviation and automobile, contributed to the development of the city.  All this came later.  But a successful, in many ways, location was noted already in its distant past. </p><h2>  The foundation of the city of Rostov-on-Don </h2><p>  The history of each city begins with a legend, and Rostov-on-Don is no exception.  In 1695, young Peter I, going with an army to Azov, ended up in these deserted places.  The king dismounted, drank water from the spring.  ‚ÄúRich well!‚Äù He concluded.  These words were enough to name the place.  It was then thought to the tsar that if a fortress was set up to protect the Russian lands from the enemy, it was only here, in this strategically advantageous place.  But the foundation of the city of Rostov-on-Don did not take place that year.  His time has not come yet. </p><p>  The fortress appeared here after 50 years.  Elizaveta Petrovna, daughter of Peter I, chose a place at the Rich Well for the construction of border customs.  The Russian state in the south of the country needed a service collecting duties from local and foreign merchants.  It was also necessary to stop the smuggling of goods. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rostovbereg.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Customs Fortress Plan" class="if uuid-3044255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044255.jpg"></div><p>  On December 15, 1749, the empress signed a decree on the creation of the Temernitsky customs, located near the historic well, and two miles from the Temernik river.  This day is officially considered the foundation day of Rostov-on-Don.  A little later a fortress appeared for its protection.  Elizaveta Petrovna gave her the name of Metropolitan Dimitry of Rostov, who was canonized shortly before these events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The name of the fortress, over time, was reduced to Rostov, and even later, to avoid confusion with the northern city, a geographical clarification was added.  So on the map of Russia appeared the city of Rostov-on-Don. </p><p>  The fortress did not last long since the foundation of Rostov-on-Don.  In connection with the end of the Russian-Turkish wars, it lost its importance as a military structure, but its role as an intermediate port between Taganrog and Central Russia increased. </p><h2>  Foundation of Nakhichevan </h2><p>  After the founding of Rostov-on-Don, Empress Catherine II pursued a foreign policy aimed at weakening the Crimean Khanate, which was then under Turkish control.  For this, in 1779, she allowed the resettlement of Armenians from the peninsula to the lower Don.  In addition to weakening the economy of Crimea, Russia received on its territory a hardworking, Orthodox people capable of accelerating the development of the region. </p><p>  12 thousand immigrants founded the city of Nakhichevan near Rostov, and two peoples lived for many years in peace and harmony.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the border between cities had completely erased. </p><h2>  The development of the city in the pre-revolutionary period </h2><p>  Meanwhile, the development of the city continued at an enviable rate.  There is another important date in the history of the founding of Rostov-on-Don.  In 1807, by decree of Alexander I, he received the status of a city.  On his coat of arms, the symbol of past years depicts a fortress tower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nailizakon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moskovskaya street 1903" class="if uuid-3044279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044279.jpg"></div><p>  After the construction of the new customs, the turnover increases 30 times, which allows the development of the economy to make a sharp jump.  The city begins to build industrial enterprises.  The foundation was laid at the iron foundry, which was launched in 1846.  And after four years, 53 enterprises of heavy and light industry worked in the city.  All this contributed to population growth.  From 3 thousand in 1809, it increased to 13 thousand in 1856. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.tour52.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The city of the beginning of the 20th century" class="if uuid-3044249" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044249.jpg"></div><p>  In the middle of the XIX century, the first water supply system appeared in the city, then the first telephones, and at the end of the century - electric lighting.  Trams went down the streets.  In the field of education, positive changes have also taken place.  One of the universities was evacuated from the city of Warsaw.  Sports, culture, art did not stand aside.  Thus, the pre-revolutionary Rostov-on-Don was one of the progressive and prosperous cities of Russia. </p><h2>  Rostov-on-Don and the revolution </h2><p>  In the early years of the revolution, the city was at the epicenter of battles.  The events of the Civil War were reflected in every family.  The political views of local residents were divided into diametrically opposed.  But the majority did not support the revolution, and all the forces of the city were directed to help the White movement. </p><p>  The areas controlled by the Don army, which opposed the Bolshevik power, were involved in the confrontation between the two forces.  A separate Rostov regiment was formed from the youth of the city who joined the Volunteer Army. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nailizakon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Hospital" class="if uuid-3044278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044278.jpg"></div><p>  Then, at the beginning of April, the city hosts a congress of Soviets of workers and Cossack deputies of the Don Republic.  He recognizes the power of the Soviets, the Brest Peace and proceeds to the nationalization of enterprises.  But already on April 25, the Don Republic ceased to exist, the ataman Krasnov occupied the city. </p><p>  Over the course of two years, power passed from hand to hand, then red or white won.  People died, families and foundations collapsed, the economy went bankrupt.  In March 1920, the power of the Soviets was finally established. </p><h2>  Soviet city </h2><p>  Rostov, who so actively did not want Soviet power, quickly began to pick up the pace of economic growth, and hence prosperity.  In the mid-1920s, construction began on Rostselmash, a giant and a leader in domestic industry.  A breakthrough was made in the field of theatrical art: a theater building was built in the city.  The names of the actors who worked here are known to the older generation: Yu. A. Zavadsky, V.P. Maretskaya, R. Ya. Plyatt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shattered paths" class="if uuid-3044298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044298.jpg"></div><p>  In the fall of 1941, Rostov was occupied by German troops.  A week later they were knocked out by the army of S.K. Timoshenko.  In July 1942, the city was again surrendered to the Nazis.  The final liberation came in February 1943.  During this time, German soldiers killed 40 thousand people, 53 thousand were forcibly taken to Germany.  The city was almost completely destroyed, it entered the top ten most affected by the war. </p><h2>  Post-war Rostov </h2><p>  The city, which survived the horror of occupation, began to recover quickly.  People worked selflessly, missing the simple, peaceful work.  Trams were quickly launched and engaged in the restoration of Rostselmash.  Already in 1947, the first combine ‚ÄúStalinets 6‚Äù came out of the gate.  The enterprises of the city began to work: a steam locomotive plant, a tobacco factory, and others. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City garden" class="if uuid-3044303" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044303.jpg"></div><p>  Rostov was included in the list of cities to be restored in the first place.  This work was carried out by 36 specialized organizations.  During the period from 1948 to 1951, 378 buildings were restored and constructed, of which 228 were residential.  There were changes in the Don.  In 1952, the Volga-Don Canal began to operate, and in 1965 traffic was launched along the Voroshilov bridge.  Opened educational institutions, cultural institutions, monuments.  In 1987, the city became a millionaire. </p><h2>  270th anniversary of Rostov-on-Don </h2><p>  In 2019, 270 years will have passed since the founding of the city of Rostov-on-Don. </p><p>  Today it is the largest southern city, a city of military glory.  It is an industrial, cultural, educational and scientific center, as well as an important transportation hub of the southern regions.  Rostov is a multinational and multiconfessional city in which people of different nationalities and religions have lived together for centuries and without conflict.  The city has many jobs in various industries, education and art. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tour52.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Modern Rostov" class="if uuid-3044248" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3044248.jpg"></div><p>  Now they are building a lot here.  In recent years, a lot of work has been done to restore old buildings, improve streets and parks, and solve housing problems.  Rostov is a city of educational institutions, libraries, theaters and concert halls.  In recent years, the tourism industry has developed well: new hotels are being built, old ones are being improved.  Sights are being restored, the facades of houses are being put in order.  The city has become very beautiful and interesting. </p>
