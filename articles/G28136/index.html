    <h2>  Reviews of Russian tourists about the hotel </h2><p>  Many modern travelers are well aware of the importance of choosing the right hotel in which they plan to stay during their holidays in a particular country.  This is especially true of cases when the hotel is supposed to live a sufficiently long period - a week, two or even more.  Indeed, most tourists come to Egypt mainly for a beach holiday, so it is very important that the hotel is comfortable enough to spend a lot of time on its territory, and is located close to the sea.  In order not to be mistaken in their choice, travelers today not only get acquainted with the official description of hotels and listen to the advice of tour operators, but also try to study the maximum possible number of reviews of real people who have already stayed in a particular place.  After all, this approach allows you to identify not only the advantages, but also the shortcomings of the hotel.  In order to save your time, we offer generalized comments by our compatriots regarding their recent stay in the hotel complex Nubian Island 5 *.  Reviews of tourists, we immediately note, for the most part are positive.  So, the guests were satisfied with both the accommodation and the service, and the cost of living here.  But we will understand everything in detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel nubian island 5" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1042026.jpg" width="600"></div>

Many guests note very comfortable beds and pillows on which you can sleep well.  The guests were satisfied with the rest of the furniture, as well as the appliances.  So, in the rooms there is a plasma TV, perfectly working air conditioning, refrigerator, hairdryer.  However, some guests complained that the air conditioner is located in such a way that cold air blows directly onto the bed.  Therefore, at night they often had to turn it off.  In general, judging by the reviews of our compatriots, the rooms have everything you need.  So, for example, in the bathroom there is a rope for drying bathing accessories.  In addition, if necessary, you can always ask at the reception to bring you a kettle, tea and coffee making facilities and an iron with ironing board.  These services at the hotel are provided to guests free of charge. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  Judging by their comments, the guests were quite satisfied with the work of the maids in the hotel in question.

Moreover, as our compatriots note, the diligence of the maids was not affected in any way by the fact whether they left them a tip or not. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nubian island 5 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1042025.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Almost all the tourists were satisfied with the beach vacation at the Nubian Island 5 * hotel (Sharm El Sheikh).  However, according to our compatriots, it has its own characteristics here.  So, the fact is that the hotel is located in Nabq Bay, which is famous for its winds and currents.  Therefore, often in the morning <span>, rescuers</span> hang out a red flag, which means that swimming from the pier is prohibited.  After lunch, as a rule, the wind subsides, and travelers can safely swim. </p><p>  As for the beach itself, it is quite large and sandy.  Sun beds and umbrellas here, according to tourists, in abundance.  There is also a bar on the beach where you can always enjoy a drink or a snack during the day.  You can enter the water both from the shore and from the pier.  The first option is suitable for vacationers with young children and people who can‚Äôt swim, as you will have to go far enough to the depths.  At the bottom there are corals, so it is recommended to swim in special shoes.  You can go down to the sea on the ladder from the pier.  In this case, you will immediately go to the depths and can admire the large coral reef.  According to experienced travelers, the reef here is not as beautiful as in some other places in Sharm el-Sheikh, but there is something to see here.  Therefore, do not forget to bring a snorkeling mask with you from home or already in place. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, vacationing in Nubian Island 5 *, tours in which many travel agencies offer, it will be difficult for hotel guests to get bored here.  So, the guests were very pleased with both the large and clean pools with warm water, a well-equipped gym, sports fields and tennis courts with high-quality coverage, as well as the services offered in the spa.  The hotel‚Äôs animators, who offer guests both entertainment during the day and an evening show program, also received positive comments from vacationers. </p>
