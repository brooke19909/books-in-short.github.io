There are many attractions in it, most of them are located in the historical areas of the center.  Transport in the Czech capital is well thought out, you can get to the desired place quickly enough, it moves according to the schedule written at the bus stops, but its cost is considerable, so when booking a hotel for a trip it is best to look for a place of residence closer to the main streets. </p><h2>  Chains Ibis </h2><p>  Accor Hotels economy class hotels are loved by travelers all over the world, because they are located in 64 countries, the number of facilities will soon reach 1000.  No wonder these hotels occupy a leading position in the tourism business.  People rate the quality of service and comfort excellent. </p><p>  The network of famous French Ibis hotels in Prague is represented by 5 hotels in different parts of the city.  These are the favorite economy options for the settlement of tourists from our country.  Consider the most popular and closest to the central attractions of the capital three-star hotels - Old Town, Mala Strana and Wenceslas Square.  These are modern European hotels with small but comfortable rooms.  The transport interchange of the city passes near the buildings, so it is suitable for tourists to populate any of them. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider their location, amenities for tourists coming to rest in Prague, we will briefly review the reviews of people about the Ibis chain of hotels in Prague. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The advantage of these hotels </h2><p>  The French company Accor Group adheres to the same standards in all its hotels.  The staff tries to make the rest as convenient as possible, so in any of the options below, tourists will find everything they need.  If something happens to you and you need help, then do not hesitate to contact the registration desk.  They will listen to you at any time, they will immediately respond to a request. </p><p>  All rooms are small, as they are located in the historical part of the city, but very comfortable.  Each room has its own bathroom with shower, washbasin, hairdryer and toilet.  You can use the Internet at any time, since there is free access in every room.  It is only necessary to take the access code number near the registration desk.  You can calmly watch TV in the evening, since the Czech language is very similar to Russian, many words are immediately understandable. </p><p>  Prague is a wonderful city where you absolutely do not want to sit in a hotel room, even if it will be the most luxurious hotel.  Here tourists find classes to their taste from morning to late evening.  Mostly the hotel only comes to sleep.  And the beds are famous in the Ibis (Prague) hotels for their size.  The rooms are visually reduced due to the huge double beds, in addition, the rooms are soundproofed so that the noise of the city bustle will not wake you up. </p><h2>  Old town </h2><p>  This hotel is built closest to the historic center, just 500 meters away is the famous Old Town Square, Orloi Clock and a monument to Jan Hus.  On Porichi street there are many shops with souvenirs and goods interesting to tourists.  In the evening you can go to the Black Theater and watch a funny performance of artists in chic luminous costumes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ibis Old Prague Hotel is located at 1076/6 Na Porici.  From the station you can take the metro to the Ploshchad Respubliki station. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.accorhotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel building in the center" class="if uuid-2537840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2537840.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel rooms are designed for two residents, there is air conditioning, TV, private bathroom with shower and toilet.  The hotel can accommodate citizens with disabilities.  When booking, you can agree on the inclusion in the price of rest and breakfast.  The rest of the time, the Rendezvous bar is open, where you can buy both drinks and snacks. </p><h2>  Reviews about the hotel in the center </h2><p>  Most tourists gave positive reviews about the Ibis Hotel (Prague).  Most of all I liked the proximity to the center, which is only 10 minutes walk.  The friendliness of the staff, who with difficulty and a strong accent, but still speaks Russian, is noted.  The rooms are rated excellent, everything you need is there, the beds are comfortable, everything works, the condition of the hotel is excellent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beds in room" class="if uuid-2537927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2537927.jpg"></div><p>  Celebrate tourists and delicious Czech breakfasts.

The dishes are all clean, ceramic, there is enough food for everyone living, when the dish is empty, it is immediately filled.  If a tourist accidentally spills something, they will immediately wipe it out with a smile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Mala strana </h2><p>  As the name of this Ibis hotel in Prague shows, it is located in the Mala Strana area.  This is the historical part of the city, in which towers on the hill Prague Castle, St. Vitus Cathedral, Loretan Monastery.  If you wish, you can take the elevator to the observation deck of the Petrin Tower and see the city from a bird's eye view.  The address of this Ibis hotel in Prague is Plzenska 14.

Tickets in Prague are sold on all vehicles at once.  If you purchase one ticket for a day pass, you can, once you punch it in the morning, use any transport during the day without restrictions - metro, bus, tram.  It is very comfortable. </p><p>  The rooms of the Ibis Hotel in Prague are small but comfortable.  There is everything you need: air conditioning, TV, comfortable wide bed, wardrobe, bedside tables. </p><p>  Breakfast is buffet style.  Indulge in a pleasure before a long walk to eat in the hotel restaurant.  All reviews describe the dishes prepared by cooks as very fresh, delicious.  Hearty breakfasts will give strength before the trip, and you can dine in any cafe in the city.  Everywhere food in the Czech Republic is tasty and very satisfying, portions will surprise even food lovers with their sizes. </p><h2>  Opinions of tourists </h2><p>  Residents of this hotel note the cleanliness of the rooms, the staff speaks English, does not understand Russian, so repeat the duty phrases before the trip.  Free Wi-Fi works great anywhere in the hotel, so you can show your photos to friends daily. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.go-today.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant of the ibis hotel" class="if uuid-2537973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2537973.jpg"></div><p>  I liked the location of the hotel, they write that there are only 5 stops to the center by tram.  In time, this is approximately 8 minutes.  On foot to the Vltava coast go 2 blocks, down from the mountain.  Smoking is not allowed in the rooms, so smokers will need to go outside.  The nearest metro station is 300 meters away.  I would like to please fans traveling with pets: the hotel is allowed to live with pets.  You can also choose a room with one double bed or 2 single beds. </p><h2>  Ibis wenceslas square </h2><p>  The Ibis Wenceslas Square hotel in Prague is located in the business center.  From the station, take the metro to the stop I. Pavlova, and it is not far from the place of residence from it.  In 5 minutes on foot you can reach the National Museum with a beautiful fountain in front, then the famous Wenceslas Square with a large number of fashion stores and small restaurants and cafes, there is even a Mac Donalds. </p><p>  It is interesting to walk along a long square in the evening, street musicians perform at every intersection, music is heard everywhere, you can enjoy fresh beer and listen to singing, watch young people dancing break-dance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.neckermann-reisen.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Wenceslas Square" class="if uuid-2538318" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2538318.jpg"></div><p>  The Ibis Wenceslas hotel in Prague can be found at 36 Katerinska. Breakfast is served in the restaurant L'Estamin et, where tourists can get acquainted with Czech dishes as well as eat more familiar to us food. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.anextour.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="restaurant in the hotel" class="if uuid-2532703" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2532703.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike other hotels in the Ibis hotel chain in Prague, Wenceslas Square (Prague), according to reviews, can provide its residents with the opportunity to visit the sauna, swim in the indoor pool or tidy up the hotel's fitness club nearby.  For a fee, the staff at Novotel Praha Wenceslas Square can use these facilities, but only for Ibis tourists. </p><h2>  Recommendations of tourists </h2><p>  When booking, be sure to discuss the issue of parking the car if you are going by your own transport.  There is an underground parking in the hotels, but it is better to take a place in advance, since parking in the center of a large metropolis is all expensive. </p><p>  If you are traveling with your child, you can ask for an extra bed in your room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixabay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Town Square" class="if uuid-2538385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2538385.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists are advised to take the opportunity and right in the center of Prague to visit the spa in a nearby hotel.  Such a pleasure costs only 8 euros (600 p.) Per person, and you get a lot more pleasure. </p><p>  Experienced travelers always choose Ibis hotels for accommodation.  They are inexpensive and all equally comfortable.  When you check in, no one will be disappointed, since they are equally good everywhere. </p>
