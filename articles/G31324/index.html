Greece</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A true Dorian city, a monument to pre-Hellenic civilization, ancient temples, medieval castles and Orthodox churches ... The <span>island of Rhodes</span> keeps secrets of all eras <span>.</span>  The sights on the map of this small piece of land are scattered so generously that it seems unfair to other corners of the earth.  There are even two seas in Rhodes - the Aegean and the Mediterranean.  What are the guidebooks advised to see on the island?  Firstly, it is worth a trip to Limnos - a city that has existed continuously since the VI century BC.  Secondly, visit Kamiros - another of the settlements of the Dorian civilization.  The guides also strongly recommend seeing Mount Filerimos, the monasteries of Moni Tari and Tsambiki, the castles of Kritinia and Monolithos, the valley of the Petaloudes butterflies.  But here we will talk about a special natural attraction, which Greece is famous for.  “The Kiss of the Two Seas” is her poetic name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes kiss of two seas" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/474245.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  As you recall, Rhodes has two waters.  If you look at the map of the island, it becomes obvious that the east coast (the one that is closer to the Turkish city of Marmaris) is washed by the <span>Aegean Sea.</span>  And in the northwest stretches the deep blue of the Mediterranean.  Between them, the natural border, like a fish jumping out of the water, is Rhodes.  “Kiss of two seas” - this is the name of the confluence of two water areas.  It would seem that here is interesting?  But tourists who visited Rhodes believe that it is necessary to make a pilgrimage there.  After all, salinity, and therefore the <span>density of water,</span> is different in the seas.  In addition, the nature of the water area is significantly different.  And this is visible to the naked eye.  Swim at this point - the top of pleasure.  Indeed, in “Kiss of the Two Seas” the heart of Rhodes beats.  So, at least, the residents themselves say.  And there is no reason not to believe them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prasonisi kiss of two seas" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/474249.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where is </h2><p>  This place is located, as the map shows, at the southernmost tip of the island of Rhodes.  The low hill on the cape is called Prasonisi.  “Kiss of the two seas” <strong> </strong>  it is best to observe and photograph from the top of this hill.  By the way, only she remains unchanged.  The outlines of the cape itself (or rather, the sand spit) change from year to year.  Sometimes at high tide, Prasonisi becomes like an island.  Then it is connected with Rhodes by a narrow sandy isthmus about half a kilometer long and only 50-100 meters wide.  And the name speaks for itself: Prasonisi in Greek means "green island".  The disadvantage of this paradise is that there are no hotels, and you can come here only for a day.  But the pilgrimage of tourists to the "Kiss" is such that even without permanent residents it is quite crowded.  This place is chosen by various categories of vacationers: families with children who want to ride a wave on the board, or daredevils who make unimaginable flips with a parachute. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiss of the two seas Rhodes photo" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/474262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Cape Prasonisi is located just nine tens of kilometers from the island's capital, the <span>city ​​of Rhodes.</span>  "Kiss of the two seas" is closest to the resort village of Katavia.  It has hotels and shops.  From Catavia to the confluence of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, only eight kilometers.  Experienced tourists are advised to go there for the whole day.  The trip is best done not with a guided tour, but on your own.  The guide in this case can tell you a little, the most important thing is in the sight.  In Greece, you can easily rent a car - our driver’s license is enough.  And Rhodes is so small that it takes twelve liters of gasoline to go round it from north to south.  Well, for those who do not know how to drive a car, it remains to take an excursion. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Greece kiss of two seas" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/474273.jpg" width="500"></div>

Rhodes, whose photos of attractions is simply mesmerizing, does not let tourists go so quickly.  There is something magical in this place.  It is no accident that in ancient times, local residents believed that Zeus himself, by God's will, ordered the two seas to merge in a single kiss.  Time rushes here just swiftly.  You will not have time to blink an eye, as evening begins to descend.  And how much must be done!  Climb to the top of Prasonisi to make a cycle of colorful photos.  Swim first in the Aegean, and then in the Mediterranean.  Necessarily in this sequence.  After the warm Mediterranean, you will not want to enter the stormy and cool Aegean.  Well, daredevils will be able to test their strength in the fight against the waves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiss of two seas" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/474297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What is interesting "Kiss of the two seas" </h2><p>  The different density and salinity of the two water areas say little to the heart of an ordinary tourist.  But these physical indicators come to light in a completely visible effect.  You will immediately see it if you give yourself the trouble to climb the “Green Island” of Prasonisi.  Turn south, where in front of you will be only water to the horizon.  To your right will be the plain deep aquamarine of the Mediterranean Sea, and to your left - the Aegean shimmering in all shades of blue, from pale turquoise to mother-of-pearl azure.  They merge precisely in a kiss: far to the south goes a clear line of touch of two different colors of water.  Water areas are different in nature.  Always stormy Aegean Sea brings down serious waves on pebble beaches.  The affectionate Mediterranean, on the contrary, gently licks the golden sand of the shore.  The temperature regime of the two water areas is also different.  The Mediterranean Sea takes you into its waters, as if in a warm mother's embrace.  The Aegean is invigorating like a man. </p><h2>  Holidays for all tastes </h2><p>  Different categories of tourists come to Rhodes.  “Kiss of the two seas” <strong> </strong>  ready to satisfy the aspirations of all.  Most beachgoers stop at the long spit that connects Prasonisi and the island of Rhodes.  Families with children and those who like to soak in the warm water choose the Mediterranean coast.  Well, wind and kitesurfers catch their adrenaline in the Aegean region of the spit.  On the southernmost cape you can swim only good and strong swimmers.  There are strong ebb currents that can carry an unlucky tourist far from the coast.  For the first time, trying to get on the board or catch on a kite is also not worth it.  A strong gusty wind is constantly blowing here, sharply changing its direction.  “Kiss of the Two Seas” is not for beginners. </p><h2>  Where does the wind come from </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhodes island attractions on the map" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/474304.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  For many, the weather conditions in this place remain a mystery.  Even if absolute calm has covered the whole island of Rhodes, “Kiss of two seas” <strong> </strong>  it’s still surrounded by a fresh breeze.  Where do such impulses come from in calm weather?  It's all about the different water temperatures in two water areas.  Over the mediterranean <strong> </strong>  the sea sets an area of ​​low <strong> </strong>  pressure, and over the Aegean - high.  When a wide strip of land lies between two water areas, this difference is not noticeable, it is smoothed out.  The friction of masses of water with different densities intensifies the wind.  Therefore, experienced surfers come here on purpose. </p>
