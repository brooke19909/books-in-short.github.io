    <h2>  MSC: decoding of the term </h2><p>  MSC - what is hidden behind the specified abbreviation?  This is the so-called bonus-malus coefficient, which depends on the experience of the driver and the number of accidents that happened to him.  This norm for some may seem redundant.  However, its purpose is to encourage drivers to drive carefully.  Indeed, no accidents and repairs do not need to pay anyone.  And without losses, the profit of the insurance company will only increase. </p><p>  To better understand the meaning of KBM - what does this parameter mean, just think about the phrase "bonus malus".  That is, we are talking about some kind of reward, which relies on driving without incident.  In CTP, the bonus is 5% for each year of accident-free driving. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But the question arises in further decoding the concept of MSC: what is "malus"?  If the owner of the CTP insurance policy gets into his car in an accident, the culprit of which is, then the discount is canceled or reduced.  But if you are not to blame for the accident, then it will not affect the cost of insurance next year.  This condition will continue even when the <span>accident was executed</span> without the participation of traffic police. </p>

    <p>  The reason why the cost does not change in this case is very simple - OSAGO is liability insurance, not car insurance.  And it carries, of course, only the guilty party. </p><h2>  When changing a company, does KBM change? </h2><p>  In CTP insurance, calculation is not an easy task.  The full insurance history of the driver is taken into account.  Consider several common options for how you can find out your ratio. </p><ol><li>  When servicing in the same insurance company, data is stored in an internal database.  Then, when issuing a new policy, the agent looks into it and voices the final cost. </li><li>  If the car owner wants to change the insurance company, then in order to save discounts, he needs to submit a certificate from the company in which he insured before. </li><li>  But even if there is no certificate, there is an automated database of the PCA operator, which stores information about all citizens who received policies.  Nevertheless, it is best to personally control this process, since it happens that the information of the IC was not entered or there were failures in the system. </li><li>  On the official websites of some insurance companies, a special service is provided that allows you to calculate KBM for CTP insurance.  It is an online calculator service.  In this case, the driver is checked on the basis of the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers.</span> </li><li>  It also happens that some UK prescribe KBM in the policy.  Examine it carefully: is there a driver‚Äôs surname opposite or in the ‚Äúspecial marks‚Äù column of the coefficient.  However, since this information does not have to be reflected in the policy, it is rarely entered. </li><li>  Try calling the insurance company on the phone number indicated on the stamp in the insurer's policy.  Ask to connect with the department of OSAGO and say that you intend to renew the contract, so you want to get acquainted with your class for next year. </li></ol><h2>  How is it calculated? </h2><p>  Earlier, KBM in insurance was tied to a specific car.  Therefore, when one car was sold, all bonuses were reset.  This method was clearly inconvenient and disadvantageous.  Therefore, when identifying flaws in the system, it was changed, and KBM began to be associated with a person, not a car. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  KBM indicators in insurance are 15 classes, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof which vary from 2.45 to 0.5.  The client who applied to the insurance company for the first time receives a third grade and has a standard cost. </p><p>  Every year, when accidents due to the fault of the driver do not happen, the MSC decreases.  That is, next year with a 5% discount the class will be already 4th.  However, in the event of an accident due to the fault of the owner of the insurance, the class will inevitably decrease, and the cost of insurance will increase.  Calculations are made according to the special KBM table. </p>

    <p>  If there are several drivers in the policy, then the calculation is made according to the maximum KBM of one of them.  And if it provides for the use of a car without restriction, then the calculation is based on how many payments were made for the previous policy. </p><h2>  Nothing but the truth </h2><p>  Making CTP, the agent may ask how many accidents.  Of course, an automated system is very good, but still ICs, as a rule, prefer to play it safe. </p><p>  Under OSAGO rules, it is forbidden to provide false information.  If this turns out, then the contract of compulsory insurance will be declared invalid, and the money spent on it will not be given back.  Not the best fate awaits those who find out cheating after the accident.  Then the contract is terminated through the court, and payments will have to be compensated in person.  And that's not all.  Next time, when the driver draws up insurance, the price for it will increase by half, that is, KBM will rise to 1.5 times.  Therefore, it is better to never deceive the UK when signing the CTP. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  KBM = 1 </h2><p>  It happens that KBM is equal to one.  This occurs in the following cases: </p><ol><li>  When vehicles that are owned by foreigners are insured (such vehicles are usually located in Russia temporarily). </li><li>  When insuring trailers. </li><li>  With insurance for an extremely short period of time. </li></ol><h2>  Overpricing insurance </h2><p>  Sometimes trying to deceive the opponent, not only unscrupulous car owners, but also the UK themselves.  This is an unreasonable overpricing of the cost of the policy. </p><p>  Most often, this is a simple silence about the MSC.  A standard calculation can be offered, albeit neat, but not knowledgeable in insurance matters to the driver. </p><p>  That is, it turns out that the same size of KBM in insurance for the first time remains the same from year to year.  And this can seriously affect the amount of insurance. </p><p>  Another common method used by agents is the imposition of additional insurance.  Thus, the cost can also increase significantly.  Management often requires employees to try to sell insurance that customers do not need. </p>

    <p>  Of course, one should react decisively to such things.  First, demand a policy without unnecessary offers, and if this does not help, then threaten that you will complain to the appropriate authorities.  In most cases, this is convincing. </p><p>  It also happens that when moving from another company, insurers put a coefficient to the client - one. </p><p>  Note - if you lose your KBM, then it will take a lot of time to recover, and with it the finances will disappear. </p><h2>  How to save? </h2><p>  So, let's figure it out: how to do it in order to pay less for the policy.  The following aspects are relevant here: </p><ul><li>  Territorial coefficient.  We are talking about a driver whose permanent registration is in the province or in the village.  For him, the cost of insurance will be significantly lower than that of a metropolitan.  Many townspeople with relatives in the outback register vehicles for them and drive a car by general power of attorney. </li><li>  It is better to include specific people in the policy who can be trusted with the vehicle than to buy insurance with permission to drive everyone.  The latter option will cost much more.  In addition, you should carefully consider whether the MSC will change with insurance without restrictions. </li><li>  If you are not going to drive in the winter, then it is better to purchase a policy for several months - then when you plan to use the vehicle. </li></ul><h2>  Recent PCA changes </h2><p>  Since December last year, the <span>Russian Union of Auto Insurers</span> introduced a new procedure for applying KBM in insurance.  What are these changes?  The algorithm is that if the policyholder does not agree with the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the coefficient, the insurance company is obliged to check the value in the AIS RSA.  In the event of a discrepancy with the used insurer, what has been identified is applied.  Then the coefficient will be taken into account not only in the current policy, but also in all subsequent ones.  Let's look at the table. </p>

    <h2>  Legal basis </h2><p>  Regulatory documents that regulate the KBM system: </p><ul><li>  CTP Law, Articles 9, 15. </li><li>  CTP Rules, paragraphs 20, 35. </li><li>  Government Decision No. 739. </li></ul><p>  In addition, there is a detailed "PCA Toolkit for the training of employees of insurance organizations No. 7". </p><h2>  The case in Rosgosstrakh </h2><p>  A few years ago, in one of the largest insurance companies - Rosgosstrakh, they once decided and KBM was canceled in case of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance.  Moreover, there was a convenient moment for unscrupulous insurers - other companies did not have blank forms, so drivers had to buy a zero-class policy at Rosgosstrakh. </p><p>  Moreover, in some offices they imposed additional insurance, as well as passing inspection even in the case of a valid diagnostic card. </p><p>  Justice was sought by those who asserted their rights: in this case, <span>the KBM class.</span>  Do I have to sue?  For the court, as you know, it is necessary to have a base that consists of written evidence (you must write in advance for all instances in order to obtain an official written position from them), as well as witnesses, audio, video and the like.  But more often, such issues can be resolved without bringing the matter to court. </p><p>  Of course, insurance companies are not too profitable to pay a discount of up to 50% for trouble-free.  Therefore, employees go to various tricks to reset it.  In addition, car owners can pay for their illiteracy.  After all, some do not even know about the existence of MSC. </p><p>  Therefore, if an error occurs and your KBM is reset, then to restore it you must take the following actions: </p><ul><li>  if less than a year has occurred since the error, send a letter to the PCA asking for an audit; </li><li>  copies of the driver‚Äôs license and old policy with the correct MSC should be attached to the letter; </li><li>  if there is no answer for more than a few months, then you should contact the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, from where the correct KBM with recalculation will be received. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  From the article we learned about the KBM: what is the abbreviation, how it is calculated, what may be the problems with its design and how to solve them.  ‚ÄúForewarned - means armed,‚Äù - well, this is the same case.  Does CBM apply today to OSAGO insurance?  Of course.  Be careful when arranging insurance, do not succumb to pressure and do not agree to additional ‚Äúoptions‚Äù that are unnecessary for you, and if a fact of violation of the calculation of KBM has been identified, dispute it and achieve the correct indicators. </p>
