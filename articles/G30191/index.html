    <h2>  Interesting facts about the capital </h2><ol><li>  It is widely believed among historians and scientists that the name of the city comes from a river nearby.  There are two versions of the appearance of the toponym "Moscow".  Adherents of the first claim that this word came to us from Finland.  Why do they think so?  It is simply believed that in ancient times Finnish tribes lived on the banks of the river.  According to this version, ‚Äúmosk‚Äù means a bear, and ‚Äúva‚Äù means water.  In general, quite plausible.  Adherents of the second version claim that <span>this toponym</span> has Slavic roots.  The word "Moscow", they believe, was translated as "wet", "damp."  And the largest city in Russia, I must say, often "pleases" its residents with this weather. </li><li>  The names of squares and streets in the capital have their own history.  For example, the gates of the Kremlin were called Borovitsky, since nearby, along the fortress wall, a <span>pine forest</span> grew <span>.</span>  And why did Mokhovaya street get such a name?  It‚Äôs just located on the bank of the river, which is thoroughly covered with moss.  Perhaps you already understand why Bolotnaya Street is named that way? </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which city is the largest" class="if" height="253" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18955/398274.jpg" width="200"></div>  All kinds of crafts were widespread among the ancestors of modern residents of the capital, for example, the manufacture of wooden and clay objects, and the production of iron.  Many of them had a garden and a vegetable garden.  Today, many people who live in the largest city in Russia do not have their own patch of land.  However, not everyone has a desire to engage in gardening. </li><li>  In the place of the capital, people have lived since antiquity.  Archaeological excavations were carried out on the <span>territory of Moscow</span> , as a result of which bone and stone objects were found.  Then it became clear that this place was inhabited by primitive people. </li><li>  In Moscow itself and on its outskirts many rivers flow.  You need to know the names of at least the largest.  Actually, these are tributaries of the Moscow River.  These include Yauza, Skhodnaya, Setun, Neglinnaya, Khodynka, Kotlovka.  The largest city in Russia would not be so beautiful if it were not for these wonderful rivers. </li><li>  From all sides the capital is surrounded by forest.  And in Moscow itself there are famous parks, for example, Izmailovsky, Timiryazevsky, Botanical Garden, famous for unusual plants.  Many residents of the capital have already visited all these interesting places.  Do not forget also about Neskuchny Garden, which is also very popular.  In the east of Moscow there is a national park called Elk Island. </li><li>  There is an opinion that there is a secret metro line in the capital.  They say that it was equipped so that there was a connection between the Kremlin and some other buildings with bunkers built in case of danger.  But no one knows the truth or not.  The largest city in Russia, perhaps, hides a lot from the eyes of its inhabitants ... </li><li>  There is a legend that the famous treasures of the Templars are now in the capital.  They were secretly brought here from Paris when the order crashed.  Some architectural monuments of the capital remind us that the Templars were here.  For example, it is worth paying attention to the St. Danilov Monastery, namely its walls.  On the first tier, stucco rosettes flaunt, representing the coat of arms of this order - a flower with six petals, enclosed in a bright rectangular frame with rings on its four sides. </li></ol>
