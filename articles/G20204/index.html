Attractions Rostov-on-Don</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rostov-on-Don is one of the most beautiful cities in Russia.  Drowning in greenery, elegant and bright, it is the real opposite of most industrial centers.  Streets, squares, everything is very densely planted with trees.  But the main "lungs" of the city are parks.  There are a lot of them, each of which is special, has its own history. </p><p>  There are cheerful and bright ones where you want to come with a child, and there are abandoned ones with dark alleys, which, however, also have their own appeal.  Today we want to tell you about the Aviators Park in Rostov-on-Don.  This is a kind of symbol of the city, which cannot be ignored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov Aviation Park on the Don" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1853934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Aircraft first thing </h2><p>  Entering the city along Sholokhov Avenue and climbing the bridge behind the airport, you can see how it stands, looking towards the sky - a MiG fighter.  This is a monument to the air forces that defended Rostov-on-Don during the Great Patriotic War.  <span>Aviators Park</span> got its name precisely because of this monument.  Although, strictly speaking, these aircraft entered service after the war ended, but that does not change much. </p><h2>  Description of the park </h2><p>  If you have a free moment, then welcome to the shady alleys.  It should be noted that here you will not find vibrant attractions and noisy cafes.  Actually, the entertainment centers are already rich in Rostov-on-Don.  Aviators Park is just a quiet place where you can organize a family picnic or just sit in silence.  Here is a real expanse for cyclists.  A huge number of tracks and only occasionally come across passers-by. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What about narrow, almost overgrown paths, with steep descents and ascents?  This is a real adventure in the very heart of Rostov-on-Don.  Aviators Park became famous with the development of cycling in the city.  A little abandoned earlier, today it is one of the most favorite places for family "pokatushek". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="May Day Rostov-on-Don region" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1852973.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Bicycles for rent </h2><p>  Today, there are often tourists who have a little free time before departure.  This is facilitated by the fact that the Pervomaisky district of Rostov-on-Don is located very close to the airport.  Due to the increase in popularity, the city authorities undertook to ennoble well-run park alleys.  Among the youth of the city it is called simply ‚Äúgrove‚Äù.  There are relatively few visitors, and today, but on weekends, cycling enthusiasts begin to flock here, and their number is growing. </p><p>  The idea to organize a bicycle park here was born a long time ago, in 2011 city activists began to come up with similar proposals.  But only after three years, with the help of sponsors and volunteers, the territory was cleaned of accumulated debris, and the paths and the central highway were asphalted. </p><p>  Now the townspeople could be congratulated on the opening of a new sports center - Aviator Park (Rostov-on-Don).  Bicycle rental is only practiced here for the second year, but it found the most lively response among the locals.  And the truth is, why drag your bike through the whole city, when you can take it right here and ride in plenty.  The rental schedule is from 10:00 to 19:00. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Rostov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1853931.jpg" width="600"></div>

But thanks to the increasing interest of citizens in cycling, the Aviators Park (Rostov-on-Don) is becoming more and more visited.  Address - Sholokhov Avenue, 246 a.  You can get here by private car or by bus number 7, 85, 85a.  A trolley bus number 9 goes to the same stop under the name "Kiziterinovskaya". Minibuses number 67, 88, 93, 95, 123, 124, 127, 128r will take you from different parts of the city.  So there will be no problems with delivery. </p><p>  The city authorities say that bike lanes with high-quality coating is only the first stage of reconstruction.  In the future there will be a huge bike lane.  In honor of the Victory Day celebration, a field kitchen was set up on the territory of the park and distribution of soldier's porridge was organized. </p><h2>  Sad fame </h2><p>  Events of past days are still reflected in how residents of Rostov-on-Don perceive this place.  Aviators Park - Chikatilo.  These are two concepts that for many have merged into one. </p><p>  Indeed, it was on its territory that a whole series of brutal murders was committed by one of the most terrible maniacs of our time.  Of course, there was a place for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov Aviation Park" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1853917.jpg" width="507"></div>  Walking distance to Sholokhov Avenue, near the largest stations, and at the same time, the park is quiet, not crowded, abandoned.  For this reason, even today, many do not like to go into its shady alleys.

    <h2>  Green Island </h2><p>  And we continue to consider how the Pervomaisky district of Rostov-on-Don can please tourists.  Green Island is a place where you can sunbathe or throw a fishing rod and catch a sparkling fish.  It is very difficult to call him uncrowded.  You can get here on the pontoon bridge, on which there are always a lot of fishermen.  To the left of the entrance to the island, a beach strip begins, and a beautiful road goes inland.  So you can drive a little further away and find yourself a secluded place for a tourist break.  These are calm backwaters and simply beautiful, green glades.  Few places of rest in Rostov-on-Don have the same atmosphere of peace and comfort. </p><h2>  Oceanarium and Dolphinarium </h2><p>  Considering the <span>sights of Rostov,</span> one cannot fail to mention these two unique objects.  The oceanarium was opened relatively recently, in 2009, and has become a leisure center for residents and visitors of the city.  This is an ‚Äúunderwater museum‚Äù with live exhibits.  Huge aquariums make extraordinary creatures feel at home.  And visitors are free to observe the life of moray eels and sharks, the unhurried movement of the ramp. </p><p>  Dolphinarium is a favorite place for kids.  A fun show of Black Sea dolphins, walruses and seals, as well as funny clowns will delight adults and children.  Hourly performance consists of a huge number of interesting rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rostov-on-Don Aviation Park bicycle rental" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1852968.jpg" width="592"></div>
