They were distinguished by reliability and excellent performance due to the latest engineering solutions. </p><h2>  Work for the occupiers </h2><p>  Like other countries captured by fascist Germany in the late 30s of the 20th century, the Czech Republic was forced to produce various types of weapons for the occupiers, including tank armored vehicles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech tanks" class="if uuid-3164045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/3164045.jpg"></div><p>  Even before the outbreak of hostilities, the country was famous for its automobile and aviation industries.  In this regard, it is not surprising that the Germans liked Czech tanks, which in some technical parameters were considered the best in the world.  Until 1941, they accounted for approximately 25% of the entire armored army of the Wehrmacht. </p><h2>  Light tank LT-35 </h2><p>  This model of a Czech tank was created at Skoda in 1935 under the name S-IIa with a classic layout and rear-wheel drive.  At the same factory, a 6-cylinder carburetor power plant was developed for him, which was located in the rear of the hull.  It allowed to reach speeds of up to 30 km / h, and the range without refueling reached 150 km. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Quite large, as for a light tank, the tower was located in the middle of the hull and was equipped with a 37 mm automatic cannon, as well as a machine gun with a caliber of 7.92 mm.  Gun guidance and firing took place using a mechanical drive, and the crew commander could determine enemy targets using a telescopic sight and periscope. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tank-photographs.cz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech tank black photo" class="if uuid-3165886" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/3165886.jpg"></div><p>  The crew of such a Czech tank of World War II (photo of the model can be seen in the article) also included a driver sitting in the right front of the hull, and on the left beside it was a radio operator gunner who shot at opponents from an additional machine gun in the front of the hull . </p><p>  Despite the fact that the LT-35 was intended primarily to support infantry attacks, the thickness of its armor was relatively weak.  The thickness of the frontal armor plates was 25 mm, and the airborne - 16 mm. </p><p>  At one time, the light tank LT-35 was very popular in the German army thanks to the latest design solutions that significantly increased its operational and technical performance.  The engine was started using pneumatics, and an improved servo drive facilitated the process of controlling the brake system and transmission. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For three years, 424 Czech tanks of this model left the assembly line.  Most of them were part of the German army in the initial stages of the war. </p><h2>  Light tank LT-38 </h2><p>  Used during World War II, the Czech tank LT-38, better known as Pz.Kpfw.38 (t), was developed in 1938 at the ƒåKD-Prague plant under the working name TNHP.  At that time, it was the best armored car in the light class in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Czech tanks of the second world war" class="if uuid-3164042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/3164042.jpg"></div><p>  Initially, the tank was produced for the needs of the army of Czechoslovakia, and after the occupation of the country its production only accelerated, but for the German tank troops.  Until 1942, almost 1,500 armored vehicles were in the Wehrmacht's army. </p><p>  Similar Czech tanks were used by the Germans in various military campaigns.  At the beginning of World War II there were 5 German divisions, consisting exclusively of such armored vehicles. </p><p>  Tank LT-38 was distinguished by its simplicity and rationality of design.  The undercarriage consisted of four support rollers pairwise interlocked by leaf springs on each side of the side.  A transmission and drive wheels were located in the front of the hull, and to simplify their repair during the battle, they made a special hatch.  The power plant of this Czech tank consisted of a 6-cylinder liquid-cooled carburetor engine. </p><p>  The armament of the machine included a 37-mm semi-automatic cannon, as well as two machine guns with a caliber of 7.9 mm. </p><h2>  Other models of Czech tanks of World War II </h2><p>  The light tank LT-38 was also famous for the fact that after the cessation of the production of this model on the basis of its simple and reliable chassis, they began to produce other armored vehicles - from armored personnel carriers, anti-aircraft mounts and repair vehicles to excellent self-propelled artillery installations, such as the Grill or Marder III " </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worldwarphotos.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="anti-aircraft installation based on a Czech tank" class="if uuid-3164072" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42603/3164072.jpg"></div><p>  The most famous was the "tank destroyer" called "Hetzer", which until the end of World War II, about 2500 units were produced.  This "self-propelled gun" was very low, and therefore invisible on the battlefield.  A 75-mm cannon was mounted on it, allowing effective fire on enemy tanks, and a 60-mm frontal armor, mounted at a large angle, made the Hetzer almost invulnerable from the front.  The model was so successful that it was produced even after the end of hostilities for the needs of the Swiss and Czechoslovak armies. </p>
