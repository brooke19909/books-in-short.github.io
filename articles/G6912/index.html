The distance to Moscow from here is quite small, but it takes a lot of time and nerves to overcome it daily.  A significant part of <span>Odintsovo residents</span> goes to work in the capital.  The lack of reliable transport communications creates domestic discomfort and social stress in a city near Moscow. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro in odintsovo" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/283048.jpg" width="487"></div>

    <p>  <strong>The decision on the metro in Odintsovo made</strong> </p><p>  Ways to solve the transport problems of the cities near Moscow have been discussed for several decades.  The issue of which nearest metro station to Odintsovo should become intermediate was also debated for a long time.  The fact is that there were as many as three options for building a line in the direction of this suburban city.  Such <span>intermediate stations</span> could theoretically be the ‚ÄúSouth-West‚Äù Sokolnicheskaya, ‚ÄúMolodezhnaya‚Äù Arbat-Pokrovskaya or ‚ÄúKuntsevskaya‚Äù <span>Filevskaya lines.</span>  But not one of these plans was accepted for economic reasons.  The strategy of the transport <span>policy of regional</span> development has been finalized.  As in some other cities of the Moscow Region, the metro in Odintsovo will come on the surface of the earth.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Both the speed of construction and the cost of it, the so-called "easy metro" option is out of competition.  The task is greatly facilitated by the fact that for the construction of such a line, you can use the exclusion strip and the already existing technical infrastructure of the railway line passing through the city.  This means that you don‚Äôt have to demolish any objects on the path of the future route.  All this will allow you to step into the metro car in Odintsovo in 2015. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The nearest metro station to Odintsovo" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/283049.jpg" width="491"></div><br>  Of course, to get to the center of the capital in this car, unfortunately, will not work.  This, in essence, will be a suburban electric train with a small interval of movement.  He will stop on suburban platforms.  At the intersection with the current metro scheme, several interchange points will be specially equipped.  Thus, we observe how in the Moscow region its own metro map is gradually being formed.  Odintsovo becomes one of the terminal stations in the west. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro map odintsovo" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/283050.jpg" width="390"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Advantages and disadvantages of the "light metro"</strong> </p><p>  Among the significant disadvantages of the project accepted for execution, it should first be attributed to the fact that it will not be integrated into the general scheme of the Moscow Metro.  The metro trains can be reached only through the interchange hub.  And the question of whether or not there are turnstiles there remains unclear.  But for the economic and social development of the Moscow Region city, the importance of this communication is difficult to overestimate.  The transport problem can be considered resolved.  Odintsovo will become part of large Moscow.  Already, new modern residential complexes are being built here.  Apartments in them are offered to customers, taking into account the proximity to the final metro station. </p>
