    <p>  Previously, the park had an outdoor pool.  Sokolniki was famous for its ‚ÄúDolphin‚Äù, which in summer formed a beach area around itself for relaxation.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the territory fell into disrepair and was not used for a long time.  The leadership of the Eastern District of the capital recently decided that such an amount of space should not disappear. </p><p>  As a result, ‚ÄúThe Pool‚Äù appeared here, which immediately included two large pools, yoga and aerobics clubs, game and sports areas.  In addition, there are cafes, showers, changing rooms - in short, all the necessary infrastructure for recreation.  There is also a porch, which can accommodate about 200 people. </p><h2>  Working hours </h2>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the pool in Sokolniki works only in the summertime, in winter the coast freezes, and therefore it is only suitable for fishing.  But in the summer you can visit here daily from 9 to 22 hours.  Since the number of seats is limited, visitors are invited to visit the pool and the surrounding area according to a certain schedule: from 9 to 12 noon, from 12 to 16 and from 16 to 22. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You can visit a cafe with a veranda for free, but you still have to pay the entrance to the beach area.  If you plan to rent a deck chair and come here on a weekday, you will have to pay 400 rubles.  If we are talking about a day off, the price of a visit will be 600 rubles.  You can also take advantage of the special offer - the "Comfort" zone.  The cost of rest here on weekdays is 500 rubles, and on weekends - 800. </p><p>  If you plan to visit the outdoor pool, Sokolniki is the best option, because it is here that one of the most modern artificial reservoirs is located.  You can buy a ticket for the whole day for 1000-1400 rubles on weekdays and 1700-2100 rubles on weekends.  For children, the cost of visiting will be 500-600 rubles.  If you take a child under 12 years old and do not plan to rent a chaise lounge for him, rest on the beach will cost 150-200 rubles. </p><h2>  Rental of other equipment </h2><p>  If you plan to enjoy a first-class vacation, but you do not want to travel far from Moscow, it is best to visit the pool.  Sokolniki work daily, trying to receive all their guests.  In addition to renting sun loungers and entry fees, visitors can rent <span>additional equipment</span> here at relatively low prices.  For example, renting a ball for playing <span>beach volleyball</span> will cost 150 rubles per hour. </p><p>  The cost of playing table tennis will be about 400 rubles per hour.  An hour of playing badminton, frisbee or backgammon will cost only 200 rubles.  A towel and mattress for a deck chair can be rented for 200/300 rubles (session / all day).  When renting any equipment you will need to make a deposit, which is from 300 to 500 rubles, depending on the service you have chosen.  All funds are returned to the client after returning the equipment in good condition. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Why is the pool so popular? </h2><p>  "The Pool" in the Sokolniki park is annually filled with visitors who come here not only from Moscow, but also from the Moscow region.  The main reason is accessibility and cleanliness.  As of 2015, this <span>recreational area</span> is the only institution within the First See, which has a superbly organized recreational space by the pond. </p><p>  Another fundamental difference between this pool is that you do not need to provide a medical certificate for entry, unlike many other institutions.  In fact, to visit other pools, local administrations require their visitors to check for the absence of various diseases that can be transmitted to other guests of the institution.  Such a document can be prepared in advance in the <span>clinic at the place of residence,</span> you can also undergo a medical examination right in the pool and get a certificate there, however, it is more fictitious. </p><h2>  Visitors reviews </h2>

    <p>  All those who visited the pool in Sokolniki respond positively about it.  The guests of the institution especially emphasize the heating, which turns on inside the artificial reservoirs when the water slowly heats up in the open.  High-quality cleaning systems work here without interruption, providing vacationers with clean water, which also, according to visitors, is one of the advantages of the facility under consideration. </p><p>  The place where the ultramodern pool is located (Sokolniki), according to guests, has a number of disadvantages.  The main one is that there is a limited number of tickets for the so-called "sessions" - not so many people can be on the beach at the same time.  The management of the complex explains the low bandwidth by the fact that the beach needs timely and high-quality service, and with an increase in the number of guests it will be very difficult to carry out all the necessary events.  In the future, the complex is planned to be expanded, but the exact dates are not yet known. </p><h2>  And what else? </h2><p>  The recreation area "Z Pool" (Sokolniki), the photo of which is presented on the page, is only part of the park, and its main task is to compensate for the lack of ponds in the territory of the recreational institution.  In addition to heated pools, here everyone can find for themselves something individual, interesting only to him. </p><p>  Wi-Fi works on the beach and the entire complex, which is very important for those who always need to be in touch at work, as well as for those who like to publish photos from their holidays on social networks.  There are almost daily parties organized for young people who gather here in the evenings, but they all end at the time the complex closes, and this is also partly a cause for discontent among the guests of the institution. </p><h2>  Sokolniki Park and the pool </h2>

    <p>  ‚ÄúThe Pool‚Äù in Sokolniki Park has a small history so far, unlike the territory that surrounds it.  In the XVI century, in its place was a forest used by Ivan IV the Terrible and Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich for hunting.  Then it was customary to use falcons in the fun, hence the name of today's park appeared.  Another autocrat - Peter I - cut through the clearing, where holidays and festivities were often held, today it is called the May clearing. </p><p>  The pool itself appeared here shortly after the Great Patriotic War.  There is no exact date for its construction, since it was built in several stages.  At that time, the pond was built to hold various competitions on the water, but later on the park management had to abandon this idea - it was too fond of the locals. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2>

    <p>  Many guests of the capital are interested in the outdoor pool in Sokolniki.  How to get to it?  This question is especially relevant for those who have never been to Moscow before.  The answer is simple: first you have to get to Sokolniki Park, and it is most convenient to do this using the metro in the capital, you just need to get to the Sokolniki station, located on the same line. </p><p>  You can also use the electric trains plying in the Yaroslavl direction.  It will be necessary to get to the station "Malenkovskaya" or "Moscow-3".  Near the park there are tram lines No. 4, 11, 25, and also bus lines No. 40, 75, 122, 140, 239, 265, 783. </p><p>  It should be remembered that the area in which the pool (Sokolniki), the park and nearby attractions are located is located near the <span>Riga Station,</span> so you can use any transport for which it is the final destination.  Accordingly, at the services of vacationers and the metro, you will need to get to the station "Riga" Kaluga-Riga line. </p><h2>  Where else are there similar objects? </h2>

    <p>  The area in which the pool is located - Sokolniki - is far from the only one in Moscow where there are similar recreation areas.  However, all other reservoirs are not so popular because of the outdated infrastructure, poor quality of the services provided, as well as the reluctance to change and meet their own guests. </p><p>  In 2014, a number of new pools were opened in Moscow, which Muscovites and guests of the capital can also use at any time.  We are talking about the Luzhniki Stadium, Fili, the Admiral, and many other institutions.  The cost of visiting each of them is best clarified in advance, since it can vary both upward and downward. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  "The Pool" (Sokolniki), whose address is: st.  <span>Sokolniki Val,</span> 1, p. 1, does not work in winter.  It is planned that in the summer of 2016 it will open its doors again for everyone.  The district administration notes that, unfortunately, there is no way to increase prices for services, but all because of the serious economic situation in the country.  However, the management so far plans to do without sharp jumps in tariffs.  In the winter of 2015/2016  The administration plans to conduct a detailed analysis and calculations. </p>

    <p>  It is planned that the complex will begin its work in early May 2016 and will function until the end of September, but everything will depend on climatic conditions.  The rapidly changing climate may surprise residents of the capital, as happened in November 2015, when the air temperature rose sharply to a plus point and heavy rain fell for several days.  In 2016, the administration plans to increase the number of tickets for ‚Äúsessions‚Äù and to ‚Äúrearrange‚Äù the territory of the complex, using absolutely all available areas.  Absolutely all services offered will be available to visitors.  Near the pool there is also a fitness club where you can improve your own health under the supervision of professional athletic trainers. </p>
