Scientists have proved more than once that different music can change a person’s emotional state.  Here and there, interesting facts about her appear in the press and on the Internet.  Many people love music, and therefore the audio system in the car is quite an important thing, maybe even the second after comfort in the cabin.  Today, many different systems are offered: from luxury and audiophile to budget and standard, but the sound quality also depends on the setting and the correct installation. </p><h2>  About native audio </h2><p>  Unfortunately, full-time audio is far from ideal, not to mention the Lexus or BMW.  Take at least the speakers in the doorway.  It’s hard to get at least a little decent sound from them, and reviews about them are often negative.  Users say that when the speaker is operating, the door and the plastic trim begin to vibrate violently.  In home <span>speakers, the</span> case is quite rigid, so there is no vibration.  To avoid such problems, manufacturers remove frequencies that cause vibrations.  This is done so that car production is as cheap as possible.  In this case, you do not have to make the door tougher.  But this happens even with self-respecting manufacturers. </p>

    <p>  For many others, everything is different.  For example, the speaker is not mounted on the metal in the door, but on a flimsy upholstery.  Moreover, these speakers are not even from the budget segment, but frankly cheap and of poor quality.  Needless to say, that such an audio system in the car goes under replacement immediately at any listening and tasteful car enthusiast? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of Existing Systems </h2><p>  Today, there are two types of equipment that is responsible for the sound in the car.  So, there are component systems and coaxial.  Music lovers prefer component systems, as they are considered to be more advanced.  Coaxial equipment is a thing of the past because it is unable to provide good or at least normal sound. </p>

    <h2>  What is a component <span>speaker system?</span> </h2><p>  This acoustics are speakers placed separately.  If you install them correctly, you can achieve a unique presence effect.  The driver will hear every instrument.  Even an inexpensive audio system in the car can provide high quality sound.  Among the common kits, two low- and mid-frequency speakers can be distinguished, as well as two high-frequency ones.  More expensive systems have additional subwoofers. </p>

    <h2>  Coaxial equipment </h2><p>  Unlike <span>component acoustics,</span> here all the speakers are assembled in one housing.  The simplest column can consist entirely of one speaker.  The advantage of this acoustics is in a simpler installation, in addition, the consumer likes the cost.  This sound is used now, but it is popular among those for whom sound quality is not important.  You can see this equipment in minibuses, trucks, cheap passenger cars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Types and sizes of speakers </h2><p>  If you need a good audio system in the car, then you can’t get by with the purchase of one high-quality <span>head unit</span> .  Sound is a complex of equipment.  When choosing <span>acoustics, reviews</span> are advised to pay attention not to the shape, but to the size of the speakers in it.  Often, most cars already have regular places for loudspeakers, the sizes of which are 10, 13 and 16 cm. This is if the speaker has a round shape.  There are also places 15 x 23 cm if the shape is oval. </p><h2>  Good sound is the right fit </h2><p>  Yes exactly.  For example, mid-range speakers are very harmful vibrations.  They should be fixed as tight as possible.  Then you can count on a good sound.  If installation is carried out in the door, prepare the vehicle in advance.  This will help achieve normal sound quality.  If the speakers will be installed in the rear, it is important to leave some space between the speakers and the subwoofer.  Optimally, if the mid-range speakers are located on the rear doors, and the subwoofer gets into the trunk. </p>

    <p>  Tweeters are best placed in front.  To ensure sound quality, just two front speakers and two high-frequency speakers installed on the front racks are enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Professionals recommend mounting tweeters as close to mid-range as possible.  However, for this you need to cut the skin.  Then these speakers are connected near the mirrors.  In general, the key to high sound quality is the correct and competent installation of the audio system in the car. </p><h2>  The best of the best </h2><p>  But the best - this does not mean the loudest.  Loud sound will never be high-quality and clear, and even loud sound can easily damage your hearing.  Some systems can be produced as standard for some brands, others will have to be purchased separately. </p><h2>  Bose car audio system </h2><p>  This company is a pioneer in the production of stereo systems.  Products are popular today.  This technique at one time turned the idea of ​​sound quality and design. </p>

    <p>  The full-fledged audio system of this manufacturer can be heard in Maybach.  There it is a full-time system.  The sound quality can be safely compared with a live concert.  For many audiophiles, it’s still a mystery how the company made a sound of this quality, despite many interior problems.  The Bose Media System can be heard on Ferrari models.  The system provides perfect sound quality.  The price is sky-high, but for true music lovers nothing is impossible.  The audio systems from this manufacturer use the latest technologies that change the way music is presented. </p><h2>  Boston acoustics </h2><p>  This acoustics can be found in the Crysler 300C.  Thus, a system with a power of 360 W is able to provide maximum sound quality.  Included are 7 speakers equipped with special filters and a subwoofer. </p><h2>  Rockford fostage </h2><p>  This system can be heard in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution.  This car audio system has a power of 650 watts.  Options - 9 speakers and a subwoofer.  The sound quality is in good processing.  The system can respond to changes in speed and can even out the volume of sound. </p><h2>  How to assemble an audio system in a car: a budget solution </h2><p>  Inexpensive, but sounding equipment is a reality.  Let there be only 10 thousand rubles for all components.  At the same time, regular systems that are more expensive will sound worse.  Installation and configuration are paid separately. </p>

    <p>  So, 10 thousand should be distributed as follows: 3.5 thousand for the purchase of a radio, 2.5 thousand for the front speakers and another 3.5 for the rear.  A 500 rubles.  will remain for the purchase of <span>speaker wires</span> and other trifles. </p><h2>  Budget head unit </h2><p>  Among the head units there is a lot of competition due to Chinese products.  Reviews recommend choosing budget solutions from market leaders.  Let them also be collected in the Middle Kingdom, but the sound quality here is much higher. </p><p>  As for the functionality, it is the reproduction of sound from any media, power up to 50 W per channel, <span>linear output,</span> settings for <span>cutting the frequencies,</span> equalizer and other little things. </p><h2>  Front and rear speakers </h2><p>  Here is the most difficult choice.  As a budget, but at the same time quality option, you can purchase models from Pioneer.  On sale inexpensively you can even find three-way models. </p><p>  Not every car has spaces under the rear speakers, but you can embed them yourself.  For 3000 rub.  You can purchase good options with three frequency bands.  As an example, we recommend that you look at Kenwoood products. </p>

    <p>  That's so easy and almost inexpensive to get a budget audio system in the car.  Now it remains to learn about installation and configuration. </p><h2>  Installing audio in a car </h2><p>  Even if the car is not equipped with a standard audio system, all wiring is already installed by default.  To install the head unit, it is necessary to remove the plug and insert the radio into a regular place.  And of course, you should connect all the connectors and cables. </p><p>  To install the speakers, you need to prepare podium podiums in advance.  Reviews recommend pre-treating plywood with antiseptic compounds.  Before installation, acoustic preparation should be done.  Then the podiums are screwed to the doors, previously holes are drilled in them.  It remains only to stretch the wires and connect them first to the crossovers, and then to the amplifier or radio.  There is nothing difficult, but if difficulties arise, it is better to entrust the work to professionals.  They know exactly how to install the audio system in the car so that the car enthusiast was surprised by the result. </p>
