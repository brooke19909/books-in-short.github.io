Holy Assumption Kiev Pechersk Lavra</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All the tourists try to visit the Kiev-Pechersky monastery in Ukraine.  This is one of the very first ancient Russian monasteries, which appeared in the thousand and fifty-first year.  Over time, its territory grew, temples expanded, numerous cells were built, and in the year one thousand six hundred and eighty-eighth, the <span>monastery</span> became a monastery.  We study in more detail the history of the emergence of the Kiev Pechersk Monastery. </p><h2>  How it all began? </h2><p>  In the eleventh century, on the site of the monastery, on the right bank of the Dnieper River (near Kiev), there was a dense forest.  The monk Hilarion from the village of Berestov often came here to pray.  He dug a cave here.  When Hilarion was appointed Metropolitan of Kiev (it was 1051), his cave was empty for a short while.  In the same year (this date was taken as the foundation of the Kiev-Pechersky monastery), the monk Anthony Pechersky settled here, followed by other monks. </p><p>  As soon as the cave was settled by twelve monks, it was decided to build a church here.  Anthony dug a cave on a nearby mountain.  Once again, monks began to flock there from all sides.  As soon as twelve monks settled in the cell, the church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was built over it. </p><p>  When the monastery could not accommodate everyone, Anthony turned for help to the Kiev prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich, and he gave permission to use the entire territory of the mountain for Christian needs.  In the thousand sixty-second year, the Kiev-Pechersky Monastery was built.  All this time, the life of the monks attracted followers and ordinary Christians who generously left their donations to them.  And after a few years, these donations were enough to erect a new church with fresco painting and mosaics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev Pechersky Monastery" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/537783.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nomadic raids on the monastery </h2><p>  For the first time the church was robbed by the nomadic people of Turkic origin - the Polovtsy - in 1906.  At this time, the monastery was ruined, and the Ukrainian capital almost fell before the conquerors. </p><p>  Only twelve years later, the Kiev Pechersk Lavra began to recover.  Hegumen Theoktist, together with Prince Gleb Vseslavich, contributed to the construction of a stone meal, as well as a new church.  At the same time, the territory of the monastery was completely fenced with a picket fence.  The monks lived in the main building, and the caves were now used as tombs for monks.  They were buried in the recesses of the walls of the cave corridor. </p><p>  At the monastery there was a shelter for the weak, the disabled, the poor, for whose needs tithe was allocated from the total income.  It was built during Theodosius.  By the way, his cave was excavated in the village of Lesniki, the territory of which also belonged to the monastery.  From the moment of its foundation to this period, the Kiev Pechersk Monastery graduated twenty bishops. </p><h2>  Turkish invasion </h2><p>  From one thousand one hundred and fifty-one to one thousand two hundred and forty years the monastery was heavily robbed and burned.  First, the Turks ravaged the monastery of monks, then burned.  But the monks continued to serve.  After the church was again robbed by the Polovtsy, but again continued to fulfill its mission.  But, unfortunately, during the conquest of Kiev, the invaders attacked the Kiev-Pechersky Monastery.  The caves became a shelter for the clergy, but even they did not save most of the monks. </p><p>  The ruined laurel stood until the fourteenth century.  From this period, under the leadership of the Kiev prince Simeon Olelkovich, a new erection of the monastery began.  The main church became the tomb for the Kiev nobility.  In the year fourteen hundred and seventy, the monastery was completely rebuilt, fortified, and began to play the role of the main sanctuary of the city.  Not even Turkish raids were not afraid of him now. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But after twelve years the monastery was again burned, only now by the Crimean army.  It took time to restore the church with human donations.  With one thousand five hundred and ninety-three years begins the heyday for monks.  Kiev-Pechersk Lavra expanded its territorial borders (two cities, fifty villages, fifteen villages with different crafts and crafts) and opportunities.  Since the fifteenth century, monks are allowed to travel to Moscow for donations.  However, trials do not leave the monastery.  The one thousand seven hundred and eighteenth year was a great shock for him: the fire destroyed all valuables - the library, ancient manuscripts, all treasures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev-Pechersk Lavra" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/537808.jpg" width="430"></div>

    <h2>  Power war </h2><p>  The wealth and glory of the monastery did not give rest not only to foreign conquerors, but also to the Union of Brest.  With the year fifteen hundred and sixty-six, the first attempts to subjugate the laurel to the Uniate Metropolitan began.  However, the monks, hardened by foreign raids, showed strong resistance to the Brest Union.  The monks were led by Archimandrite Nikifor Tur, who, together with the monks, successfully rebuffed the Uniate Metropolitan.  Neither monks nor the land of the monastery suffered from these skirmishes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Only at the end of the sixteenth century Kiev-Pechersk Lavra achieved independence from the influence of local dioceses.  She is appropriated by the Ecumenical (Constantinople) Patriarch the status of stavropigia.  Despite the expansion of the Uniate churches, the Pechersky Monastery becomes a stronghold for Orthodox Christians.  Thanks to the activities of archimandrites E. Pletenetsky and Z. Kopystensky, a competent struggle against uniatism begins by issuing polemical, liturgical books printed by the forces of our own printing house (1616). </p><p>  The Moscow Patriarch will fight for power.  The monastery in the year one thousand six hundred and eighty-eighth is subject to the Moscow Patriarch and All Russia.  However, this reign will last ninety-eight years.  Then the laurel will pass to the Kiev Metropolitan. </p><h2>  The history of the development of the monastery from the 17th to the 19th century </h2><p>  Despite the bloody confrontation with Uniate, the Kiev Pechersk Monastery is developing.  In addition to the printing house, a school for monks appears under the leadership of Peter the Grave, which eventually grew into the Kiev-Mohyla College. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kiev Pechersk Lavra photo" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/537785.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The priest‚Äôs son, Ivan Samoilovich, as a hetman, fortified the entire territory of the monastery with a rampart, and another hetman, <span>Ivan Mazepa,</span> fenced the church with a stone wall.  During the reign of Peter the Great, the territory of the monks expanded, forming the Pechersk fortress.  However, a fire of one thousand seven hundred and eighteen destroyed almost the entire monastery.  Kiev-Pechersk Lavra was able to recover only after eleven years. </p><p>  Two years later, the construction of the Great Lavra Bell Tower began.  It was the tallest building throughout Ukraine (the height was ninety-six and a half meters).  The construction of the bell tower took fourteen years.  The project was led by Russian architect G.I.  Schedel. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the construction of the bell tower was delayed (according to architectural assurances, it was planned to erect the building in three years), and the budget of the laurel did not allow to take on new projects, by the nineteenth century its territory consisted of six monasteries (Main, Hospital, Near and Far Caves, Goloseevskaya and Kitaevskaya deserts). </p><h2>  Characteristics of the buildings of the laurel </h2><p>  The main monastery is located at the main church.  The hospital monastery was built in the twelfth century near the Lavra gate with the support of the Chernigov prince Nikola Svyatoshi.  In the church itself there was already an icon of the Assumption of the Mother of God, utensils, the Gospels, a library with valuable books, portraits and relics of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra.  Here was the tombstone of Prince K.I.  Ostrog, tomb and tombs of saints. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="caves of Kiev Pechersk Lavra" class="if" height="277" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/537810.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  Near and Far underground passages are located not far from each other.  The first grottoes formed around the cave of monk Anthony, and the second - near the cell of the monk Hilarion.  Anthony Caves have three entrances, the most accessible and popular is the western entrance from the Holy Cross Church.  In total there are three underground passages that connect the Temple, the Church of the Introduction of the Virgin and the Meal of the Cave Fathers. </p><p>  Since ancient times, caves have been a place for the monks to live, and later their burial.  Residential cells had two opposite ledges, designed for sleeping and eating.  There were also recesses for candles and icons.  In the underground passages are locales.  It is believed that they were snouted and buried by the monks Mark Caveman.  There are also small windows with the names of hermits.  Currently, the size of the passages of the caves has been reduced due to late rebuilding and is only three hundred and eighty-three meters. </p><h2>  Holy churches </h2><p>  Not every monk of the Kiev Pechersk Monastery was honored to be buried in caves.  The distant cells store forty-five relics, and the neighboring ones - eighty.  To the Far relics belong the relics of St. Theodosius, Hilarion the Skimnick, Pimen the Lenten, Amphilochius, Euphrosyne, Pior, Paphnutius, Pamy, Sisoy, Theodore the Silent, Zacharias, Agathon the Wonderworker, Longinus, Macarius, Moses, Pavilion, Arsenius, Arsenius, Arsenius , Euphemia hermit, Hypatia, Joseph Sick, Leonti, Mercury, Martyrius deacon Paisija Nestor unlearned, Titus Feofioa, Ignatius Theodore of Ostrog, Paul of Tobolsk, Vladimir of Kiev, Filaret, hermits Athanasius, Anatoly, of Ammon, Mardary, Pancrazio, Sophronia ,  Assia, Martyrius, Lawrence, Gregory, Rufus, Dionysius. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="monk of the Kiev cave monastery" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/537809.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>The nearby caves</span> store the relics of St. Anthony, Prokhor Lebednik, John the Fast, Juliania, Theodore, Basil, Polycarp, Damian, Varlaam, Erasmus, Titus, Theophilos, Ionanne, Nectarius, Mark the Grave Digger, Alexius, Gregory, Sergius, Savva, Mercury, P Nestor, Eustratia, Hellas, Jeremiah, Moses, John the Long-suffering, Onufry, the Saints, Gregory the Miracle-Worker, Matthew, Onisim, Isaiah, Abraham, Nifont, Sylvester, Kuksha, Macarius, Pimen the Fast, Lavrentiy, Anatoly, Onislau, Zatisor, Zatis, Onisil, Sis Arefs, Alipia, Simon, Theophanes, Nikon  , Anastasia, Efrem, Abraham the recluse, Agapit, Luke, John the baby, Elijah, Nikon Sukhoi, Nicodemus, Spiridon, Isakia, Athanasius the recluse. </p><p>  All the monks of the monastery are revered on certain days according to the <span>Julian calendar:</span> on August twenty-eighth, the memory of the monks of the Far Caves is revered, September twenty-eighth is dedicated to the monks of the Near Dungeons, and the saints of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra are revered in Lent (usually the second week). </p><p>  There are believers for whom it is important to touch the relics of saints.  But tourists are often interested in interesting facts from the life of monks.  Guides often talk about the following saints. </p><ul><li>  Anthony Pechersky.  Founded Near Caves.  Since childhood, he was a devout person and devoted his whole life to serving God. </li><li>  Nestor the Chronicler.  Seventeen-year-old youth identified as deacon, church writer.  He made a significant contribution to Old Russian literature. </li><li>  Agapit the Deadless.  The monk had the gift of healing, but did not have a medical education.  He treated common people and princes completely free. </li><li>  Ilya Muromets.  A popular ancient Russian hero who, according to the epic legend, accepted monasticism, is buried in the monastery. </li><li>  Nikola Svyatosha.  Prince who accepted monasticism.  Thanks to him, the Gateway Trinity and St. Nicholas Church, the Hospital Nikolsky Monastery were built. </li><li>  Twelve builders of Greek origin.  Their names are unknown, but the story of their monasticism is unique.  In the eleventh century, they arrived specially from Byzantium to restore the Great Lavra, after its completion they became monks. </li><li>  Varlaam.  Boyarsky son adopted monasticism, participated in the laying of the first wooden monastery on the Anthony Caves.  Known for the fact that after a pilgrimage from Constantinople and Palestine, all his property bequeathed to the monastery. </li><li>  Kuksha.  Missionary and Holy Martyr.  Known for the gift of healing, the ability to work miracles.  The pagans were tormented and executed.  It is said that on the day of his death pillars of fire stood over the monastery. </li><li>  Nikon Sukhoi.  During the attack, the Polovtsy was captured, tortured for three years.  According to his prediction, he was supposed to get into the Pechersky monastery, because the Polovtsy wounded his legs.  However, the saint became invisible and ended up in the monastery.  The miracles associated with his life do not end there.  When, several years later, the Polovets came to the caves, who tortured the monk Nikon, he saw him alive.  Immediately he adopted Christianity with his whole family. </li><li>  Eustratius the Martyr.  A native of a noble family who distributed all his property and became a monk.  During the Polovtsian attack he was sold into slavery.  Long tormented for an unshakable faith and was crucified on the cross.  Miraculously lived another fifteen days, then thrown into the sea.  However, the body inexplicably appeared in the laurel. </li></ul><h2>  History of the Soviet era </h2><p>  From the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-six, the caves of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra from the Moscow Patriarch passed into the possession of the Kiev Metropolitan.  In the Soviet period, the monastery was replaced by one status after another.  Since September, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-sixth, the territory of the monastery has been transferred to the state reserve by Ukrainian Soviet authorities.  The formation of a museum town on the territory of the monastery led to its ruin.  During the Soviet period, most of the monks were executed or exiled to prisons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relics of Kiev Pechersk Lavra" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/541603.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  During World War II, the Germans allowed the monks to live in the monastery, but already in November they blew up the Assumption Cathedral of the Kiev-Pechersky Monastery, having managed to take out the jewelry.  Although now the story is misinterpreted, telling tourists about the explosion of laurels by Soviet partisans.  This information was refuted when the record of the explosion made by the Nazis for their own entertainment became available.  Later, the fact of the explosion of the monastery by the Germans was proved by other researchers and scientists. </p><p>  After the war, the monastery was no longer closed and was available to the people until the nineteen sixty-first year.  Later a new wave of anti-religious views began, and the monastery began to play the role of a museum more than shrines.  Often, guides conducted tours of the caves and scientifically explained the status of various relics, but still Christians tried to adhere to the remains and ask for protection from the saints. </p><p>  A miracle for the Orthodox and an <span>inexplicable fact</span> for scientists is the appearance of three myrrh-streaming chapters on the territory of the monastery of the Far Caves.  From the moment the authorities allowed religious activity, the world began to stand out from the chapters.  Scientists have still not found out what is in its composition so far, they have only asserted that this applies to a living organism and is not the result of chemical experiments. </p><h2>  Modern Kiev-Pechersk Lavra </h2><p>  Photos of the current and original appearance of the church are practically no different.  Modern authorities only restored the building to preserve historical authenticity.  In 1990, the entire territory of the laurel was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. </p><p>  From 1992 to this day, the Metropolitan <span>Vladimir Sabodan of</span> Kiev has been the archimandrite of the Lavra <span>.</span>  A year after his appointment, work began on the restoration of the monastery.  In 2000, the Cathedral of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra was rebuilt and consecrated. </p><p>  In addition to the monastery, the Orthodox Academy, the printing house, there is the Kiev-Pechersk National Reserve.  His possession includes the Upper Lavra.  Admission is free for children and beneficiaries, the rest must purchase a ticket at a purely symbolic cost (two years ago the ticket cost three hryvnias). </p><p>  Tourists can see caves, chapels, graves, cells of monks, towers, walls, gates, educational and printing institutions, monuments, churches.  By the way, on the official website of the monastery there is the possibility of a virtual trip, which allows you to see firsthand the Kiev-Pechersky monastery (the photo of different attractions increases when you click one or another cursor). </p><p>  The Lavra is unique in its historical value, religious shrines, wonderful legends, architectural sights for all people, regardless of faith and nation.  The atmosphere of the monastery allows you to look at many things with different eyes.  Many Christians claim to be returning from there by other people.  Whether it‚Äôs miracles of faith or the work of the subconscious, but holy places help to rethink your life path. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery Kiev Pechersk Lavra" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/537781.jpg" width="570"></div>
