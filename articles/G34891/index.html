  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Buy Real Estate In The Moscow Region?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Without focusing on what kind of real estate in question, we can answer for sure: Moscow region real estate is a great investment!  Having a much more intelligible value than the ‚Äúintramad‚Äù, real estate near Moscow is guaranteed and tirelessly growing in price. <br><br>  The reason for this is the rapid growth of the capital.  Moscow threatens to soon turn into an analogue of Tokyo or Mexico City, and the president‚Äôs initiative to withdraw many administrative bodies to the suburban area is only confirmation of the steadiness of this process. <br><br>  However, the larger the city, the higher the demand for suburban, suburban housing.  That is why the cottage villages of the Moscow Region so quickly grow.  The breathtaking pace of metropolitan life is forcing Muscovites to use every free day to travel outside the always smoky and always noisy city.  And many-day celebrations, which have become a tradition of recent years, and complementing regular vacations in a good way, are required to be held ‚Äúin nature‚Äù.  In winter - <noindex>  <span>New Year in the suburbs</span> </noindex>  , in the summer ... Yes, all summer you can live outside the city, coming to Moscow only for work. <br><br>  Many Muscovites do not unreasonably believe: to buy a house in a cottage village means to doom yourself to the same crowding that is so tired of the city!  However, it is worth noting that there is still a difference ... <br><br>  Firstly, the cottage village is clean fresh air and the opportunity to leave the village in one minute (well, five minutes) in order to be in the lap of nature.  Secondly, it is unfair to call crowding a few dozen families staying (or even living) on ‚Äã‚Äãa territory of several tens of hectares.  Thirdly, the possible noise from the prolonged neighborly feast is never as burdensome as the incessant car hum - especially if you are among the guests invited to the table. <br><br>  Do not believe?  come to <noindex>  <span>Moscow region for the new year</span> </noindex>  and you will see that doubt is unnecessary.  Cottage villages are spacious enough to accept both those who like the noisy fun, and those who like peace and tranquility. <br><br>  Having bought a house in one of the cottage villages of the Moscow Region, you will make both a convenient and profitable purchase.  For several years that separate you from the moment of profitable sale of real estate, you can be an active user of all the benefits provided for by the cottage village project. <br><br>  And who knows, maybe you decide to leave this acquisition in your possession forever ... </p></div></article>
