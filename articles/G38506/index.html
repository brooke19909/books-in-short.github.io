    <h2>  Low efficiency devices </h2><p>  Electronic ballast (2x36 circuit) of low efficiency is suitable for 20 W lamps.  The standard circuit includes a set of expansion transceivers.  The threshold voltage for them is 200 V. The thyristor in devices of this type is used on the lining.  Comparator fights with overloads.  Many models use a converter that operates at a frequency of 35 Hz.  In order to increase the voltage, a tetrode is used.  Additionally used adapters for connecting ballasts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  High Efficiency Devices </h2><p>  The electronic ballast (wiring diagram shown below) has one transistor with an output to the lining.

    <h2>  15 watt device </h2><p>  Electronic ballast (2x36 circuit) for 15 W lamps is assembled with integrated transceivers.  Thyristors in this case are mounted via a choke.  It is also worth noting that there are modifications on open adapters.  They are distinguished by high conductivity, but operate at a low frequency.  Capacitors are used only with comparators.  <span>The rated voltage</span> during operation reaches 200 V. Insulators are used only at the beginning of the circuit.  Stabilizers are used with a variable regulator.  The conductivity of the element is at least 5 microns. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  20 W model </h2><p>  The electrical circuit of the electronic ballast for 20 W lamps implies the use of an expansion transceiver.  Transistors are standardly used with different capacities.  At the beginning of the circuit, they are set to 3 pF.  For many models, the conductivity reaches 70 microns.  In this case, the sensitivity coefficient is not much reduced.  Capacitors in the circuit are used with an open regulator.  The operating frequency is reduced through the comparator.  In this case, the rectification of the current occurs due to the operation of the converter. </p><p>  If we consider phase transceiver circuits, then there are four capacitors.  The capacitance starts at 40 pF.  The operating frequency of the ballast is maintained at 50 Hz.  Triodes for this are used on operational controllers.  To lower the sensitivity coefficient, various filters can be found.  Rectifiers are often used on liners and are installed behind the choke.  Ballast conductivity is primarily dependent on threshold voltage.  The type of controller is also taken into account. </p>

    <h2>  36 W ballast circuit </h2><p>  Electronic ballast (2x36 circuit) for 36 W lamps has an expansion transceiver.  The device is connected via an adapter.  If we talk about the performance of ballasts, then the rated voltage is 200 watts.  Device insulators are suitable for low conductivity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The 36W electronic ballast circuit also includes capacitors from 4 pF.  Thyristors are often installed behind filters.  To control the operating frequency there are regulators.  Many models use two rectifiers.  The operating frequency for ballasts of this type is a maximum of 55 Hz.  In this case, overload can increase greatly. </p><h2>  Ballast T8 </h2><p>  The T8 electronic ballast (circuit shown below) has two low conductivity transistors.  For models, only contact thyristors are used.  Capacitors at the beginning of the circuit are large capacity.  It is also worth noting that ballasts are manufactured on contactor stabilizers.  Many models support <span>high voltage.</span>  The heat loss coefficient is about 65%.  The comparator is installed with a frequency of 30 Hz and a conductivity of 4 microns.

    <h2>  Using Transistors MJE13003A </h2><p>  Electronic ballast (2x36 circuit) with transistors MJE13003A includes only one converter, which is located behind the inductor.  The models use a variable contactor.  The operating frequency for ballasts is 40 Hz.  In this case, the threshold voltage during overloads is 230 V. The triode in the devices is of the pole type.  Many models have three rectifiers with conductivity from 5 microns.  The disadvantage of the MJE13003A transit device is the high heat loss. </p><h2>  Using N13003A Transistors </h2><p>  Ballasts with these transistors are valued for good conductivity.  They have a small coefficient of heat loss.  The standard device circuit includes a wired converter.  The throttle in this case is used with a lining.  Many models have low conductivity, but the operating frequency is 30 Hz.  Comparators for modifications are selected on the wave capacitor.  Regulators are only suitable for the operating type.  In total, the device has two relays, and contactors are installed behind the inductor. </p><h2>  Using transistors KT8170A1 </h2><p>  The ballast on the KT8170A1 transistor consists of two transceivers.  The models have three filters for impulse noise.  For the inclusion of the transceiver meets the rectifier, which operates at a frequency of 45 Hz.  The models use converters of only variable type.  They operate at a threshold voltage of 200 V. These devices are great for 15 W lamps.  The triodes in the controllers use the output type.  The overload indicator can vary, and this is primarily due to the throughput of the relay.  You also need to remember the capacitance of capacitors.  If we consider wired models, then the above parameter for elements should not exceed 70 pF. </p><h2>  Using transistors KT872A </h2><p>  Schematic diagram of electronic ballast on transistors KT872A involves the use of only variable converters.  The throughput is about 5 microns, but the operating frequency may vary.  The ballast transceiver is selected with an expander.  Many models use several capacitors of different capacities.  At the beginning of the chain, lining elements are used.  It is also worth noting that the triode is allowed to be installed in front of the inductor.  Conductivity in this case will be 6 microns, and the operating frequency will not be higher than 20 Hz.  At a voltage of 200 V, the overload at the ballast will be about 2 A. To solve problems with reduced sensitivity, stabilizers on expanders are used. </p>

    <h2>  The use of unipolar dinistors </h2><p>  An electronic ballast (2x36 circuit) with single-pole dynistors is capable of operating under overloads of more than 4 A. The disadvantage of such devices is the high heat loss coefficient.  The modification scheme includes two low conductivity transceivers.  For models, the operating frequency is about 40 Hz.  Conductors are mounted behind the choke, and the relay is installed only with a filter.  It is also worth noting that ballasts have a conductor transistor. </p><p>  Capacitor is used low and high capacity.  At the beginning of the circuit, 4 pF elements are used.  The resistance in this section is about 50 ohms.  It is also necessary to pay attention to the fact that insulators are used only with filters.  The threshold voltage at ballasts when turned on is approximately 230 V. Thus, the models can be used for lamps of different power. </p>

    <h2>  Circuit with bipolar dinistor </h2><p>  Bipolar dinistors primarily provide high conductivity for the elements.  Electronic ballast (2x36 circuit) is produced with components on the switches.  In this case, the regulators are used operational type.  The standard circuit of the device includes not only a thyristor, but also a set of capacitors.  The transceiver is used capacitive type, and it has high conductivity.  The operating frequency of the element is 55 Hz. </p><p>  The main problem of devices is low sensitivity at high overloads.  It is also worth noting that triodes are able to work only at an increased frequency.  Thus, the lamps often flash, and this is caused by overheating of the capacitors.  To solve this problem, filters are installed on the ballasts.  However, they are not always able to handle overloads.  In this case, it is worth considering the amplitude of the jumps in the network. </p>
