    <h2>  "Black arrow" </h2><p>  Biysk sights are a delight.  The first thing that visitors to the city will see is a steam engine named Black Arrow, which will meet you at the station.  It got its name thanks to the writer Vasily Shukshin.  A large train is a tribute to the builders who paved the <span>Siberian Railway.</span>  The building of the railway station itself is also a peculiar architectural creation, the opening of which was an important event for the city. </p><p>  One of the interesting sights of the city is the bronze horseman - a monument to Emperor <span>Peter the Great.</span>  It seems that the monument escaped from St. Petersburg and found a cozy place in the park of Garkavy.  The city of Biysk, Altai Territory, is the third settlement where the monument to the great emperor is located. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

One of them is connected with <span>the Ob River,</span> which originates from the water resources of Biya and Katun.  The water of these two rivers has a different color and for many kilometers they flow without mixing their colors.  Historians claim that in these places the holy dwelling of the Golden Baba was located - an idol, which was worshiped by local peoples for many centuries.  Well, it is worth noting that the Ob is the longest river in Russia (more than five thousand kilometers). </p>

    <p>  An amazing attraction of the city is the planetarium.  It is entertaining to visit both adults and children.  It is here that the model of the Zeiss planetarium is located, which was given to Biysk by the astronauts.  At one time, astronauts learned to move in open space among stars on it.  With this model, tourists will be able to look at our planet as if from a height from a spaceship, and the most fascinating will be the viewing of six thousand stars in our sky. </p><h2>  The highlight of the city </h2><p>  The bright pearl of Biysk is the Assumption Cathedral, which adorns the old part of the city with its beautiful facade, excellent architectural solution, and the visitor will remember the chic and unique interior decoration of the temple for a long time. </p><p>  The Cathedral is one of the main noble places of the city, created in the Russian-Byzantine style.  The temple has a rich history.  With him there was once a church school, a parish school.  He survived the cathedral and the persecutions that were arranged at the church in the twenties and thirties of the last century.  Some ministers were repressed, the church was closed, but despite this, the Assumption Cathedral survived all the difficulties, and today its doors are always open for parishioners. </p>
