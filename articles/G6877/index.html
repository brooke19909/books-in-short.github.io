    <h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Egor Abakumov, whose biography originates in the city of Donetsk, was born back in 1895.  The city was then called Yuzovka. </p><p>  It was a small working village built around a metallurgical plant.  In those days, the village was divided into two parts: New World and Factory Side.  The central part of the village developed rapidly from the factory to the railway station. </p><p>  Six years before Abakumov‚Äôs birth, two more plants were built near Yuzovka - an iron foundry and a machine building. </p><p>  Growing up in a workers' settlement, Yegor Abakumov from childhood knew the hard factory labor.  He saw how adults worked hard in a blast furnace, smelting hot iron. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egor Abakumov awards" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1802019.jpg" width="600"></div>

Hard work underground, a busy shift schedule, narrow dark passages - an inexperienced teenager had to face all this. </p><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  Young Egor met the October Revolution with joy and hope.  Finally comes the end of slave labor, work on the selfish, satiated rich. </p><p>  Abakumov becomes an active <span>participant in the Civil War,</span> with arms in hand defending the power of workers and peasants.  He sincerely seeks to achieve the triumph of Soviet ideology in his native Donbass. </p><p>  At the age of twenty-five, a young man receives an honorary appointment - he holds a leading position in the coal industry of the Ukrainian SSR and Sakhalin Oblast. </p><p>  The experience gained in working youth becomes a solid foundation in the endeavors of the young miner, affects his professional skills. </p><h2>  Mature years </h2><p>  Recognizing that special qualifications are required for managerial work, Yegor Abakumov is receiving higher education at Moscow State Mining University. </p><p>  The capital immediately drew attention to the hardworking young man, sincerely in love with his profession.  He is assigned to work on the construction of the Moscow Metro.  At the age of thirty-eight years, Yegor Abakumov holds the post of first deputy chief of Metrostroy, and only a couple of years later he becomes the direct head of the facility under construction. </p><p>  Then Yegor Trofimovich transferred to leadership work in the Ministry of Coal Industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egor Abakumov memory" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1802021.jpg" width="542"></div>

He was engaged in the development of new technological methods to improve production efficiency. </p><p>  Along with other educated advanced workers, Yegor Abakumov is the author of new techniques for accelerating mine workings.  Thanks to him, a mining machine was invented and developed (a pile-breaker loading machine used to load rock mass into mine vehicles). </p><p>  Among other things, Yegor Abakumov invented the shield method of driving <span>subway tunnels</span> and mine shafts. </p><h2>  The Great Patriotic War </h2><p>  Egor Trofimovich fought against the Nazi invaders in the Kuzbass and Karaganda, raising Soviet coal mining in these parts. </p><p>  For the sake of the industry of the Kuzbass (or the Kuznetsk coal basin) Abakumov had to move to the south of Western Siberia, where the largest coal deposits of the world are located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egor Abakumov photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/1802020.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Now <span>coal mining</span> in the Kemerovo region is conducted both by the generally accepted underground method and by more advanced methods - open and hydraulic.  Three hydraulic shafts, twenty-five coal processing plants, and about a hundred underground mines, most of which are large mechanized enterprises, operate in the basin. </p><p>  In the modern activities of the Kuzbass there is a great merit of such strong and courageous people as Abakumov, who stood at the origins of the development and establishment of the Kuznetsk basin.  Despite the terrible war years, the lack of people and financial means, such industrial enthusiasts worked not only for themselves and their contemporaries, but also for us - their future descendants. </p><p>  After the great victory, Abakumov performed no less responsible and important tasks - he restored mines in the Donbass, blown up or flooded by Nazi occupiers. </p><h2>  Thanks </h2><p>  Egor Abakumov, whose rewards and incentives corresponded to his significant authoritative activity, at the age of fifty-two years received the honorary Stalin Prize for the introduction and improvement of the shield method in the construction of the Moscow Metro.  This type of tunneling provided a significant increase in the productivity of underground work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egor Abakumov biography" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14322/1802063.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Grateful descendants in honor of Abakumov named the Donetsk mine and Donbass mining college, as well as one of the streets of the capital of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  Death </h2><p>  He died an active and influential production worker of Donbass in Moscow at the age of fifty-eight years.  He was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery. </p><p>  Egor Abakumov, whose photo is given in this article, lived a short, but very eventful life, having a huge beneficial effect on the further industrial activity of not only his native Donbass.  His developments were of all-Union significance. </p>
