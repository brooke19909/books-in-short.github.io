    <p>  The best option is 4 * Crete hotels.  They, compared to 5 *, are cheaper.  And unlike 3-star ones, they can offer a higher level of service.  When considering Crete 4 * all-inclusive hotels, it is worth mentioning the Grecotel Club Marina Club 4 *, which is located at a distance of 25 km from Rethymnon.  The main advantages of this hotel are its large well-kept grounds, excellent cuisine and a magnificent beach.  Especially here families with children like to relax, they have a mini-water park and spacious pools. </p><p>  Crete 4 * all-inclusive hotels also cannot be imagined without Aldemar <span>Cretan Village 4 *.</span>  It is located 2 km from Hersonissos.  It is presented in the form of two-story bungalows that emphasize the ancient traditions of Crete with all their appearance.  Nearby is the sea, and around are magnificent blooming gardens.  The local food also pleases guests, especially the ‚Äúsea menu‚Äù. </p><h2>  Prices for accommodation in hotels of Crete </h2><p>  Looking for a comfortable hotel to stay during your vacation in Crete, every traveler, of course, is interested in the cost.  After all, it is an important criterion when comparing two identical hotels.  Or choosing the option that best suits the financial possibilities of the tourist.  Of course, prices depend on the "stardom" of the hotel, as well as its location relative to the sea, landscaping, the availability of additional services, etc. </p><p>  So, a 3-star hotel will cost a guest of Crete about 30,000 - 33,000 rubles for 1 person for 7 days, a 4-star hotel - 33,000 - 38,000 rubles, and a tourist will have to pay 45,000 - 55 for the most expensive 5-star hotel 000 rubles.  Of course, the last accommodation option is the most luxurious, but this does not mean that only it can provide a pleasant and unforgettable vacation.  For example, if you plan to spend most of the time relaxing on the beach or traveling around the island, then there is no need to pay money for the most expensive room. </p><h2>  Which hotel of Crete should I prefer? </h2><p>  A huge number of accommodation options can offer its guests the island of Crete.  4 * hotels receive the most diverse reviews of tourists, the same applies to 3 * and 5 *.  It all depends on the personal preferences of each traveler.

True, there are reviews that mention, for example, a tasteless kitchen, inattentive staff, then they should really pay special attention to. </p>
