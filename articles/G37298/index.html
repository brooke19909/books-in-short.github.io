    <h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  At the end of the 14th century, the city was founded by Prince Vladimir Sergeevich Serpukhov.  He was named after the fourth princely son, Yaroslavl.  The city was first mentioned in chronicles in 1402.  After joining the <span>Principality of Moscow,</span> it was renamed Maloyaroslavets.  In 1776, he received the status of a county town.  October 24, 1912 Maloyaroslavets became the site of a bloody battle of Russian troops with a powerful army of Napoleon.  After a 17-hour ongoing battle, the city changed hands 8 times.  As a result of fierce fighting, he was almost destroyed. </p><p>  During the Second World War, Maloyaroslavets was in the occupation for a short time and also suffered greatly.  In 2012, by decree of V.V. Putin, he received the title <span>"City of Military Glory."</span> </p><h2>  Maloyaroslavets Attractions </h2><p>  The city, which has a rich history, has a huge number of cultural, historical and architectural monuments.  The city authorities treat them very carefully, monitor their condition and carry out the necessary <span>restoration work.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Ancient settlement </h2><p>  This is a unique historical and natural monument.  An artificial earth embankment 30 meters high is located on the banks of the Puddle River, between two ravines.  Archaeologists claim that there were settlements of the Vyatichi tribes who lived in the territory where today is the Kaluga region, in the 12-13th centuries. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of the 14th century, the settlement was strengthened by the brother of Dmitry Donskoy, Vladimir the Brave-Donskoy.  It is assumed that he called this new settlement Yaroslavl.  It was a wooden tyn on a high earthen rampart, a hill fort adapted for hand-to-hand defense.  It was a protective city system. </p><p>  In the 15-16th centuries, after numerous raids of the <span>Crimean Tatars</span> and Lithuanian invaders, the fortress was burned.  The remains of this rampart are still preserved. </p><h2>  Chernoostrovsky monastery </h2>

    <p>  Not far from the ancient settlement, on the banks of the Yaroslavka River, surrounded by magnificent gardens, is the Nikolsky Chernoostrovsky Monastery.  It was founded at the end of the 16th century.  In those days, it occupied only one of the hills, which was covered with a dense and impenetrable "black" forest.  Hence the name went - Chernoostrovsky.  This is the first version regarding the foundation of the monastery. </p><p>  According to the second, it was erected by the <span>princes Obolensky</span> in the 14th century on a mountain that was formerly called Black Ostrog.  In ancient chronicles, the monastery was called Black-Ostrog Monastery.  Later the name acquired a modern sound.  In the 17th century the monastery was destroyed, but in the second half of the 17th century it was restored by the old man Ipatius.  In 1775, he became a parish church. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The monastery was revived in 1800 thanks to the merchant Tselibeyev, who donated 20 thousand rubles (a huge sum at that time) for the maintenance of the fraternity. </p><p>  In 1812, the legendary Maloyaroslavets battle with the army of Napoleon took place under the walls of the monastery.  As a result, the temple was destroyed, property was looted.  The surviving remains were re-consecrated in 1813, and its restoration began. </p><p>  The monastery lasted safely until 1918, until the Bolsheviks closed it.  Ancient acts and letters, priceless icons, church vessels, and the richest sacristy disappeared from it without a trace. </p><p>  In the mid-twenties, all the monks left the monastery.  After that, a pedagogical college was placed in the building.  In 1991, the monastery was transferred to the Kaluga diocese.  Divine services and the new life of the monastery began on October 4, 1992. </p><h2>  The revival of the monastery </h2>

    <p>  In recent years, large-scale restoration, construction and repair work has been carried out here.  The bishop, sister and refectory buildings, a hotel for pilgrims were rebuilt again, vegetable growers and flower beds were arranged.  In the former ascribed chapel is a museum with a diorama of the battle of 1812. </p><h2>  Manor in Vorobevo </h2><p>  Fans of antiquity have always been attracted to the small town of Maloyaroslavets.  Its sights are of great historical value.  In 1897, a promising St. Petersburg surgeon S.P. Fedorov purchased land from the village of Vorobyevo and began to build a church parish school and outpatient clinic for the peasants. </p><p>  The engineer from Sweden, Gunnar Swenson, who worked as a construction consultant for the Embassy of Sweden at that time, developed the project for this estate.  Many details of the building are made in the Art Nouveau style, popular in those years in Europe.  The estate "Vorobyevo" is surrounded by a magnificent <span>orchard, a</span> shady square.  On its territory there is a greenhouse and a park with ponds. </p><p>  All the facades of this mansard with attic are individual.  They have successfully used various types of textures and finishes - completely smooth surfaces, plastered, finished with ceramic tiles.  The composition is complicated by a corner tower, balconies, terraces and ledges.  A special role is played by windows of various shapes.  From 1945 to the present day, a sanatorium is located on the estate. </p><p>  The estate "Vorobievo" has become an administrative building.  There is also a museum of its history. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maloyaroslavets attractions photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/477906.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Monument of fame </h2><p>  Famous for its military events Maloyaroslavets.  Sights regarding the exploits of compatriots of different times, he keeps very reverently.  This also applies to the Monument of Glory, built by decree of Nicholas I at the beginning of the 19th century in memory of the soldiers who died during the battle with Napoleon. </p><p>  All cast-iron elements were cast at the Alexander Foundry in St. Petersburg.  In August 1844, a monument was laid to the soldiers who glorified Maloyaroslavets.  Sights (photos of which you see in this article) are endlessly dear to the townspeople.  Of course, because they tell about the heroic story of their great-grandfathers. </p><h2>  Maloyaroslavets: attractions, reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited this city speak very flatteringly of it.  First of all, everyone is struck by its extraordinary purity.  And this applies not only to streets and squares, impeccable cleanliness reigns in hotel rooms.  Special thanks to the hotel staff.  Everyone works professionally, unobtrusively and at the same time everyone is welcoming and friendly. </p><p>  Tourists are greatly impressed by the monuments dedicated to the heroes of World War II, especially the museum-diorama "Battle of Maloyaroslavets," which is located in the chapel of the monastery. </p><p>  Many note an extraordinary sensation when visiting an ancient settlement.  This is probably due to the professionalism of local guides who can transfer their listeners several centuries ago. </p><p>  Some guests of the city note some neglect of the territory of the Vorobyevo estate, which spoils the impression of visiting this wonderful monument. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="maloyaroslavets attractions photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/477907.jpg" width="600"></div>
