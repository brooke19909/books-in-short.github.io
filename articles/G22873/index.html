    <h2>  Comments of Russians about the number of rooms and the location of the hotel </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of travelers, the rooms in this hotel are pleasantly decorated, quite spacious and equipped with everything necessary.  If, after checking in, you do not like the apartments offered, you can always ask the administrator to offer you a different room (for example, if you did not like the view from the window or is too noisy).  As a rule, such requests are quickly granted.  Many tourists note the fact that bathrooms have fairly small showers.  However, according to them, this is not uncommon for European hotels, and this option of a shower cabin is much better than a simple shower tray, which is quite common in hotels in Spain and neighboring countries. </p><p>  The guests liked the location of Playa Santa Ponsa 3 *.  Guest reviews indicate that the hotel is in a very pleasant quiet location surrounded by beautiful nature.  You can reach the sea in three minutes, and along the way you pass along an alley with parrots, which causes a storm of delight not only in children but also in adults.  Also in the vicinity of the hotel there are many restaurants and shops.  A few dozen meters from Playa Santa Ponsa there is a bus stop with links to neighboring towns. </p>
