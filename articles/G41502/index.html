Many are interested in the question of what kind of life path Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev took (biography), where he was actually born. </p><p>  Its small homeland is the city of Gakh, from where the family subsequently moved to Tolyatti (Samara Region).  Date of birth - July 11, 1991. Father - a self-taught musician who inherited talent from his grandfather Elbrus.  He plays folk instruments and introduced his son to his favorite pastime from 4 years old.  The boy was bought a synthesizer, which he mastered on his own.  The author of his own tunes, Dzhanmirzoev is unfamiliar with musical notation. </p><p>  Since childhood, the young man was fond of boxing, considering sport his main destination.  From the age of 16 he composed music, but did not show his works to others.  Already a student at the law faculty of Togliatti University, Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev (a biography is known from the interview) fell in love for the first time and wrote the song ‚ÄúBrown Eyes‚Äù, publishing it for VKontakte friends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Success </h2><p>  This happened in 2010, which became the year of the beginning of his musical career.  After putting the song on the Network, the young man suddenly heard it in one of the cafes.  The melody went ‚Äúto the people‚Äù, falling in love with the audience and leading the charts on the Internet.  The first success inspired the novice performer, and he decided to tour.  The producer Kemran Amirov appeared in his life.  The first city where Elbrus performed successfully was Rostov.  Today, he identifies three favorite settlements: Togliatti, where he spent his youth, Krasnodar, which became a residence, and Rostov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev, biography and photos" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1610869.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev, whose biography in art is just beginning, in 2013 was at the peak of popularity, without official awards and television broadcasts.  This is achieved thanks to: </p><ul><li>  Amazing hard work.  Despite the busy touring schedule, he continues to write songs on the road. </li><li>  Great charm and sincerity.  Each new song is like another love confession. </li><li>  The ability to collaborate.  The duet with Alexandros Tsopozidis and co-authorship with Mushfik Damirov (‚ÄúMom‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnchanters‚Äù, ‚ÄúPoor Gods‚Äù) are a real decoration of his work. </li></ul><p>  For most music lovers, he is the author of the main hit - the song ‚ÄúTramp‚Äù, without which not a single eastern wedding in the country can do. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Singer Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev: biography and personal life </h2><p>  It is known that a young man is not married.  Although on his page there is a photograph of a girl with a very important comment: "My everything."  The question of personal life is constantly raised at press conferences.  The upbringing of the young man is such that he can only associate his future with a girl who professes Islam.  This increases the chances of oriental beauties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev, biography and personal life" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40637/1610856.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the meantime, information in the press indicates that the young man is still young and often becomes the subject of scandalous chronicle. </p><h2>  Scandals </h2><p>  In 2015, Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev, whose biography is full of scandalous events, was detained at the Samara airport.  During a personal search, an artist was found to have a cartridge (7.62 mm caliber).  There was no criminal prosecution, because in the explanatory singer referred to an accidental find. </p><p>  In December of the same year, he became the culprit of the accident.  Having no driver‚Äôs license, Dzhanmirzoev drove a foreign car.  At great speed, his car crashed into a truck on the highway near Armavir.  The musician was seriously injured, and his passenger - 34-year-old producer Amirov - died.  Fans were worried not only about the artist‚Äôs health, but also about his fate.  Elbrus Dzhanmirzoev, whose biography could seriously change, appeared in court.  He was facing serious punishment.  Fortunately, the case was closed at the request of the victim's relatives. </p><p>  Fate gave the young performer a chance to continue his creative activity, delighting the audience. </p>
