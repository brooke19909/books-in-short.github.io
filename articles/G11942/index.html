    <p>  Sources of working capital are divided into attracted, borrowed and own.  The main role belongs to the latter.  They take part in the circulation of funds due to the fact that organizations whose activities are based on commercial calculation must have specific independence (property and operational).  This is necessary in order not only to conduct business economically, but also to bear full responsibility for all decisions made. </p><p>  The structure of fixed assets includes production and non-production assets.  The first function during the production process.  They take a permanent part in it and transfer their value to the finished product.  Non-production funds are used to service the production process.  They do not participate directly in the process and do not transfer their value to the goods. </p><p>  The formation of resources is carried out at the moment when the authorized capital is created during the creation of the enterprise.  Sources of <span>working capital</span> formation in this case are investment funds of all founders.  In the process of replenishment is carried out using the profit. </p><p>  Sources of working capital formation can be stable liabilities.  They do not belong to the enterprise.  At the same time, stable liabilities in the organization‚Äôs turnover are constant and serve as sources of funds in the form of the sum of their minimum balance.  These include: </p><p>  1. The minimum wage arrears to employees, passing from month to month. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Provisions to cover foreseen expenses. </p><p>  3. Transferring balances of the consumer fund. </p><p>  4. Minimum carry-over debt to extra-budgetary funds and the budget. </p><p>  5. Received in the form of an advance payment of creditors. </p><p>  6. Collateral funds of buyers for returnable packaging. </p><ol></ol><p>  It is advisable to attract borrowed sources of working capital formation to reduce the total economic need for them (means of turnover).  Along with this, stimulation of more efficient use of resources is provided. </p><p>  Borrowings include, as a rule, bank loans for short periods.  Borrowed resources make it possible to satisfy temporary, additional arising needs.  Among the main areas of attracting loans in order to create working capital should be highlighted: </p><p>  1. Lending to stocks of materials, raw materials and costs associated with the seasonal production process. </p><p>  2. Carrying out calculations, mediation of the turnover of payments. </p><p>  3. Short-term replenishment of the deficit of own resources. </p><ol></ol><p>  As practice shows, <span>borrowed funds</span> in the <span>form of loans</span> are used more efficiently than the <span>company's own means of</span> turnover.  This is due to the fact that loans cycle faster, have a purpose.  In addition, these funds are issued for a clearly defined period and are accompanied by the payment of bank interest.  These circumstances prompt the organization to provide constant control over the process of movement of credit resources, as well as the effectiveness of their application. </p><p>  It should be noted that borrowed funds can represent not only short-term bank loans, but also <span>payables.</span>  Other attracted resources also fall into this category - reserves temporarily not used for their intended purpose, fund balances. </p><p>  If the company in the process of implementing the planned production program has a lower actual amount of working capital than the planned need for them, there is a release of working capital. </p>
