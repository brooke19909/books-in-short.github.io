This smartphone is given a special place in the line of Nokia devices.  In fact, this is the second smartphone of the company that runs on the Symbian operating system. </p><p>  The device has a lower cost compared to the <span>Nokia N8,</span> and therefore the demand for it is expected to be much greater than for the first smartphone with Symbian.  Comparing these two models, you will not find significant differences in performance and filling in general, but the phone‚Äôs case is different, and the price is lower.  It is due to this sale that the models are expected to be much more promising. </p><p>  The manufacturer positions the device as a touch phone that is suitable for everyday use. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  Appearance - this is what is one of the trump cards ‚ÄúNokia C7‚Äù.  The characteristic given to the smartphone by users indicates that the move with an unusual design was a success.  This mixture of typical company design and the design of Korean devices is quite attractive, there is nothing more to say. </p><p>  Looking at the photo of the smartphone, you are unlikely to understand what it is about.  In fact, from the first seconds of real work with the device, it becomes clear that it lies comfortably and securely in the hand. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2>

    <p>  The size of the Nokia S7, the performance characteristics of which will be given a few points below, in all three planes gives the following picture: the height of the smartphone is 117.3 mm, the width is 56.8 mm, and the thickness is 10.5 mm.  Well, the thickness of the apparatus has caused constant debate.  On the one hand, it is not so big, but on the other hand, the device is still far from a <span>thin smartphone</span> .  However, even with such dimensions, the phone, as mentioned earlier, lies comfortably and reliably in the hand, while using it does not cause any problems to the owner. </p><h2>  Color schemes </h2><p>  On the market, this smartphone is available in three colors.  The first is silver, the second is brown-red, the third is dark gray.  In all color solutions, the <span>appearance of the</span> device stands out from the Nokia S7.  The characteristic, however, suggests that most buyers buy red-brown devices for girls.  However, there are universal options.  For example, ‚ÄúNokia S7‚Äù is black, which will be a great choice for any user, regardless of gender and age. </p><h2>  A look from all sides </h2><p>  The front panel accommodates the <span>front camera,</span> with which you can make video calls.  Sensors are located next to it, including proximity and light. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Using the keys located on the front side, you can make a call, as well as cancel it.  In addition, the menu button is also located there.  The keys are made mechanical, which is an obvious plus of the device. </p><p>  On the right panel there is a phone lock lever, as well as buttons for adjusting the volume of sound modes and the volume of music being played, camera control. </p><p>  By tradition, on the upper edge there is a jack for a wired headset of 3.5 mm standard, as well as a MicroUSB connector.  On the right <span>side panel</span> there is an input for the charger. </p><p>  On the back of the device is a speaker that provides hands-free calling.  Next to it is a camera module (which, by the way, has a resolution of 8 megapixels), as well as an LED flash.  Unfortunately, there is no autofocus on the Nokia S7 camera.  The characteristic given by the manufacturer confirms this fact.  However, we will talk about the camera later, and now we are talking about design. </p><p>  If you remove the back cover, you can immediately notice the SIM card slot.  The user can always replace the card without resorting to removing the battery.  But even in this case, the phone will automatically restart.  It is precisely because of this difference between the ways to replace SIM cards as such. </p><h2>  Assembly </h2>

    <p>  This option does not involve long conversations.  The device is assembled efficiently, without any problems.  If the phone is often placed down to the speaker of the front surface, this element will be erased.  Rather, not the speaker itself, but its design.  The manufacturer did not give any comments on the speaker, therefore, we assume that this is simply a <span>"military secret."</span> </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  The screen resolution of this device is 640 by 360 pixels.  The diagonal of the display is 3.5 inches.  The display is covered with glass.  Manufacturing technology allows the screen to produce colors in 16 million colors, which is the norm today. </p><p>  There are no differences between the screens of the first and second Symbian smartphones (we are talking about the N8 and C7, respectively).  All the same type of AMOLED, all the same screen provider (Samsung), all the same color rendering.  In the manufacture of this display, Clear Black technology was not applied, which is designed to polarize light. </p><p>  Typically, about 15-16 text lines can be displayed.  The font size can be selected in the settings, there are a total of 3. It is quite possible to read text from the screen in natural light, here there are no complaints against the manufacturer. </p><p>  The phone has a built-in light indicator.  Adjusting the backlight due to its work is carried out in automatic mode.  It is not possible to adjust the level manually; the software does not provide such an opportunity to the user.  Generally speaking, the middle screen, without ‚Äúbells and whistles,‚Äù but also without critical flaws. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúNokia S7 01‚Äù: memory characteristic </h2>

    <p>  The long-term memory built into the device has a capacity of 8 GB.  For some money, the user can buy a cover for ‚ÄúNokia S7‚Äù, as well as a memory card, the maximum size of which is supported up to 32 GB.  The flash drive must be of microSD type.  The slot, as for SIM cards, is located inside the phone.  To install the drive, you must remove the back cover. </p><p>  The RAM built into the phone is 256 MB.  It was expected that such an increase would be a breakthrough in the field of increasing the speed of the device, as well as its stability.  Well, we managed to increase the speed.  But with the stability of the operating system, as well as software, problems are still observed, despite doubling the ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The battery capacity of the device is 1200 mAh.  In standby mode, the phone can function for almost 400 hours, or to be more precise, 380. At the same time, it is able to work in talk mode until noon.  You can play the video up to 7 hours, listen to music - up to 50 hours, record video - up to 4 hours. </p><p>  In what, in terms of battery life, the differences between the C7 and N8 are very noticeable.  And clearly not in favor of the latest model.  But even with this turn of events, it is unlikely that it will be possible to get the smartphone to work for more than 2 days without recharging. </p><p>  Many competitors who are in the same price category with this device ‚Äúlive‚Äù for no more than a day, and this favorably distinguishes the ‚ÄúNokia S7‚Äù.  The largest percentage of charge is absorbed by the desktop, on which, as you know, there are enough widgets. </p><p>  You can spend even more charge when surfing the Internet.  The maximum brightness installed on the device will reduce the time of its possible operation by 20 percent.  From an electric network the phone is charged a little less than 2 hours. </p><h2>  Phone ‚ÄúNokia S7‚Äù: performance characteristic </h2><p>  Much can be said about the performance of the device.  This is not a gaming smartphone, definitely.  As the processor installed ARM11.  It operates at a frequency of 680 MHz. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the model indicate that the device will be a good acquisition for ordinary users.  That is, using the phone as a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù and a means of exchanging text messages is quite possible.  However, nothing more.  Buyers of the device also note that Nokia S7 will give the necessary experience to people who just stop using push-button telephones and switch to touch devices. </p>
