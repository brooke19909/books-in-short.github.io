    <p>  Spiral weaving begins with the preparation of newspaper tubes.  For any crafts, you need to wind them up as much as possible, because if you continue your work, they will be useful to you in the future: </p><ol><li>  So, we take the newspaper, cut it with a clerical knife into 4 or 2 equal parts (it depends on the required thickness) and make blanks. </li><li>  We begin to twist the cut sheets into thin tubes at an angle of 30 ¬∞.  To do this, you can use a thin rod from the handle. </li><li>  Twisting starts from any angle.  By the way, many use a knitting needle or a skewer for twisting.  At the end, we fix the tip of the newspaper with glue. </li></ol><p>  It is worth remembering one important rule - the tube should be twisted so that one end remains thin, and the other gradually expands.  This is necessary so that during the weaving process it is possible to increase the tube by inserting a thin one into the wide edge, having previously lubricated it a little with glue. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Do not try to immediately increase the workpieces by a meter length when weaving from newspaper tubes.  Spiral weaving in this case will be uncomfortable.  Better add length gradually.  As soon as you run out of tubule, smear quite a bit of glue on one of its ends, insert into the other and gently press.  And after 20-30 seconds you can continue weaving newspaper tubes. </p><p>  Spiral weaving is best done using the base.  It can be anything.  For example, for vases it is better to use an ordinary plastic bottle, and for stability, you can simply type water into it.  In this case, you need to braid as tightly as possible to the base. </p><p>  After the product is ready, it must be painted.  You can do this with anything, even enamel.  You can leave the product white, but for durability it should be varnished.  In these cases, any varnish for wood surfaces can be used.  It provides the product with strength and durability, and practically equates it to wooden baskets.  Many use varnish as the main stage of painting, simply adding the necessary shade to it.  The colors are original, and in addition, it saves time. </p><p>  If you want to use weaving from newspaper tubes (spiral weaving), having previously painted the parts, then it is best to try with a few of them first.  Since it is possible at the time of staining the tubes will become soft, and it will just be uncomfortable to work with them. </p><h2>  Making a newspaper wreath </h2>

For this, a spray can of varnish or shaving foam can be used.  It is braided as follows: </p><ol><li>  We cross two newspaper tubes on the table and add one more at a time, so that we get the appearance of a snowflake with 8 ends. </li><li>  In the middle of the snowflakes we place our base and begin to braid the cylinder.  We take one end of any tube (the whole spiral weaving construction starts from it) and, braiding the end of the adjacent newspaper tube on the right side, we lower it down.  We do the first couple of rows very carefully, since the design is not strong.  With your right hand it is worth weaving, and with your left hand tightly press the structure to the surface. </li><li>  With the braided end, we wrap the subsequent tube on the right side.  We perform such actions with all the tubes until they end.  If you see that you do not have enough length for the subsequent bend, increase it as we advised earlier. </li></ol><p>  How long to make a cylinder, see for yourself.  If you do not have enough height of the base, then just pull it out gradually from the braiding. </p><p>  To make a wreath of newspaper tubes with spiral weaving, after reaching the required length, connect it in a circle.  To do this, glue with the help of hot glue the bottom of the structure with the top.  After fixing, cut off the unnecessary ends with scissors.  By the way, many instead of hot glue use wire or thick threads.  Do not forget to varnish the wreath and decorate to your liking. </p><h2>  Spiral weaving from newspaper tubes: vases </h2>

    <p>  Vases are woven like a wreath.  As a basis, you can use any glass vessel or vase.  For stability, they must be filled with water.  For the base we use 3 tubes, we lay them out, crossing each other.  Leave the ends at an equal distance from each other and begin to braid like a wreath, tightly pressing the weaving structure to the base.  To the top, the product can be narrowed or expanded. </p><p>  The finished product can be painted and varnished.  This option will look original with beautiful wildflowers. </p><h2>  Christmas tree background </h2><p>  Finally, about how the simplest product is made - a Christmas tree made of newspaper tubes.  Spiral weaving in this case is similar to a vase and a wreath.  For the base, a cone is taken and is also braided. </p>

    <p>  To do this, take 4 tubes from the newspaper.  They can be glued together with hot glue between each other and phased in a conical shape.  And at the end of the work, fix the tips with glue and paint the finished Christmas tree in green. </p><p>  Decorate all finished work.  For this, you can use decoupage options.  Apply embroidery, ribbons and more.  Imagine, and your work will be unique! </p>
