    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Once the Cosmos camp (Samara) belonged to the large Strommashin plant, which built it in 1963.  Since 2000, it has become privately owned and operates on the basis of its own Charter.  Belongs to Fairy Valley LLC.  Its capacity is impressive: at the same time, 300 children can heal in the winter and 630 in the summer. Three-story buildings for living are made of brick, children are accommodated in rooms for 4-6 people.  All amenities are located directly in the rooms. </p><p>  Successfully located the camp.  It was built at a distance of 40 km from the metropolis, in an ecologically clean area - a pine forest.  The Kondurcha River flows nearby, where in the summertime children swim.  This is a favorite vacation spot for citizens on hot summer days. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Throughout the year, 13 races are organized.  Duration of shifts in summer is 21 days, in winter - 24, as children must have time to fully undergo a course of wellness treatment.  On school days, mini-rides for 6 days are available. </p>

Samara children can take advantage of the privilege - once a year (except for the summer months) in the framework of the regional program receive a ticket for free.  To do this, you should contact the regional branch of the "Family" center at the place of residence with an official statement and a package of documents: </p><ul><li>  passport and birth certificate of children; </li><li>  a certificate of family composition; </li><li>  medical report on the need of a minor in preventive treatment. </li></ul><p>  Vouchers are allocated in order of priority.  The sanatorium card is provided directly to the Cosmos 2 camp.  Minor children from 6 to 17 years are accepted for recovery.  During the academic year, two race options are provided: a whole class with school teachers who carry out the learning process on their own;  individually.  For the latter, the camp administration organizes training with the help of qualified specialists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews of children and parents </h2><p>  Earlier it was possible to meet many negative statements.  All of them were connected with the quality of the water coming from the taps, which was not only impossible to drink, but also with fear it was worth brushing her teeth or washing her face.  In recent years, water quality has been taken under special control; an artesian well has been dug.  Some parents complain that in summer there is no mass delivery of children to the camp.  There are those who are dissatisfied with the staff.  But everyone recognizes that the creation of the official website has feedback.  The administration of the Cosmos camp is working through all the appeals of citizens and taking timely measures.  The site has extremely positive reviews from those who are grateful to the staff for the health of children.  Parents emphasize their constant employment, the availability of lounges on the floors. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  DOL is located in the Krasnoyarsk region, the village of Fried Bugor.  You should get on the highway Samara-Ulyanovsk.  The site provides a detailed map of the location.  There are special signs on the track.  The camp occupies a closed recreational area, access to which is possible only by special passes or a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  A round-the-clock patrol is carried out by a private security company. </p>
