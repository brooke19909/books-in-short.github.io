There, priests read a prayer and throw a cross into the sea.  After the men are offered to get it from the seabed.  And the most desperate agree to participate in the competition.  Anyone who manages to get a cross from the depths of the sea, is proclaimed <span>king of water</span> triumph.  At the water festival, none of those present remains dry.  Water on this day is a symbol of purification, therefore, every participant in the ceremony should take a bath.  After the "water procedures" walks continue on the coast.  The festive program includes concerts, fun contests, dances.  Guests are offered to try Cypriot sweets and delicious national dishes. </p><h2>  Cyprus Hotels </h2><p>  On the island, vacationers can enjoy both economy class hotels and VIP apartments.
