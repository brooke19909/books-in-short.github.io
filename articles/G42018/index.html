    <p>  Since Soviet times, women considered large curls to be the most beautiful hairdo, for their creation they suffered uncomfortable curlers, on which they had to sleep in order to acquire the desired appearance in the morning.  The curlers at that time were sticks; they could be thick or thin.  Strands were wound on them and secured with an elastic band.  But over time, progress has touched this area of ‚Äã‚Äãbeauty.  In the middle of the 20th century, electric curlers appeared, the reviews of which made up the essence of the material described below. </p><p>  <strong>Advantages and disadvantages</strong> </p><p>  New hair styling devices, created using modern technology and taking into account the safety of use, help to make the hair more stable and beautiful.  There is one caveat: in order not to harm yourself, it is better not to use them every day.  Indeed, due to the effects of electricity and high temperature, the hair becomes thinner, their structure is weakened.  In the end, they will lose their shine, the <span>ends</span> will begin to <span>split, the hair</span> will be dull and brittle. </p><p>  Having studied what consumer reviews say about electric curlers, it can be noted that these devices have undoubted advantages.  The predecessors of electric were thermal curlers.  Before use, they needed to be ‚Äúboiled‚Äù in water for several minutes and monitored so that they did not overheat.  In addition, hot curlers were difficult to wind on the hair, because they were not covered with thermal insulation. </p><p>  <span>Electric curlers are free</span> from such drawbacks.  They are sold in a special box, which serves to heat them (when connecting it to the network).  Moreover, overheating is excluded.  In addition, electric hair curlers have heat-insulating edges, which allows you to burn your hair curls without fear and experiment in creating hairstyles.  There are sets of electric curlers with ceramic protection, which protects against high temperature and allows you to do more gentle styling.  And also they are found with velor coating. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Women who have purchased electric curlers, leave positive reviews.  They share styling methods and advise which curlers are best to buy.  In order to do the styling, they must be heated, for which three to five minutes are enough.  After 5 minutes, you can already begin to form curls.  Curlers cool slowly and therefore help to create firm curls.  It takes about half an hour to lay.  But due to prolonged exposure to the hair, it may be weakened and damaged, so you should treat them with special attention.  Due to the fact that the set contains curlers of various sizes and diameters, you can create hairstyles to your liking. </p><p>  Customers who have purchased Babyliss electric curlers are simply thrilled.  They note that these devices for creating curls meet all their requirements.  They quickly heat up, have a velor coating and all curlers in a set (there are 12 of them) of the same diameter.  In addition to them, the set includes twelve studs and clamps ("crabs").  There is a heating indicator that changes color when the temperature rises.  The result is excellent curls in forty minutes.  Moreover, as one of the consumers noted, the curls that turned out after using the electric curler are not afraid of either rain or wind.  They hold on in any weather! </p><p>  Responses to the use of Valera electric curlers are also enthusiastic.  Women report having found the most convenient hair styling method that far surpasses the use of thermal hair curlers.  The result is wonderful curls, beautiful waves and volume lasts all day. </p><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that electric curlers, reviews of which are so positive, must be used, observing some rules.  For example, they should not be used if hairspray is left on the hair.  And it is necessary before applying curls to the hair to apply thermal protection. </p>
