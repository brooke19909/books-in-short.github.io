Domostroy: author, year of creation, summary</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A unique cultural monument has remained contemporaries from the inhabitants of ancient Russia.  Compiled in the 16th century, the book was the only right guide not only for those who are building a house.  She was taken as a basis in matters of <span>creating a family</span> and housekeeping.  What is Domostroy, what was it for our ancestors, and what is its significance for historians?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Encyclopedia <span>of household of</span> ancient Russia </h2><p>  "Domostroy" is a set of rules and tips for every day.  He combined the spiritual and the secular.  No wonder <span>this book</span> became the first "Encyclopedia of household" - this is what "Domostroy" is. </p><p>  In addition to advice and recommendations, it presented the rules for ritual ceremonies.  Weddings, festivities, and daily activities should be consistent with this book. </p><p>  Some foreigners are mistakenly convinced that the contents of Domostroi are known to all residents of Russia without exception. </p><h2>  The emergence of "Domostroy" </h2><p>  In the 16th century, the number of handwritten books increased.  They were very valuable.  Instead of parchment, paper began to be used with success, which was delivered to Russia from Europe.  Therefore, the creation of "Domostroi" could be both in manuscript and in print.  Some researchers report two versions of the old encyclopedia.  One of them has a very ancient syllable, strict, but correct and wise.  And the second one is crammed with tough and strange orders. </p><p>  Domostroy appeared (the year of creation is not known for certain) in the first half of the 16th century in Veliky Novgorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The predecessors were such Slavic collections with teachings and recommendations as ‚ÄúZlatoust‚Äù, ‚ÄúIzmaragd‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolden Chain‚Äù. </p><p>  In Domostroy, all previously printed knowledge and norms were generalized.  Exploring Monomakh's ‚ÄúPrecepts‚Äù, you can find a lot in common in the rules of moral behavior of different eras. </p><h2>  Who owns the authorship? </h2>

Some researchers are sure that the author of Domostroi is the confessor of Ivan the Terrible - Archpriest Sylvester.  He created a book to instruct the king.  Others believe that Sylvester just rewrote Domostroy in the mid-16th century.

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  It is worth examining the contents of this book on households in order to understand what it obligated to and why it was so revered by the church.  If we take as a basis the creation of Sylvester, it has a preface, a message from son to father and almost 70 (more precisely 67) chapters.  They were reunited in the main sections devoted to the spiritual, worldly, family, cooking. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Almost all chapters are closely connected with Christian rules and commandments.  After the ‚Äúorder of the father to the son,‚Äù the next chapter tells how Christians can correctly believe in the Holy Trinity and the Most Holy Theotokos.  It says how to worship holy relics and holy powers. </p><p>  The author of Domostroi tells readers in detail how to make obeisances, be baptized, receive communion, and use the prosphora.  What is forbidden to do in the temple. </p><p>  Great importance in the book is paid to the veneration of the king and every ruler, which combined the significance for the people of the church and the ruler. </p><h2>  Father's instruction to son </h2><p>  I would like to get acquainted with the book ‚ÄúDomostroy‚Äù, the brief content of which is described above, in a little more detail. </p>

Turning to his son, he first of all blesses him.  Then he instructs his son, his wife and children to live according to Christian laws, with truth and a clear conscience, believing and obeying the commandments of God.  The father gives these lines to his son and his household and emphasizes: "if you do not accept this scripture, you will answer for yourself on the Day of Judgment."

    <p>  Majesty, wisdom and pride are embedded in it.  Such instructions would be relevant at any time.  After all, all parents wish their children good, they want to see them as honest, merciful and worthy people.  Modern youth often do not hear such phrases from their fathers and mothers.  And ‚ÄúDomostroy‚Äù, the year of creation of which fell on the period of special reverence for God, put everything in its place.  This is the law to be followed, and that‚Äôs the point.  He was not questioned.  He put all family members on their ‚Äústeps‚Äù, determined the relationship between them and, most importantly, united them.  This is what Domostroy is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Honoring and Obeying Father and Mother </h2>

    <p>  All children must love father and mother, obey them, honor their old age and obey them in everything.  Those who disobey are in for a curse and excommunication.  And there is nothing to fear for children who give obedience to father and mother - they will live in goodness and without adversity. </p><p>  The chapter is filled with wisdom, respect for the individual.  It recalls the inseparability of the future and the past, that honoring parents is the strength of the whole society.  Unfortunately, this is not being promoted now as truth and norm.  Parents have lost authority for their children. </p><h2>  About needlework </h2><p>  In those days, honest work was highly esteemed.  Therefore, the rules of "Domostroi" concerned the conscientious and high-quality execution of any work. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="homebuilding summary" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/631590.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who lie, work dishonestly, steal, do no good for the good of society indulged in condemnation.  Before the beginning of any work, it was required to cross himself and ask for blessings from the Lord, and bow three times to the holy land.  All needlework (cooking, stocking up, handicraft) must begin with clean thoughts and washed hands. </p><p>  Everything that is done with pure thoughts and desire will benefit people.

Of course, this was due to the fact that the revolutionaries opposed religious propaganda and everything connected with it.  Therefore, Domostroy could not be approved by the new government.  The struggle against autocracy and serfdom (supported by the church) prohibited the mention of religion and Orthodoxy.

    <p>  In any literature, the authors of that time brought to the reader the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãatheism.  Of course, a book with teachings on veneration of priests and monks, their spiritual fathers, service to the king and all rulers could not be allowed in any case. </p><p>  Such a struggle with religion for many decades did not have a favorable effect on the morality of modern society. </p><h2>  Educational value </h2><p>  Despite the mention in the book of such words as ‚Äúthe final judgment‚Äù, ‚Äúdemon‚Äù, ‚Äúcrafty‚Äù, all these commandments could now become a good guide to everyday actions.  Given the fact that ‚Äúlaws are not written‚Äù for modern residents of Russia, it is not possible to rely on a set of generally accepted rules. </p><p>  Manners of behavior are developed on the basis of moral standards laid down by parents, school, and society.  This is not always given due attention.  Not to mention that any rules should be accepted by everyone for daily use.  The church has ceased to be taken so seriously by people to honor all the divine commandments. </p><p>  Now many works are rethought and take on a new meaning.  Works that are rejected, condemned, recognized as brilliant and talented.  "Domostroy" is one of such unique creations that carry a lot of valuable practical advice for every day for the modern family, the younger generation and all people.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe book is to educate children from the very first days, direct the child to good deeds and the manifestation of goodness in all his actions.  Isn't this what is so lacking now in our society, full of lies, hypocrisy, envy, anger and aggression? </p><h2>  Historical meaning </h2><p>  Thanks to the appearance of this book, today we can get information about the life and life of people of that time.  "Domostroy" was written for a wide range of readers, for people of different social status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="house building rules" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/631593.jpg" width="600"></div>  This guide is for the military, clerks, servicemen, and all the townspeople who have a family and create their hearth.  Regardless of whether the book reflects real life or is the rule for creating an ideal life, it has great historical significance for people living in Russia.  Researchers study the leisure, cultural and intellectual life of the population of Russia in the 16th century.  Although, while such entertainment did not exist at all, as the church condemned and forbade any entertainment.  What is Domostroy for historians?  This is important information about privacy, family values, religious rules, traditions and laws of everyday life in a Russian family of that time.
