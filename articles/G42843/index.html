Craving for everything secret has always been a hallmark of the human race.  Actually, because of this, the first people were expelled from paradise.  Even today, despite the age of smart cars and high technology, people's interest in everything supernatural does not wane. </p><h2>  Fenugreek </h2><p>  Shambhala is a country that supposedly exists in Tibet or in another region of Asia.  According to legend, only the chosen one can find her, for the gaze of which she will open.  Shambhala is mentioned in a number of ancient texts, which suggests that there is no smoke without fire.  To prove or refute the existence of a mythical country from a scientific point of view is not possible. </p><h2>  Connection with esotericism </h2><p>  The very concept of "Shambhala" is inseparable from esotericism.  Initially, this ancient country existed in Hinduism, and many ideas were taken from there.  Classical Hinduism linked Shambhala with the new avatar of Vishnu - Kalka, which is due to be born soon.  Over time, the concept and awareness of Shambhala has changed, but today only <span>Blavatsky has</span> managed to at least partially reflect the concept of a wonderful place <span>.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rigden japo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1455460.jpg" width="388"></div>

Thus, it should be a territory where Vedic traditions are respected, and the society is controlled by the priests of the brahmanas.  Following this description, it can be assumed that Shambhala should be sought in the Vedic Semirechye - the place where Brahminism originated and spread to all of India. </p><h2>  Rigden Japo speculation </h2><p>  On the Internet you can find a huge amount of false information.  It talks about who Rigden Japo is, and a variety of conjectures are given.  Everything would be fine if the authors of such articles indicated that everything written was their personal speculation.  However, many people take for granted the tales of ordinary dreamers.  Unfortunately, this is very common.  A lot of false information surrounds the mystical Shambhala. </p><h2>  Where did the Horseman and Shambhala come from? </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, Shambhala was originally found in ancient Indian texts and scriptures of Tibetan sages.  But for a long time no one paid significant attention to this, since it was very difficult to objectively explain the existence of an invisible country, its purpose, functions and goals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="who is rigden japo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1454173.jpg" width="500"></div>

He is a writer, mystic, philosopher, artist and public figure from Russia.  He was born in the city on the Neva on September 27, 1874.  It is interesting that in his life he created more than 7000 paintings.  Many of them are dedicated to his vision of Rigden.  Also, his paintings are in galleries around the world.  In addition to paintings, Roerich left a rich literary heritage, including poetry.  This man also founded the Institute of Himalayan Studies and more than a dozen different cultural and educational institutions.  Nicholas was married to Helena Roerich, has two sons.  It is worth noting that he was involved in the political and economic spheres of society, had connections with the Bolsheviks and Masons. </p><h2>  Acquaintance with the Bishop </h2><p>  To date, the Rigden Japo Lord of Shambhala is described in the writings of Nicholas Roerich.  However, references to it are extremely inaccurate.  It will be very difficult for a person who is not connected with spiritual trends and is not familiar with the activity of Roerich to understand what he is talking about.  In fact, without a spiritual knowledge base, Roerich‚Äôs lines about Rigden can be perceived as fiction or a beautiful fairy tale.  For a long time, many people think so, because there is practically no real truthful information about the Lord.  The Internet was filled with false scientists, who allegedly broadcast from the lips of the Lord. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rigden japo lord of shambhala" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1455461.jpg" width="374"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Nicholas Roerich describes Rigden as the Messiah who will come to many nations.  He focuses on the fact that it does not matter what name Rigden has in a particular religion: he can be Jesus, Maitreya, White Burkhan or Muntazar - his essence is the same.  The coming of the Lord is expected in the near future - the era of Aquarius, which has already come.  The idea is that the advent of Jappo will completely change and renew the whole world. </p><h2>  Japo paintings </h2><p>  Nicholas Roerich has many paintings that are dedicated to the Lord of Shambhala.  The canvas "The Order of Rigden Japo" Roerich wrote in 1927, but scientists argue over this date, considering it possible another option - 1933.  To date, this work is stored in the Museum of Nicholas Roerich in New York.  The painting depicts the Lord, who orders his subjects to race to the human race to inform him of future changes.  People should hurry to prepare for this, because without a spiritual understanding of what is happening, the transition will not happen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rigden Japo Roerich order" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1455465.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The theme of the artist‚Äôs paintings is imbued with the fact that great changes are coming that will lay the foundation for a new world.  Rigden Japo is the messenger of these changes.  Also among the paintings dedicated to the great Djappo, one can find the canvases ‚ÄúThe Great Horseman‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Apparition of the Messiah‚Äù, ‚ÄúMiracle‚Äù, ‚ÄúKalki Avatar‚Äù, etc.  It is worth noting that each Roerich's work has a special mystical subtext, which is hidden behind a brush.  Often the author himself explains the meaning of his paintings. </p><h2>  Rigden Japo: Allatra Book </h2><p>  The book "Allatra" has become a bestseller; it transfers its knowledge to the world through writers.  It talks about the past, present and future.  The past of mankind, all accumulated experience is explained in detail and spiritually.  Much attention is also paid to the specific moment ‚Äúnow‚Äù, on which the future depends.  In ‚ÄúAllatra‚Äù you can find reflections on what awaits us in the future.  An important point is that the birth of children should not be the goal of procreation.  It is worth giving birth only for spiritual and exalted purposes, having the strength, ability and patience to educate your child everything you need. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the book is freely available on the Internet.  Anyone can download it, even by choosing the desired format.  "Allatra" is a huge encyclopedia of spiritual knowledge, which gives an answer to anyone who dares to plunge into its depths.  Reading the book allows a more versatile view of the truth, to feel it, and also to understand what is the meaning of human life. </p><h2>  Interpretation of Anastasia Novykh </h2><p>  Rigden Japo preaches through modern writer Anastasia Novykh.  Very little is known about her, on the Internet it is impossible to find information about her personal life or past.  Rigden Japo, whose Allatra is incredibly popular in certain circles where he is looking for a spiritual mentor, writes his books with the help of Anastasia Novykh.  She has already released a large number of works that more fully reveal the image of the Lord.  A feature of her works is that they are written in simple language, and everything that happens is related to real time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="namo om rigden japo" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1455464.jpg" width="426"></div>

    <p>  Anastasia Novykh is an artist and writer who does not appear publicly anywhere.  She prefers to hide her identity, so that she does not interfere with perceiving the true knowledge of Rigden.  A series of books ‚ÄúSensei.  Aboriginal Shambhala ‚Äù, which examines in detail the image of a mystical country and its ruler. </p><p>  The most significant work is Allatra, which was completed <span>on December 21,</span> 2012.  It was on this date that esotericists and mystics appointed the end of the world.  Coincidence or coup?  It is definitely impossible to answer. </p><h2>  Disputes </h2><p>  There are a lot of disputes about the identity of Anastasia Novykh and Rigden Japo.  Their essence lies in the fact that some of the ideas expressed in the main work of A. Novykh touch very sensitive issues. </p><p>  The Internet is full of debates about one idea from the book, which is that you should not give birth to children.  Many people insist on birth being meant for birth itself.  It is worth giving life to a new person only if he becomes a worthy citizen and can bring something spiritual to the world.  The birth of children (as a process of procreation) is considered stupid and meaningless.  This issue has caused heated debate.  There is no point in saying who is right and who is wrong, because each person has his own views.  However, such ideas cause great distrust among those who would like to get acquainted with the work of Anastasia Novykh. </p><h2>  Scientific Versions </h2><p>  There is no unequivocal scientific opinion about Shambhala.  The opinion of scientists is radically different.  Some do not even want to consider the idea itself, considering it a successful marketing move or just speculation of the author‚Äôs rich imagination.  Those who are interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coming of the Messiah do not have enough solid evidence to prove the truth of their arguments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rigden japo book allatra" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42901/1455463.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  The Great Horseman Rigden Japo, Lord of Shambhala, who is the spiritual author of Allatra, is considered a mythical creature in the scientific world.  It is worth looking in more detail at the book itself in order to understand by whom it could be written.  To begin with, it should be mentioned that the book is considered an example of fiction.  Despite this, it is built on the principle of "question and answer." </p><p>  The book asks quite specific questions that relate to various sciences: physics, astronomy, chemistry, etc.  But the most interesting thing is that the answers are very accurate.  Following them, we can conclude that science has much to discover.  The knowledge given in the book is far ahead of the current level of technology development.  Despite this, scientists could take note of all theories in order to develop them. </p><p>  Summing up, I want to say: "Namo Om Rigden Japo!".  Humanity is waiting for its Messiah and is ready to cross the threshold of stupidity and ignorance. </p>
