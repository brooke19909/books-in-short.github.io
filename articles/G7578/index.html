    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Already from the first lines of our article it is clear where the Midland Hotel is located.  Sheremetyevo is one of the most visited airports in the world.  Dozens of aircraft land daily here, each of which has hundreds of passengers.  All of them need the opportunity to rest, wash and tidy themselves up.  The ideal solution is a hotel located a few steps from the airport.  This is exactly what the Midland Hotel (Sheremetyevo) is.  Every 30 minutes, round-the-clock free shuttle runs between the hotel and the airport. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In just 40 minutes you can get from here to the Rechnoy Vokzal and Planernaya metro stations.  And from there, to the center of the capital is at hand.  If you consider the path from the hotel to the center of Moscow in a personal car, then you will spend time about an hour.

    <h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Near the airport is not only the Midland Hotel.  Sheremetyevo is a place where hotels can be found literally at every step.  Why is this hotel so popular?
