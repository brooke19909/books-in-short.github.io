Present times are no exception.  A favorite vacation spot for residents and guests of the capital of Russia are the Vorobyovy Gory, the address of which is not necessary to know for sure.  Reference points will be the Moscow River and Moscow State University. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparrow Hills how to get on the subway" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/580420.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  From the village of Vorobyevo </h2><p>  On the banks of the Moskva River back in the 14th century there was the village of Vorobyevo, which was owned by the boyars of the Vorobyovs.  Then it was bought by Princess Sofia Vitovtovna and presented to her grandson Yuri Vasilyevich, Prince Dmitrovsky, from whom it passed to Prince Ivan of Moscow of the Third. </p><p>  In 1949, they began to build a new building of Moscow State University.  It was completed in 1953.  The village did not fit into the new environment of the Sparrow Hills, and soon it was demolished.  Only the Trinity Church, built in the 14th century, has survived.  True, then it was wooden.  In 1811, a stone temple was erected in its place, which has survived to this day.  By the way, in Soviet times, the Vorobyovy Gory was called Lenin. </p><h2>  On a high steep shore </h2><p>  It‚Äôs even difficult to call the Sparrow Hills mountains.  Their maximum height is 220 meters.  Rather, it is a high washed bank of the river.  Rather, they will be considered one of the seven hills on which Moscow is located. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the mouth of Setuni, the Vorobyovy Gory stretches to the Andreevsky Bridge.  They are covered with forest and cut by ravines.  The forest zone of the Sparrow Hills remarkably combines the natural nature and well-being for recreation of citizens. </p><p>  When the construction of Moscow State University was completed, an observation deck was built on a steep bank of the river, from where a wonderful view of the city opens. </p><h2>  Vorobyovy Gory: how to get by metro </h2>

    <p>  There is nothing complicated in this, if only because the Vorobyovy Gory is located in relative proximity to the center of the capital. </p><p>  It is most convenient to use the services of the Moscow Metro, or rather its red line.  In the center of Moscow, you can take a seat at any of the stations: the Lenin Library (near the Kremlin) or Okhotny Ryad (near Red Square).  From the last, after 13 minutes, the train will arrive at the Vorobyovy Gory station.  How to get on the subway, now the question is clear.  It remains to add that the station is located inside the bridge across the Moscow River.  You need to go out to Kosygin street.  Already at the exit, a panorama of the Vorobyovy Gory opens before you.  Walking takes another twenty minutes. </p><h2>  Metro alternative </h2><p>  Metro is not the only way to visit the Vorobyovy Gory.  How to get in other ways?  Of course, the easiest way to go is by car, and even use the navigator.  For the destination, you can take the Church of the Holy Trinity, which will lead to the Sparrow Hills.  Address: st.  Kosygina, d. 30. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can also go by trolley.  Route number 7 will take you directly to the observation deck on the Sparrow Hills.  You can take a trolley at the Kiev station, but in general it goes to the Sparrow Hills from Victory Park.  The final stop is Kaluga Square.  However, it will take a long time to take into account the traffic in Moscow, and there is no separate lane for public transport on Kutuzovsky Prospekt. </p><p>  So there is no better way to see the Vorobyovy Gory, how to get there by metro! </p><h2>  Walking route </h2>

    <p>  You can start a walk from the building of Moscow State University.  Heading along the Alley of Scientists, you can walk directly to the observation deck.

Indeed, in the winter the Vorobyovy Gory is popular.  The address, how to get there, winter sports lovers is well aware of this information.  After all, there is a ski slope, a springboard, you can go skiing and sleigh rides. </p><h2>  Sparrow Hills Temple </h2><p>  This is one of the oldest <span>temples in Moscow,</span> which has a rich history.  And most importantly, this story has been preserved for posterity. </p><p>  At first the temple was wooden.  It is known that when the village of Vorobyevo was bought by Sofya Vitovtovna in the 15th century, it already existed. </p>

According to the project of architect Vitberg, a stone temple was built.  In 1811, a monument was erected on the site of the old one, crowning a cross.

    <p>  There is evidence that Kutuzov prayed in this church in 1812, before the famous council at Fili. </p><p>  It is also noteworthy that the Trinity Church during the years of Soviet power was not only not destroyed, but even the service continued in it and the bells rang. </p><p>  Now the Church of the Life-Giving Trinity has three chapels; worship services are constantly being sent in it. </p><h2>  St. Andrew's Monastery </h2><p>  The buildings of <span>St. Andrew's Monastery</span> are best seen from the observation deck of the Sparrow Hills, because it is located at their foot. </p><p>  There are disagreements about the time the monastery was founded, which was then called the Transfiguration Desert.  However, this is still an old institution, whether it be the 13th or 14th century. </p><p>  In the Soviet years, the monastery buildings were used as a research institute.  In 1992, they were finally returned to the church.  True, they did not begin to use them for their original purpose. </p><p>  Three churches are of interest on its territory: the Resurrection of Christ, the Apostle <span>John the Theologian</span> and the martyr Andrew Stratilates.  Since 1991, they have been the Patriarchal Compound, since 2013 it is the St. Andrew‚Äôs Monastery of Stavropegial. </p><h2>  Sparrow "Sparrow Hills" </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparrow Hills how to get" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/580419.jpg" width="550"></div></h2><p>  Walking through the park, you can go down the <span>cable car</span> to the embankment and take a boat ride along the Moscow River.  On the promenade is the pier "Sparrow Hills".  How to get there from the city center?  As well as on the Sparrow Hills themselves.  Best on the subway.  From the station of the same name, a walk to the cable car will take no more than 10 minutes. </p><p>  In the warmer months, river trams run from the Vorobevy Gory pier, a ride on which is a great pleasure.  The route passes through the center of Moscow with a U-turn at Kotelnicheskaya embankment and return to Vorobyovy Gory. </p><p>  The routes of boat trips are very diverse.  They give a good opportunity to see Moscow from a different angle and take wonderful photos of the Kremlin, Novodevichy and Novospassky monasteries and other Moscow sights. </p><h2>  To the Neskuchny Garden </h2><p>  A few years ago, the Vorobyovy Gory Reserve was attached to the <span>Central Park of</span> Culture and Rest named after  Gorky and Neskuchny garden.  The latter is a <span>landscape park that</span> has been preserved from several noble estates belonging to the Golitsyn, Orlov and Trubetskoy.  Together, all parks form a single complex. </p><p>  Neskuchny Garden has preserved many architectural monuments.  The house of Count Orlov (1796), the Stone arbor, the house with the rotunda near the Elizabethan pond, as well as various bridges over ravines, for example, a three-span stone arch bridge, are interesting. </p>
