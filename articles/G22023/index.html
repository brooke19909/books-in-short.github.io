    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The considered metro station Botanichesky Sad is one of the main metro facilities that was sharply unreasonably criticized in 2015, which arose only due to the laziness of passengers to walk extra tens of meters along the track.  This happened after replacing part of the escalators in one of the lobby of the station. </p><p>  The station opened simultaneously with the completion of the Medvedkovo-VDNH line on September 29, 1978.  This station (104th in a row) of the Moscow metro is located on the Kaluga-Riga line.  It owes its name to the Main Moscow <span>Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences</span> (the Russian Academy of Sciences), located not far from the metro, although its design names were ‚ÄúRostokinskaya‚Äù and ‚ÄúRostokino‚Äù.  On the line itself, the station was located between VDNH and Sviblovo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow: metro Botanical Garden" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1798069.jpg" width="600"></div>
