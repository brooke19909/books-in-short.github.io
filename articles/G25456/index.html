Design and modeling of clothes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The process of making clothes is exciting, and each of us can find in it a lot of interesting things for ourselves.  To make wardrobe items, design and modeling of clothes are used. </p><h2>  The process of creating clothes </h2><p>  First, clothes are modeled, and the design of clothes is the second step in its creation.  This process allows you to make a drawing of a future product and make patterns, according to which cutting will occur.  Patterns are patterns of clothing parts that are made of cardboard, paper, film, wallpaper and other materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-716720" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/716720.jpg?1552746347"></div><p>  There are differences in the design of clothing for mass and individual sewing.  For mass tailoring, the following requirements are imposed: clothing should be made according to accurate calculation, patterns should be correct.  The design of men's clothing suggests that the manufactured products will sit well on the body, will be comfortable to wear and will be easy to care for, it will sit well on the figure of a person. </p><h2>  Modeling </h2><p>  The basis for manufacturing quality garments is modeling.  This is an art that requires special knowledge, and many seek to master it. </p><p>  Designing and modeling clothes directly works with the <span>appearance of a</span> person.  It's no secret that with the help of a properly selected suit, you can significantly change the perception of the person. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-716615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/716615.jpg?1552746347"></div><p>  Modeling begins with preparation.  At this stage, the fashion designer decides who will wear this model of clothing, what it is for, what materials will be used for its manufacture.  Having decided on the answers to these questions, the artist creates a sketch. </p><p>  All sketches have certain requirements.  This is clarity and completeness, the full embodiment of artistic design.  Also, if the model will be produced in a <span>sewing enterprise,</span> it makes sense to find out how cost-effective it will be to produce.  And after that, the design of clothes begins.  This is the sequence of the creative process. </p><h2>  Clothing Design Methods </h2><p>  The creative process of creating clothes has deep roots.  It is known that the design of clothing has a long history, and over the centuries its various methods have been developed.  There are two large groups of methods for designing clothes: approximate and engineering. </p><p>  Approximate methods can also be different.  The oldest of them are considered fake, when measurements are made on the figure of a person or using a mannequin. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-716639" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27363/716639.jpg?1552746347"></div><p>  I must say that the design of clothing in our usual sense began to take shape only in the twentieth century, before that exact measurements for planting on a figure simply did not exist.  Clothing was created using folds and folds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Methods of designing clothes were developed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when London cutter Michelle came up with the first "grid" for drawings of clothes.  He applied the principle of scale: the original drawing was divided into cells with the same side, and if desired, it could be increased or decreased.  In 1840, the well-known cutting system of G. A. M√ºller arose, which used the principle of spherical trigonometry to construct a drawing. </p><p>  In 1959, the design and modeling of clothing was studied by the central experimental and technical sewing laboratory, which used the <span>calculation and analytical method.</span>  Its disadvantage is that the graphical constructions in it are cumbersome, the accuracy of the construction of the base is relative, it is difficult to choose an increase in free fit. </p><h2>  Modern design methods </h2><p>  In recent years, engineering methods have become increasingly common.  Many believe that in the future all measurements will be carried out using a 3D dummy.  Such a method will include the method of expandable surfaces, the method of split surfaces, the method of triangulation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-717450" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/717450.jpg?1552746347"></div><p>  Now for the design of clothing is widely used automated production system (CAD).  It is based on the techniques that Michael Mueller, a well-known German tailor, once developed.  Now the Lubax cut system is also used, which involves visual measurement of the figure before constructing the pattern. </p><h2>  Designing children's clothing </h2><p>  Children's clothing is designed on the same principle as adult clothing, but it requires knowledge of the physical and psychological development of the child.  Not only artists and fashion designers, but also pediatricians, educators and teachers take part in the development of the concept of children's clothing. </p><p>  When modeling and designing children's clothing, the ratio of different <span>parts of the</span> child‚Äôs <span>body is of</span> great importance.  Therefore, all children for whom clothing is created are conventionally divided into five groups. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-717448" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/8885/717448.jpg?1552746347"></div><p>  This is a nursery group (up to 3 years old), a preschool group (up to six years), a primary school group, which includes children from seven to eleven years old, and a teenage group, which includes children from twelve to fifteen years old.  There is also a youth group, which includes children from sixteen to eighteen years old. </p><p>  There are a number of requirements for children's clothing.  It should warm in the cold and cool in the heat, should protect from the weather.  Due to the fact that children quickly wear clothes, it is recommended to sew them from inexpensive materials.  Folk art is often used to create <span>children's costumes</span> ; this is an inexhaustible <span>source of inspiration</span> for fashion designers. </p><h2>  Patterns as a unit of measure </h2><p>  The main unit of measure in modeling and design is considered a pattern.  They are of the following types: patterns-originals, control and workers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-717317" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13387/717317.jpg?1552746347"></div><p>  The basis of the creation of any costume is the basic pattern.  An experienced specialist can at first glance determine the clothing manufacturer, given the quality of the base pattern.  The patterns are created taking into account all the features of the human figure. </p><p>  Now, when creating patterns, specialists turn to modern technologies, especially computers.  The use of computers in the manufacture of patterns has its advantages.  So, this is the opportunity to accurately adapt the patterns to the features of a particular <span>figure, this is the</span> opportunity to show the result of work to the client at any stage.  This kind of patterns can be used much longer than paper, they do not wear out and cannot be replaced. </p><p>  The piece, made in electronic form, makes it possible to conduct a virtual layout of the material on the fabric, which can simplify the cutting process. </p><h2>  Modeling by Burda Moden </h2><p>  Different systems for modeling and designing clothes have not helped to create clothes that are convenient for the majority of the population.  And then the magazine Burda Moden came to the aid. </p><p>  The magazine has made itself known in such a field as the design of women's clothing.  He entered the fashion arena in the aftermath of World War II.  At this time, not all women had money to buy beautiful new clothes, while everyone wanted to look stylish. </p><p>  In 1950, the magazine Burda Moden was published and immediately attracted attention.  Now it remains popular, this is due to the fact that the magazine reflects current trends in the fashion world.  Moreover, all models are adapted to real life, and you can immediately sew a model and use it. </p>
