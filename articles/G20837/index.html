Simple braids knitting needles for beginners</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All lovers of knitting must pay attention to the beauty and variety of this type of pattern, such as braids, made with knitting needles.  These patterns can look completely different.  From delicate, thin braids on baby's booties to complex, interwoven patterns of Aran knitting.  Based on the simple principle of crossing loops, a huge number of different types and patterns of knitting braids were invented. </p><h2>  Varieties of braid pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="yaas.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="An example of knitting braids" class="if uuid-2488712" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2488712.jpg"></div><p>  There are several separate types of these patterns: the braids themselves, braids and arana.  They differ not only in appearance and complexity, but also in execution technique.  But they are all united by one common nuance: when knitting according <span>to the braid scheme</span> with knitting <span>needles, the</span> loops of the pattern will necessarily intersect. </p><p>  <span>Drawings from braids</span> are dense, textured and very elegant.  They are chosen both for knitting baby clothes, and for adult models.  Recently, snood sets and caps connected with braids have been very popular. </p><h2>  The technique of knitting a braid pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.woolandthegang.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The process of knitting braids" class="if uuid-2486534" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2486534.jpg"></div><p>  When knitting different types of braids, one technique is used, the loops of the picture intersect, creating a pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To knit according to any, the most simple <span>scheme of the braid with knitting needles, you</span> need a so-called additional <span>knitting</span> needle.  In professional extra knitting needles, one end is rounded in the form of a loop, which prevents slipping of the removed loops and facilitates the work.  But if there isn‚Äôt one, but you want to try, then you can use an ordinary knitting needle or an English safety pin. </p><p>  In order for the loops of the future braid to not stretch when crossing, it is better to choose an auxiliary spoke one number less than the <span>main ones.</span> </p><p>  To <span>knit a braid with knitting needles</span> , an even number of loops are used.  This pattern will be more expressive if you tie a narrow vertical track of purl stitches along the edges of the braid (2-5 loops, depending on the width of the braid). </p><h2>  Little secrets when knitting a braid pattern </h2><p>  When calculating the consumption of yarn, it must be taken into account that the wider the braid, the more it shrinks when the loops cross, and the greater the consumption of yarn.  Another amount of yarn depends on the frequency with which the braid loops will cross: the more often, the more thread will go, and vice versa. </p><p>  If the yarn consumption is large or the fabric turns out to be too dense, you can fix this a little by making the frequency of crossing loops more rare.  In order to find the optimal combination, it is better to tie several control samples and stop at what you like. </p><p>  From thick yarn, braids are very embossed.  So that the product is not very dense, it is better to dilute them with stripes of simple patterns, such as the front surface or a small pearl pattern.  Then the beauty of the braid will be visible, and the product will turn out more soft and comfortable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If thin threads, such as mohair or cotton yarn, are used to knit braids, you can make them a continuous fabric with small dividing stripes.  The pattern is stylish and elegant. </p><h2>  Simple patterns of knitting braids </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting braids with an extra knitting needle" class="if uuid-2484998" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2484998.jpg"></div><p>  In order to learn how to knit braids, it is better to practice on the simplest scheme.  Knitting braids with knitting needles for beginners may seem incomprehensible and difficult.  But it‚Äôs worth starting the work, and all questions will be resolved. </p><p>  We offer a description of a simple pattern scheme.  In order to better see the resulting pattern, you should study on thick yarn and knitting needles of suitable diameter. </p><p>  To knit a pattern, dial 10 loops (2 edge loops, 4 loops are involved in the braid and 2 on each side will emphasize the pattern). </p><ol><li>  Edge, 2 front, 4 wrong, 2 front, edge. </li><li>  Edge, 2 wrong, 4 front, 2 wrong, edge. </li><li>  Repeat row 1. </li><li>  Edge, 2 wrong, 4 loops to cross (remove 2 loops on the auxiliary knitting needle and leave them before work, 2 facial, then knit left loops left), 2 wrong, hem. </li><li>  Repeat from 1 to 4 rows. </li></ol><p>  You can change this pattern a little if you leave the loops on the auxiliary spoke not before, but at work.  Then the braid will be braided not to the left, but to the right.  In a continuous canvas of braids, this simple technique can be alternated, which will make the structure of the pattern more unusual. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As can be seen from the diagram and description, knitting with braids in a braid pattern is absolutely <span>not difficult, the</span> main thing is patience and attentiveness. </p><p>  Similarly, you can knit wider braids, crossing not 4 loops, but up to 10-14.  It is possible and wider, but the wider the braid, the more the edge of the knitted fabric can be deformed. </p><h2>  More complex braid patterns </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Examples of knitting pattern &quot;royal braid&quot;" class="if uuid-2488749" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2488749.jpg"></div><p>  After trying and learning how to knit simple braids with knitting needles, you can move on to more complicated braid patterns.  In fact, such simple patterns in which the loops cross only in one direction, separate braids - bundles. </p><p>  The term "braid" itself implies a pattern in which weave loops in different directions are combined, several combinations of loops can be mixed.  They are united by one nuance: in contrast to Aran, the same number of loops always cross in braids. </p><p>  Very beautiful braids with knitting needles are obtained when knitting a wide strip, for example, a royal braid pattern.  She looks very prominently on the front or back surface.  To knit such a braid, the number of loops must be a multiple of 30. In the wrong rows, all loops are knitted on the wrong side, the pattern is formed only in the front rows. </p><ul><li>  1 row - the front surface; </li><li>  3 row: 5 loops are removed on the auxiliary knitting needle before work, 5 loops are facial, then knit the loops removed face.  Then 10 stitches of the front surface, again 5 stitches to the auxiliary knitting needle and leave them already at work, 5 stitches and knit the stitches removed; </li><li>  the next 5 and 7 rows are tied with front stitch; </li><li>  Row 9: 5 stitches with front stitch, 5 stitches are removed and remain at work, then 5 stitches and 5 stitches are knitted.  Again, 5 loops are removed on the auxiliary knitting needle, leave them before work, 5 front ones, then knit the removed loops and the remaining 5 loops face. </li><li>  11 row - the front surface. </li></ul><p>  Repeat from 1 to 11 row. </p><p>  Such a pattern will look good in a drawing of a warm pullover or a wide snood. </p><h2>  The magical beauty of Aran </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ravelry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aran-related models" class="if uuid-2488736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2488736.jpg"></div><p>  The most difficult to knit braids in knitting needles are considered to be Arana.  It is known that the beginning of this knitting technique came from the craftswomen of ancient Ireland.  In those days, all these complex interweaving of harnesses, braids and loops had a magical, protective value.  Over time, this symbolism disappeared, and the stunning beauty of this knitting technique continued to develop. </p><p>  Today, there are a huge number of braid patterns in the technique of knitting aran.  These are very unusual, bewitching patterns, but it is difficult to give a description to even one of them in a small article. </p><p>  When knitting arana, it is not necessary to move the same number of loops, as when knitting a braid pattern with knitting needles.  In this technique, on the wrong side (Arana is always performed on the wrong side), you need to move a different number of loops.  In complex schemes, not just loops intersect each other, but harnesses and braids. </p><p>  When knitting arana, you need a lot of attention and patience, but the result will be worth it. </p><h2>  What can be connected with a braid pattern </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.belasdicas.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Examples of twisted braids" class="if uuid-2488691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2488691.jpg"></div><p>  The answer to this question will be very simple: almost everything!  In the products, beautiful braids, knitted with needles, will harmoniously look on cute children's things, and on the men's pullover. </p><p>  It will be interesting to get a knitted set of mittens, hats and a scarf decorated with braids for the baby.  You just need to pick up soft, bright yarn, choose a pattern for the pattern and knit things that will warm the baby in cold winter.  And you can knit a children's blanket or blanket, decorated with thin braids. </p><p>  Very harmoniously different combinations of braids are decorated with cardigans, pullovers, blouses.  A long coat made using the technique of Aran knitting will surely cause envy of oncoming people.  Or maybe the subject of admiration for acquaintances will be a pullover made of weightless mohair yarn, decorated with intersecting tracks of braids.  And you can also please your beloved man by tying him a warm winter sweater with embossed braids. </p><h2>  Knitting braids for home </h2><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Things in the interior associated with braids" class="if uuid-2486569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87704/2486569.jpg"></div><p>  I would also like to highlight how harmoniously you can use the technique of knitting a braid pattern with knitting needles to decorate a house.  These can be very simple things such as a set of oven mitts or a beautiful cover for a decorative pillow.  Knitted covers for chairs made by embossed braids will also look very stylish in the interior. </p><p>  And when the cold comes, how nice it will be wrapped in a warm blanket, knitted with your own hands using a braid pattern. </p><p>  The possibility of using these patterns is almost limitless, the main thing is to show a little imagination and patience, then everything will turn out! </p>
