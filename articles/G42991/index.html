More precisely, certain malfunctions and malfunctions in the connection began to occur.  Why is this so?  What is worth doing?  Change operator or somehow try to fix the situation?  All this will be discussed now.  In principle, it is impossible to unequivocally answer all of the above questions - this is a fact.  After all, there are many reasons.  And not always everything depends directly on the operator.  Why does the MTS connection not work?  Let's try to figure it out! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS connection does not work" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149519.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Network congestion </h2><p>  For example, quite often the network refuses to work during a period of high voltage.  That is, if at the same time a lot of people call or send messages, then the transmission line simply refuses to work.  As a result, you can‚Äôt even dial another person‚Äôs number.  And this applies not only to MTS.  Communication does not work during ‚Äúoverload‚Äù for each mobile company.  No one is safe from this. </p><p>  And nothing can be done here.  Unless just be patient and wait until the voltage on the line decreases.  Then the connection will improve.  Repeat connection attempts from time to time - you will definitely be able to resume work.  Change the operator due to such phenomena is not worth it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Engineering works </h2><p>  Your MTS mobile connection does not work?  Then it's time to somehow contact the operator and find out if any technical work is being carried out on the line.  As a rule, such events are warned.  The exception is cases in which there is a connection and testing of new features. </p><p>  Practice shows that recently, ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù is trying to warn in advance about the timing and duration of preventive work and updates.  For example, information about this can be read on the official website or simply on the Internet under the guise of important news in the field of technology and communications.  Fighting such a phenomenon is also useless.  Just wait until the work is completed - the connection will return to normal.  And after that you can enjoy comfortable working with the phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why does the mts connection not work" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149520.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Why is MTS still not communicating?  Say, weather conditions can have a significant impact on this indicator.  After all, it is no secret to anyone that with any ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù, the first thing the connection suffers is.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of operator you have - everyone will fail. </p><p>  Before raising a panic and showing your dissatisfaction with the company, look out the window.  <span>A storm warning?</span>  Heavy wall shower?  Terrible heat?  Or is the wind really such that the trees bend to the ground?  Do not be surprised that the network refused to work.  The connection will return to normal as soon as the weather improves.  MTS, by the way, is far from being the most ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù operator in this regard.  Of course, you will not be able to independently influence the speed of the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  MTS doesn‚Äôt work, but not regularly, but intermittently?  It‚Äôs time to think about what specific issues are occurring.  What for?  After all, the reason may lie in your location.  In some areas remote from transmission lines, the signal will be very poor.  To wonder why the connection does not work or is ‚Äúpoorly caught‚Äù is simply silly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile communication does not work" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149521.jpg" width="500"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Pay attention also to the fact that in the subway (underground), as well as in elevators, any operator will not work for you.  During this period, the conversation and connection will be interrupted.  Once you get out of the confined space, everything will work out. </p><p>  Plus, do not forget that being in the forest and places remote from the city can also cause some connection problems.  In the same forest, for example, not only MTS, but also Megafon, Beeline, etc. will not work for you. Not only are the transmission lines far, so the vegetation interferes with the signal transmission.  This moment should not be forgotten and overlooked.  The problem is solved simply: you return to the arms of civilization - communication is restored. </p><h2>  Just appeared ... </h2><p>  Does MTS (Ukraine) not have a connection?  Frankly, in some countries and cities this operator is just starting its work, and the connection itself has not yet been properly established.  So, some time will have to be patient.  After all, never before has a new connection been able to work immediately well: smoothly and without errors with breaks.  This is a common occurrence. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS Ukraine does not work communication" class="if" height="372" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  And this phenomenon applies to citizens of Ukraine.  Here, ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù not so long ago began to fully develop.  Therefore, the connection may be interrupted, disappear and not work for some time.  All you can do is temporarily refuse the services of the company.  Well, or just get used to some inconvenience and not complain.  After some time, when the work of MTS will be established, it will be possible to use communication without problems.  The average duration of the ‚Äúsetup‚Äù is about 6 months.  During this time, the operator provides maximum comfort for his customers in the matter of communication. </p><h2>  Telephone </h2><p>  Despite all these cases, does your MTS still not work?  Ukraine, Russia or any other country - it does not matter where exactly this unpleasant event overtook you.  What else could be the reason? </p><p>  Do not immediately scold the operator.  Maybe the whole thing is in your mobile phone or any other gadget where a SIM card is installed?  Sometimes the cause of the problem is a banal breakdown of the equipment used for communication.  Perhaps this is the point that subscribers miss.  Especially when you are dealing with a new gadget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS does not work Ukraine" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1149522.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In any case, take the phone or other equipment for diagnosis to a service center.  They will tell you what the matter is.  If the operator‚Äôs communication works fine on its own, but specifically you don‚Äôt, change the device to a new one.  Any doubts about the performance of MTS?  Call your nearest mobile phone provider for help.  Here, they will help you to solve all the communication problems and explain the reasons for the failures. </p>
