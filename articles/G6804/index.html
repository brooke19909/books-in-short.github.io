In this case, such amounts must be refunded to the servicing bank and accounted for as deposited wages. </p><p>  <span>Article 136 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation</span> approved the provisions according to which the payment of sums of money to employees of the organization can be made by the employer using two different methods: </p><p>  - non-cash transfer of salaries to individual accounts opened by employees at a service bank; </p><p>  - cash payments made from the cash desk available at the enterprise. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of any organization to draw up a cash balance limit.  The size of this value is determined at the beginning of the annual period and agreed with the servicing bank.  The balance limit indicates the amount of cash that the company has the right to keep at its cash desk.  It is prohibited to keep cash in excess of the amount agreed upon with the bank in the safe at the end of the working day.  Target amounts are an exception.  These include funds that the company issues as state social insurance benefits, as well as scholarships and wages.  The balances of outstanding amounts for these purposes may exceed the approved limit for a period of three days (working days).  When this period ends, the funds shall be returned to the bank servicing the organization.  Violation of this rule provides for the imposition of penalties on the enterprise and its manager. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Deposited <span>wages</span> arising after the expiration of a three-day deadline for the payment of material remuneration for labor are determined by the <span>settlement and payment statements.</span>  If there is no signature on the employee‚Äôs last name, then a note on the return of the unclaimed amount is made in this column.  The cashier, after the end of the period during which the salary was to be paid, performs the following actions: </p><p>  - puts in front of the names of non-appearing employees the inscription ‚Äúdeposited‚Äù; </p><p>  - Reconciles funds taking into account their arrival and issue; </p><p>  - at the end <span>of the payroll</span> indicates the amounts that amounted to deposited wages and paid; </p><p>  - draws up a register of funds to be returned to the servicing bank; </p><p>  - draws up a cash warrant for expenditure, which indicates the amount of actual payments relating to remuneration for labor. </p><p>  Deposited wages must be returned to the bank on the next business day after the expiration of their storage.  This amount is reflected in the expense order. </p><p>  The deposited salary is fixed in a special register.  This document must contain the number assigned to the time sheet officer, full name  the employee, as well as the amount of material remuneration for labor unclaimed by him. </p><p>  The <span>cashier‚Äôs duties</span> also include maintaining a book that takes into account all depositors.  This document is filed separately for each year. </p><p>  The deposited wage, the accounting entry on which transfers unclaimed amounts to the credit of the seventy-sixth account, is issued to the employee upon his first request, with reflection on the debit of the same account.  The procedure for receiving unpaid timely wages may be preceded by an oral appeal of the employee, as well as his written application.  According to the norms of Article 196 of the Civil Code, the general limitation period is a three-year period.  It is at this time that the employee has the right to receive his salary.  If the employee of the enterprise did not claim the amounts intended for him, then these funds are charged to the financial results of the organization. </p>
