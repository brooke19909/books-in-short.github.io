  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Republican form of government in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Being a sovereign country, Russia independently establishes its form of government.  Thus, the organization of government bodies is determined, as well as the order of their activities. </p><p>  The republican form of government in the Russian Federation is established by the Constitution.  At the same time, the main sign of such a state system is the turnover and election of the head of state.  In this, the republican form of government differs from the monarchist.  Under the latter, as you know, the <span>head of state</span> more often inherits power. </p><p>  From a purely formal point of view, some authors believe that the form of government does not affect the features of the state system.  For example, Great Britain, being a monarchy, is, together with this constitutional and democratic state. </p><p>  In Russia, the republican form of government provides for the abandonment of any long-term or independent ownership of power, which will be based on individual law.  At the same time, the political system is guided by experience and intelligence, and not by achieving an ideal goal, which, as a rule, leads to the establishment of totalitarianism.  The republican <span>form of government in Russia</span> also provides for the formation of state bodies in accordance with the coordination of the interests of public administration with the steadfastness of civil liberty.  The creation of governing bodies is carried out for a certain (limited) period by means of free elections. </p><p>  The republican form of government provides for a democratic system.  At the same time, democracy (as equal freedom for all) is a complement to the specified system of government in the country.  In turn, the republic strongly supports the rise and development of this equal freedom for all, contributing to an even distribution of social benefits.  Along with this, equal elections, access to education, public positions and other things are ensured. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are two <span>types of republic:</span> presidential and parliamentary. </p><p>  The main political difference of the first is the concentration of powers of both the head of government and the head of the country in the hands of the President.  Other features of this form of government include the extra-parliamentary way of choosing the head of the country.  In this case, indirect or direct elections are applied.  In addition, the presidential republic provides for an extra-parliamentary method of creating a government. </p><p>  The system of higher state bodies under the parliamentary system of government is based on the principle of parliamentary dominance.  Moreover, the government bears <span>collective responsibility</span> before it <span>.</span>  In a <span>republic a parliamentary</span> government has power as long as it has a parliamentary majority. </p><p>  Some modern countries with a republican form of government also have some features of the presidential system.  Such states, in particular, include modern Russia.  The combination of features of the two systems of government is reflected in the presence of a powerful president‚Äôs power, while preserving typical features of parliamentarism. </p><p>  From the beginning of the constitutional system, Russia has sought to strengthen the features of the presidential republic.  At the same time, having a presidential character in the end, the public administration system retains certain external characteristics of a parliamentary country. </p><p>  Today, the Russian Federation has a presidential-parliamentary or (as it is called in some sources) semi-presidential form of government.  The president is elected by universal suffrage.  He has his own prerogatives, which allow him to act regardless of the government.  At the same time, there is a government that is formed by ministers, has a chairman and is responsible to some extent to the parliament. </p>
