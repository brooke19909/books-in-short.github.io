Every year, tens or even hundreds of thousands of tourists from different cities of our country buy tours to the hotels of the legendary Antalya or other equally beautiful resorts of the Turkish Riviera, for example, Alanya, Kemer or Side.  Hotels of various categories are scattered across the coastline - from 2 to 5 stars.  By the way, for those tourists who want to relax normally and at the same time save money, it is recommended to choose three-star options.  For example, Side Iona Hotel 3 * and other hotels of the same category.  The service is quite acceptable in them, and the prices are quite low.  For example, a weekly tour at Side Iona Hotel for two will cost 40,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="side iona hotel" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/695596.jpg" width="554"></div>

    <h2>  Side - one of the best resorts in Turkey </h2><p>  From Antalya, where the international airport is located, to Side is only 75 kilometers away.  This means that there, after arriving in the country by <span>air,</span> you can get there by car or dolmushe (minibus) in 40-60 minutes.  Unlike other areas of the Turkish Riviera, the <span>relief of these</span> territories is more flat.  There is no lush vegetation.  However, these places can hardly be called deserted.  And still, the owners of hotel complexes are doing everything possible to green their territories.  So, the hotel Side Iona Hotel <strong> </strong>  today literally immersed in greenery.  Here, with the light hand of gardeners serving at the hotel, many magnificent shrubs, trees, vines and flowers bloom magnificently.  But the biggest pride of this resort is the beach.  Thanks to its parameters, it has repeatedly awarded the EU blue flag. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  The comments of the guests about this hotel are quite positive.  At the same time, as often happens, vacationers point to both the pros and cons.  For example, a big plus is the fact that you can stay at the hotel with your pet.  And this is very rare.  In most hotels in Turkey this is prohibited.  Tourists also point to excellent food conditions.  The menu is quite varied and includes a large selection of international dishes.  It is very important that during all meals tourists are served fresh fruits and vegetables.  The level of service is also at a high level.  There are no complaints about sanitary conditions.  This is all right here.  But the minus, perhaps, can be called not very fresh linen and towels.  Some guests point out that bedding is quite washed out, although spotlessly clean.  In a word, the hotel provides good conditions for relaxation, of course, if we consider such a statement from the point of view of not too picky people.  And on the other hand, we must remember that this is not a five-star hotel, but a three-ruble note. </p>
