  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aberdeen (Scotland) - a cozy and romantic city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Wondrous Scotland, sung in the romantic ballads of R. Burns, resembles a fabulous corner where legends come to life.  An amazing country full of secrets, I want to go round and round, stopping in every city.  Recently, the tourism industry has been actively developing, and travelers from all over the world are in a hurry to enjoy the charm of the majestic kingdom.  I am glad that every year there are more and more vacationers from Russia. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.149717" data-lng="-2.094278000000031" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="11"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/0/6/5/4065.png"></div><h2>  The economic capital of the country </h2><p>  A small town on the North Sea coast, considered the third largest in the country, appeared in time immemorial, when two villages grew on this territory, which later merged into a single whole.  Here is the region‚Äôs most significant fishing port. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bbc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Charming Aberdeen" class="if uuid-2529597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2529597.jpg"></div><p>  It is not for nothing that the miniature settlement is called the "oil capital of Europe."  Large corporations use it as an industrial center for trade operations, and therefore the cold city of Aberdeen in Scotland is recognized as the economic capital of an independent state.  Most of the population is made up of oil sector workers who came from different countries, including Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, the city profits from the sale of fish, which is literally teeming with sea water. </p><h2>  Maritime Museum </h2><p>  The sights of Aberdeen (Scotland) made its appearance unique in the eyes of tourists.  And one of the most interesting corners of the city is the Maritime Museum, the exhibits of which will introduce the history of shipbuilding and the port, talk about various fishing vessels.  Tourists are happy to visit the exhibition dedicated to oil and gas.  This is not just a museum, but a great place for families.  Children love multimedia presentations and interactive exhibitions, which are often held here.  Each exhibit shows how shipbuilding technologies have changed and improved, because the life of the local population has always been closely connected with the North Sea. </p><h2>  Popular tourist attraction </h2><p>  In the heart of Aberdeen in Scotland is the Art Gallery, built thanks to philanthropists.  The building is a true work of art, made in the Victorian style.  City guests love to roam the halls of a cultural institution famous for its rich collections of valuable sculptures and paintings. </p><h2>  Architectural and religious monument </h2><p>  If we talk about the religious monuments of the city of Aberdeen, then you can not ignore the Cathedral of St. Mahar, dedicated to the preacher of Christian teachings and faithful companion of Columbus.  Tourists note the amazing architectural beauty of the local landmark, where masses are constantly held, accompanied by organ music. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": Justin Boylan-Toomey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Mahar Cathedral" class="if uuid-2529568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2529568.jpg"></div><p>  A tiny church appeared in 580, and after 550 years it was rebuilt into a spacious cathedral, destroyed after three centuries.  Residents again began the construction of the main temple of the city, in which nothing was left of the appearance of the former. </p><p>  Since 1690, there has not been a bishopric department in it, but the cathedral is active and is under the patronage of the organization "Historic Scotland". </p><h2>  Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The picturesque botanical garden, on a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich the whole variety of unique plants is collected, is an amazing corner for leisurely walks at all times of the year.  Evergreen trees, luxurious flower beds, manicured lawns cause the only desire - to stay here for a long time.  The intoxicating aroma, floating in the air, the melodious singing of birds and the soft whisper of artificial waterfalls captivate the guests of Aberdeen (Scotland), enjoying an amazing pacification.  The garden is ideal for romantic walks, so lovers from all over the world rush here to stay alone with each other. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2529620" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2529620.jpg"></div><h2>  Castle complex </h2><p>  In cozy Aberdeen in Scotland, almost no ancient buildings have been preserved, but a harsh castle, pleasing with unusual architecture, will pleasantly surprise vacationers.  Creits Palace, built in the 16th century, is famous for its unusual shape, similar to the letter "L".  Inside the complex, rare furniture remained from the previous owners.  The fortress, surrounded by a wonderful park, leaves no one indifferent. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nts.org.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kreits Palace" class="if uuid-2529572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2529572.jpg"></div><p>  They say that a ghost often appears in the castle of a young maid killed by her master.  The harbinger of her appearance is a green fog, in the veil of which the silhouette of a girl appears. </p><h2>  Holiday city </h2><p>  The original Aberdeen in Scotland is famous for its many holidays.  A jazz festival takes place here, and music lovers come from all over the country, dreaming of listening to the performances of the best performers.  In addition, in the summer, an international youth festival begins, and young musicians and dancers demonstrate their talents.  The best of them get good cash rewards. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hfbscotland.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Scottish Music Festival" class="if uuid-2529582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2529582.jpg"></div><p>  Folk festival gathers many connoisseurs of folk songs.  A huge number of people passionate about folk music come to concerts. </p><p>  One of the old harbors hosts a colorful and fun boat festival.  Several hundred participants bring home-made ships with them and arrange competitions accompanied by music. </p><h2>  Aberdeen, Scotland: reviews </h2><p>  Enthusiastic tourists admit their love for the economic and cultural capital of the country.  Guests are surprised by the huge number of monumental granite buildings, but the city does not look either gray or dull.  Structures made of rock with small inclusions of mica give a special touch to the Scottish pearl. </p><p>  It is not surprising that there are so many gardens and parks that admire with bright colors, giving the locals missing from the cold granite structures. </p><p>  Many celebrate delicious seafood dishes served in pubs and restaurants.  Gourmets even share the addresses of budget food places where you can inexpensively get acquainted with national cuisine. </p><p>  Charming Aberdeen in Scotland, in which time flies by, should not be taken only as an industrial center.  There are many cultural institutions and picturesque park areas, and walks along them give a lot of pleasant impressions. </p>
