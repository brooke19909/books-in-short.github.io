In connection with the spread of social networks and regular access to them via mobile devices, the telecom operator has developed a new option that is ideal for users who spend a long time on sites such as Odnoklassniki and VKontakte.  The MTS “Online” service, reviews of which will be considered in this article, allows you to refuse to count traffic when exchanging messages, surfing a number of social networks and instant messengers.  More details about the conditions under which the service is offered and what opinions the current subscribers have about it will be described below. </p>

    <h2>  Option Description </h2><p>  The MTS "Online" service provides unlimited access to sites called "social networks" and a number of instant messengers - a detailed list is given below.  By "unlimited" is meant really unlimited access, without taking into account the consumed traffic.  Why is such access necessary if there are tariffs and services that provide unlimited on any actions on the Internet?  The “Online” option (MTS), which subscribers' reviews will be given later, allows you to <span>save traffic</span> paid as part of a tariff plan or an additional service, and to refuse to connect to unlimited Internet for those red-and-white operator SIM cards users who visit certain sites and use popular instant messengers.  Thus, the traffic presented as part of a paid option or tariff can be spent on watching videos, downloading files, photos, sending e-mail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  List of free sites and applications under the option </h2><p>  So, what resources within the framework of the MTS option can you get unlimited access?  Full list of sites and applications below: </p><ul><li>  "In contact with"; </li><li>  "Classmates" (including OK Live); </li><li>  “TamTam”; </li><li>  Twitch </li><li>  Facebook (including messenger); </li><li>  Instagram </li><li>  Telegram </li><li>  Skype </li><li>  Vatsap; </li><li>  Viber; </li><li>  Twitter </li><li>  “They are Snapchat”; </li><li>  MTS Connect. </li></ul><p>  The list of resources is taken from the official website of MTS. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS network service" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2057868.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Service cost </h2><p>  The option in question is not free, like any other service of a mobile operator.  However, its cost will pleasantly surprise those who are interested in the idea of ​​gaining unlimited access to social networks.  The MTS “Online” service assumes the presence of a regularly charged subscription fee - when it is connected, 4 rubles will be charged from the user's balance every day.  Many subscribers will agree that this is a rather symbolic fee for accessing so many sites.  The MTS “Online” option, reviews of which are rather contradictory, is free for two tariff plans of the Smart series operator, namely: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  "Zabugorishte" (previously TP was called "Smart +"); </li><li>  "Unlimited". </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="online pay service reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45312/2057850.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Connection Order </h2><p>  How is the option activated?  The MTS "Online" service, the description and reviews of which are discussed in the current article, is connected in two ways: </p><ol><li>  By the subscriber himself (through self-service channels or with the help of the operator’s company employees), provided that a tariff plan is established and there is access to connecting the service (a list of TPs for which the service is not available is shown below). </li><li>  Automatically on tariff plans on which it is not charged.  Since June of this year, when switching to the Smart Zabugorishte and Smart Bezlimitishche TPs, activation takes place instantly, without any additional actions on the part of the subscriber. </li></ol>

    <p>  In the first case, in order to get unlimited access to the resources listed above, it is enough to visit your personal account on the operator’s official website or to dial the required key combination - * 345 # from your smartphone / tablet and wait for confirmation (connection is free).  If you experience difficulties during activation, you can safely contact the technical support of the operator - specialists will tell you how you can get out of the situation. </p><h2>  Feature Features </h2><p>  When changing the TP "Unlimited" and "Zabugorishte" the option is disabled automatically. </p><ol><li>  If the subscriber has switched to another tariff of MTS “Online” (feedback on this option will be given below) will need to be activated again.  This mechanism has been used since the beginning of September of this year. </li><li>  For TPs such as Hype, the service is not available for connection, as on the MTS Tablet tariff. </li><li>  When you open sites in "secret mode" (incognito, private) traffic will be taken into account. </li><li>  If the “Turbo-button” is activated, as well as the “Turbo-bonus”, then the traffic for visiting the resources will be taken into account. </li><li>  Watching videos on YouTube and Rutube will be charged: if paid traffic is connected, it will be consumed when visiting these resources, otherwise the fee will be charged to the subscriber’s balance. </li><li>  <span>Push notifications are</span> not included in the unlimited use of social networks, that is, they will need to be deactivated in order to exclude tariffing. </li><li>  Updating applications representing access to free resources will also be charged.  If the subscriber wants to update the mobile application to visit the Vkontakte resource, then such an operation will entail traffic accounting. </li><li>  Access to sites through the mobile browser "Opera" or any other that uses a data compression mechanism will be paid. </li><li>  When using a WAP access point, traffic will also be taken into account, even when visiting the resources listed earlier. </li></ol><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The MTS “Online” option has reviews both positive and negative.  Let's start with pleasant moments.  For subscribers who previously used the service of the operator "Social Networks" (which includes only three resources for unlimited access), the appearance of a new option was a pleasant surprise, because now instead of three you can visit fifteen sites and instant messengers for free.  Another plus is the fact that the subscription fee is charged every day - 4 rubles, while for the previous service - one-time in the amount of 90 rubles.  Thus, you do not need to replenish the balance at a time for this amount.  It is enough that every day on the account was a little more than 4 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The MTS “Online” option also has negative reviews.  Subscribers say this about this: </p><ol><li>  Due to the fact that in modern mobile gadgets various applications, widgets (for example, weather on the home screen or exchange rates) are regularly updated, the traffic will be consumed in any case.  Thus, in order not to pay for megabytes, you need to connect a tariff with the included gigabyte package or an additional option in addition to the existing “Online” service.  Which is not entirely profitable and convenient. </li><li>  The MTS Connect resource was also previously free (traffic was not taken into account for using it) and it is not clear for what reason the operator emphasizes that only with the option “Online” there can be unlimited use. </li><li>  For the Chukotka region, the service is not available for connection. </li><li>  Downloading pictures from social networks, watching videos via links leading to third-party hosting, sending files in instant messengers (videos, pictures, documents) will still be charged. </li></ol><p>  Judging by the reviews, the MTS "Online" service has both pros and cons.  We tried to cite its main advantages and dissatisfaction of subscribers above. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In this article, the “Online” service from MTS was reviewed: reviews and description of the option.  Of course, for some subscribers of the operator, it has become a real lifesaver: for a nominal fee, this is unlimited to your favorite and frequently visited sites and instant messengers.  However, there are also such subscribers who pay attention to the nuances, features of the service and conclude that it is not worth using it, but rather connect the unlimited Internet option with the included traffic.  If you take into account the reviews, the MTS "Online" service can really help subscribers who are used to using the Internet from mobile gadgets.  MTS creates improved tariff plans so that users have as much choice as possible. </p>
