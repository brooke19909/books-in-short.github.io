    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From Becici you can easily reach all the most interesting places in Montenegro. </p><h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  If you have purchased a ticket to "Sentido Tara" (hotel, Montenegro), then your vacation will be very calm and comfortable.  However, if you like not only to lie on the sand, but also to travel, then you certainly need to consider an excursion route.  The hotel, of course, has representatives (guides) of the host country, but you can book a trip from any agency.  Going out on the promenade by the sea, you will find a considerable number of representatives of travel companies offering vying with their excursions.  By the way, the cost of their trips is cheaper than in a hotel. </p><p>  From "Sentido Tara" (hotel, Montenegro) you can independently get to Budva (bus fare - 1.5 euros), and there you can see a wide selection of local attractions. </p><p>  According to the residents of Budva, in the summer in the city there are ten Russians per inhabitant.  How true such accurate data is, is unknown, but the fact that in the summer a large number of our compatriots come to the resort is true.  What attracts crowds of vacationers here?  Probably, the secret of popularity lies not only in the beautiful beaches and landscapes, but also in the very atmosphere of the city with its historical monuments.  It cannot be said that in the city there are historical places at every step, but nevertheless a harmonious combination of some factors creates a certain charm of the resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="centido tara hotel montenegro" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1479652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In terms of architecture, the Old Town of Budva is of interest.  Charming old streets with Venetian buildings are surrounded by greenery and flowers and surrounded by 15th-century ramparts.  Walking around this area, you can feel the spirit of ancient Budva.  It has its own attraction - the citadel fortress.  Thousands of tourists climb to its observation deck in search of beautiful sea views.  There are many cathedrals in the city worthy of attention.  Among them - the church of St. John, the church of the Holy Trinity. </p><p>  Museum lovers in Budva must visit the Budva Library, the Gallery of Modern Art and the Archaeological Museum.  In these places you can not only get acquainted with the most ancient archaeological finds, but also plunge into the world of art of Montenegro. </p><p>  The Budva library is amazing for those who visit it for the first time.  And there are reasons for that.  The fact is that it is housed in an old Scandinavian-style fortress.  In 1979, the building was damaged during the earthquake, but after a couple of years it was rebuilt and strengthened.  Currently, the fortress is more like a fairy-tale palace.  However, inside it the library interiors themselves amaze, they do not at all coincide with our stereotypes about dusty shelves.  The reading room, for example, is a truly luxurious living room with numerous glass cabinets. </p><p>  In general, it‚Äôs somehow very difficult to imagine that a hundred years ago all of Budva was located within the walls of the fortress.  For several centuries, the town was as if in hibernation, its borders did not change.  And only in recent decades, the resort has grown and gained a new look.  And in the old district, as before, the same atmosphere prevails, and its inhabitants live in ancient houses.  To get into this spirit, you just need to slowly walk through the quiet Budva streets. </p><h2>  Sentido Tara 4 * (Montenegro): hotel reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to turn to the reviews of tourists who shared their impressions of the rest.  Can I recommend it to people planning a vacation in Montenegro?  According to tourists, Sentido Tara Hotel 4 * (Montenegro) is a good place for a quiet and relaxing family vacation.  If you want to really relax and forget about all the problems, then you need it here.  Confirmation of the words of tourists is the fact that ninety percent of vacationers are pensioners. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel sentido tara hotel 4 montenegro" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1479665.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Hotel Sentido Tara Hotel 4 * (Montenegro) has a small territory.  Its buildings are located near the sea.  Only a cobbled promenade separates the hotel from the beach.  The hotel rooms are spacious and beautiful, with good furniture and large, comfortable double beds.  Very often it is impossible to sleep in hotels, because everyone gets used to his bed and the slightest inconvenience takes off his sleep as if by hand.  But in the Sentido Tara Hotel 4 * good beds and a cozy atmosphere set up for relaxation.  The rooms have air conditioning, very well located in the hallways, and not overhead.  All plumbing in good, good condition.  The bathroom has cosmetics and detergents, replenished as necessary.  The rooms are cleaned every day, there are no complaints.  As for towels, they are regularly changed, as expected.  Unfortunately, beach towels are not provided, if you want to take them, then an extra replacement will cost you money. </p><p>  The only minor drawback of the rooms is the French balcony.  By the way, in our understanding, this can not be called a balcony.  The door just opens, and there you will find a surprise from the bar for drying clothes.  Of course, this is not enough for a sea resort hotel.  However, such balconies are only on the second and third floors of the villas.  On the ground floor and in the main building there are full balconies. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Sentido Tara Hotel is a 4-star hotel, which means that the food in it is at the proper level, which is confirmed by the reviews of vacationers.  Tourists can pay half board if they plan an active vacation, or choose the all-inclusive system.  In any case, no one will remain hungry, because near the hotel there are shops with food, a cafe with normal prices, a live fish shop, which free-of-charge fry the favorite marine creature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido tara 4 tours" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1479666.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel restaurant serves very good food.  Breakfast includes fried eggs, porridge, scrambled eggs, sausages, yogurt, snacks, bacon, olives, pastries, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãtea, coffee, pancakes with honey, yogurt and jam, a large number of fruits. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, guests are offered each time several options for new soups, greens, salads, snacks, stewed and fresh vegetables, as well as grilled ones.  A variety of sauces with many meat dishes are very tasty.  Pizza was served every day, and it is fried with you.  The same applies to fish and meat, fried before your eyes.  The dessert and fruit selection is just awesome.  In addition, you can take quite good quality wine in any quantity. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the food is very diverse.  Every day they serve something new, you do not have time to try everything.  As a rule, there are no queues at the buffet table, and if a couple of people gather, then such a mini-queue quickly diverges.  Dishes are constantly replenished, so there is no need to rush to food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sentido tara 4 standard" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1479671.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Service: reviews </h2><p>  The hotel staff deserves special attention.  All very well-mannered and sweet.  At the reception, the girls are fluent in Russian, like all other hotel workers, so there is no language barrier.  The maids are cleaning normally.  If you have problems, you should contact the reception.  Then the situation is quickly resolved.  The service is just beyond praise. </p><p>  The beach is only 80-100 meters from the hotel, depending on which building you live in.  Going to the shore is just a couple of minutes.  The beach is clean and good, there are enough sunbeds for everyone.  You may not be able to stay in the front row, but this is not so important, since the sea is very close.  At the bottom there is a small pebble, which gives a beautiful color to water. </p><p>  Along the beach there is a promenade that leads to Budva.  You can always take a walk if you wish. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the complex has many advantages.  Therefore, those who plan to relax in Montenegro can safely recommend Sentido Tara 4 *.  Tours to the hotel, among all other advantages, still have a fairly reasonable price.  For a hotel of this level with good nutrition, the price / quality ratio is simply optimal. </p>
