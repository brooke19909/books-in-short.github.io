One of the main attractions of the whole country, next to which the Ocean Star <span>Resort 4 *</span> hotel stands <span>,</span> are the Ponagar Tam towers, which have more than a thousand-year history. </p><h2>  Description </h2>

    <p>  Tourists not only from Russia but also from all over the world who once visited this complex unanimously give the highest score possible for its location.  The proximity (100 m) of the beach and the ocean, the wild jungle and privacy are evaluated exclusively as one of the main advantages.  Some of the vacationers who traveled in the winter and spring months (from December to March), note the presence of waves, which makes swimming difficult.  However, this state of affairs, as it turned out, is ideal for kitesurfing, especially since the hotel has a school with Russian-speaking specialists. </p><p>  Pleased Ocean Star Resort 4 * gently sloping beach with snow-white and clean sand.  Hotel guests with children note that it is very convenient, however, there are often ebbs and flows. </p><h2>  Food and Restaurant Reviews </h2>

    <p>  Most of our compatriots note that breakfast is the best option, but not because the food quality is poor, but because every day I want to go to a new place.  Guests of the hotel note an abundance of fruits, high quality food, not only national but also European dishes.  Judging by the recommendations, one should go to the Boke district to all those who love fish and seafood, there are a lot of cafes and restaurants of various levels and price categories.  You can get there by taxi, and inexpensively, or on foot, it will take about 40-50 minutes. </p><h2>  Ocean Star Resort 4 *: room and service reviews </h2><p>  Most living in rooms and villas, bungalows note their quality, decor and cleanliness on a rating of 3 and 3.5 on a five-point scale.  We are talking mainly about not entirely new and noticeably dilapidated furniture upholstery, bedding and towels.  Cleaning is carried out, according to tourists, regularly, but its quality does not quite match the declared level of the hotel.  The staff is polite and smiling, but they do not speak Russian at all, and English is at the weakest level.  All this complicates communication and, to some extent, mutual understanding between the administration and guests. </p>

    <p>  Over the weekend, according to the guests, a large number of local residents come to the hotel.  Such a neighborhood is sometimes inconvenient, some note noise, but overall the atmosphere is friendly and calm. </p><p>  Analyzing official information about the Ocean Star Resort 4 * hotel (Vietnam), reviews of its guests, we can conclude that there is some ambiguity and inconsistency.  However, everything is quite fixable and smoothed out by other, more pleasant factors of rest at sea.  In particular, the fact that tourists spend most of their time outside the walls of the hotel. </p><h2>  Who is the institution oriented to? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that <span>the Ocean Star Resort</span> 4 * <span>hotel is</span> decorated in the best local traditions and has a beautiful and interesting national color.  A clean and well-groomed area allows you to spend more time in nature.  The mixed national composition of the guests of the complex allows you to meet new people and learn something about a different culture. </p><p>  Most tourists in their reviews note that the hotel does not have infrastructure for children, with the exception of a few swings on the territory and two offices in the pool.  The sea is often hectic, the calm is characteristic in the early morning hours, which is good for water activities and to a lesser extent for swimming.  Many note that on windy days, which are frequent, the wave covers an adult with his head.  Therefore, the Ocean Star Resort 4 * hotel, reviews of which is mostly positive, is recommended for a romantic getaway for two, especially newlyweds, as well as those who are chasing a big wave.  To a lesser extent, it is suitable for families with children and business people. </p>
