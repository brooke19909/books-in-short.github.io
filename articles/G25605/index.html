    <p>  The hotel has six conference rooms (can accommodate up to a thousand people), which are used not only for business events, but also for organizing celebrations. </p><h2>  Hotel beach <strong></strong></h2><p>  The Riu Palace Bavaro 5 * hotel (Dominican Republic) has its own beach.  One of the bars adjoins the coast.  I would like to note that the local beach is something amazing.  It is hard to imagine, but the wide coast is completely covered with fine clean sand.  Palm trees grow all the way to the water's edge. </p><p>  The beach is just perfect cleanliness, it is cleaned daily.  There are a lot of sunbeds on it, but there are absolutely no umbrellas, and this is not an accident.  Here it is customary to relax in the shade of palm trees, which are many throughout the territory. </p><p>  The entry into the water is gentle, but quickly becomes deep, it’s convenient to swim right away, and it does not completely cover with a wave.  Sometimes algae appear in the clear ocean, then most of the tourists quickly move to the pools on the territory of the hotel.  Unfortunately, algae are not harvested very often. </p><p>  The Dominican Republic is worth it to visit just to plunge into the waters of the stunning ocean.  Children really like to have fun in its waves, they simply can not be pulled ashore. </p><p>  We can say with confidence that the hotel is very popular due to its chic rooms and a unique beach and ocean.  Guests of the complex have long appreciated all the charms of the Riu Palace Bavaro 5 *.  Booking, for example, ranks the hotel among one of the best establishments in Punta Cana.  And it’s hard to argue, because the rest here is truly divine.  Everything is different here.  Life is changing, as if you are plunging into a completely different, idle world, in which there is nothing but a gentle breeze and a quiet whisper of the ocean. </p><h2>  Punta Cana Attractions </h2><p>  Punta Cana is a large resort in the Dominican Republic, which is considered the best in this country.  It is famous for its whitewashed sandy beaches and beautiful coconut palms along the entire coast.  The resort has three large parks, museums.  Relaxing in the Riu Palace Bavaro 5 *, you should definitely visit local attractions, as well as numerous and varied excursions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riu palace bavaro 5 booking" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1433597.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of them is the beaches of Bovaro.  Their coral sand has one feature, it does not heat up in the sun at all, even on the hottest day.  Therefore, on the shore you can relax without a sunbed.  These places are almost never disturbed by storms, and the reason for this is the most powerful coral reefs located along the entire coast and protecting it from strong waves.  For this reason, this wonderful place 25 kilometers from Punta Cana has long been chosen by the owners of the most expensive <span>hotels in the Dominican Republic.</span>  However, fashionable buildings do not spoil the local landscapes at all, they are almost invisible due to thickets of coconut palms. </p><p>  Fans of underwater beauty should definitely visit boat trips, which include not only skiing along the coast, but also an acquaintance with the tropical fauna and flora.  Tourists are particularly delighted with sharks and electric ramps. </p><p>  Manati Park is very popular among tourists.  Tropical thickets are of interest, since you can see the most diverse representatives of the local flora and fauna in them.  Here guests can see completely unique birds and animals.

But the most interesting entertainment is swimming with a dolphin, which has a healing effect. </p><p>  In Manati, there is a museum where you can get acquainted with the culture of the local population, including Aboriginal people. </p><p>  Eyes Ecological Park is home to rare animals.  You can walk on its territory on your own, or you can book an excursion with a zoology expert guide who will tell you a lot of interesting facts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="riu palace bavaro 5 dominican macao" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1433598.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The list of must-see sights worth seeing includes a house museum called Ponce de Leon, built over five centuries ago.  Here, tourists can immerse themselves in the long history of island civilization.  The author of this complex lived in these places before moving to Puerto Rico, where he subsequently took up a political career. </p><h2>  Sightseeing Tours </h2><p>  Active vacationers will be interested in excursions to islands or cities (for example, you can visit Santo Domingo, Saona Island, the city of artists Altos de Chavon).  Fans of boat trips should definitely go on a boat to watch whales.  This is an amazingly interesting activity.  Near Pointe Cana there is the fishing village of El Cortecito, whose restaurants always serve only fresh fish.
