At this time, families have to deal with a huge variety of difficulties.  For example, it is important to find a bona fide developer so as not to lose not only hopes for the apartment of your dreams, but also your own financial savings.  Unfortunately, the enormous number of developers today is losing the opportunity to pay off their obligations and bring to the end the projects for the construction of which they undertook.  Thus, an increasing number of interest holders suffer serious losses.  Many cannot find help from government agencies and third-party investors, which means they have to cope with such a difficult situation on their own.  To avoid this, it is important to devote enough time and attention to researching information about the developer company, its current and completed projects.  As a rule, this allows you to find out whether it is worth cooperating with this developer.  For example, this article is intended to inform you about the activities of the GC "Don Alliance" and its major project LCD "European".  Details are as follows. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD European Rostov-on-Don" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42841/1615932.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  About the developer </h2><p>  In this article, we will talk in detail about everything that concerns the LCD "European" (Rostov-on-Don).  Developer - GK "Don Alliance".  What can be said about him? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For a long time the developer "Don Alliance" was known as a company with an impeccable reputation, actively developing, which erected buildings of exceptionally high quality.  In a certain territory, the developer has become a market leader in its segment. </p><p>  The main activity of the company in question is the construction of housing complexes and various infrastructure from scratch on acquired land.  Construction technology - monolithic brick.  Experts consider it the most reliable and durable of the currently used. </p><p>  What are the reasons to turn to the services of this company? </p><ul><li>  Monolithic brick technology. </li><li>  Improvement of the local area. </li><li>  Affordable real estate prices. </li><li>  The ability to make payments without intermediaries. </li><li>  An opportunity to receive housing by installments. </li><li>  The apartments are finished, ready to move in. </li></ul><p>  However, the situation on the market is changing, and the position of companies in their niches is changing.  The same thing happened with the Don Alliance.  Practice shows that today the company does not have the financial ability to fulfill its obligations to equity holders.  We will talk more about the current situation on the project later in this article. </p>

    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  Let us consider in detail directly the project of the residential complex "European" (Rostov-on-Don).  Address: suppression of Baturinskaya street with the street of Workers.  The project was positioned as a quality property at affordable prices. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The building was designed along with convenient underground parking.  All recreation areas were carefully planned and should contain squares, children's and sports grounds.  It was also planned to build a comprehensive school along with a stadium and a kindergarten, a fitness center. </p><p>  The infrastructure of the district is actively developing.  Today, there are beauty salons, pharmacies, Apex store and a children's development center.  In total, eighteen residential buildings were to be erected. </p><p>  Designed apartments of the most diverse layouts (including studios, one-room apartments, two- and three-room apartments).  The building construction technology used in this case is a brick-monolith.  The improvement of the adjacent areas was also planned to be given close attention.  Communications should have been central.  And each building, it was decided to equip a beautiful silent elevator. </p><p>  However, there is something that you should familiarize yourself with before deciding to purchase housing in the Evropeisky residential complex (Rostov-on-Don) - a photo of the construction progress that has not yet been completed.  Detailed information on this is presented later in the article. </p>

    <h2>  LCD "European" (Rostov-on-Don): reviews </h2><p>  At the beginning of construction, buyers were pleased with the plan he presented.  The materials had to be used high-quality and reliable, which increased the attractiveness of the LCD "European" (Rostov-on-Don).  Residents' reviews also related to a beautifully designed house territory, convenient layouts, a large selection of apartments.  Indeed, at first everything went fine.  However, later the situation changed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Apartments in the LCD "European" (Rostov-on-Don) are unlikely to soon fall into their rightful owners.  The fact is that the developer company does not fulfill its obligations.  The project was implemented as a whole by thirty-seven percent (some buildings - by sixty percent, but the majority - by ten).  Is it worth believing that the developer will still bring to the logical conclusion the project of the residential complex "European" (Rostov-on-Don)?  Responses of residents allow us to conclude that they no longer have such hopes.  Deceived real estate investors appeal to the highest authorities and the media with a request to pay attention to their problem.  Do such actions give at least any result? </p><h2>  Activities of defrauded equity holders </h2><p>  Today, all those who have not received their housing are doing their best to restore justice.  In addition to official letters to government officials and attempts to bring the press to trial, defrauded real estate investors go on pickets.  This is intended to draw public attention to this problem.  So far, unfortunately, these actions do not bring the desired effect.  And most of the buildings remain unfinished.  This is the case, for example, with one of the houses of the residential complex "European" (Rostov-on-Don) - Liter 24A.  The frame was only partially erected in it, although, according to the established deadlines, the construction of this building was to be fully completed at the end of September 2014.  On the contrary, another house of the residential complex ‚ÄúEvropeisky‚Äù (Rostov-on-Don) - Liter 21 - was completed in 2015 much earlier than the deadline, so that those who are resettled from emergency property can settle there.  Nevertheless, the elevator still does not work in this building and there is no road to the house, and also many components are missing.  Since the beginning of 2015, the large-scale construction of all houses has stopped, and in the period from 2015-2016, the construction of houses is carried out periodically.  The general contractor explains this situation by the lack of money that was used to pay interest and penalties to equity holders for late delivery of houses.  Today, deceived equity holders demand that they be recognized as such and entered in the appropriate register, indicate the actual deadlines for the completion of construction work and find a solvent investor for a high-quality completion of the project.  To date, ten buildings remain unfinished. </p>
