    <h2>  Hotel Accommodation Policies </h2><p>  Check-in and check-out at Dionis Hotel Resort &amp; SPA 5 * (Bogazkent) is carried out in the same way as in most hotels around the world.  Check-in of the rooms of the category reserved by them is carried out from 14:00.  However, despite this rule, the hotel complex administration is trying to do everything possible to immediately populate tourists arriving earlier than the specified time.  Unfortunately, sometimes this is not possible due to the fact that in the midst of the season the hotel is almost 100 percent full.  Therefore, newly staying guests have to wait until the previous guests have left the room and the maids have prepared it.  In this case, you will be asked to leave things in the luggage storage room and stroll through the territory of Dionis Hotel Resort Bogazkent 5 *, have lunch, swim in the pool or immediately go to the beach.  Check-out should be done before noon.  If your plane leaves only in the evening, then for an additional amount you can extend your stay at the hotel.
