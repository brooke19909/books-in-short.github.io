    <p>  North-west winds are not terrible for this area, because from all sides the mountains surrounded and protect from Divnomorskoe strong wind gusts.  The weather here, according to tourists who rested there in 2015, is much better than in Gelendzhik and in the whole region. </p><p>  Such prevailing climatic conditions at the resort are optimal for those who can not stand the tropics and heat.  Last year, even at the peak of the tourist season, the village of Divnomorskoye boasted the clean coast of the Black Sea.  Rest (2015), reviews of which inspire tourists to come there, left only indelible impressions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fans of this resort write that they like to spend their holidays here because of the beautiful and picturesque coast, which is completely strewn with small and pleasant to the touch pebbles.  The water temperature in Divnomorskoye can warm up to +24 degrees Celsius in the summer, and in winter drop to the mark of +7 heat.  Such a pleasant and gentle climate makes tourists who have visited this village at least once come there again and again. </p><h2>  Amazing nature </h2><p>  Divnomorskoe is considered an ecologically clean area because of its location.  It is located between the Caucasus Mountains, and any major routes are located far from it.  Through the entire village runs the mountain river Inogura, whose flows are directed far into the sea.  Therefore, coastal waters always remain so clean and transparent that even coarse sand is visible at the very bottom.  Along the entire coastline from the village itself to Dzhanhot on the mountains, a pine forest with a pine tree spread.  Thanks to this tree, the air here is very fresh and endowed with healing properties. </p><p>  Last year, many tourists decided to visit Divnomorskoe.  Rest (2015), reviews and comments about which almost all are positive, for these people has become unforgettable.  They all write as one that, of course, the main attraction of the resort is its clear sea and remoteness from noisy cities, but at the same time well-developed infrastructure. </p>

    <h2>  Where is the best place to stay when coming to the village? </h2><p>  Finding housing in Divnomorsk will not be difficult.  Along the coast, next to each other are guest houses, motels, recreation centers and the private sector.  Arriving on vacation in the new season, it is possible not to go in search of a home, but to know in advance what comfortable living conditions the Divnomorskoye resort can offer.  Rest (2015), reviews of which bring fame and popularity to the village, will be pleasant only in a comfortable place.  Its selection directly depends on the preferences and budget of travelers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First you need to decide on the area where you would like to stay.  There are many prerequisites for self-rest, which the Divnomorskoe resort can offer its tourists.  Guest houses can serve as a striking example.  Those who decide to use this type of housing leave only positive feedback about their choice. </p><p>  They write that for those who are looking for a more relaxing holiday, it would be preferable to settle away from the intersection of Kirov and Lenin Streets, as there are many cafes and a bit noisy.  Gornaya is considered a calmer street, there are no discos and noisy parties. </p><p>  Tourists are happy with the rest in the private sector.  Due to the fact that the resort has many shops and markets, there will be no inconvenience in purchasing products and all necessary goods.  There are also pharmacies, snack bars and canteens, where you can enjoy home cooking. </p><p>  Well, for those who prefer small beaches and a sea with a rocky bottom, it is better to settle in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe central beach and the Fakel base.  Divnomorskoe can provide accommodation to its tourists for every taste and budget. </p>

    <h2>  Health resorts of the Black Sea resort </h2><p>  Back in 1901, the first sanatorium was opened in the village.  Various resorts and health centers work here throughout the year, where you can get a complete recovery of your body after any disease.  For example, such a health and fitness center is the Raduga Hotel (Divnomorskoe), which is located just 150 meters from the sea and 15 kilometers from the airport.  The complex has its own pebble beach.  Tourists note the high level of service in the <span>health resorts of Divnomorsk.</span>  They say that they not only had a nice rest, but also got better. </p><h2>  How can I have fun in the resort village? </h2><p>  Previously, there was a stereotype that Divnomorskoe is more suitable for people of older or middle age, but after reading the reviews of tourists who rested there in 2015, we can conclude that this is completely not so.  The whole tourist infrastructure is well developed here: discos, bars, cafes, restaurants and a variety of beach parties.  All this, combined with the cleanest ecology and spacious beaches, makes vacation in this Black Sea resort simply magical and unforgettable. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  In addition to the local beauties with coniferous forests and unusually clear sea, the village has its own items for pride.  One of them is the central promenade, which is the embodiment of all the best that can only attract tourists.  It is on it that the main festivities are organized. </p><p>  The historical sights include two dolmens that have been located above the valley for the past five thousand years, and they are not afraid of any bad weather.  A little further from them is their peer - a burial mound, which is already half destroyed.  The younger historical monuments include the church of St. Sergius of Radonezh.  It will be no less interesting to look at the rock, which the locals nicknamed Sail because of its external similarity with it. </p>
