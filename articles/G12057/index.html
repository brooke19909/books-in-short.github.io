    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  It is better to learn about the pros and cons of this hotel from those people who have already rested here and wanted to share their impressions.  In general, this five-star hotel complex met the expectations of our compatriots.  The number of rooms is quite good, although some were bothered by the small area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms and poor soundproofing.  The hotel was built in a small and fairly quiet village, there are no motorways and noisy establishments nearby.  Nearby, just a hundred meters away, is a private beach with a bar.  The swimming area is very clean and large enough with comfortable sun loungers and umbrellas.  Some, however, did not like that beach towels needed to be left a deposit, but this is a common practice. </p><p>  On both sides of the street there are small souvenir shops where you can purchase original gifts.  A minibus leaves three times a day from entering the territory in Side.  Our compatriots say many kind words about the staff.  As for food, the vast majority of Russian tourists are unanimous about the quality of the dishes offered: they are very tasty and varied.  Many express a desire to return to the Alba Queen Hotel again. </p>
