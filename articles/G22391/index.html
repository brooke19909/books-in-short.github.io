    <h2>  Belver Castle </h2><p>  Several masterpieces of Gothic architecture can be seen on the island of Mallorca.  Sights of this kind are always excitingly interesting.  <span>Bellver Castle was</span> erected at some distance from Palma de Mallorca.  At first (in the 14th century) it was a chic residence of monarchs, then (in the 18th century) it became a prison for political prisoners.  Since 1976, the Palms Museum has opened in the castle, where an exposition tells the history of the city - from the very first settlers to the Middle Ages.  An unusual form of architectural construction is the only round castle in Europe.  Its four towers are oriented to the cardinal points, the main and highest (25 m) looks north.  Now on the territory of the building entertaining events are held: concerts, even weddings in a medieval style.  The real gem of the castle‚Äôs architecture is the spacious patio on the top floor, which offers panoramic views of the city and Palma Bay.  This spectacular sight is celebrated by all visitors to the Belver Fortress on the island of Mallorca.  Sights, reviews of which are published in this article, do not end there. </p>

    <h2>  Dragon Cave </h2><p>  The island of Mallorca, whose attractions include unique objects created by nature itself, invites you to visit the Dragon Cave.  In the enchanting underground kingdom of grottoes, stalactites and pristine lakes, you will lose track of time.  For two kilometers, wonderful discoveries await you, covered in ancient folk legends.  Tradition has it that the Knights Templar and the Mediterranean filibusters hid their treasures in the cave.  The search for innumerable wealth has been undertaken since the 14th century, but their result so far has become only a detailed map of the dungeon. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the Dragon Cave there are five lakes of various sizes, among which Nergo, Delicias and Martel stand out.  The latter is sometimes used as ... a concert venue.  Musicians play, sailing in boats on a backlit lake.  The acoustics of cave vaults make such performances unforgettable.  And the Martel Lake was decorated with lighting effects by the architect Carlos Bougas.  The unsurpassed master built an amazing <span>fountain</span> in the underworld <span>, illuminated by a</span> hundred light bulbs imitating the dawn.  You will need about an hour to go around the magnificent halls of the Dragon Cave, but you will not regret the time spent. </p>

    <h2>  City of Valldemossa </h2><p>  This fabulous town will charm you with its sleepy serenity and provincial antiquity.  The architectural sights of Mallorca impress with their elegance and simplicity. </p><p>  Valldemossa boasts a Cartesian monastery, in which the famous <span>George Sand</span> and Frederic Chopin huddled.  It is believed that this couple in love became the discoverer of Mallorca as a tourist resort.  The great musician suffered from consumption, and he was taken care of by his tinctures only monk of the monastery, which at that time became an inn.  Later, Chopin will write an elegiac prelude ‚ÄúRaindrops‚Äù, reminiscent of the sad time of his forced imprisonment in Mallorca.  Now in the cells of the monastery there is an exposition dedicated to the writer and composer, and Chopin regularly gives concerts in the local chapel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The narrow streets of the Moorish city of Valldemossa are lined with neat paving stones; on each dwelling there is a portrait of the local patron saint - Catalina.  Valldemossa cats walk with dignity through the streets of the city in collars decorated with local pearls - a medieval tradition or a touching marketing move?  Try asking this question to the residents of Valldemossa. </p>

    <h2>  Cape Formentor </h2><p>  The island of Mallorca (Spain), whose sights are known all over the world, is famous for its unique views of the vast expanses of the Mediterranean.  The landscape landscapes of Cape Formentor are especially good: cliffs covered with dense evergreen forest, a picturesque steep coast washed by the amazing blue sea, and a white strip of sandy beach stretching into transparent waves ... The fermentor is located in the northern part of Mallorca.  It has some historical sights.  A lighthouse was erected here in the 19th century.  Given the inaccessibility of the place, the construction was truly revolutionary.  Mike is acting now, however, for this he had to be modernized.  Noteworthy is the medieval 16th-century watchtower, built on the top of the cape.  In order for tourists to enjoy the breathtaking views from Formentor without interference, they built the Mirador observation deck at an altitude of three hundred meters. </p><h2>  The Palacio de la Almudaina </h2><p>  The oldest royal palace that Spain can boast of.  Mallorca, the sights of which can be described endlessly, has several ancient fortresses, the Palacio de la Almudaina is one of them.  Moorish viziers and Arab rulers ruled here.  Now the palace is the royal residence in Mallorca.  It also houses the military commandant‚Äôs office and the National Museum. </p><p>  A powerful medieval facade with four watch towers will meet you Almudaina.  The top of one of its towers is crowned with the image of the patron saint of the city - the archangel Gabriel.  Another was called the ‚ÄúTower of the Heads‚Äù, which fully justifies its past purpose - the severed heads of executed people were exhibited here. </p><p>  The throne room is a brilliant pearl of the grand palace complex.  It contains many artifacts.  In the royal courtyard is the chapel of St. Anne, built in the 14th century.  The Royal Garden promenade and visit to the Arab baths will seem no less entertaining to you. </p>

    <h2>  Luke Monastery </h2><p>  This monastery was erected in one of the most mysterious and sacred places on the island of Mallorca.  The sights of this paradise often have a long and exciting history.  According to local legend, Luke Monastery stands on the site of an ancient temple where pagan rituals of worshiping the spirits of the forest were held.  Archaeologists have excavated at the site of the sanctuary and discovered objects of the Iron and <span>Bronze Ages.</span>  According to legend, in the 13th century a simple shepherd found the image of St. Mary at the site of the monastery‚Äôs erection and took it to a more suitable place - the local church.  However, in the morning the image again appeared in the forest, in the same place.  It was there that the chapel was erected. </p><p>  At the end of the 17th century, the monastery was reconstructed and stylized in the spirit of the Renaissance.  Later, the outstanding architect Gaudi worked on the facade of the building.  Inside the monastery is stored an ancient relic - a statuette of the Holy Virgin Luke from dark stone.  An archaeological museum operates inside the building, and a delightful garden is set up around the monastery. </p><h2>  Alfabia Gardens </h2><p>  The magnificent gardens of Alfabia is another lovely place that Spain can rightfully be proud of.  Mallorca, whose sights are worthy of close attention, is famous for its luxurious vegetation.  Alfabia Gardens is a unique example of landscape design.  They surround the estate with the same name.  Located on the west coast of Mallorca, at the foot of the rocky mountains of Tramuntana, the gardens beckon with their shady alleys, planted with lemon, orange and other fruit trees and shrubs.  Lush thickets of date palms and fragrant pines give the coveted coolness to the traveler tired of the midday heat.  The canals with fresh clear water, built in the lush <span>Arab-Moorish style,</span> delight the eye with picturesque ponds and fountains. </p><p>  Alfabia Gardens are divided into lower and upper.  The latter are more extensive and completely surrendered to the cool power of delightful fountains and meandering water jets.  In the lower gardens you can find a pond overgrown with water lilies, and thickets of outlandish palms. </p>

    <h2>  La Granja Manor </h2><p>  One of the oldest estates on the island of Mallorca.  Architectural sights are distinguished by elegant restraint in design.  This local tradition is due to the fact that once the island was subject to the invasion of treacherous filibusters.  To attract the attention of pirates with excessive luxury was unreasonable. </p><p>  La Granja Manor was built in this simple and noble style.  It was built during the Roman Empire at the behest of a noble nobleman.  In the 13th century, the building was given a more modern look, and two centuries later it was reconstructed to its current size.  Now tourists can admire the numerous rooms of the estate, filled with entertaining artifacts, as well as walk through the local garden with lush vegetation and transparent fountains. </p><h2>  A train </h2><p>  If you decide to explore the sights of Mallorca on your own, you just need to go on a trip on a historic train that runs between Palma de Mallorca and Soller.  The original interior of cars of the beginning of the 20th century has been carefully preserved for more than a hundred years.  The railway was laid in record time in the same period, it stretches along the mountain serpentine and numerous tunnels of Tramuntan.  Through the huge windows of the cars, you can admire the fruit grove, forests, dizzying landscapes.  Six trains follow daily at both ends of the route.  They make several stops along the way, the most popular of which is Bunyola.  In Soller, you can continue the journey in the old-fashioned way - take an electrified tram to the local port. </p>
