Of course, this is not a luxury leisure complex, but a standard European three-star hotel.  Therefore, you should not expect frills from her, as in the Turkish or Egyptian "fives."  This hotel has its charms and advantages, and now we will try to share them with you, having analyzed the reviews of tourists who have been here.  The hotel usually stops people who come to spend a couple of days on the Italian coast or as part of a sightseeing tour of Europe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pacesetter 3 rimini" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1523315.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rimini Region </h2><p>  No wonder this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãItaly received the title of the most popular resort of the Adriatic.  Here, sandy beaches are not so frequent for the country, and in addition, Russian tourists come here for shopping.  Not without reason in Rimini is one of the largest trade fairs in Europe.  Even the Milan can envy the shopping malls of the city, for example, La Befane.  It is better to walk around the historical center of Rimini, but if you already get around, then by public transport.  A bus or tram ticket costs a little more than Euro and lasts an hour and a half.  By the way, the Pacesetter 3 * hotel (Italy, Rimini) is located near convenient transport interchanges.  This resort town has many ancient sights that date back to the era of Ancient Rome (Arch of Augustus, Tiberius Bridge, the "house of the surgeon"), as well as monuments of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (city hall, Palace of the Mayor, Sismondo Castle).  And Rimini is inextricably linked with the name of Federico Fellini.  There is a bench where the master liked to sit, a diner where he visited, and in general, a whole museum of his work.  Also interesting is the sea pier and the architecture of some houses, fully lined with shells. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel pacesetter 3 rimini" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1523317.jpg" width="600"></div>

This is a bit far from the center - to the main attractions of the city, as well as to the station from it about the same distance.  It takes about a quarter of an hour to get there by bus.  But he stands right on the beach by the Adriatic Sea, so that at night the sound of the waves calms you, and in the morning you wake up under it.  Near the hotel there are two large grocery supermarkets - Konad and Coop.  Right near the hotel entrance there is a bus stop number four (just the one that goes to the center and the train station), and a Tabak stall where, among other things, they sell tickets for public transport.  The historic center can also be reached on foot, especially since the walk in Rimini itself is always very pleasant. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pacesetter 3 italy rimini" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1523320.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and sea vacation </h2><p>  We already mentioned that the seashore is literally ten meters from the hotel, except maybe across the road.  Hotel Pacesetter 3 * (Rimini) has its own beach at number twenty-one.  It is divided by breakwaters with the coast of other hotels.  The sand is very fine, like flour.  The beach is well equipped, there are many different kinds of water sports.  But sunbeds and umbrellas are very expensive - eighteen euros for a couple of pieces per day.  They are not allowed to sunbathe in the sand on their own towels, but on the stones - as much as you like!  The beach is well suited for families with small children.  There are also many cafes, restaurants and bars right by the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel pacesetter 3 rimini" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1523338.jpg" width="300"></div>
