  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pontic mountains: description and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Pontic Mountains are a massive mountain range that covers almost all of the Black Sea coast.  They are quite inaccessible, but are famous for their picturesque views and ancient historical monuments.  We will discuss this in more detail in this article. </p><h2>  A brief excursion into history </h2><p>  The Pontic mountains are located in Turkey, namely, they encircle its northern part along the Black Sea coast.  Their total length reaches thousands of kilometers, and the width of some sections exceeds one hundred kilometers.  The mountain system acquired an unusual name in ancient times.  The fact is that before the Black Sea was called Pontus Ewkinsky. </p><p>  Historically, this mountain range was too difficult to access and therefore was not of special value to the ancient conquerors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="footage.framepool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pontic mountains" class="if uuid-3022429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/3022429.jpg"></div><p>  The tribes inhabiting this region were called Mossineks.  Their main occupations were farming and beekeeping.  The power here belonged to the Persians.  Then, on the Black Sea coast, the formation of the Pontic kingdom took place, which did not last long.  Further in the sources there is a mention of the Greek colonies, which were swallowed by the mighty Roman Empire.  After the collapse of the latter, Byzantium seized power over this region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the 15th century, mountains and surrounding territories were ruled by the Ottoman Empire.  This region is currently part of Turkey. </p><h2>  Region Development Plans </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="40.5" data-lng="40.5" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/3/2/4/2/13242.png"></div><p>  Pontic mountains are a historical monument.  Here, even before our era, ancient tribes lived, and battles were also fought.  Power belonged to great civilizations, which, by the will of history, replaced each other.  The remains of the great past in the form of the ruins of ancient castles have survived to this day.  In addition, many travelers and locals are aware of the unusually picturesque views that open from different points of this mountain system.  Therefore, at present, the country's authorities have decided to create conditions for ecotourism in this region.  To implement this plan, asphalting of the roadway, improvement of walking paths and comfortable places for rest of tired travelers are already underway. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The Pontic mountain range is conditionally subdivided into the West Pontic Mountains, the central part, which is called Janik, and the Eastern Mountain System. </p><p>  The western part of the mountain range is famous for its huge coal deposit, and numerous lowlands create the conditions for the development of agriculture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The East Pontic Mountains are widely known for their large active deposits of polymetals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.colourbox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pontic Mountains Waterfall" class="if uuid-3022453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/3022453.jpg"></div><p>  The vegetation in this area is quite diverse.  For example, on the north side it is represented by oak and beech forests, and on the south it is replaced by coniferous forests.  Thickets of evergreen thorny shrubs are also found throughout the territory. </p><p>  The Pontic mountain system is located on the migration route of rare species of birds and wild animals.  Therefore, in this territory there are several national parks, the main function of which is to protect the habitats of animals such as wolves, jackals, bears, lynxes and several varieties of mountain goats. </p><h2>  National parks </h2><p>  On the territory of the Pontic Mountains (Turkey) there are several national parks with rare species of animals and birds.  The largest among them is Altyndere Vadisi.  This park is a delight for all travelers.  There you can see rare animals such as wild deer and goats, bears, wolves and many others.  However, it is worth noting that hunting and fishing in this area are prohibited. </p><div class="photo" data-original="footage.framepool.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View from above" class="if uuid-3022431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/3022431.jpg"></div><p>  The hydrographic system of the park is represented by many lakes, rivers and streams of unprecedented beauty.  Here you can pitch a tent and enjoy a relaxing holiday in the lap of nature. </p><p>  The vegetation of the park zone is represented by coniferous and mixed forests, as well as alpine meadows.  You can independently develop a walking route, taking into account your own physical preparation and explore the surroundings of this magical place. </p><h2>  Traveler Reviews </h2><p>  The Pontic mountains are still difficult to visit for tourists, but some travelers confidently lay their own routes on off-road vehicles and explore this unusual place. </p><p>  All tourists who have visited the mountains note the picturesque landscapes they met along the way.  The fact is that this mountain system has a rich hydrographic system, which is represented by many rivers, lakes and streams.  The overall picture is complemented by abundant vegetation and reddish mountain ledges.  The unusual color of the mountains was due to the special chemical composition of the rocks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pontic mountains in Turkey" class="if uuid-3022462" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66454/3022462.jpg"></div><p>  On the way, tourists find many ancient historical monuments that were once castles and fortifications.  Stone buildings and thick walls make a lasting impression. </p><p>  Currently, the Turkish authorities are trying to make this place accessible for visiting to unprepared tourists. </p>
