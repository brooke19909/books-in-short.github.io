    <h2>  Opinion of residents </h2><p>  <span>So, the project has been completed, almost all townhouses are populated.</span>  <span>In general, it can be called successful: the developer fulfilled all the promises.</span>  <span>The houses are of high quality, there are no complaints from the residents.</span>  <span>Excellent planning decisions are what many emphasize.</span>  <span>Real professionals worked on the project, who managed to take into account the needs of modern residents of the metropolis and organize the space in such a way that it would be comfortable for even several generations to live on it.</span>  <span>All houses were built using quality materials, as the developer promised, they turned out to be warm and comfortable.</span>  <span>So if you are interested in townhouses in the Primorsky district of St. Petersburg, take a closer look at the project.</span>  <span>Currently, almost all houses are rented out and sold out, but some of them can still be found on sale.</span> </p><h2>  LCD "Tradition" </h2><p>  <span>But this project is unlikely to interest those who are not ready to say goodbye to the charms of metropolitan life, because it is located at a significant separation from the city.</span>  <span>But if you consider yourself a connoisseur of suburban life, want to taste all its charms and have the potential for this - LCD "Tradition" will become a real find.</span>  <span>The complex is located 16 km from the Ring Road and, perhaps, its only drawback is the proximity to the local cemetery.</span>  <span>But this does not bother anyone who decided to purchase housing here.</span>  <span>The complex is fenced and is under round-the-clock security.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Reviews about the complex </h2><p>  <span>Townhouses in St. Petersburg, in fact, attract many, even if they are distant from the city.</span>  <span>But not all of them deserve the price they require and offer excellent living conditions.</span>  <span>That is why the feedback of real residents must be taken into account when choosing your future home.</span>  <span>So, all those who managed to inspect the project at the construction stage, note that high-quality materials and innovative technologies were used for it, which made it possible to commission the entire complex so quickly.</span>  <span>The houses turned out to be warm, strong and durable.</span>  <span>The insulation is well thought out, so even the noisiest neighbors will not bother residents.</span>  <span>The users were also pleased with the excellent planning decisions: the space is organized in such a way that both adults and children will comfortably live in the house.</span> </p><h2>  Tips &amp; Tricks </h2><p>  <span>Of course, townhouses in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region are an excellent option for large families who cannot reconcile with the cramped apartments in the city.</span>  <span>At the same time, it is a budget alternative to detached cottages, endowed with all the advantages of suburban life.</span>  <span>But the choice of complex should be approached more carefully and prudently.</span>  <span>Most of them are still located outside the city, which is why it is important to take into account transport accessibility, the presence of at least minimal infrastructure and, of course, communications.</span>  <span>These are general principles of choice, but there are some subtleties that inexperienced customers do not know or forget about.</span>  <span>We want to talk about them.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>So, pay attention to the number of sections of each house: the fewer they are, the better.</span>  <span>An important selection criterion is not only the price of the house at the stage of its delivery, but also the cost of subsequent maintenance.</span>  <span>Quite often, buyers are ‚Äúled‚Äù by the low cost of real estate, but then they simply can‚Äôt afford to pay utility bills on a monthly basis, so it‚Äôs better to worry about this in advance.</span>  <span>Well, of course, it is important to understand that townhouses in St. Petersburg, as in any other region of the country, are most often a long-term and large-scale project.</span>  <span>That is why it is necessary to trust only trusted developers, in whose history there is at least one already implemented project.</span> </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  <span>We presented to your attention the best townhouses in the city of St. Petersburg and the region.</span>  <span>These are the <span>residential complexes that</span> have already been commissioned, respectively, managed to earn a certain reputation.</span>  <span>Pay special attention to them, be sure to visit the sales office and get acquainted with the most attractive object: evaluate the layout, the quality of construction in order to form your own opinion.</span> </p>
