  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Novelty in the entertainment industry: water park in Nizhny Novgorod</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What is popular in Europe, sooner or later comes to our region.  So, recently, water parks have become very popular.  These are large indoor complexes, most often with a lot of entertainment and pleasure.  A good example is the water park in Nizhny Novgorod.  The project is ready, and he admires his prospects. </p><h2>  A bit of history <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in nizhny novgorod" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/344641.jpg" width="430"></div></h2><p>  Few people realize how long the first water parks appeared.  In its basic concept, these are amusement rides on the water.  And a similar complex appeared already in 1940.  And Peterhof itself is considered the ancestor of water parks, where the complex of fountains inspired <span>the invention of</span> the water park with which we are familiar today.  The first Russian water amusement park was built in Samara in 2002, and today it is a visiting card of any large city. </p><h2>  Who needs water parks? </h2><p>  Mankind is going through a period when "bread" is enough for everyone, but "spectacles" are still not enough.  Hence the popularity of various kinds of leisure activities.  Water park is no exception.  In it you can spend time with the whole family, with friends or a loved one.  There is a place for everyone.  For the uninitiated, we note that the water park is a place where there is a pond or pools, many slides of different steepness and shape, there is a children's corner and an animation program.  Usually, water parks also have a cafe or restaurant where you can have a bite to eat, a bar with drinks, but all this is for a fee.  Entrance is usually paid once, the time of stay is not taken into account.  If you take such large centers as this water park (Nizhny Novgorod) will be, the prices do not differ much from the European giants.  For the day you have to pay up to 1,500 rubles per person.  For a child, the tariff is, of course, lower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What will be the water park in Nizhny Novgorod? <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park nizhny novgorod prices" class="if" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/344639.jpg?1393521819188" width="600"></div></h2><p>  The location of the new building is the <span>Meshchersky Lake</span> microdistrict <span>.</span>  The water park will have 2 zones: a closed area and an open.  Moreover, the latter will be built primarily due to the relative simplicity of the design.  It is planned to build a huge entertainment complex with attractions, sports grounds and food outlets.  In the construction of such establishments, the fact that a person expects to stay in the complex all day, from morning to evening, is taken into account.  This means that he needs to be provided with various activities so that he does not get bored, as well as with processes important for life support, such as eating, hygiene, and so on.  All this is taken into account in the project "Water Park in Nizhny Novgorod."  Completion is planned in 2014.  In such a park there will be an open beach area and bicycle paths.  And next it is planned to create a football field and a subway line.  All these are just projects, but today the water park in Nizhny Novgorod, whose photo looks so amazing, inspires hope for a bright future for modern Russia. </p><h2>  The rules of conduct in the water park <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park in nizhny novgorod photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13524/344640.jpg?1393521846482" width="600"></div></h2><p>  No matter how the developers of such centers are worried about your safety, the life of your child and your own are in your hands.  Follow all safety precautions indicated next to the rides.  Do not leave your child alone and unattended.  If he cannot swim, provide him with a <span>life jacket</span> and do not take it off all day.  Stay alert while you are in the center.  Remember that water is always dangerous, especially for children.  First try to ride on a hill yourself, and then trust this child.  Get to know the rides gradually - from simple to complex.  Choose slides where you need to ride on inflatable buns, and not just on the fifth point.  Even such a progressive water park in Nizhny Novgorod can be very dangerous if you are illiterate to behave in certain situations.  Worry about your safety yourself, without laying it on the shoulders of the rescuers. </p>
