They were not abstract.  Leading Russian engineers worked on the development of the country's first urban underground railway.  Gradually, the future <span>metro</span> scheme of <span>St. Petersburg</span> loomed <span>.</span>  But its embodiment in reality was prevented by the First World War and everything that followed. </p><h2>  Leningrad Metro </h2><p>  In 1918, the city on the Neva lost its capital status.  Consequently, the subway in it could appear only after it was built in Moscow.  Nonetheless?  its creation began in the late thirties and was interrupted by World War II. </p><p>  It would not be an exaggeration to say that the current metro scheme of St. Petersburg actually came into being in 1955.  Of course, this was only the very first of its relatively small piece.  But it was in the fall of 1955 that the first passengers drove along the launch site of the Kirov-Vyborg line. </p><p>  The construction of the Leningrad Metro was fraught with very great difficulties.  The territory on which the city is located has a very difficult geological structure.  Builders had to overcome areas with difficult terrain and many water barriers.  But at the same time, it is impossible not to note the level of engineering solutions - the scheme of St. Petersburg metro is quite rational.  It managed to avoid some significant errors made in the design of the Moscow subway. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro scheme peter" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/391336.jpg" width="456"></div>

This most important decision was made at <span>the design stage.</span>  The metro scheme of St. Petersburg is designed in such a way that all its lines connect the densely populated areas of the outskirts with the historic city center.  Each of them has intersections and transfer stations with the rest.  And this provides the opportunity to get from one <span>district of St. Petersburg</span> to any other with a single transplant or without it at all. </p><p>  The lines of the St. Petersburg metro are quite long and connect through the center the areas located at the opposite ends of the city.  Thus, one path connects the Kirov and Vyborg districts of St. Petersburg, and the other - the historical Moscow and Petrograd sides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="areas of St. Petersburg with the metro scheme" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/391339.jpg?1399479768352" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  Development prospects </h2><p>  The already formed and ongoing development of the St. Petersburg Metro system reliably provides communication with all areas of the city.  She has already gone beyond his administrative borders in the direction of the Leningrad region.  Today in St. Petersburg there are 67 metro stations located on five lines.  There are 7 interchange nodes. </p><p>  Existing plans for the development of the metro system provide for the period until 2025 the appearance in the city of more than thirty new stations.  They will be located both on the extensions of existing lines, and on the new, Krasnoselsko-Kalinsky.  But the further construction of the St. Petersburg metro is greatly complicated by circumstances of a financial and economic nature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="scheme metro Peter with stations" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/391337.jpg?1399479831547" width="496"></div>

    <h2>  From station to station </h2><p>  The scheme of St. Petersburg metro with stations is interesting primarily for those who follow the train with a transfer.  All five <span>railway stations of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãare tied to the metro.  <span>The Moskovsky station</span> is located near the <span>Ploshchad Vosstaniya</span> and Mayakovskaya stations, the Baltiysky station is at the Baltiyskaya station, the Finnish station is near the <span>Lenin square</span> station <span>,</span> Vitebsk is near the Pushkinskaya and Zvenigorodskaya stations.  And not so long ago, the built <span>Ladoga station</span> is located at the <span>Ladoga station</span> . </p>
