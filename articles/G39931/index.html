These are, as a rule, Apple and Samsung;  and only a few of us can take something alternative, like HTC and LG.  Basically, we do not pay attention to the less popular, but cheaper and more productive models, not trusting an unfamiliar brand.  Phone Explay Indigo, the reviews and specifications of which will be described in this article, is one of these. </p><h2>  Why Indigo? </h2>

    <p>  Surely most of us have not heard of such a brand as Explay.  But in vain.  This is a domestic, Russian manufacturer of electronics, which has taken one of the leading positions in the market in a relatively short time.  Initially, the company specialized in promoting mp3 players, e-books, and other electronics.  Now Explay make smartphones that sell in the domestic market.  Due to the fact that this is a local producer, it has every chance of success within the country. </p><p>  As for the answer to the question of why Explay Indigo, the reviews confirm that the phone itself is made on a rather frisky platform, developed using budget, but high-quality materials, due to which it performs its tasks at a high level.  Moreover, due to the fact that the company is young, the cost of its devices, even with other things being equal, is much lower than competitors from China.  And this is another ‚Äúin favor‚Äù in favor of this model.  Anyway - the device is new, what prevents you from acquiring it purely out of interest? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Market Positioning </h2>

    <p>  The Explay Indigo mobile phone, reviews of which say it is a decent device for everyday use, is positioned by developers as a budget model.  It is enough to look at least at the price (8,000 rubles) - this is a third of the cost of the flagship Samsung models, despite the fact that the hardware filling does not differ so significantly. </p><p>  It turns out that the model is offered as a cheap competitor to Chinese noname Android smartphones, while this device can well compete with market leaders, although it costs several times less. </p><p>  Do not believe?  But in vain, an excellent model, this Explay Indigo!  Customer reviews confirm this: the smartphone runs on an eight-core processor, it is equipped with a powerful camera with autofocus and an IPS display that perfectly displays the graphics (even for models from the price segment above).  This is all made in an aesthetic case and sold for 8 thousand!  Which manufacturer can boast of a similar model? </p><h2>  Build quality and design </h2>

In general, of course, they did not come up with something new in Explay by stuffing the hardware in a standard shell for touch phones made of black plastic.  The case can be confidently called thin and so that it lies comfortably in the hand.  As one of the minuses that the Explay Indigo smartphone has, the reviews call the brand-name back cover, which constantly leaves handprints.  Of course, not critical, but visually certain inconveniences are delivered.  You can deal with this with the help of a regular napkin, although there is little sense in this. </p><p>  The design of the model, again, does not contain something extraordinary - a black ‚Äúbox‚Äù with a pseudo-metallic insert on the facade from the bottom (due to this the phone is slightly similar to HTC One) with sound adjustment and unlock buttons located on one side.  Like all Android devices, the phone has virtual keys ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù in the style of KitKat 4.4.4. </p><h2>  CPU and hardware </h2>

    <p>  As noted above, the 8-core processor Explay Indigo reviews are called such that it completely satisfies the vast majority of the tasks that may arise in front of the device.  When working with the phone, it is difficult to notice any hangs or delays, like the more expensive model, Indigo shows a rather high efficiency.  In general, here stands <span>MediaTek MT6592M,</span> well-known on models of this class, with a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  In principle, this is enough even to confidently support the latest applications on Google Play, not to mention the implementation of ordinary, everyday tasks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The novelty was equipped, as already reported, with an IPS-display, the diagonal of which is 4.7 inches, and a resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels.  This is the optimal format for running applications and games of any class. </p>

    <p>  As for the picture itself, there are no complaints about it - all the images, all the graphics on the phone are transmitted quite clearly, brightly and richly.  Colors do not change even when the viewing angle of the display changes. </p><h2>  Battery Explay Indigo.  Endurance Reviews </h2><p>  As for such an important issue as the device‚Äôs battery, its capacity is 2500 mAh.  This, as noted by Explay Indigo reviews, is enough for active use of the device during the day, or for gradual and moderate consumption over several days using various settings to optimize the phone.  Thus, the phone can be called quite hardy, despite the demanding screen and eight-core processor. </p>

    <h2>  Device memory </h2><p>  Regarding the memory of Explay Indigo, reviews call the device sufficiently capacious and universal for any task.  According to the developers, the device is equipped with an internal memory of 8 gigabytes, which are designed to host the operating system.  In addition, Explay Indigo also has a microSD card slot, which can have a capacity of up to 32 GB.  They, respectively, can be used to download multimedia files of any type.  This amount of memory should be enough even for several films that can be viewed on the road and literally on the go in high quality.  Such mobility of the device will appeal to lovers of books, series, video tutorials. </p><h2>  Support for two sim cards </h2><p>  Another feature that Explay Indigo (black) has, reviews are called support for two sim cards.  The advantage of this addition is obvious - the owner of the device can simultaneously be in touch in two networks of mobile operators.  However, in the case of the Indigo model there is a nuance: the device cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù both the sim card and the memory card at the same time.  This means that the user is given the choice: support for 2 mobile cards, or 1 card and microSD.  Of course, most buyers complain about the need to choose. </p><p>  At the same time, some more advanced users have found a way to get around the restriction due to some special technique: placing a sharpened sim card in the slot, for example.  Thus, it is placed in the slot and does not prevent the device from ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the memory card. </p><h2>  Explay Indigo Cost </h2>

    <p>  Now let's talk in more detail about how much the device praised above costs.  The figure, in principle, has already been named - it is 8 thousand rubles.  However, to understand the relationship, let's compare mobile phones of the same class. </p><p>  So, Phillips Xenium, which has a more capacious battery, but a similar camera with auto-capture and a 4-core processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz, will cost 12 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Another device is the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Grand Prime Duos, which also supports the simultaneous operation of two SIM cards, but equipped with a much worse display and, again, a quad-core processor, will cost 13 thousand rubles. </p><p>  As you can see, the difference in cost is not always due to the functionality of the device.  As each mobile phone is, first of all, a product, special attention in its sale is given to marketing.  And this is the additional cost of brand advertising, its promotion, promotions.  All these costs are invested in the cost of the product. </p><p>  Buying little-known products, you at least already save on marketing costs, which are more widely known, more hyped brands.  The difference in cost and characteristics you see yourself. </p><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  When writing this article, of course, we used not only reviews.  Explay Indigo, the characteristics of the device, its appearance and build quality were also ‚Äúunder the gun‚Äù.  Summing up all these criteria, we can say with confidence about the positive impression left by the device. </p><p>  Of itself, Explay Indigo is a device that is equipped with everything necessary so that it does not cross reasonable boundaries.  It means that there is nothing superfluous in this phone - just what you need for its daily use as a means of communication, a multimedia player, a source of entertainment and, of course, a tool for doing business. </p><p>  At the same time, the phone looks pretty stylish to everyone - again, this expands the circle of people who can use it in everyday life.  This is especially true for those who pay special attention to every detail in their own style. </p><p>  Finally, the cost of the phone is much lower than even those devices that lose Indigo in one way or another.  The question is: why pay more if such a great option is available? </p><p>  The advantage of the phone, of course, is the fact that the manufacturer company belongs to the domestic economy.  This means that each of us is interested in the development and prosperity of the brand and its further promotion in the market. </p>
