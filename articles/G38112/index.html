It is affordable, and without compromising on comfort.  Due to the well-thought-out arrangement of rooms in the apartments, their layout, there is a saving on the area of ​​non-residential premises, and the price becomes available to more people, although the quality of housing is in no way inferior to the comfort class. </p>

    <p>  As the best company, CDS received an award at the Builder of the Year Award in 2011.  A year later, there was a victory in the nominations “Patron of the Year”, as well as “The Best Company in the Field of Housing”.  The CDS achieved such success under the leadership of CEO Mikhail Medvedev and thanks to the coordinated work of professional staff.  Moreover, when identifying the best contestants, qualitative indicators were taken into account, not quantitative ones.  The assessment also included the level of external and internal decoration, as well as how well-maintained the area around the erected buildings was.  All these and other indicators of the CDS were at their best. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The company already has several dozen new buildings, covering an area of ​​more than 3.5 million square meters.  m.

    <p>  Much attention is paid to the reviews about CDS related to the interest of those who want to have housing thanks to <span>the loyalty program,</span> according to which the apartment can be purchased in installments, and interest-free.  The CDS company cooperates with many banks in terms of providing mortgages, and an additional discount is also offered for the regions.  Residents, for example, in Murmansk, having learned about the CDS, reviews of which can be found on any construction forum, by calling the toll-free line for consultations, have the opportunity to conclude a purchase agreement, and send documents and receive them by mail. </p><p>  Thanks to professionalism and creativity, the company is known as a reliable, never-failing partner.  On the construction market, there are reviews of CDS as a developer of full-fledged apartments of small footage, as a designer of complex development of neighborhoods, and, importantly, as a company providing installment payments up to five years, including interest-free. </p>
