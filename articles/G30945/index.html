  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wood carving, flat-relief carving: description with photos, sketches, necessary tools and work technique</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As one of the types of woodcarving, flat-relief carving appeared in the 18th century in Russia under the rule of Peter I. The period of active flourishing of the craft fell on the second half of the 20th century, which was largely due to the activities of the philanthropist Mamontov, who opened a workshop in his estate in the Moscow Region. </p><p>  Artists and carvers are based on sketches of flat-relief wood carvings of ancient Russian masters, who laid the foundation for Abramtse-Kudrino carving thanks to the conducted research and creative searches.  The name of the new type of craft came not only from the place where the workshop was located, but also from the village from which the craftsmen came. </p><h2>  Features and types of flat-relief carvings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood carving" class="if uuid-3215215" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3215215.jpg"></div><p>  The wood-carving of the flat-relief type differs from other types of craft in that when processing the background is cut to a shallow depth, as a result of which the pattern remains at a slight elevation, but at the level of the board. </p><p>  There are several types of flat-relief carving: </p><ul><li>  Abramtsevo-Kudrinskaya. </li><li>  Vornosovskaya. </li><li>  Tatyana. </li><li>  With a pillow background. </li><li>  With selected background. </li><li>  With a select background. </li><li>  With undercut background. </li></ul><p>  The first type of flat-necked carving influenced its formation as one of the ways of decorative wood finishing and became the progenitor of the other varieties. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Pillow thread </h2><p>  Unlike ordinary flat-relief carvings, wood carvings with a cushioned background preserve the background, and the master is limited to sticking corners.  The background of works in this style resembles pillows, which gave it such a name. </p><p>  The technique is similar to contour thread in that grooves are cut along the contour of the pattern.  But the difference lies in the fact that the edges of the sketch are subsequently rounded off both from the side of the background and from the side of the ornament. </p><p>  The cuts are made along the contour of the drawing, after which the cutting is carried out from the side of the background, then they begin to zagivaniya faces.  A similar contour can be obtained by highlighting the image lines with a cutter, and its sock should smoothly bend around the contours and completely chamfer.  The latter is removed in two tricks - both "on my own" and "on myself". </p><h2>  Vornosovo thread </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pembrokehistorical.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat-relief wood carvings pictures" class="if uuid-3215218" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3215218.jpg"></div><p>  A type of flat-necked carving invented by Vornskov on the basis of traditional carving and many years of experience gained in the Abramtsevo workshop.  Having subsequently become the leading master in the country, Vornskov admitted that he borrowed ideas for his works from samples of old Russian wood carvings. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of the Vornosov wood carving was the so-called palmate pattern - the technique of applying plant elements, the weathered edges of which give them the shape of fingers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tatyanka </h2><p>  A unique type of flat-relief carving is wood carving, recognized by many researchers as a separate art form.  It appeared relatively recently - 24 years ago - and was named in honor of the wife of the master who invented the technique. </p><h2>  Handmade thread </h2><div class="photo" data-original="whiteriver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flat-relief wood carvings photo" class="if uuid-3215225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3215225.jpg"></div><p>  Work in the technique of flat-relief carving with a selected background allows you to create an ornament with a clear silhouette.  A flat relief with zaulovannymi faces rises above the background, which can be different - bumpy, smooth, in the form of various textures. </p><p>  The threading technique is performed in the same sequence as other types.  First, cuts are made along the outer contour of the pattern, for which the tool is placed vertically and immersed in wood to a great depth.  However, the depth of the incisions varies: at the sharp corners of the ornament, it is minimal, at sharp turns - the maximum. </p><p>  Rough background sampling is carried out to a depth of 3-4 millimeters, first with flat semicircular chisels, then flat.  The point of the chisel is at an angle to the wood being processed.  To facilitate the work on the handle of the instrument, it is easily struck with a mallet or palm.  The departure of the blade to the side or to a greater depth is corrected by cutting the background from the opposite side.  The background is gradually cut to the intended depth. </p><p>  The next step is zagivanie and trimming the forms of ornament.  The cutting tool is placed at a certain angle to the work surface.  Zawing is performed in a standard way for other types of technology. </p><p>  The final cleaning of the background begins with the processing of large areas, gradually moving on to the small details between the ornament.  The last step in stripping the background is the use of skins and loops or chasing it with punches. </p><h2>  Patchwork for beginners: where to start? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nbss.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood carving" class="if uuid-3215226" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3215226.jpg"></div><p>  Flat-necked carving, despite its sophistication and complexity, is not considered the destiny of only professional wood masters.  In order to achieve a serious level in the craft, it is not necessary to spend a lifetime learning. </p><p>  Patchwork woodcarving for beginners requires minimal wood skills and the necessary tools.  The first thing a beginner needs is to gain theoretical knowledge and be able to understand the tools. </p><p>  Proper preparation of the workplace is no less important: for the first steps in the craft, a minimal set of tools and an ordinary table are enough.  For those who plan to further develop in this direction, a full-fledged workbench is useful. </p><p>  The choice of wood is important - the final result and the complexity of the work performed depend on it.  Wood and boards are carefully prepared, since the quality of the material depends on its competent processing.  The wood must be thoroughly dried and scraped.  To change color, the material is painted and varnished. </p><h2>  The use of flat-relief carvings in the creation of furniture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.fanchmachinery.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sketched wood carvings sketches" class="if uuid-3215217" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3215217.jpg"></div><p>  The described craft technique was widely used at the end of the 19th century, as indicated by numerous photographs.  Flat-necked woodcarving was used to decorate furniture and accessories, which are highly rated by antique dealers, even if they are made by contemporaries. </p><p>  The most in demand are flat-relief carvings in the manufacture of church iconostases and the arrangement of Orthodox churches from the inside.  Aesthetic photos of flat-relief wood carvings confirm the high value of a unique and elegant craft. </p>
