    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The beach capital of Vietnam is Nha Trang.  This definition for travelers is quite enough to understand the essence of the resort.  Nha Trang, although not very large, is a cheerful and noisy town with a developed tourist infrastructure.  It is no accident that it attracts more and more tourists every year, including our compatriots.  It is difficult to name one thing that is important, which is why it is worth coming here, overcoming thousands of kilometers.  Some love Nha Trang for the <span>azure sea</span> and the white sand beaches, as if necklaces surrounded by green hills of all colors, for tropical islands growing in the middle of the bay.  And it's all here - a reality, as if descended from a commercial.  Others choose this resort because of its vibrant nightlife.  And conservative tourists who like the Sybarite infrastructure of Nha Trang - mud baths, first-class spa treatments, stay in chic five-star hotels, which here fully correspond to the declared category. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Angela Suites Lobby Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1790549.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Angela Hotel 3 *, Vietnam: reviews </h2><p>  Most of the Russians staying at this hotel were satisfied with their stay.  Convenient location Angela Hotel is one of its main advantages: it is the very center of Nha Trang.  Near many shops and cafes, there is a very inexpensive night market.  Many of our compatriots dined outside the hotel, for example, in the nearest barbecue, or bought food in mobile shops. </p><p>  The rooms are all new.  Especially a lot of positive feedback about the work of staff - maids.  Everywhere is clean and tidy.  And although only workers at the reception speak several languages, the rest nonetheless communicate well in sign language.  But the most important thing is the responsiveness and friendliness of the staff. </p><p>  As for excursions, many are advised to go to Hon Tam Island and Dalat.  Those traveling with young children should not go on tours in the mountains of Vietnam because the road is exhausting. </p><p>  Many liked the fact that the rooms have tea accessories, as well as the code on the telephone set for free access to the Internet. </p><p>  The food at the hotel is not bad, although some Asian cuisine was not to their liking, so they preferred to eat at nearby cafes.  Nevertheless, most Russians liked the breakfast, there are even tips to try local coffee. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, our compatriots note the very small size of the pool, as well as the fact that the windows in the rooms do not open.  Some were annoyed that when checking in at the reception they took their passports, but, as they were told, this was done for the benefit of the tourists themselves, who very often lose their documents and with great difficulty restore them.  Another reason for dissatisfaction is the noise during weddings, which are held in this hotel a lot. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  If to summarize based on the reviews of Russians, we can say that the vast majority of our compatriots Angela Hotel 3 *, located in the Vietnamese resort of Nha Trang, really liked it.  The average rating for this hotel is four and a half points. </p>
