They give grace, beauty and originality to the room.  Therefore, in the next article, we will study the features of the execution of the napkin "Sunflower" crochet.  Schemes and a description of the whole process will allow readers to create an interesting and colorful thing.  Which will certainly decorate the interior of any room. </p><h2>  Yarn preparation </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen say that various small crafts are most conveniently made from the remains of knitting threads.  But despite this, you should not use the first hank that comes across for a number of reasons.  First of all, the color should correspond to the idea.  Since we plan to knit a napkin "Sunflower", it is necessary to choose yellow yarn and black or brown.  The thickness of the skein is also worth considering.  Napkins are best made from fine yarn.  Iris is ideal for these purposes.  Especially if you want to make an openwork canvas.  But in extreme cases, you can use thin acrylic yarn.  But from fleecy and "shaggy" skeins it is better to refuse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="in.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin crocheted sunflower step by step" class="if uuid-3015969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015969.jpg"></div><h2>  Tool selection </h2><p>  Even novice needlewomen will be able to <span>crochet the ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù</span> napkin using the presented schemes and descriptions.  True, only if they prepare a good tool.  But what is hidden under this term?  In fact, everything is simple.  Professional craftsmen are convinced that the hook that is comfortable to hold in your hand is called ideal.  Therefore, we immediately refuse from a long or too short one.  In addition, it is believed that the easiest way to work with a metal tool.  Although readers who have the habit of knitting with large loops, it is wiser to consider wooden.  The size of the selected tool should correspond to the thickness of the thread.  If you want to knit a canvas of simple columns, you can take a smaller hook. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The initial stage of knitting </h2><p>  Next, we will offer different schemes and descriptions of the "Sunflower" napkin crocheted.  However, if you study the various master classes prepared by professional needlewomen, it becomes clear that the starting actions are identical in all cases.  Knitting a simple or openwork napkin begins with an amigurumi ring.  Readers familiar with the techniques for knitting toys need no explanation.  And they can proceed to the next point.  If such a term is heard for the first time, then we suggest studying the instructions, which will not only reveal the secret of the mysterious name, but also teach you how to start crocheting napkins correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.duitang.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin crochet sunflower description" class="if uuid-3015967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015967.jpg"></div><h2>  Amigurumi ring </h2><p>  Amigurumi is a crochet technology for various toys.  Invented it in Japan.  But after a small amount of time, it spread all over the world.  The needlewomen loved her so much that they even prefer to build schemes and descriptions of crocheted napkins (including the ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù napkin), starting with the amigurumi ring, which is performed as follows: </p><ol><li>  Cooking yarn and hook. </li><li>  Wrap the tool two times with knitting thread. </li><li>  Remove the resulting loop. </li><li>  Slightly stretch, trying not to dissolve. </li><li>  And tie with six single crochet. </li><li>  We close the row in the ring, connecting the first and last loops. </li><li>  After performing all the described actions, we pull the initial tip of the skein. </li><li>  As a result, the center of the resulting circle closes. </li><li>  Now we need to knit three rows, guided by a specific pattern or independently adding loops and expanding the circle to the desired size. </li><li>  Then we turn the circle over with the initial tip of the thread towards us. </li><li>  And then we knit in the opposite direction. </li></ol><p>  If the master is just beginning to learn the basics of crocheting, you can continue to work according to the standard scheme and description of the "Sunflower" napkin.  In this case, crocheting a product should be tied clockwise, as a simple technology implies.  And accordingly, the formed circle does not need to be turned to itself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Simple napkin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual crochet sunflower doily" class="if uuid-3015947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015947.jpg"></div><p>  First of all, we offer readers to study the technology of performing an elementary product.  However, despite its simplicity, it looks very original and beautiful.  Work begins with knitting amigurumi rings.  We use black or brown yarn.  Further actions are best represented as a list: </p><ol><li>  In the second row, double the number of loops. </li><li>  In the third, we increase through one column. </li><li>  Turn the circle over and knit counterclockwise.  Or we continue to work in a standard manner. </li><li>  In the fourth row, we increase after 2 loops. </li><li>  In the fifth we knit columns with one crochet.  We make an increase through three loops. </li><li>  In the sixth - SC, we do not increase or decrease. </li><li>  In the seventh - columns with one crochet.  Adds through three loops. </li><li>  In the eighth, single crochet.  Increases through two loops. </li><li>  In the ninth - columns with one crochet, we do not increase. </li><li>  We knit the tenth row in a circle, making an increase with an interval of two loops. </li><li>  Eleventh - with an interval of three loops. </li></ol><p>  Thus, it is possible to crochet the center of the Sunflower napkin.  The description of further actions involves knitting petals. </p><h2>  Preparing Sunflower Petals </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="doily sunflower crochet pattern" class="if uuid-3015913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015913.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced needlewomen prefer to start knitting these parts directly from the core of the flower.  However, novice craftsmen can first prepare the petals, and then sew them with a needle and thread.  To do this, take a yellow knitting thread and knit twenty parts.  In this case, we will not load the reader with a step-by-step description.  The crochet napkin scheme ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù will best explain the necessary actions. </p><p>  Having successfully coped with the work, we collect all the details together.  First, sew the top row of petals, and then in between the bottom row.  In conclusion, we remove all the strings so that they do not spoil the beauty of the craft.  After that, we use a ready-made napkin for its intended purpose or present it to someone from relatives. </p><h2>  Round napkin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="simple crochet sunflower doily" class="if uuid-3015951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015951.jpg"></div><p>  If the above description and crochet pattern for knitting napkins "Sunflower" seem to be difficult for a beginner, we suggest making a different version of the craft.  It is a circle that can be increased to the desired size.  However, for its implementation should prepare green yarn.  She will serve as a backdrop to our flower.  It is also worth noting that this model can not start with the amigurumi ring.  The rest of the technology is quite simple, and then the reader will be able to verify this on their own: </p><ol><li>  First of all, prepare a black or brown knitting thread and knit a chain of six air loops. </li><li>  We close it in a ring, connecting the first and last loop. </li><li>  We tie the chain with twelve single crochet columns. </li><li>  We knit the next two rows, moving in a circle and from time to time adding loops.  In this case, there are no strict recommendations regarding increases.  Therefore, the reader can navigate on their own. </li><li>  We cut off the working thread. </li><li>  We continue knitting napkins "Sunflower" crochet yellow and green yarn. </li><li>  We knit four columns with yellow yarn and one with green.  Repeat the step to the end of the row. </li><li>  In the next two rows on the yellow petals, increase the number of loops to eight, we also knit one green.  Repeat the step to the end of the row. </li><li>  Increase the number of loops in the yellow petals to ten, knit two loops in green.  Repeat the step to the end. </li><li>  Narrow the petal, knit eight yellow loops and six green. </li><li>  In the next two rows are eight yellow and ten green. </li><li>  We break off the threads, fix and hide.  This completes the creative process. </li></ol><h2>  Napkin with beads </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin crocheted sunflower with beads" class="if uuid-3015961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015961.jpg"></div><p>  The next version of the product under study looks very interesting.  For its implementation should be prepared beads or beads in the amount of one hundred eighty pieces.  Then we take a black or brown thread and, guided by the scheme, we knit the middle.  Change the yarn to yellow and add two more rows.  We take a needle and thread, sew on loops from beads.  Then again use the hook and tie each petal crafts.  This crochet ‚ÄúSunflower‚Äù napkin will not only protect a wooden or other surface, but will also become an excellent decoration of the interior. </p><h2>  Openwork napkin </h2><p>  If the previous version of the crafts seems to the reader insufficient bright and expressive, then we suggest exploring another.  Experienced needlewomen say that it is better for him to use a thin thread and an appropriate sized hook.  The rest of the work is also carried out in a circle, with the allocation of a black or brown center and yellow petals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="openwork crochet napkin" class="if uuid-3015934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3015934.jpg"></div><p>  So we figured out how to crochet a "Sunflower" napkin.  Schemes and descriptions will help novice masters bring an interesting idea to life.  After all, it is not difficult to do this.  You just need to want to. </p>
