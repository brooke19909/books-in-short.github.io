In the marine business there are a huge number of outstanding ships, whose names are known throughout the world.  But not always ships became popular thanks to military battles.  There were those who received fame for other reasons.  We are talking about the ship "Mikhail Somov." </p><h2>  Research scientist </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting a story about this icebreaker with its name.  Like most other ships, this one was named after a famous Soviet explorer.  Mikhail Mikhailovich Somov was born in 1908 in Moscow.  He devoted many years to his beloved business, became a doctor of geographical sciences, and in 1952 he was awarded the Gold <span>Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Somov" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471378.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The father of the future researcher was a fish farmer and professor at one of the country's universities.  Mikhail Mikhailovich himself, also after graduation, began to teach in it.  Already at the age of 30, he had the opportunity to go on an Arctic expedition. </p><p>  Mikhail Mikhailovich was able to survive the Great Patriotic War and was even awarded with medals: ‚ÄúFor the defense of the Soviet Arctic‚Äù, ‚ÄúFor the victory over Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945‚Äù, as well as the <span>Order of the Red Star.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the war, he participated in ice operations in the White Sea flotilla.  Several times helped the ships pass the Arctic, and later defended the small village of Dickson from the German cruiser. </p><p>  After the war, Mikhail Somov managed to return to scientific activity.  He defended his thesis, headed the polar station North Pole 2.  In 1955, he had the opportunity to become the head of the first Soviet Antarctic expedition.  Subsequently, more than once was the commander of research trips. </p><h2>  Birthday </h2><p>  Mikhail Mikhailovich died in 1973.  In the fall of next year, the State Committee for Hydrometeorology and Hydrology of the USSR ordered the project.  They became the ship "Mikhail Somov".  The ship was launched only in February 1975. In the summer of this year, the State flag of the USSR was hoisted on the ship.  On this day, the future conqueror of ice was officially ‚Äúborn‚Äù.  Immediately he was transferred to the management of the Research Institute of the Arctic and Antarctic.  And in the fall of 1975, the first flight took place. </p><h2>  First difficulties </h2><p>  At that time, navigation through the ‚Äúice lands‚Äù was difficult and dangerous.  Despite the fact that the drift was always unpleasant to the team, it was a fairly common thing.  It was probably surprising that the icebreaker Mikhail Somov fell into drift only two years after his first trip. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="icebreaker Mikhail Som" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471375.jpg"></div>

The task of that flight was to equip and change the personnel of the Leningradskaya Arctic Station.  But just on the way to this mission the ship encountered ice with a concentration of 8-10 points.  He stopped moving, hoping for the best.  A little later, the first ice drift in the Ballensky massif began in the life of Mikhail Somov. </p><p>  The crew of the ship was not at a loss.  They even managed to complete the task.  After almost two months, the icebreaker was able to escape from the trap.  For 53 days of "captivity" he sailed more than 250 miles. </p><h2>  Loud event </h2><p>  But a truly high-profile event only happened in 1985.  Then the icebreaker Mikhail Somov set sail for the Ross Sea.  The Russkaya station, which needed supplies and personnel changes, was located nearby. </p><p>  Even then it was known that this Pacific sector of Antarctica is famous for its dangerous "surprises."  The ice masses were very heavy, so the ship spent a lot of time and arrived at the station much later.  It so happened that the Antarctic winter had already begun at the destination. </p><p>  The time has come difficult.  But "Mikhail Somov" could not leave his compatriots.  The ship was supposed to unload fuel and products, as well as change personnel. </p><h2>  Start of trouble </h2><p>  Further events unfolded quickly.  Already on March 15, the ship fell into an ice trap.  A strong wind rose and the team was blocked by heavy ice floes.  The strong cover of the sea was 3-4 meters thick.  It became clear that getting out quickly did not work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rescue operation began.  Now it was necessary to calculate with the help of satellites and air reconnaissance the approximate release dates of the icebreaker Mikhail Somov.  The vessel, presumably, could get out of captivity only by the end of 1985. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Somov photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471377.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the fact that during this time the team could significantly decrease in quantity, there were still problems and even be crushed.  Moreover, such a story has already happened to Chelyuskin.  It was clear that it was necessary to develop a plan to form an ice camp, where the team had to move in order to wait for rescue. </p><h2>  Inaction is not an option </h2><p>  Later it became known that not far from the captured team was the ship "Pavel Korchagin".  But "close" was a rather subjective concept.  By the standards of the Antarctic, it really was close, but in reality there were hundreds of kilometers between the ships. </p><p>  At this time, the country's news channels only said that the fate of the team.  It was urgent to save the ship "Mikhail Somov".  Drift at any moment could ruin the lives of dozens of people.  Then the allegations began that the ship was left to its own devices and it was too late to save someone. </p><p>  In fact, these were just rumors.  Already in April, 77 people were transported by helicopter to the Pavel Korchagin ship.  53 polar explorers still remained on the ship.  These included captain Valentin Rodchenko.  Already in May, cracks in the ice around the ship became noticeable.  There was a hope for salvation.  But it got worse.  The wind carried the ship south. </p><h2>  Help </h2><p>  Already in the early summer of 1985, the government decided to send the Vladivostok icebreaker to the rescue expedition.  In a matter of days, the ship came to the aid of colleagues.  In just 5 days, fuel supplies, equipment and helicopters were loaded onto the ship. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Mikhailovich Somov" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471373.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But the captain of Vladivostok faced an extremely difficult task.  Gennady Anokhin needed to lead the ship so that he himself did not have to be rescued.  Otherwise, this would end the story of the icebreaker Mikhail Somov. </p><p>  The problem was that the vessel of the Vladivostok type had an egg-shaped underwater part.  This was done so that in case of danger, the ship was independently pushed out of the traps.  But Gennady Anokhin was faced with the task of not only getting to ‚ÄúMikhail Somov‚Äù, but also of overcoming the famous latitudes: the forties and fifties, which were famous for their fury and danger. </p><p>  Vladivostok successfully reached New Zealand, there it received another fuel supply and went to Antarctica. </p><h2>  Famous personalities </h2><p>  The story of Mikhail Somov made it possible to meet such brave people as <span>Arthur Chilingarov</span> and Victor Gusev.  The first one at that time was the leader of the rescue operation and, at Vladivostok, was getting to the captives.  The second is the now famous sports commentator.  Few people know, but his career began after the incident with the famous icebreaker. </p><p>  So, when Chilingarov was appointed head of the rescue operation, the polar explorers were not thrilled.  Some even reacted to this with hostility.  But it was Gusev who later defended the official.  He said that Chilingarov is not just a scientist and a traveler, he is an expert in his field, and most importantly, he is devoted to him. </p><p>  The commentator later told a story that is still striking.  It turns out that after sending Vladivostok from New Zealand, the ship caught a storm.  In addition to the fact that the team was not accustomed to such events, the ship was not at all prepared for the weather.  The icebreaker staggered from side to side.  For three <span>days, polar explorers</span> suffered from motion sickness.  Cooks could not do anything.  And only Chilingarov calmly moved around the ship, cooked, if someone asked. </p><h2>  Misfortune after misfortune </h2><p>  While the ship Mikhail Somov survived as best it could, Vladivostok was still struggling with the storm.  At this time, the fuel barrels that the team received in New Zealand began to be washed overboard.  Chilingarov announced to the polar explorers that if they lose 50% of the fuel, then they can reach the captives, but if 51%, the ship will have to return. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the icebreaker Mikhail Som" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471379.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Gusev recalls that everyone who could stand on their feet rushed to tie barrels.  And they did it to which it was only possible.  As a result, it turned out that less than half of the fuel was lost, and the remaining was enough to get to Mikhail Somov. </p><h2>  Victims for salvation </h2><p>  There really was little fuel and food.  The team had to save resources as much as possible in order not only to survive by themselves, but also to save colleagues.  It was decided to wash and bathe only twice a month.  For days, the crew kept cleaning the propeller and steering wheel from the ice.  It was necessary to be as careful as possible, because at stake was the life of not only one's own, but also of colleagues. </p><p>  A month after departure, Vladivostok was able to reach the ship Pavel Korchagin.  Now the course was kept on the diesel electric ship Mikhail Somov.  A week later, the MI-8 helicopter reached the prisoners, bringing the medical personnel and necessary resources on board. </p><h2>  Courage and courage </h2><p>  There were about two hundred kilometers to the ship.  Vladivostok falls into an ice trap.  To this day, <span>Victor Gusev</span> recalls how the crew of the ship left on the ice.  A huge rope was lowered from the ship.  The crew made a hole, brought an anchor into it and began to rock the ship.  A similar practice has already been applied to polar explorers, perhaps even successfully.  But the rescue expedition was unlucky this time. </p><p>  Such events could not be ignored.  Nature decided to give a chance to the sailors, and the next morning the glaciers left Vladivostok alone.  The polar explorers did not have time even for joy.  It was urgent to save colleagues. </p><p>  The events in Antarctica were watched by the entire Soviet Union.  On July 26, at 9 am, Chilingarov and his team reached the captured Mikhail Somov.  Two hours later, the ship was killed and taken under wiring. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ship som Mikhail" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471372.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It was necessary to hurry.  Antarctic winter could catch both crews by surprise.  The ship "Mikhail Somov" was supposed to be taken out of heavy ice.  After almost 3 weeks, the icebreakers went to the open ocean, and after 6 days they reached Wellington, where they were met as real heroes. </p><h2>  New Adventures </h2><p>  It so happened that ‚ÄúMikhail Somov‚Äù was destined for the third time to fall into ice drift.  This did not happen at the right time - in 1991.  In summer, the crew went to the rescue station "Youth".  There he evacuated polar explorers aboard the ship.  But on the way home he was again a prisoner of ice.  In mid-August, the pilots went to rescue the team. </p><p>  The entire crew had to be returned again to the Molodezhnaya station.  And only a couple of days later the Il-76MD aircraft was able to free 190 polar explorers.  The ship continued to be trapped until December 28th.  Nobody came to help him, it was connected with the difficult situation in the country.  And if "Mikhail Somov" was able to escape on its own, then the Soviet Union forever remained "under the cold political ice." </p><h2>  In the ranks </h2><p>  In 2000, the ship was repaired and sent to the Northern UGMS.  To this day, "Mikhail Somov", whose photo remains in the memory of many, serves the benefit of polar explorers.  In the first year after his revival, he successfully completed two voyages, delivering cargo to polar stations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Somov drift" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471374.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The following year there were already seven such expeditions.  In addition to auxiliary flights, research resumed.  In 2003, the icebreaker went on a trip under the Pechora-Shtokman 2003 program, and also made a trip to the Arctic in order to supply researchers with everything necessary. </p><p>  For 16 years, he completed dozens of flights that were connected not only with the help of polar stations, but also with research tasks.  Now he delivers equipment and supplies to stations and border outposts, and also helps to study the Arctic ice.  The ship proudly holds the name of the famous scientist Mikhail Somov, and continues to make its contribution to science. </p><h2>  Awards </h2><p>  The icebreaker, like its famous researcher, was also awarded.  After a difficult and bold expedition in 1985, Mikhail Somov received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for heroically resisting ice drift in Antarctica for 133 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mikhail Somov ship" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1471376.jpg"></div>
