And this was once again proved by their next invention - crocheting rugs from bags.  Such crafts really look very original.  However, their implementation does not require a lot of money.  Moreover, you can successfully use the old plastic bags, creating a spectacular and unusual little thing that will certainly decorate any room. </p><h2>  What explains the popularity of polyethylene mats </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="bag mat crochet step by step" class="if uuid-2999876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999876.jpg"></div><p>  The masters who deal with the studied interior item professionally argue that the technology does not imply complex actions, and the creative process is a very exciting experience.  It allows not only to make an interesting and useful thing ‚Äúfrom what was‚Äù, but also to have fun.  And with a rug crocheted from packages you can decorate not only your interior.  Experienced needlewomen say that such a thing will be a wonderful and certainly memorable gift for loved ones and acquaintances.  In addition, it is not necessary to knit gloomy rugs solely to be placed at the front door or in the hallway.  You can also make a bright and colorful crafts, ideal for decorating the bathroom, kitchen and even the living room.  Of course, if the owners can successfully fit an unusual rug crocheted from packages into the general ensemble of the interior. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Necessary materials and tools </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="rug from packages in a spiral" class="if uuid-2999880" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999880.jpg"></div><p>  To implement your idea you don‚Äôt have to use the whole package.  Previously, it needs to be cut into thin strips.  But first you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  stationery knife; </li><li>  wooden ruler; </li><li>  large and comfortable scissors; </li><li>  a suitable hook (most often use the tool with the number 3, 5 or 7); </li><li>  cellophane bags of various colors. </li></ul><h2>  Yarn preparation </h2><p>  Before you start crocheting rugs from bags, you need to prepare cellophane.  To do this, we straighten and put several packages in a small pile.  We press with a ruler, stepping back from the edge about 4 cm. Experienced craftsmen say that the thicker the bag, the narrower the strip should be.  That is, the ruler should be closer to the edge.  It is also important to try to pick up packages of the same thickness so that the product turns out to be smooth and accurate.  Having measured the required width, we draw a knife along the packet, cutting off the strip.  We ‚Äúcut‚Äù the whole package in this way.  Then we connect the prepared "rings" into a single "thread".  Which we will use to crochet rugs from bags.  This is easy enough to do.  We take two prepared strips, unfold.  We wrap one around the other and thread the tip into the resulting loop.  Tighten.  Thus we connect the edges of all ribbons.  And only then we wind the resulting ‚Äúthread‚Äù into a skein, while slightly twisting it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="mat from packages how to make" class="if uuid-2999871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999871.jpg"></div><h2>  How to knit a square rug </h2><p>  Experienced craftsmen note that polyethylene "yarn" is used in the same way as woolen.  Therefore, you can safely embody various schemes you like.  However, novice needlewomen should still wait a while with the implementation of a complex product.  It is better to start with a simple technology, and having mastered it, continue self-improvement.  Experts agree that crochet square rugs from packages look most interesting.  They are easy to perform, so we offer readers to start with just such a product.  For its implementation, it is necessary to prepare a hook and a skein of "yarn".  After that, make simple manipulations: </p><ol><li>  Tie a chain of six loops and close into a ring. </li><li>  Then knit twelve single crochet stitches.  Three pieces on each side of the square. </li><li>  Between them you need to knit three air loops. </li><li>  Then we continue to knit triple crochets, and between them - three air loops.  In the corners we knit 6 single crochet stitches, making three air stitches between them. </li><li>  We continue this until we reach the desired size of the square.  In this case, you can use various shades of "yarn" and color combinations.  Thus, you can crochet a rug from garbage bags or old colored ones. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="square bag mat" class="if uuid-2999885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999885.jpg"></div><h2>  Make a round rug </h2><p>  Novice masters in various reviews and comments write that round rugs are most easily performed.  Because they do not need to comply with technology.  It is enough just to add loops in time, forming an even circle.  However, experienced craftsmen say that a round rug can start the same way as a square rug.  Although it‚Äôs better to do it right.  To do this, take a plastic "yarn" and wrap it on the index finger of the left hand.  Then carefully remove the loop, tie and tighten, pulling on the initial tip.  As a result of the described actions, a middle without a hole is obtained.  And the product looks much more interesting.  Further crocheting the rug from garbage bags or any other is very simple.  The needlewoman knits single crochet or with one crochet from each loop of the previous row.  And in order to get a beautiful circle, he lifts two new ones from one loop.  This version of the rug is noteworthy in that it is carried out at the request of the needlewoman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="round bag mat" class="if uuid-2999866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999866.jpg"></div><h2>  Cooking mat from plastic pompons </h2><p>  The implementation of this original and simple piece of furniture can be done by the whole family.  It is also worth noting that this is the only model that does not require knowledge of knitting technology.  However, it requires a different set of materials and tools.  First of all, it is a skein of polyethylene "yarn".  And also scissors, a needle with a thread, cardboard, a mosquito net.  Having completed the preparatory phase, we proceed to the creative process: </p><ol><li>  We cut the cardboard into several identical patterns - strips 3-4 cm wide. </li><li>  After doing the pompons.  We wrap the polyethylene "yarn" onto the template, carefully remove it, knit it in the middle and cut the ends. </li><li>  Sew multi-colored pompons to the mosquito net, trying to arrange them closer to each other.  This will allow you to get the original "fluffy" rug. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="rug from bags of pompons" class="if uuid-2999891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999891.jpg"></div><h2>  Knitted doormat mat </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen, talking about how to crochet a rug from packages, note that fantasy has no boundaries, so you can risk fulfilling the idea even in complex technique.  In this case, you should rely on the scheme of your favorite knitted napkin.  However, in this case, it is necessary to prepare a thinner polyethylene "yarn".  And cut packages of selected colors should be in strips of a width of not more than one centimeter.  Then we fasten the material and twist it into a skein.  And already then we begin to knit our ideas. </p><p>  You can use any scheme for this.  Nevertheless, experts recommend starting with a simpler and smaller one.  Therefore, below we suggest our reader to study two options for work.  The first will help to understand and master the technique.  And the second is to make a truly masterpiece of interior.  Which can be presented even as a gift. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="bag mat scheme" class="if uuid-2999567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999567.jpg"></div><h2>  Mat made of motifs </h2><p>  If the needlewoman still cannot determine the degree of her knowledge and patience, experienced craftsmen suggest making a dimensionless rug from plastic bags crocheted.  It is called so because it consists of squares, the number of which the knitter adjusts independently.  Therefore, if suddenly the work gets bored, or the craftswoman wants to make another rug, for example, openwork, it will be possible to interrupt.  In this case, you will not have to dissolve the work begun or to postpone it for future completion.  In addition, it is important to note that it is permissible to choose one or more motives to create your product.  Some experienced needlewomen combine many options, effectively beating the simple ones with bright polyethylene "yarn".  As a result, they get a really interesting and beautiful product that looks no worse than the purchased one.  For our readers, we offer several different schemes.  Among them, you can choose one, or create an unusual rug from all at once. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="mat made of motif bags" class="if uuid-2999582" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2999582.jpg"></div><p>  This concludes our master class.  But the creative path of the needlewoman is just beginning.  Good luck and new ideas! </p>
