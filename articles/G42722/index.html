This is such painstaking work, but chairs, tables, home decorations, handmade baskets and chests look so beautiful.  Yes, weaving from a rod is a difficult hobby and not everyone can afford to weave a small chest for a long time. </p><p>  Skillful craftsmen have found a solution how to replace the vine, while creating the same beautiful products, on paper tubes.  They, of course, are much more malleable and it is much easier to work with them, you can freely use the weaving technique from the rod, greatly simplifying the whole process. </p><p>  All you need to weave a chest of newspaper tubes is a stack of old newspapers and a little patience.  Try to weave with your own hands a small chest, convenient for storing different trifles, in the master class that we have prepared for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself storage chest" class="if uuid-3064867" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3064867.jpg"></div><h2>  Newspaper Trunk Box: Master Class </h2><p>  To create a chest you will need: </p><ul><li>  cardboard box; </li><li>  three sheets of cardboard; </li><li>  Newspapers </li><li>  thick PVA glue; </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  brushes; </li><li>  fabric for decoration; </li><li>  wide braid or dense fabric; </li><li>  various elements for decoration. </li></ul><p>  Weaving trunks from newspaper tubes is divided into three stages: weaving the base, that is, the main part into which various things will be folded, creating a lid, painting and decorating.  But we will begin our master class with the preparation of the main material - with the twisting of newspaper tubes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple do-it-yourself chest" class="if uuid-3064870" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3064870.jpg"></div><h2>  Newspaper tubes </h2><p>  To get started, we‚Äôll prepare more of these elements.  To make a tube of the right size, you need to cut the newspaper into several parts.  Two strips along the edges are the most valuable, because the tubes from them turn out white, but the central ones can also be put into work.  The tubes with letters look interesting in weaving, only emphasizing the peculiarity of the material. </p><p>  On a piece of newspaper about 10 cm wide, lay the needle at an angle of 30 degrees.  Wrap a corner on it and fix it firmly.  With your right hand, rotate the spoke by rolling up the tube, and with your left hand hold the line. </p><p>  Put a little glue on the corner of the strip, wrap it to the end and firmly press it, let the glue grab.  Take out the knitting needle, and put the small tube aside.  One is ready.  Harvest more tubes before weaving. </p><p>  It is clear that such a short tube will not be enough, it needs to be increased.  If they were twisted correctly, then one of the ends will be wider than the other.  The narrower end is simply inserted into the wide end and fixed with a drop of glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Newspaper Chest" class="if uuid-3064873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3064873.jpg"></div><h2>  Chest weaving </h2><p>  Let's start weaving a trunk from newspaper tubes.  The master class begins with the layout of the box on which the chest will trail.  Using a ruler, outline the box with lines with a distance of 2 cm. At the bottom of the box, where the lines are marked, make small cuts, insert the tubes.  Lock.  From the outside, lift the tubes up and tighten with a rope or rubber band, pressing them to the box. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Weave the box with ‚Äúchintz‚Äù weaving, that is, leading the tubes horizontally, alternating the passage of vertical ones from below, then from above.  On the next row, change the rotation.  Weave a box of the height you need. </p><p>  Further cover.  Bend the cardboard with an arc that is suitable in size to the main part of the chest, fix it with rubber bands or wire.  Attach the arc to another cardboard and circle.  Cut the part and seal with tubules.  Tubules can be laid out directly or by weaving "chintz".  Make the same second side plate for the lid.  Glue the parts to the arc.  Also braid the arc itself with weaving "chintz", fixing it with good glue. </p><p>  A trunk of newspaper tubes is almost ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="What a beautiful chest!" class="if uuid-3064872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3064872.jpg"></div><h2>  Assembly and decor </h2><p>  All that remains for us is to connect the two parts of the chest and decorate it.  First, collect the chest.  To do this, leaning the two parts together, fasten them together.  This can be done with the help of threads, stretching them between the rows and tightly tied.  So the lid will remain movable, while not losing during operation. </p><p>  Glue a piece of thick fabric or braid at the junction of the lid and box.  Outside, connect the junction of the two main parts with paper. </p><p>  Inside the box, paste over with thin white paper.  If you glued the tubes to the bottom of the box outside, then cover them with a sheet of cardboard.  For convenience, make small legs from coiled tubes, glue.  From a piece of fabric, cut the lining to size and stick to the glue. </p><p>  Paint the outer surface of the chest with paint, choosing a color to your liking.  Paint over each tube well to hide the color.  After that, cover the basket with several layers of varnish. </p><p>  For the chest, you can make various locks and other decorations, for this you can use the straps of old bags and other accessories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Handmade chest" class="if uuid-3064875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/104524/3064875.jpg"></div><p>  Here is such a beautiful chest of newspaper tubes you can get.  This is an excellent box for storing various things and immodest gift for lovers of handmade. </p>
