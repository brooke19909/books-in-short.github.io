In 1624, a devastating fire occurred in the city.  <span>The king of Denmark</span> and Norway decided not to rebuild the ruined city, but built a new one, calling it Christiania.  In 1814, Christiania became the capital of Norway, and on January 1, 1925 the city was renamed Oslo. </p><p>  Norway consists of 18 f√ºlke - administrative units, which are respectively divided into 430 communes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="norway.nordicvisitor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Oslo Attractions" class="if uuid-2450032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72243/2450032.jpg"></div><h2>  Science and education </h2><p>  Oslo is the most important educational and scientific center of the country.
