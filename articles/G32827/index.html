    <p>  The essence of the procedure is that another bank will pay a loan for the client.  He concludes a new contract with the borrower, according to which a favorable percentage will operate.  Not all lending institutions offer such a service.  Do not delay the solution to the problem.  You need to act as quickly as possible. </p><h2>  The difference from restructuring </h2><p>  Refinancing is different from <span>loan restructuring.</span>  The latter service involves changing the size of the loan, term, rate and other terms of the contract.  It turns out that the client needs to visit the bank, write a statement, for example, on increasing the lending period.  The application will be considered by the bank, after which a decision will be made on the restructuring of the loan.  As a result, a new debt payment schedule will be issued, a new amount, but the contract will be the same. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When refinancing, a new contract is concluded.  The subjects of the agreement are also changing.  This is due to the fact that the procedure can be performed in the same bank or in another.  But banks practically do not refinance their own loans, as it is unprofitable for them.  Therefore, customers need to contact credit organizations working under special programs.  These are the services that Alfa-Bank provides.  These programs have different conditions and requirements for borrowers.  Therefore, you must first familiarize yourself with them before choosing any service. </p><h2>  Conditions </h2><p>  With financial difficulties, refinancing a loan at Alfa Bank will help.  Its conditions are as follows: </p><ol><li>  The loan is issued in rubles. </li><li>  The contract can be drawn up for up to 25 years. </li><li>  Sometimes a deposit is required.  It all depends on the amount of debt. </li><li>  Customers can be residents of the Russian Federation from 21 years. </li></ol>

    <p>  The decision on the application is made by the bank individually.  The client may be refused in case of non-compliance with the requirements. </p><h2>  Online application </h2><p>  It is possible to apply online, which will save a lot of time.  The questionnaire must indicate the name, telephone number, address, amount.  After reviewing the application, a bank specialist will contact the client.  If the decision is positive, then it will be proposed to visit the bank for a loan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  It is necessary to solve the problem with a loan immediately, until the lender has not been given information about delays in the credit bureau.

    <p>  If the decision is positive, the borrower and the new lender sign the contract.  Funds are transferred not to the client, but to the bank where the debt is in effect.  The borrower will be a customer of Alfa-Bank.  He will be given a new contract with his payment schedule. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Requirements </h2><p>  In case of difficulties, you should contact Alfa-Bank.  Refinancing of consumer loans and mortgages will be carried out after familiarization with the situation of the borrower.  The Bank has strict requirements for borrowers.  It is important to have a positive credit history.

Interest rate, maximum amount depend on various factors.  For example, to pay for a consumer loan, up to 1.5 million rubles are issued at 12.2%.  Such conditions apply to payroll clients. </p><p>  <span>Alfa-Bank</span> provides mortgage loan <span>refinancing</span> .  The minimum loan amount is 600,000 rubles.  When registering a service, the balance of the debt should not exceed 85% of the price of real estate.  The maximum amount a bank can provide is 60 million rubles. </p><p>  The rate is determined by the loan term, loan amount, property value.  For salary clients, the rate is 11.25%, and for the rest - more by 0.25%.  The smaller the loan amount, the greater the estimated value of the object and the shorter the loan period, as well as the lower the rate.  The maximum is 19%.

    <p>  If the decision is positive, refinancing is carried out.  Alfa-Bank pays debt in the previous bank.  And the client needs to take a certificate of account closure, termination of the contract.  The new lender must be paid according to the schedule in any convenient and affordable way.  Customers have the same opportunities as ordinary borrowers, so they have access to credit holidays. </p><h2>  Term </h2><p>  The lending period is determined by various factors: </p><ul><li>  purpose of the loan; </li><li>  financial solvency; </li><li>  loan balance; </li><li>  by age. </li></ul><p>  Alfa-Bank now has the opportunity to issue refinancing for up to 25 years.  The minimum term is 5 years, while individuals can fulfill financial obligations ahead of schedule. </p><h2>  Getting and servicing a loan </h2><p>  After transferring funds to the old bank, the borrower needs to take a certificate of debt closure.  After completing the service from the new lender, you can expect: </p><ul><li>  rate increases after a few years; </li><li>  credit vacation opening, which can last several months; </li><li>  extending the term of a loan with financial difficulties. </li></ul><h2>  Payment Methods </h2><p>  After registration of the refinancing, it is necessary to make payments established by the contract every month.  Individuals receive payment schedules, which indicate the amount and terms of payment of funds.  Alfa-Bank customers can increase the amount of payments, which will allow them to repay the debt ahead of schedule. </p>

    <p>  To perform financial calculations with a financial institution, you can choose any convenient payment method: </p><ul><li>  card (you can set auto payment); </li><li>  terminals </li><li>  electronic payment systems; </li><li>  cash offices of financial institutions. </li></ul><h2>  Transaction Features </h2><p>  Refinancing attracts people with favorable conditions.  This is true, but it is necessary to know some nuances in order to successfully conduct a transaction.  The service is convenient if less than half the amount paid is paid.  The reason for this is that many banks offer annuity payment schemes: equal payments consist of most of the interest at the beginning of the term with an increase in the share of the principal debt to completion.  Many borrowers do not pay attention to this, as it is convenient for payment.  But here the credit part is not greatly reduced, and interest is accrued on it.  Sometimes it‚Äôs more profitable to leave a loan in the same bank. </p><p>  Before refinancing, you need to find out what the interest recalculation will be.  It is also necessary to clarify whether there will be penalties for early payment.  It is advisable to complete the transaction before the payment period.  It should be borne in mind that insurance will be required, and this leads to additional costs. </p><p>  Refinancing is really beneficial, as it helps to solve many problems.  But only with a thorough analysis and calculation of the benefits will it be possible to make the right decision, as well as save money. </p><h2>  Service Reviews: Pros and Cons </h2><p>  Refinancing is a profitable offer, especially for customers who cannot afford a loan at another bank.  The main advantage of the service, according to numerous reviews, is a short time for consideration of the application, prompt resolution of the issue, exemption of the borrower from excessive contributions.  Alfa-Bank customers receive low rates.  The organization works with borrowers of retirement age, offering acceptable conditions for them. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantages include the fact that the bank does not work with customers who have overdue debts.  If loan payments have not been made for several months, re-lending will not be possible.  Alfa-Bank does not work with customers who repaid loans ahead of schedule.  This information comes from credit history. </p><p>  Thus, refinancing will be an excellent help to borrowers who have loans from other banks.  With the service, you can reduce the percentage or reduce payments.  The main thing is to seek help in a timely manner. </p>
