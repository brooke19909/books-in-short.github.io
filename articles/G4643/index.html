    <p>  Today Ostankino is a manor that can be seen in many TV shows and films. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Ostankino was first mentioned in documents dating from 1558.  In those days, on the site of the current estate was a village belonging to Alexei Satin.  It was called Ostankino.  Somewhat later, the curator of the state press, clerk Vasily Shchelkanov, became the owner of this settlement.  In Ostankino, on his orders, a boyar house was erected, a church was built, a grove was planted, and a pond was dug.  However, during the Time of Troubles, most buildings were razed to the ground. </p><p>  Restoration of buildings began in the 17th century.  At this time, the lands of Ostankino began to be owned by Prince Cherkassky.  By his order, in the place of a shabby wooden church, a stone was erected, a cedar grove was planted, and hunting grounds were set up in the estate.  For princes Cherkassky, these lands belonged for almost a century until Varvara Alekseevna Cherkasskaya (the only daughter of the estate owner) became the wife of Count Peter Borisovich Sheremetev.  Ostankino was the <span>dowry of the bride.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  At Sheremetyevo, alleys and a garden appeared on the estate, and entertainment pavilions began to be built.  On the orders of the new owner, greenhouses began to plant decorative and agricultural crops. </p><h2>  Heyday </h2><p>  A new stage in the formation of the history of Ostankino began under Count Nikolai Petrovich Sheremetyev.  He was a true connoisseur and art connoisseur, one of the most educated people of that period and a passionate theater-goer.  Ostankino is a manor where Sheremetyev was able to fulfill his dream.  The count created the theater and palace complex on the estate.  Construction work has been carried out for six years since 1792. After that, the estate of Ostankino acquired its final shape. </p><p>  <span>The Sheremetyevo Palace</span> was erected according to the designs made by outstanding architects of the 18th century.  Among them are V. Brenn, F. Camporezi and I. Starov.  The fortress architect I. Argunov also took part in the construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ostankino estate opening hours" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/472419.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the construction of the building was used wood.  After that, the palace was plastered under a stone.  The final architectural ensemble of the estate began to include a theater, a small front yard.  The territory was adorned with a pond, as well as landscape and regular gardens. </p><h2>  The building for staging performances </h2><p>  The best European theaters of those years became examples in the design of the palace, built by Count Sheremetyev.  The hall, made in the shape of a horseshoe, was decorated in pink and blue.  The layout of this room provided excellent audibility and visibility from all its corners.  The hall is designed for two hundred and fifty spectators.  The scene in which the actors played was one of the largest in Russia.  Its depth was twenty-two meters, and its width was seventeen.  Served the lower stage, as well as the upper two-story engine rooms.  The last of them has partially survived to the present. </p><p>  In order to get into the theater hall, it was necessary to go through the right or left Sentsi.  Through the left, spectators fell into the foyer of the stalls, which was located in the western wing of the building.  The Italian pavilion was also located here.  Its design in greenish-blue tones resembled a park area.  Through the right Sentsi, visitors entered the upper foyer, the halls of which were located directly one after another.  At the very end was an art gallery.  The Ostankino Theater is interestingly arranged.  It could be quickly transformed into a ballroom. </p>

At the same time, the bulk of the invited guests were direct participants in this event. </p><h2>  Architectural complex </h2><p>  Ostankino is a manor whose construction was divided into several stages.  After the construction of the main wooden building of the theater, several more structures were attached to it.  The mezzanine foyer was built, the Egyptian and Italian pavilions, as well as galleries, were symmetrically located.  All these structures in terms of a U-shaped complex.  At the same time, the general axis of the Sheremetyevs estate near Moscow was oriented towards the Kremlin.  An interesting decision was made in the design of the front yard and outbuildings.  Together they resembled a stage space. </p>

    <p>  The Sheremetyevs estate in Ostankino is distinguished by its classical simplicity.  At the same time, the latter is combined with an abundance of gilding and mirrors used in the design of the interior of the premises.  The rooms of the palace were decorated with valuable works of art. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  He built the Sheremetyev estate for his beloved, the serf actress Praskovya Kovaleva-Zhemchugova, with whom he was secretly married.  Not far from the estate appeared the Amusement Garden.  When planning it, various types of elements of the park area were combined.  Together, they composed an interesting composition.  A shaft was erected around the garden.  Behind it, on the east side, there were huts for servants, and on the west - a greenhouse and a horse yard. </p><p>  The territory to the north was turned into a surplus garden.  It laid paths for walking, planted trees and dug a pond.  Near the nearby Kamenka River, the area was also ennobled.  Here they dug a cascade of ponds.  In those days, Ostankino was the estate where the secular society of the capital gathered.  Various events and holidays were held here, as well as performances were shown. </p><h2>  New estate life </h2><p>  In the 19th century  Sheremetyevs moved to St. Petersburg.  From this time on, they began to visit their estate only occasionally.  However, despite the absence of hosts, on holidays they still continued to arrange festivities during which representatives of the secular circles of the capital gathered in the Amusement Garden.  Ordinary people on the banks of the pond had picnics.  A little later, the managers of the Moscow region estate of the Sheremetev family began to hand over manor buildings to their summer cottages.  At the same time, the palace could be examined by special permission, and then it was completely turned into a private museum. </p><h2>  The fate of the estate after the October Revolution </h2><p>  The estate of Ostankino (see photo below) after the advent of Soviet power was nationalized. </p>

    <p>  Collecting was a favorite pastime for most noble people.  The Sheremetyevs were also fond of this.  Their collections are presented in the first hall of the museum.  After visiting the unique items collected here, visitors are invited to go to the gallery.  On the walls of this room hang various drawings, designs and measured drawings of the 18th century.  All of them are associated with design and construction work carried out during the construction of the palace in the Ostankino estate.  Further, visitors go to the Italian Pavilion, which is the most luxuriously decorated in the estate.  It contains a corridor leading to Count Sheremetyev‚Äôs office.  However, guests are not allowed into it.  The Italian pavilion with the Engraving Gallery is connected by the Prohodnaya gallery.  This room is an integral part of the lower lobby of the theater.
