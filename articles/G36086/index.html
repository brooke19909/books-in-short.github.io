    <h2>  Mari Beach 3 * (Crete): reviews on the location, equipment and food at the hotel </h2><p>  In order for people planning to spend their holidays at the three-star Cretan hotel ‚ÄúMarie Beach‚Äù to have a more complete and closer to reality picture of this place, we offer you to get acquainted with the impressions of our compatriots who happened to be here.  Looking ahead a bit, we note that most tourists were very pleased with their choice of hotel.  They do not exclude that they will stay here again during a new trip to Crete, and they are also ready to recommend ‚ÄúMarie Beach‚Äù to all their friends and acquaintances planning a trip to the Greek coast.  But let's understand everything in more detail. </p><p>  So, let's start with the numbers.  According to tourists, they are quite spacious, clean and pleasantly decorated.  In addition, it is noticeable that recently a repair was carried out in Mari Beach 3 * (Crete).  Here you are unlikely to find new and modern furniture and appliances, but the whole situation is in good and working condition.  Another advantage of our compatriots was the fact that almost all of the hotel rooms offer magnificent views of the sea and mountains.  So, sitting on the balcony, you can enjoy the pleasant sea breeze, the azure surface and the sound of the waves.  In addition, tourists were pleased with the fact that the rooms have safes.  You can use them for an additional fee.  Travelers also note the presence of a Wi-Fi signal in the rooms.  However, he was not equally good everywhere.  Our compatriots were also satisfied with the quality of cleaning, as well as the regularity of changing linen and towels. </p><p>  Many tourists respond positively to the location of Marie Beach.  So, the hotel is located literally a couple of tens of meters from the beach in a calm and quiet place.  To the objects of tourist infrastructure, guests of Mari Beach 3 * (Crete) can literally walk in 5-10 minutes.  Therefore, nothing will hinder your relaxed vacation.  At the same time, if you wish, you can always quickly get to any entertainment.  From the hotel it is convenient to travel to the surrounding settlements, as there is a bus stop next to it.  In addition, experienced travelers strongly recommend that all vacationers in Crete rent a car for at least a couple of days and travel to interesting places on this Greek island. </p><p>  Almost every tourist who writes a review about a hotel considers it his duty to dwell on the topic of food.  Marie Beach was no exception to this rule.  So, most of the guests of this hotel were quite satisfied with the quality of the food they offered.  Our compatriots basically ate on an all-inclusive system.  According to them, you could eat five times a day if desired.  In addition to the main meals, guests were also offered to have a delicious pastry between breakfast and lunch, as well as a couple of hours before dinner.  In addition, many tourists pay attention to the fact that most of the products offered in the hotel restaurant are natural and are produced on the own farm of the owners of Mari Beach 3 * (Greece, Crete).  This applies to fruits, vegetables, cheeses and other dairy products, as well as meat.  Agree, eating environmentally friendly products grown and made before your eyes is a pretty nice bonus to an already wonderful vacation on the sea coast.  Of course, the choice of dishes here was not as extensive as in five-star hotels, but the quality of the products and their masterful preparation left few indifferent. </p>
