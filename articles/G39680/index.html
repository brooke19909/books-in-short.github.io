Although there are fewer positive ones, it is worth paying attention to them.  So, negative reviews: </p><ul><li>  a lot of people gather for breakfast, you have to wait a long time, as there is a lot of work; </li><li>  food is more suitable for local; </li><li>  the pool is open only until 20:00; </li><li>  the restaurant has a small room; </li><li>  the third berth is not very comfortable; </li><li>  in the parking lot you need to drive the car only with the help of staff; </li><li>  no spa; </li><li>  no sauna; </li><li>  small pool. </li></ul><p>  Still, negative reviews are much less than positive.  Many guests claim that the hotel fully justifies the cost.  The value for money is perfect.  Even a five-star hotel does not always have the same service and comfort as here. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we can conclude that vacationers from all countries can come to a four-star hotel.  Here they will receive comfortable conditions, excellent service and see many fascinating sights.  For example, Discover Al Bastakiya Quarter.  Unfortunately, in the photo it is impossible to convey the beauty of this landmark of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jalan2.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dubai Landmark Discover Al Bastakiya Quarter" class="if uuid-3237386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27224/3237386.jpg"></div><p>  Children will also enjoy the fun and relaxation.  They can always refresh themselves in the children's pool, which is open from morning to evening.  And the beach, warm sand and sea air will help children improve their health. </p>
