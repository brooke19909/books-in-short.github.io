For a long time, our compatriots were scared by the unstable political situation inside this country, but by now it has stabilized as much as possible, and Russian tourists have begun to actively buy up tours in this direction.  Four-star hotel complexes are in great demand, which can provide guests with a high level of comfort. </p><p>  One of these hotels is Le Soleil Bella Vista Hotel, and it was he who received a lot of positive reviews from tourists in the current holiday season.  Interest in this hotel complex is very high, so today we decided to describe it in detail.  We will give readers a brief description of Le Soleil <span>Bella Vista Resort</span> Hotel, talk about its infrastructure and features.  In some sections, we will rely on the feedback of our compatriots who this year had a rest in this hotel complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le soleil bella vista hotel" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2033945.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Le Soleil Bella Vista Hotel: description </h2><p>  This hotel is considered quite new, because it was commissioned in the early nineties of the last century.  During construction, very serious requirements were made to the design, and as a result, a magnificent complex appeared in front of the guests, successfully combining the Moorish traditional style with modern technologies.  Oriental flavor is read in the appearance of the hotel and in the design of rooms, and the beautiful green area creates a certain atmosphere of bliss and luxury. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLe Soleil Bella Vista Hotel is about eighty thousand square meters.  With the full occupancy of the hotel complex, free space is barely enough for all guests, so many tourists are advised to come here in September-October, when the flow of travelers decreases markedly.  I would like to add that the territory of Le Soleil Bella Vista Resort Hotel looks very well-groomed and conducive to relaxation, and the palm grove spread around the hotel is a real highlight of the whole complex. </p><p>  Recent repairs were carried out at the hotel about six years ago.  Tourists often note that the number of rooms looks quite decent, and describe the hotel in bright colors. </p><p>  Le Soleil Bella Vista Hotel has two buildings in which five hundred and two rooms are equipped.  They can simultaneously accommodate a little more than one thousand people.  Guests are offered a choice of four room categories. </p><p>  Based on the reviews of Le Soleil Bella Vista Resort Hotel, we can say that the hotel complex is well suited for a relaxing and measured stay.  Here, children and those who want to completely disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life feel great. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The location of Le Soleil Bella Vista Resort Hotel (Tunisia) is detailed in all brochures.  And tourists themselves more than once described in their reviews in what a magnificent place the hotel was built.  It is located in the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSkanes, which is famous for its wide beaches with golden sand and the clear waters of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The city of Monastir (Le Soleil Bella Vista Resort Hotel is often located in this place in advertising booklets) is located only eight kilometers from the hotel.  If you translate this distance into the time period, it turns out no more than fifteen minutes by bus or taxi. </p><p>  It‚Äôs nice that it takes only five minutes to get from the international airport to Le Soleil Bella Vista Hotel.  The distance separating them does not exceed one kilometer.  Our compatriots often record this fact in the clear advantages of the hotel, because after a long flight, I so want to be in a cool and comfortable room as soon as possible. </p><p>  About fifteen kilometers from the hotel is the city of Sousse.  Our compatriots often come here for excursions.  However, they do not recommend going to the city unaccompanied by males.  Of course, no one will offend a single woman, but, believe me, she will be very uncomfortable walking in the streets and shops. </p><p>  Almost opposite the hotel complex is a ground metro station and a bus stop.  Having paid two or three dinars, tourists can be in the nearest resort town in ten minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le soleil bella vista resort hotel" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2034036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Le Soleil Bella Vista Resort Hotel 4 * has a very beautiful beach, which is praised by almost all tourists.  Many consider it a real advantage of this hotel complex. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach area is a wide strip of golden sand, which is regularly cleaned by hotel staff.  There are three rows of sun loungers, so they are enough for all guests. </p><p>  The entrance to the water is gentle, and the sea in this part of the coast is rather shallow, therefore it is suitable for bathing children and those who do not feel very confident on the water. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel itself and the beach area are carefully guarded.  If outsiders can still enter the hotel grounds, citing the need to visit the store, then the coast is not available to them.  Tourists will not be annoyed by local merchants, who often spoil the rest at other resorts. </p><p>  The only minus of the beach area, our compatriots consider the abundance of jellyfish in the water.  In the summer months they are especially active and sting bathers rather painfully.  Even in adults, redness occurred, which later transformed into bruises.  With the onset of September, jellyfish swim to the shore less and less and are no longer interested in those who are in the water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="le soleil bella vista hotel photo" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/2034034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Photos of Le Soleil Bella Vista Hotel are quite beautiful, but it‚Äôs extremely difficult to determine how developed the infrastructure for vacationers is.  Therefore, we will try to fill this gap and give readers a description of everything that awaits them at the hotel. </p><p>  Tourists spend a lot of time by the pool with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost six hundred squares.  It has a spacious recreation area, which is almost always occupied by vacationers of Arab origin.  And in the evenings our compatriots gather here, having fun until the morning. </p><p>  The pool has slides, so both adults and children have something to occupy themselves with while swimming.  However, be very careful, many Russians in the reviews write that the pool cover near the slides is very slippery and because of this, tourists receive various injuries several times a day. </p><p>  Hotel guests can use two conference rooms.  Both of them are quite small, accommodate thirty and forty people.  But here is everything you need to successfully conduct a business meeting or a festive event. </p><p>  The territory has eight bars and restaurants, whose staff will not allow guests to stay hungry.  The food here is very tasty, our compatriots especially praise the national cuisine and sweets. </p><p>  At the 24-hour reception there are no employees who speak Russian.  However, the simplest requests are understood by both the front desk and the maids.  The receptionist is at the reception from the earliest morning to evening, he promptly responds to any requests and comments, so do not be shy to contact this friendly person. </p><p>  The hotel has laundry facilities and a beauty salon.  At the reception, guests can exchange currency, place valuables in a safe or rent a transport, for the storage of which a spacious parking lot is equipped. </p><h2>  Compliments </h2><p>  The hotel administration loves its guests very much, so it provides them with several options for compliments: </p><ul><li>  for regular customers; </li><li>  on the wedding anniversary; </li><li>  welcome </li><li>  for newlyweds; </li><li>  in honor of the birthday. </li></ul><p>  Regular guests can count on a whole range of discounts and bonuses, which include a discount on visits to a beauty salon, a basket of fruits and wine, as well as a welcome letter from the administration of the complex. </p><p>  During check-in, guests receive a cool cocktail as a compliment. </p><p>  If you plan to celebrate the wedding anniversary in Tunisia, then you will be sure to be congratulated with the most delicious cake.  The birthday men will also not be left without their cake; in addition, a table will be decorated for them in the main restaurant. </p><p>  Newlyweds should warn about their holiday in advance, in which case wine and fruit will be delivered to their room. </p><h2>  Check In Rules </h2><p>  The rules at this hotel are standard, but you must know them before booking Le Soleil Bella Vista Resort Hotel.  For example, check-in occurs after two in the afternoon.  Many of our compatriots write in reviews that they were settled without much persuasion much earlier than the specified time.  But often they tried to give the keys to the apartments easier than those that were paid.  When an error was indicated, the situation was instantly corrected. </p><p>  It is necessary to check out of the room before noon, by this time guests must pay all bills and hand over the keys to the front door. </p>

    <h2>  Free and paid services </h2><p>  The hotel complex provides guests with a large number of services of a different nature.  Many modern tourists cannot imagine their life without Wi-Fi, he catches quite well at the hotel, and guests are satisfied with the connection. </p><p>  If you need food or drinks in your room, you just need to call the reception and the staff will immediately deliver everything ordered. </p><p>  The list of paid services is quite wide, we will not list them all.  However, keep in mind that for the hotel staff there is practically nothing impossible when they want to please guests.  For example, they are ready to pack your luggage before leaving, so that you do not take away your last precious minutes of relaxation.  This service costs about five dollars. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  Guests with children often come to the hotel, so they are well prepared for their reception.  For small guests there is a swimming pool with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãthirty-six squares, its depth does not even reach half a meter.  Also, kids can spend their time in the pool with slides.  Its area is one hundred forty-four squares. </p><p>  If your child likes to be in motion, then a playground will suit him.  It has various designs that are ideal for active kids. </p><p>  The hotel has a mini club.  Here you can safely leave children from four to twelve years old.  Among the animators there is a Russian girl who will quickly find the most suitable occupation for the child. </p><p>  There is no children's menu in the restaurant, so if you go to the hotel with a baby, be sure to bring baby food with you.  Otherwise, you will experience serious difficulties with feeding your offspring. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about nutrition </h2><p>  The hotel complex operates on an all-inclusive basis.  This is another reason why people here are happy to go on vacation with the kids.  The main restaurant Le Carnavale accommodates seven hundred guests, it operates according to the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  from seven to ten in the morning breakfast; </li><li>  brunch lasts until eleven in the morning; </li><li>  dinner begins at thirteen hours and lasts two hours; </li><li>  for dinner, the first guests come at seven in the evening, the meal ends at half past ten in the evening; </li><li>  from eleven o'clock in the evening until midnight, late dinner lasts. </li></ul><p>  The hotel has several a la carte restaurants: </p><ul><li>  La Fiesta.  In this Italian restaurant you can have dinner for free once during your vacation, but only by appointment (dinner starts at seven in the evening and ends at ten in the evening).  The institution is designed for fifty people. </li><li>  Mediterrano.  Here you can taste delicious Mediterranean cuisine with an abundance of seafood.  The restaurant has a lounge and an outdoor terrace.  The hall can accommodate one hundred people, under the starry sky there are enough places for only thirty hotel guests. </li><li>  Neptune Pub.  This roomy establishment will accommodate one hundred people.  But in the open air there are even more tables that can accommodate up to four hundred guests. </li></ul><p>  Bars have their own work schedule: </p><ul><li>  The Kiosk.  The cafe opens immediately after breakfast and offers guests a large selection of snacks. </li><li>  Piano bar.  This poolside bar opens its doors at six in the evening.  The institution works until midnight. </li><li>  Cafe Maure.  Here, all guests can try the hookah, the schedule of the bar is identical to the previous one. </li><li>  El Mahfel.  The bar is located in a disco and serves dancers.  It opens at half past ten in the evening and closes at two in the morning. </li></ul><p>  I would like to add that in all a la carte restaurants it is strictly forbidden to come in shorts. </p><h2>  Room Feature </h2><p>  The apartments in the hotel are pretty well equipped.  They have everything you need, although guests often write that they need updating.  This is not too striking, but a little annoying holidaymakers.  The rooms are divided into the following categories: </p><ul><li>  two hundred and fifty-nine standards; </li><li>  one hundred twenty-five superior; </li><li>  one hundred and eight apartments designed for four guests; </li><li>  ten suites. </li></ul><p>  In each issue, the TV shows several Russian channels, which gives an orientation specifically to our tourist. </p>
