Sometimes it is necessary to change the situation and, perhaps, it is worth going to one of the European capitals.  Holidays in Stockholm are an opportunity to wander through museums, taste local cuisine in numerous restaurants, take a walk in parks and go on exciting excursions, and simply become a part of this city, which has a rich culture and offers a lot of entertainment.  Here you can see an example of true European life and learn from the locals calm and <span>peace of mind.</span>  Stockholm hotels offer vacationers many services and additional services.  This city is rightfully considered one of the most environmentally friendly in Europe.  We can say that it consists of water, greenery, buildings and clean air in equal proportions. </p><p>  Cultural leisure in Stockholm is amazing.  Here you will find about 150 museums, many galleries, exhibitions and festivals.  You can endlessly admire the architecture of local buildings or a trip to the world famous opera.  A cultured, educated person will appreciate both Stockholm hotels and local attractions. </p><p>  In addition, Stockholm is a European shopping center.  Here you can buy quality goods at attractive prices, and even hear the Russian speech of local sellers.  In different areas of the city you will get products of folk art, things of world fashion brands, high-quality household appliances, electronics, as well as products from art glass.  And jewelry of fashion designers will not leave indifferent any woman. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Five-star Stockholm hotels will take you to the highest level.  Of course, other hotels that have a lower category are worthy of attention, but if you can afford it financially, it is better to stay in the best ones.  The most famous hotel in the city - Grand Hotel, represents a <span>classic style.</span>  The rooms have different categories, but they offer views of the Royal Palace, the Old Town and other attractions.  The hotel is famous for its restaurants.  Here you can taste a varied cuisine and get acquainted with Swedish traditions.  You are also pleased to visit the gym, sauna, fitness center, and the Spa center offers guests a wide range of various wellness and relaxation treatments. </p><p>  Hotels in Stockholm are also worthy of the First Hotel Reisen.  It has recently been refurbished and now attracts guests with a contemporary design that blends in perfectly with the classics.  The hotel consists of 5 seven-story buildings with different categories of rooms.  Here you can hold a banquet or business conference, visit the pool, which is located in the former wine cellar and impresses with its medieval atmosphere. </p><p>  Recently opened a new hotel Nobis Hotel, which is located in the city center.  He has not yet managed to earn any reputation, but it is safe to say that he can compete well with his brothers.  The hotel has 201 rooms and also invites guests to <span>an Italian restaurant,</span> fitness center and spa. </p><p>  The Clarion Sign Hotel is Nordic, but the friendly and pleasant atmosphere always lures customers here.  558 rooms, well-equipped, large conference rooms, a spa complex, an outdoor pool and the wonderful Aquavit Stockholm Restaurant. </p><p>  Reviews of Stockholm hotels are various.  It all depends on the category of hotel.  People, of course, complain more about three-star and four-star hotels.  Some find the disadvantages in the organization of accommodation, food or service level.  But in general, the owners of local hotels are trying to do everything for a comfortable stay for their guests. </p>
