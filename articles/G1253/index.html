    <h2>  Short hotel description </h2><p>  Wassermann Hotel 3 * is described as a hotel, which is ideal for family tourists.  However, its convenient location allows you to consider it and those who love outdoor activities and prefer to spend most of the time outside the walls of the hotel complex. </p><p>  The Wassermann Hotel 3 * was built in the early nineties and worked without major repairs for more than twenty years.  Therefore, in 2013 there was a need for large-scale renovation, which was carried out over several months.  For four years now, the hotel has been welcoming its guests with chic interiors and impeccable rooms, which invariably evoke positive reviews from guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Wasserman Hotel (Kemer) is approximately one and a half thousand squares.  The hotel complex is small, as it has only forty-seven rooms.  Several three-story buildings are arranged in a rectangle and interconnected. </p><h2>  Location of the hotel complex </h2><p>  We already mentioned in passing that the hotel has a very convenient location, suitable for any category of tourists, without exception.  To be more precise, we can say that it is located in the center of Kemer.  From here it is easy to get to almost anywhere in the resort town, and if you wish, you can even go to another place to see historical sights, of which there are quite a lot in the vicinity of the resort. </p><p>  From the center of <span>Kemer, where the</span> hotel <span>is</span> located, you will have to go to the airport terminal for a rather long time.  Keep in mind that all flights from Russia arrive at Antalya Airport.  The way there or back stretches for a long fifty kilometers.  If there are no traffic jams, you can get to the hotel in about one and a half to two hours.  However, keep in mind the fact that tourists are usually met by a representative of the host country and transported on the same transport to different hotel complexes.  Therefore, the trip may well drag out. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  As you know, a hotel located in the city cannot be large.

However, all that you need to have in a hotel with three stars, Kemper Wassermann Hotel 3 * will provide you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel complex is occupied by an outdoor pool.  The water bowl of one hundred and sixty squares is clean, and around it there is a relaxation area, almost completely lined with sun loungers and parasols.  The pool is open from eight in the morning until seven in the evening. </p><p>  There is one restaurant and a bar on the territory of the Wasserman Hotel (Kemer).  It is in them that all the guests of the hotel complex eat.  If desired, guests can organize a festive or business event in the conference room.  It consists of a small office-type meeting room and a banquet hall.  It usually hosts receptions with a different number of guests. </p><p>  The 24-hour front desk offers car rental and a safe.  For using it, you need to pay a certain amount of money.  For rented vehicles there is parking.  You can leave your car here for free, so there are few free parking spaces. </p><p>  Guests wishing to relax from all everyday worries are happy to use the laundry and dry cleaning services.  In just a few hours, guests' clothes will be put in order and returned in perfect condition to the room. </p><h2>  Hotel Wasserman, Kemer: service </h2><p>  Each traveler is very interested in how comfortable he will be in the hotel complex.  Therefore, many of the reviews are trying to get information about the level of service and the range of services provided. </p><p>  Wasserman Hotel in Kemer provides free Wi-Fi.  The signal level in the hotel complex is pretty good, which makes it possible to freely communicate with relatives who have remained at home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If necessary, guests can take advantage of room service.  At one call from the apartment, the hotel staff will bring vacationers any food and drinks from the restaurant. </p><p>  If you do not want to get from the airport with other tourists, then agree on an individual transfer when booking.  Of course, you will have to pay extra for this service, but you will find yourself in your hotel complex in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  Please note that guests of the Wasserman Hotel (Turkey) can use sun loungers absolutely free not only by the pool, but also on the beach.

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  It is for the sake of the affectionate Mediterranean Sea that so many tourists travel to Turkey every year, so they are primarily interested in the condition of the hotel's beach. </p><p>  Kemper Wassermann Hotel 3 * has its own beach area several hundred meters long.  It consists of fine sand, which is so popular with kids of any age. </p><p>  Going to this hotel complex, remember that it is located on the second coastline.  From the hotel to the sea you need to walk about two hundred meters. </p><p>  The beach is equipped with everything necessary for an excellent holiday, because most of the guests spend almost the whole day here, returning to the hotel only for eating and sleeping. </p>

    <h2>  Should I come to the hotel with children? </h2><p>  This question is often asked by those who are just planning to buy a tour to this hotel.  Therefore, we analyzed the reviews of guests and found out what services and entertainment are provided at the hotel to the kids. </p><p>  Of course, Wasserman is not quite a typical Turkish hotel complex, in which each guest will find a lot of entertainment for himself.  Here, their selection is quite modest, but do not forget that the hotel has only three stars. </p><p>  For children, a special compartment in the adult pool is allocated and a playground is equipped.  It is not large in size and it will be interesting only to very small guests. </p><p>  In each room, you can install an extra bed for a child absolutely free.  This request must be voiced at the time of purchase of a tourist permit or booking a room via the Internet. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Wasserman in Kemer: room description </h2><p>  It is worth saying that almost all apartments in the hotel complex are one class - standard.  These are the most popular and common rooms in the hotel.  Of the forty-seven numbers, twenty-seven are standards.  The hotel also has two family rooms and nineteen triple apartments. </p><p>  All are equipped approximately the same.  Each room has cable TV, air conditioning and telephone.  Use of the telephone is paid. </p><p>  Also included in the room are additionally paid services and a minibar.  Its replenishment occurs as a result of emptying.  All apartments have excellent Internet access and a balcony.  Some rooms have a spacious terrace instead of a balcony. </p><p>  Not all apartments are equipped with a safe, so you should take care of the safety of your valuables in advance.  Although cases of theft in the hotel for all the years of its existence are not marked. </p><p>  In the reviews of the Wasserman hotel in Kemer, a lot of attention was paid to the description of the rooms.  Guests often mention that some apartments need updating.  This is noticeable in furniture and bedding, on which you can notice tears.  Also in the comments is mentioned and not always high-quality room cleaning, after which dirty stains and dust remain. </p>

    <h2>  Entertaining activities </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the hotel we are describing is not quite typical for Turkey.  Therefore, here guests will not be able to find a lot of entertainment for themselves.  The most popular are baths and massages.  These services are provided at an additional cost. </p><p>  Also, vacationers can rent bicycles for money.  They are very convenient to explore the surroundings of Kemer, because there are quite a lot of bicycle paths equipped for skiing. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there is a small and cozy spa center, which will offer guests various programs for improving the body and maintaining beauty. </p><h2>  restaurants and bars </h2><p>  The hotel operates on a half-board basis, however, it should be borne in mind that you are not waiting for the same variety of dishes as in five-star hotel complexes.  Mostly guests eat in a restaurant with international cuisine.  This is where breakfast, lunch and dinner are served. </p><p>  In addition, the restaurant has a restaurant, where dishes are ordered only by the menu and an outdoor terrace, which is almost a separate restaurant.  Fans of fun songs can spend time in karaoke.  This bar is the most popular in the hotel, so it is here in the evenings that many hotel guests gather. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel guest reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the Wasserman hotel in Kemer are quite numerous.  Therefore, it was not difficult for us to analyze them, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of this hotel complex.  Let's start with the cons.  It is worth saying that they are very typical for the "treshka": </p><ul><li>  monotonous and tasteless nutrition; </li><li>  small and uncomfortable safe; </li><li>  lack of drinks during dinner; </li><li>  lack of an all-inclusive system; </li><li>  weak internet signal; </li><li>  a large number of people from Europe, which often arranges brawls and walks until the morning. </li></ul><p>  Also, our compatriots noted many advantages of living in this hotel: </p><ul><li>  convenient location; </li><li>  Russian-speaking staff; </li><li>  excellent hamam; </li><li>  clean pool; </li><li>  lack of intrusive animation; </li><li>  The optimum ratio of price and quality; </li><li>  friendly staff. </li></ul><p>  So is it worth buying a ticket to this hotel?  It‚Äôs quite difficult to answer unequivocally, but many of our compatriots consider it an excellent option for those who are limited in means, but still dream of spending a couple of weeks at sea. </p>
