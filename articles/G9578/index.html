Guest reviews focus on such negative points: </p><ul><li>  entrance doors are massive and slam strongly at closing (it would not hurt to install closers); </li><li>  inconvenient location of plumbing in the bathroom; </li><li>  due to the thin walls between the rooms there is a strong audibility (this problem is especially acute for adjacent rooms); </li><li>  near the hotel there is a busy driving road, the movement on which does not stop even at night (of course, this is accompanied by a loud noise, which is heard even when the windows are closed); </li><li>  an old dirty carpet needs to be replaced or at least dry cleaned (it is very unpleasant to see numerous spots on a bright floor); </li><li>  if you arrive not at the beginning, but towards the middle or at the end of breakfast, you will find the food trays almost empty (there are very few dishes on the distribution, they are not replenished); </li><li>  not all rooms have windows overlooking beautiful city views (from some rooms you can observe only the wall or roof of a neighboring building); </li><li>  when corporate events or holidays are held in the hotel restaurant, noise is heard until late at night throughout the hotel; </li><li>  by default, toothbrushes and bathrobes are not provided in the bathroom (they can be taken for free at the reception, but not all guests know about this, no one warns about this); </li><li>  when booking a room, you cannot predict which side the windows will face; </li><li>  malfunctioning iron (when filling the tank with water, liquid flows through the holes on the sole); </li><li>  poor picture quality, sound on the TV; </li><li>  the interior is "tired" and needs to be updated (in some places scuffs are visible, wallpaper is peeling off in some places); </li><li>  at breakfast there are no fruits, as well as bottled water, so that you can take with you; </li><li>  in the cold season, the rooms are not well heated, and the heater can also not be called a salvation; </li><li>  there is no private parking (you cannot also park cars along the road - a tow truck immediately picks them up); </li><li>  uncomfortable design of the shower cabin (water from the shower does not pour on the bather, on the wall); </li><li>  the restaurant closes at 23:00, and to find an alternative restaurant outside the hotel, you need to go at least 20 minutes; </li><li>  the towels in the rooms are already quite washed; </li><li>  uncomfortable entrance to the hotel; </li><li>  hotel staff do not help guests bring their bags (this is especially important, given that the entrance to the hotel involves climbing stairs); </li><li>  the forced hood works non-stop in the bathroom, and its noise is very annoying (especially at night); </li><li>  the washbasin is very small, so water sprays scatter throughout the bathroom; </li><li>  rooms of various categories do not differ much (which cannot be said about the price); </li><li>  poor-quality bath cosmetics, does not correspond to the level of a four-star hotel; </li><li>  constantly occurring hiccups with the issuance of payment documents (the problem is that management is rarely in place, and documents are not valid without printing it); </li><li>  not all rooms have wireless Internet; </li><li>  in a room designed for two guests, a set of bath and cosmetic accessories is provided for only one (you have to deal with this problem at the reception); </li><li>  the bathroom has few hooks for bathrobes and towels; </li><li>  There is no coffee machine in the restaurant, and instant coffee served at breakfast is tasteless. </li></ul>
