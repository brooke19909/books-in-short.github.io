  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ordinary book or Making an e-book choice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The book has always attracted a person who, by nature, simply must be an inquisitive and creative person.  The appearance of electronic literature is considered to be a very interesting and modern trend of the present time, of our modernized century.  It became possible to easily reproduce any art book, technical or reference information on the monitor screen, and if desired, print it on a sheet of the required format. </p><p>  But progress is moving, and there are devices that are always at hand.  Reading with the necessary information from him is quite comfortable and gives real pleasure.  These devices are called e-books, and choosing an e-book with a lot of pluses rather than minuses can be quite a problem.  Let's try to understand the variety of modern models and solve this difficult task as correctly as possible. </p><p>  <strong>E-book - universal device</strong> </p><p>  The information carrier in the device is electronic filling, and conditionally these carriers can be distinguished into adapted and specialized models.  For example, a mobile phone is designed to make calls, but it is only adapted for reading.  The right choice of an e-book can lead you to the acquisition of a universal specialized device that has a huge amount of functionality, a color display with an acceptable diagonal, and an adequate supply of energy resources. </p><p>  Content - content that is stored in the memory of the device (device) and most often it can be illustrated text, high-quality video with sound or other electronic form.  A potential buyer is not able to imagine all the features of the functionality of a huge selection of models.  He is simply lost in this variety of e-book readers and the final decision on which e-book to buy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Let's talk about technology</strong> </p><p>  The leaders of the 6-inch screens continue to be "E-Ink VizPlex."  Nearby in popularity is ‚ÄúPearl‚Äù, and both <span>have a screen resolution of</span> 600x800 pixels in the presence of 16 shades of gray.  Substantially lags behind SiPix.  Still, the market still remains filled with LCD screens, which already do little to meet the needs, and I don‚Äôt want to talk about monochrome screens. </p><p>  Of interest are E-Ink Triton, Liquavista, Pixel Qi, Qualcomm Mirasol technologies, but Plastic Logic technology, which offered unbreakable screens, can be singled out separately.  Bookeen demonstrated smooth video playback using a display that has <span>electronic ink.</span>  All this is certainly wonderful, but for the average consumer is quite expensive. </p><p>  <strong>How to choose</strong> </p><p>  One must think that the choice of an e-book should be made, starting from the popularity, so that a 6-inch screen is available, and the price corresponds to the category of the product.  2012 promises to please users with new developments, which will have variable display topography, as well as inexpensive models of readers that will be equipped with <span>touch screens.</span> </p><p>  On this basis, an electronic book is usually chosen.  You can choose according to other criteria as you wish or with competent consultation.  You can try to take a closer look, for example, at the Sony PRS-505 or Pocketbook 301. The intuitive and logically complete convenient menu of the PRS-505 is mastered literally on the fly.  The page is refreshing at normal speed.  With all supported formats: Doc, Html, Txt, Pdf, Fb2, Rtf, Chm, Djvu, Jpeg, Wolf, Mp3 + Excel do not forget about adapting the model to the CIS market.  Pure "Japanese" has a spectacular appearance with a metal body and excellent build quality.  Pocketbook 301 is specifically targeted at the CIS - there are no problems with fonts, and uniqueness lies in a clearly thought-out control format.  Choosing an e-book requires at least basic knowledge in this area or competent expert advice. <strong><br></strong> </p>
