    <p>  <span>Of the advantages, it is worth highlighting the ‚Äúzero‚Äù display depth.</span>  <span>Unlike many other gadgets where the display is recessed into the case, in EXEQ Set 2 it is located on the same level with it, which positively affects the perception of the content being played (especially games).</span> </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  <span><span>Portable Game Console</span> EXEQ Set 2 comes with the Cortex A9 chipset.</span>  <span>Two cores are present, the frequency of each of them is 1500 megahertz.</span>  <span>In general, performance is enough to run simple games.</span>  <span>More complex ones, such as Asphalt 8 or Dead Trigger 2, also work, but the frame rate often drops below normal.</span>  <span>Slight slowdowns and "lags" are noticeable in many serious projects developed for Android.</span>  <span>In classic games, these are not observed.</span> </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  <span>Under the hood of this baby, only 1 gigabyte of RAM was found, which is not enough for smooth operation of the operating system, let alone work under load.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  <span>Expecting something supernatural from a device from a lower price category is stupid.</span>  <span>Especially from the Android-based set-top box, where only the similar case is left from the word ‚Äúset-top box‚Äù.</span>  <span>This is not a console from famous brands, developed by professional engineers and, with love for business, honed to the smallest detail.</span>  <span>This device is aimed at ordinary consumers who do not want to give serious money for entertainment, are not well versed in technology, choosing from what is simpler and more affordable.</span>  <span>The product does not meet all the criteria described in the advertising booklets and on the official website.</span>  <span>On the other hand, what is generally worth demanding from a gadget for 4,500 rubles?</span>  <span>He launches modern games from the Google Play Market, he goes on the Internet, shows a movie, on it you can run the game with the good old Sega and comfortably surrender to nostalgia on the way to work.</span>  <span>Therefore, it is not worth judging strictly the manufacturer, the solution will find its consumer and will certainly give many happy minutes to the owners of the EXEQ Set 2. You can buy the console in Moscow only on the used market, official sales are suspended due to the release of more advanced models.</span> </p>
