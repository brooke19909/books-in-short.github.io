    <h2>  Functions and authority of the service </h2><p>  The KGB of the USSR was engaged in operational-search activities, guarding state borders, external search and counterintelligence, and providing government communications.  The committee also fought against dissent, nationalism, and anti-Soviet activity.  The system consisted of individual elements (there were fourteen in all) in the territories of the republics of the union, local authorities, military districts, formations, border troops, research institutions and educational institutions, and many other units.  The KGB (the decoding of which is known to almost every person) in those days had different names and statuses.  Today, this name is used, as a rule, in colloquial speech, when one of the <span>special services of Russia</span> is mentioned <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Committee History </h2><p>  <span>The State Security Committee</span> was formed on February 4, 1954.  It included the <span>USSR</span> Ministry of <span>Internal Affairs,</span> various services and departments.  Colonel General I. Serov became the chairman of the KGB (the decryption of which was officially approved on March 13, 1954).  It is worth noting that the committee was not created in order to become the central public authority.  He was supposed to be a department under the Government of the <span>Soviet Union.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="KGB USSR" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/322187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A feature of the system was the organized department of the KGB of the USSR.  It is known that there were sixteen of them in all, but some sources refute this information, claiming that the number is not precisely determined.  The first headquarters was intelligence, the second was internal security.  Then military counterintelligence, the fight against anti-Soviet elements, transport security, operational search, encryption and decryption and communications, security of the government and party leaders, the command of the Moscow Kremlin commandant, medicine (healthcare), radio interception, electronic intelligence, economic reliability. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Management of the KGB of the USSR" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/322216.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  KGB training </h2><p>  The history of the KGB (the transcript of which is often used today to refer to the Russian special services) is quite extensive and covers almost every area of ‚Äã‚Äãgovernment.  The number of bodies working on the committee was about three hundred thousand people.  Under the KGB there were educational institutions whose purpose was to train and release highly qualified personnel for the state security organs of the Soviet Union.  They included universities, colleges, schools, training centers and special courses.  The activities of the institutions were controlled by the KGB department. </p>
