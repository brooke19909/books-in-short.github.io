Hainan Island is considered the best Chinese health resort, it is also called East Hawaii.  Once upon a time, the island was a place of exile nobles.  And now about this paradise in the South China Sea have heard tourists around the world.  Residents of the Far East and Siberia have long been recovering here, treating ailments, and at the same time basking in the warm sunshine and in clear sea water. </p><h2>  Number of rooms <strong></strong></h2><p>  Palm Beach Resort Spa Sanya is a luxurious four-star complex located in the city center.  The hotel is represented by a variety of apartments of different categories: </p><ol><li>  Standard (for two vacationers). </li><li>  Villa with stunning ocean views and a living room.  The apartments are designed to accommodate six vacationers, there is also one extra bed.  The room has three bedrooms. </li><li>  Deluxe (double room) with ocean view.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment is 58 square meters. </li><li>  The deluxe villa has two living rooms and four bedrooms.  The apartments can accommodate eight tourists (there is one extra bed). </li><li>  Suite with beautiful garden views for two vacationers (with one extra bed).  The room has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã48 square meters. </li><li>  Business Double Apartment (with one large bed). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach resort spa sanya" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431903.jpg" width="555"></div></li></ol><p>  All rooms <span>of the Palm Beach Resort</span> Spa (Sanya) have a balcony, a telephone, a safe, coffee and tea making sets, a modern TV, and wireless internet.  Some apartments have a minibar.  Bathrooms are equipped with hairdryers, slippers, bathrobes.  The hotel has a room service.  The reception desk serves guests around the clock. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Guest room reviews </h2><p>  I would like to note that the <span>Hotel Beach Resort Spa</span> (Sanya) 5 * (guest reviews we give further in the article) previously really had the status of a five-star complex, apparently, there were reasons for that.  Currently, the hotel has a fourth category.  According to hotel guests, rooms require repairs and furniture updates.  Unfortunately, not everyone is satisfied with the quality of work and the appearance of the plumbing.  Very often there are such cases when tourists encounter breakdowns immediately after checking in, so they ask to be relocated to the best apartments.  The administration willingly agrees, but finding a room in the best condition is very difficult.  Our compatriots, as a rule, are housed in small three-story houses called bungalows.  The main multi-story building is occupied by Chinese holidaymakers themselves. </p><p>  This is not to say that the rooms are very poor, but they require redecorating.  But regarding the plumbing, hotel guests unanimously express negative reviews. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach resort spa sanya 4" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431904.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For some reason, most of the rooms in the complex are equipped with single beds, so rooms with double furniture are quite difficult to find.  A similar problem can be solved independently by moving the beds, if the situation allows it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location of the complex and its territory </h2><p>  Hotel Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) has a good location.  The beach of the complex is only three minutes walk.  The distance from the international airport of Sania Phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãno more than ten kilometers.  But to the railway station - fifteen kilometers.  The complex offers free parking. </p><p>  Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 4 * has a very large and beautiful area, separated by a road.  In the courtyard of the complex there are a lot of trees, flowers, greenery.  And the charm of the complex can be called charming ponds with real goldfish.  The plants are not very clean, but they create a special atmosphere. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 4 * has two pools on the territory.  One of them is open to guests until late at night, there is a bar near it.  When it gets dark, people move from the beach to the sunbeds near the reservoir, and continue their rest there.  Swimming in the pool by the light of the lanterns is incredibly romantic.  A wonderful tree grows above the water, the flowers of which constantly fall into the pool.  Swimming amidst such beauty is something amazing. </p><p>  In addition, the complex has tennis courts, a massage parlor, a golf course, a beauty salon, a fitness center, five conference rooms and a business center.  Dry cleaning and laundry services are available for a fee.  On the territory of the complex there are several shops in which, if necessary, you can purchase everything you need for your vacation.  In addition, around the hotel there are many shops with souvenirs and local cafes where you can have a delicious dinner if you get tired of meals in the complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach resort spa hotel 4 sanya" class="if" height="453" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431906.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the coast, active tourists can always go in for water sports, try out new hobbies.  There are all conditions for this. </p><p>  On the third floor of the main building there is a medical center, the services of which can be used for a fee. </p><p>  Near the territory of Palm <span>Beach Resort Spa Hotel 4 *</span> (Sanya) there is a cemetery.  Currently, it is not operational, and from afar resembles a square.  However, not all vacationers like this neighborhood.  Still, people come to relax and distract from problems. </p><h2>  Sea beach <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Palm Beach <span>Resort Spa Hotel 4 *</span> (Sanya) has its own beach.  In general, the location of the complex is its highlight, since not every hotel is on the first line.  A small inconvenience is that you must cross the road to get to the shore, but it is not so difficult.  The hotel's sandy beach, there are never waves on the sea.  Umbrellas and sunbeds on the coast are completely free. </p><p>  Speaking about the hotel Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya), reviews of which, by the way, are rather contradictory, it is worth noting the presence of small midges on the shore.  According to vacationers, insects live in the grass on the beach and behave quite aggressively, because of which many bites appear on the bodies of tourists.  Unfortunately, no local creams completely influence the midge, it is impossible to get rid of it.  Apparently, there are periods when insects appear and then disappear somewhere.  Otherwise, the coast is very clean and beautiful.  The water is warm and clear. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach resort spa sanya reviews" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431911.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are always many fishermen on the shore waiting for their catch.  Swimming in the sea, you can see flocks of shrimp, small fish, squid.  There are small jellyfish in the water, but they are fearless, because they do not sting at all. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  I would like to pay special attention to nutrition.  When you buy a tour at the Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya Bay), you only get breakfast.  As for dinner and lunch, they can also be ordered at the hotel.  And you can have good and inexpensive refreshments in local cafes, of which there are many in the vicinity of the hotel.  The food there is quite normal and tasty, so you can safely eat it.  Due to the fact that the resort is located near the sea, all establishments prepare a lot of seafood dishes.  This is definitely worth using.  Tourists advise careful attention to the choice of dishes, since the Chinese are preparing all sorts of marine reptiles that we are not used to eating.  In the variety of local food it is quite possible to choose something to taste. </p><p>  For breakfast, the hotel serves European and Chinese dishes, as well as seafood.  If you do not like local food, then you can choose for yourself more acceptable options.  Some tourists believe that morning food is very monotonous, others emphasize that they are quite happy with the food.  Apparently, individual preferences are affected. </p><p>  The standard breakfast at the hotel includes: sausages, duck (cooked according to the local recipe), vegetables, fruits, meat dishes, porridge, yogurt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel palm beach resort spa sanya 5 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431915.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, vacationers are happy with the food.  It is wonderful that the Chinese people carefully prepare not only their traditional dishes, but also European ones, since not all guests will master the local gastronomic delights.  Still, European food is more familiar to our compatriots. </p><h2>  Quality of service </h2><p>  The Chinese are very interesting people.  They are very sensitive to smiles and kind attitude.  It is for this reason that they relate better to those guests who are not aggressive.  This point is worth considering.  Unfortunately, in a place like Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya, China), there is staff who speak only Chinese.  But this is not a hotel problem, but rather, local customs.  In China, it is not customary to use English at all.  However, our compatriots do not have communication problems, because among the service staff of the complex there are people who perfectly understand the Russian language. </p><p>  By the way, in China, quite a lot of local residents speak and understand our language. </p><p>  Check in at the hotel is fast.  Overall the service is very good.  Apart from the fact that the rooms should be repaired for a long time, the Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya), the reviews of which we are analyzing, is a pretty decent place to stay.  Staff clean the rooms daily and change towels.  It is very nice that the apartments have special beach sets: bags with towels.  It is very convenient and practical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel palm beach resort spa sanya china" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431916.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 5 * it is customary to take a deposit for the room upon check-in.  They then return the money when people are going to leave, if the apartments are rented in full order, and all services are paid. </p><h2>  Entertainment <strong></strong></h2><p>  Hotel Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) offers its vacationers the following entertainment: bowling, billiards, tennis, massage, volleyball, jacuzzi.  A variety of water rides await tourists on the coast. </p><p>  The Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 5 * complex (the hotel description was given by us earlier) is located in a quiet place, on the very shore.  And at the same time it is very easy to get to the city center from it.  About a fifteen minute walk is the fruit market where you can buy all kinds of sweets.  Near the hotel there is a cafe and eateries, which are deliciously prepared.  The center can be reached by taxi (it will cost about 30 yuan) or by bus. </p><p>  A photo studio is located on site.  You can pay for a photo shoot in it, and then you will get beautiful pictures against the backdrop of local landscapes, and not embellished with photoshop. </p><p>  What is good about Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 5 * hotel?  Guest reviews contain a lot of praise for the coast.  Tourists flock to these parts every year precisely for the sake of the sea.  In recent years, the rich deep sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe South China Sea has attracted many divers from all over the world.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Visibility under water in these parts is more than twenty meters, and diving can be done year-round, thanks to the mild climate.  However, sometimes weak echoes of southern storms reach the coast, and then divers for a couple of days give way to the sea for surfers. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Relaxing in the Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 5 *, you definitely need to see the main attractions of Hainan Island.  Celestial Empire has something to show its guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach resort spa sanya 5 reviews" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431917.jpg" width="552"></div>

    <p>  In addition, tourists can make some purchases.  It has already become a tradition to bring rock crystal, tea, and pearls from the island.  Porcelain, wood carving, silk, Feng Shui symbols, Buddhist souvenirs are especially popular among holidaymakers.  Such souvenirs are sold in many shops and shops.  And for serious shopping, you can go to the capital of the island of Haikou.  The most prestigious shops are located on Haisyundunlu Street, and you can buy various artifacts on the market (on the cape).  In Sanya, the best shops are located on Liberation Street, which is located in the very center. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Not far from the city (23 kilometers), on the very shore there is a park with the beautiful name "End of the World".  It attracts tourists with beautiful landscapes.  On a sandy beach lumps of bizarre shapes rise.  Each stone has its own name: "a stone that supports the heavens", "stone - the refuge of a bachelor", "broken heart".  "Boulder - wealth" is even depicted on the local banknote (2 yuan).  And on one ten-meter stone there is even an inscription saying that it is in this place that the extreme southern point of China is located - ‚ÄúEnd of the World‚Äù. </p><p>  No less interesting for tourists is the oceanarium, in which you can get acquainted with the life of two hundred varieties of exotic inhabitants of the deep sea.  Here you can see a show of crocodiles and sea lions, trained parrots.  The bravest guests can feed the reptiles and take pictures with them.  On the territory of the oceanarium live all species of birds of southern China.  Here you can see unique turtles, whose age is more than six hundred years. </p><p>  Eighty kilometers from the city there is an island of monkeys, on which more than two thousand primates live.  A cable car stretches across the strait to the island.  Tourists from the cabins of the funicular can enjoy a bird's eye view of the sea.  On the island you can see not only animals, but also see the monkey circus. </p><p>  Near the city (about forty kilometers) is the largest Buddhism Center in Asia at the foot of Nanshan Mountain.  It was opened in 1997, its area is more than fifty kilometers square.  Tourists will certainly enjoy not only the oldest temple (it was restored), but also a large landscape park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel palm beach resort spa sanya" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431918.jpg" width="542"></div>

    <p>  The ethnic settlement of the Li and Miao ethnic groups is very popular among holidaymakers.  These aborigines lived here long before the Chinese.  Even now they live in thickets of tropical forests in the very center of the island, keeping their foundations and way of life unchanged. </p><p>  Near the thermal radon keys is the famous botanical garden, which contains all the tropical plants of China.  Their total number exceeds a thousand copies. </p><p>  Thirty kilometers from Sanya is a butterfly museum, which is more like a piece of rainforest, in which many different insects flutter.  The sight is simply amazing. </p><p>  List all the attractions within the article is simply impossible.  There really are an infinite number of them on the island, and many are located just near such a resort as Sanya. </p><h2>  Treatment </h2><p>  Do not forget that the island is famous for treatment.  For a long time, stomach ailments, osteochondrosis, rheumatism, hypertension, skin and lung diseases heal here.  In Sanya, vacationers can undergo a course of procedures at SanYiTang - the center of modern medicine.  Relaxing at <span>the Palm Beach</span> Resort Spa, tourists acquire coursework and undergo the necessary treatment. </p><h2>  Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  The hotel has a very good location.  On the one hand, it was built away from the hustle and bustle of the city, and on the other hand, it is enough to get to the center and the main attractions of the city from it. </p><p>  The main advantage of the complex is its location on the coastline, which is very convenient for a seaside resort.  The hotel is more suitable for families with children.  Young people looking for endless parties and nightly entertainment may get a little bored here.  Although it cannot be said that there are no night clubs. </p><p>  Beautiful clear sea and fine sand will make your vacation unforgettable.  Moreover, you will not be bored here.  Exotic nature and attractions will not leave tourists indifferent. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palm beach resort spa sanya 4 reviews" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1431919.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The food at the hotel is quite acceptable.  But the rooms, according to vacationers, have long been in need of repair.  Although, coming to rest in China, it is unlikely that anyone will sit in the apartment.  Therefore, you can close your eyes to the hotel environment.  If we take into account the ‚Äúprice-quality‚Äù ratio, then the complex is fully consistent with it.  It is not necessary to initially set excessive requirements for the hotel.  I would also like to note the fact that the complex has a well-groomed beautiful territory with backwaters, lagoons and pools, bridges.  During your vacation you will be surrounded by a flowering garden and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflowers.  And not far in the sun the sea glistens, what could be better?  It has everything that makes the island a popular resort and hospital not only among the Chinese, but also foreign tourists.  Every year, sea open spaces with sandy beaches attract thousands of vacationers from all over the world. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p> If you are planning a trip to China, Palm Beach Resort Spa (Sanya) could well be a vacation destination.  However, it should be understood that this place is suitable for a calm and quiet family vacation.  You should not believe in seeing glamorous hotels and boardwalks on the island.  If you are used to luxury, then you should not go here.  Lovers of exotic and wide sandy beaches will certainly enjoy this place.  And there is no need to talk about the abundance of attractions.  To see at least a small part of them, you need to spend more than one vacation.  Therefore, lovers of the sea and exotic can safely recommend a vacation on the island of Hainan.  You will get a lot of impressions and learn a lot about the culture of China, which has recently become increasingly popular among tourists. </p>
