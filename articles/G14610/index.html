Indeed, as practice shows, before making a purchase, you should pay attention to the opinions of the owners and the main characteristics of the device.  Only in this way will it be possible to fully realize how high-quality the gadget is in front of the user.  Given the fact that the modern world is full of a variety of phones, the choice is difficult.  All mobiles have pros and cons.  They are emphasized just by reviews.  So what about the Samsung J1 Mini? </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  First, pay attention to what this device is.  ‚ÄúSamsung J1 Mini‚Äù reviews are varied, but overall they are positive.  After all, the proposed gadget is nothing more than a phone with a new version of the Android-based operating system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung j1 mini reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460136.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is a compact and modern device for maintaining communication with the whole world.  "Samsung J1 Mini" performs all the standard functions of a regular smartphone.  But the advantage of the device, as many indicate, is its size.  The proposed phone is compact, has a small size, but this does not prevent it from performing all the generally accepted functions.  What features and characteristics does the device have and what type of feedback does it receive?  Understanding all this is not so difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini receives mostly positive reviews for its size.  There are opinions of a negative type, but there is no significant negative. </p><p>  The thing is that the size of the phone is small, especially by modern standards.  This gadget is perfect for women's and children's hands.  Unlike smartphones with similar characteristics, you can use it without any problems, even if the buyer has small palms.  It is very comfortable.  At the same time, Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini receives not the best reviews from customers with big hands.  It is noted that this smartphone is not suitable for men.  Keeping it will not be very convenient, so the model is called a female. </p>

Some are not happy with the thickness of the gadget.  But this indicator is not so critical.  In any case, carrying in your pockets "Samsung J1 Mini" is convenient. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The next component is the screen.  Another important nuance that is paid attention to when choosing a smartphone.  Here <span>, the Samsung Galaxy J1</span> Mini <span>phone</span> reviews are mixed.  Why?  The screen size is only 4 inches, and the resolution is 800 by 480 pixels.  These are not the best indicators for a modern smartphone.  At the same time, do not forget about the size of the device.  With these in mind, we can say that the phone is quite good at the size of the display. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The screen on the Samsung J1 Mini is capacitive, equipped with multi-touch technology.  Recognizes 262.14 thousand colors.  The image on the screen is good, clear and high quality.  There is a function auto-rotate the image on the display. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone samsung j1 mini reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460134.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Many indicate that the screen has some disadvantages.  For example, the Samsung J1 Mini phone receives not the best reviews because the viewing angles are not too good.  And in bright sunlight, it is very difficult to work with the device.  It is also noted that the sensor does not have a proximity sensor.  During conversations this is very inconvenient.  But not critical. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  What other characteristics do users pay attention to?  For example, as a keepsake.  There is an operational one that is responsible for the power of the gadget, and there is an ordinary one designed for these users. </p><p>  Smartphone "Samsung J1 Mini" reviews are not getting the best for these components.  Many owners of such devices indicate that this gadget is far from a gaming phone.  In particular, due to the very small amount of RAM.  Its only 768 MB.  For powerful games and programs, Samsung is not designed for this model. </p><p>  But with ordinary memory, everything is much simpler.  The built-in space in the phone is only 8 GB.  Of these, about 4.4 GB will be available to the user.  The rest is the place occupied by the operating system.  Agree, this is not too much for these users.  Phone "Samsung J1 Mini" gets positive feedback from owners of the positive type because it can expand the memory up to 128 GB.  Not all modern gadgets provide such an opportunity.  Therefore, if necessary, everyone is able to buy an additional memory card of a rather large volume and use it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU and system </h2><p>  Important components are also the processor and operating system.  There are no special complaints to them.  Moreover, many are satisfied with these indicators.  The thing is that the "Samsung J1 Mini", the characteristics and reviews of which are presented in the article, has a processor for 4 cores.  The power of each is 1.2 GHz.  Not too much, but not enough.  This is enough to work with the phone quickly and without brakes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone samsung j1 mini reviews" class="if" height="364" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460133.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The operating system is what pleases many model owners.  After all, the Samsung J1 Mini is equipped with Android 5.1.  A relatively new assembly, which most Android enthusiasts are interested in.  It works quickly, without brakes.  The only nuance that is emphasized is the relatively small amount of RAM.  Without it, you can‚Äôt fully enjoy the capabilities of Android 5.1. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The next nuance is the battery.  An important component of each smartphone.  For her, the ‚ÄúSamsung J1 Mini‚Äù reviews earn mostly positive.  Although some emphasize that working with the device will not work for a long time.  In general, the talk time is about 8 hours.  Standby time - up to 3-4 days.  But if you actively use the phone, then the battery may drain the very next day.  Therefore, the reviews vary in the information provided. </p><p>  Samsung J1 Mini is a phone that is designed for fairly active users.  But it should be borne in mind that the battery is able to sit down very quickly.  In any case, not faster than most similar phones.  Among the advantages, it is also emphasized that the battery is removable.  If necessary, you can replace it.  And to do this is not so difficult.  There are a lot of Samsung batteries in stores. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Of course, the Samsung J1 Mini has a camera.  She is only the rear.  There is no frontal.  Such a solution seems to some modern users not the best move.  Nevertheless, the rear camera shoots with 5 megapixel quality.  This is a pretty good indicator.  In experienced hands, the camera allows you to take high-quality pictures.  She also has disadvantages, but they are not so significant. </p>

    <p>  The disadvantages of the Samsung J1 Mini model include the lack of autofocus and flash.  Therefore, in poorly lit places, shooting becomes very problematic.  These shortcomings must be considered by each user.  Otherwise, the camera is unlikely to suit.  After all, some people are initially looking for a phone that will take high-quality pictures in the dark.  Samsung J1 Mini is not suitable for this purpose. </p><h2>  additional characteristics </h2><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the smartphone is equipped with additional standard functions.  What can be attributed to them? </p><p>  Among the additional features are: </p><ul><li>  GPS navigation </li><li>  voice control capability; </li><li>  use of 2 SIM cards; </li><li>  3G network </li><li>  Bluetooth; </li><li>  Wi-fi </li></ul><p>  All this allows you to use the phone with maximum convenience.  It‚Äôs not very comfortable working on the Internet due to the small <span>size of the screen,</span> but it‚Äôs not such a big problem.  All of these services operate quickly, efficiently, without failures. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  ‚ÄúSamsung J1 Mini‚Äù reviews get positive for its value.  Despite some negative points, the owners are still generally satisfied.  And all this thanks to the cost. </p>

    <p>  It is noted that this device is a budget smartphone.  It will cost the modern buyer about 5-6 thousand rubles.  Not too high price for a modern gadget with a new operating system based on Android.  Just what so many need. </p><p>  As soon as users find out how much the Samsung J1 Mini costs, reviews from negative change, as already mentioned, to positive.  After all, this phone is really good for its price, which means you can take a closer look at it. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn from all of the above?  Phone "Samsung J1 Mini" reviews are generally positive.  This is a compact smartphone with very good parameters and budget cost.  Perfect for working with the Internet, a camera and just to keep in touch.  It is not gaming, although some programs run on the device without problems.  Rather, this phone is a business and educational gadget.  This should be remembered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="samsung j1 mini owner reviews" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/28277/1460131.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Should I buy the Samsung J1 Mini?  If you are not confused by the shortcomings in the form of screen defects, the lack of <span>an proximity sensor</span> and far from the best camera - yes.  But if you need to purchase a powerful gaming device, the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini needs to be excluded from the options.  Therefore, it is worth paying attention to all the previously listed characteristics and reviews regarding each component.  Due to the lack of a proximity sensor, many call this model a "phone not for talking." </p>
