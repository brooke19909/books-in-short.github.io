    <h2>  Location of the hotel The World Hotel 3 * (Vietnam, Nha Trang) </h2><p>  The hotel is located in the northern part of the resort.  Tourists called this location very successful.  Close to the city center (about seven minutes walk), but the street is quiet.  From all sides the hotel is surrounded by the same hotels in which foreigners settle.  To the nearest beach go exactly two minutes.  It is less crowded than in the city center.  Also nearby is the famous Dam Market.  Nha Trang Railway Station is a five-minute drive away.  But the road to the Kamran international airport will take three quarters of an hour.  The Ward Hotel is suitable for travelers who prefer outdoor activities.  Three hundred meters from the hotel are the museums of Alexander Yersin and Han Hoa.  Walking distance to the Nha Trang Center Shopping Mall and the city's cathedral.  And a little further away are attractions such as the Ponagar Towers, Tram Huong and Long Son Pagoda.  There are several shops near the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The World Hotel 3 Nha Trang" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569298.jpg" width="600"></div>

He has no territory as such.  Only parking at the building, places on which are free for hotel guests' vehicles.  There is no pool at the hotel either.  After all, this is, after all, a "treshka."  ‚ÄúThe Ward Hotel‚Äù occupies a beautiful brand new penthouse, lined with golden mosaic from the facade.  On the ground floor there is a spacious lobby with a reception and a restaurant.  Guests are accommodated above.  In the fifteenth year, tourists complained about a construction site in a nearby hotel.  But in the past, nothing of the sort happened.  Yes, sea views are far from every room.  In many rooms, windows face the courtyard or wall of a neighboring hotel.  The building has two elevators.  Therefore, rooms on the upper floors are preferred.  There, noises from the street do not reach, and the view is better. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The World Hotel Nha Trang 3" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569299.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  There is no pool at The World Hotel Nha Trang 3 * hotel.  But this hotel is not even on the first line, but very close to the sea.  To be precise, then on the second - right behind the Michelia Hotel.  Go to the nearest beach for two to three minutes.  The place is not crowded, calm.  But those who want to snorkel may not like it there.  The fact is that the Kai River, which carries sludge, flows into the sea not far from the sea.  Therefore, the water in the sea off the coast is a little muddy.  This beach is municipal.  Admission is free, but the rental of sunbeds and umbrellas is paid.  A set of beach equipment costs three hundred rubles.  If you want a relaxing holiday, without the buzz of <span>water scooters</span> and the screech of vacationers, then here you are.  The sandy beach is quite well maintained and equipped.  There are several inexpensive cafes on the waterfront. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The World Hotel 3 (Vietnam Nha Trang)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1569280.jpg" width="600"></div>
