Many people want to buy it, however, due to the high cost, they refuse to buy in favor of more budget brands.  Today there is a compromise option - the acquisition of a refurbished phone.  What is it, is there a risk when buying it, where and how is the recovery process going?  About all this and not only - further in our article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sxusedsdipswa.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish" class="if uuid-3170110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170110.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  First you need to figure out what it is.  The restored iPhone 6 is a second-hand device that was handed over to Apple under warranty or at the expense of a new device.  After that, it was repaired, a new building was installed, all the necessary checks were carried out, it was equipped with new original accessories and sent to stores at a significantly reduced price marked ‚Äúlike new‚Äù. </p><p>  It is also worth clarifying two things: </p><ol><li>  First: failed smartphones are being restored not at a third-party enterprise, and not in Chinese cellars, but at Apple‚Äôs production facilities.  After recovery, they undergo the same checks and tests as new ones.  That is, the quality of phone recovery is controlled by Apple itself. </li><li>  And the second: the restored "iPhone 6" has the same year of guarantee that only the devices that have come off the assembly line are not distinguished between the new and the restored device. </li></ol><h2>  Why is it needed by Apple itself? </h2><p>  Like many Western tech giants, Apple cares about the environment, offering users a kind of "trade-in" - to hand over the old gadget to the new.  This promotion is officially valid in company stores.  Next, the smartphone is disassembled into a screw, some parts are sent for processing to produce new products of the company, and some are disposed of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But since often in the trade-in completely surrendered devices that can still serve, Apple sends them for recovery.  And this approach has been won from all sides: environmental conservation, reduced price and less labor.  And the quality of restoration work is so high that the people who bought it do not know how to distinguish the original from the restored iPhone 6. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gottabemobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="distinguish the restored iPhone 6 from the original" class="if uuid-3170113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170113.jpg"></div><h2>  Can the rebuilt iPhone 6 be considered new or used? </h2><p>  In the process of repair, it is subjected to cleaning, repair, replacement of the housing and battery.  That is, cosmetically and technically, the phone is as close as possible to the state of the new.  But still it is used, which is worth remembering at the time of purchase.  The best clue in choosing between the original or restored iPhone 6 will be customer reviews. </p><h2>  Opinions of people </h2><p>  This sample included the results of both positive and negative reviews about the restored iPhone 6.  Of the positive aspects, users emphasize good build quality, the absence of extraneous noise from the speakers and from the vibromotor.  Among other advantages are the absence of body creaks, artifacts on the display or camera, the complete delivery package and the inability to identify the original iPhone 6 or a restored device.  Buyers, of course, are pleased with the price of the gadget, since at a reduced cost they got a completely new and working device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Of the negative reviews, complaints are mainly related to the quality of the screen, which after some time can begin to go in strips, and the touchscreen, which has freezes or random triggers.  Also, some users complained about the speed of charge and discharge of the battery. </p><p>  It is obvious that the people who bought the restored "iPhone 6", reviews are mostly positive or neutral.  But there are also many negative ones.  Based on this, we can make a logical conclusion that buying a phone marked ‚Äúlike new‚Äù is a lottery, albeit with a high chance of winning.  But the possibility of marriage cannot be ruled out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bgr.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish restored 6 from the original" class="if uuid-3170118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170118.jpg"></div><h2>  How to distinguish the restored "iPhone 6" from the original? </h2><p>  The answer to the question is quite simple.  At the beginning of the serial number of the newly assembled device are the letters FG, and it will end with the letters RFB (abbreviated - Refurbished).  The same number should be displayed in the settings ("Settings" - "General" - "About the device"). </p><div class="photo" data-original="arstechnica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to distinguish a restored iPhone from the original" class="if uuid-3170121" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170121.jpg"></div><p>  If you buy ‚Äúlike a new‚Äù phone from your hands, but the numbers do not match, most likely, you are trying to sell a used gadget at the price of a new one.  This is a brief instruction on how to distinguish the original from the restored "iPhone 6" will help to bypass scammers and not waste money.  But it also happens that under the guise of an officially restored smartphone, a device restored in ‚Äúartisanal‚Äù conditions can be sold. </p><h2>  Chinese fake </h2><p>  Users are often interested in how to distinguish the restored iPhone 6.  Of course, unscrupulous manufacturers of consumer goods use this.  Yes, these phones can also be called refurbished, but this is not done at the Apple factory and, of course, not from branded components. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trustedreviews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="like a restored iPhone 6 from the original" class="if uuid-3170114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170114.jpg"></div><p>  The used smartphone is taken as a basis, which is brought to the ‚Äúconditionally new‚Äù state by replacing the original components that are out of order or have lost their brand appearance with cheap Chinese counterparts that are inferior to the originals in almost everything. </p><p>  This also applies to accessories: headphones, cable and power supply.  But experienced users of "apple" devices can easily check the originality of accessories, and for beginners below is a tip on how to distinguish the original "iPhone 6" from the restored one. </p><p>  The serial number can be changed not only on the case, but also on the package (it will contain the letters FG and RFB, which were mentioned above).  Therefore, when buying a supposedly ‚Äúrestored‚Äù smartphone, one should go into the same ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù - ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù - ‚ÄúAbout the device‚Äù and check the serial number on the screen with the number on the package.  If the numbers differ, then most likely you are dealing with a device assembled from non-original parts. </p><h2>  Types of officially assembled iPhones </h2><p>  Abroad on sale there are many items of "restored" Apple technology.  These are laptops, and desktop computers, and tablets, and, of course, smartphones.  They are sold at a lower cost, even in company stores with full support and warranty, like brand new devices.  But for now, things have not gone further than phones.  And then, with some amendments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tellakos.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to distinguish iPhone 6 from the original" class="if uuid-3170116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170116.jpg"></div><p>  With us, refurbished phones can be purchased officially from retailers authorized by Apple itself, which include almost all the major network equipment stores.  When buying a device there, you don‚Äôt have to worry about how to distinguish the original ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù from the restored one, since in stores they are sold packed and with the corresponding inscriptions on the boxes. </p><p>  But in addition to refurbished devices purchased officially at the store, refurbished phones from China are popular with Russians.  The reason is an even lower price than retailers.  And these smartphones are not clones on the "Android" - they are the same "iPhone", but restored unofficially.  And judging by the reviews, most users of devices restored in this way are quite happy with the purchase.  After all, they received an absolutely working and original device, but for a much smaller amount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="canacopegdl.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to distinguish a restored iPhone 6" class="if uuid-3170124" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3170124.jpg"></div><p>  However, it is worth mentioning that the components can be very low-quality.  There are highlights on the screen, incorrect color reproduction, the sound may not be so clear and loud, and so on.  Also, they are not guaranteed.  But still they differ from the fakes described above.  If you find problems with an unofficial gadget, you can‚Äôt return the defective Apple device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If you still think whether it‚Äôs worth the risk and buy the restored ‚ÄúiPhone 6‚Äù at a reduced price compared to the original, then most likely this makes sense.  Especially if you just want to get acquainted with the world of Apple or the budget does not allow you to take the original new device. </p><p>  Any marriage in the restored phones is not common.  In addition, they have the same warranty as brand-new devices lasting one year.  If you do not want to take risks or the funds allow you to purchase a new original phone, in this case it is better to buy it.  And here were all the instructions on how to distinguish the restored iPhone 6 from the original and not run into scammers. </p>
