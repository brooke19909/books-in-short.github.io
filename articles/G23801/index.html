History and origin of the name of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The origin of the name "Novosibirsk" is rooted in the beginning of Peter's reign, during the intensive development of Russian people vast Siberian lands.  This relatively young city was included in the Guinness Book of Records as the fastest growing metropolis in the world.  For 70 years, he became a millionaire city.  It took New York 250 years, and Moscow 700. Why was Novosibirsk called Novosibirsk?  Perhaps because the formation of this largest economic and administrative center began the history of new Siberia. </p><h2>  Nikolsky Pogost </h2><p>  The history of the name "Novosibirsk" takes us back centuries.  The first Russian settlement in the modern city appeared in the last decade of the 17th century.  Pogost, that is, a hotel with a trading depot and a small chapel, served as a border point between Russian and local residents - telenguts, who were considered the owners of the lands on the other side of the Ob.  The settlement was named in honor of St. Nicholas and lasted until 1712.  Then the Teleut border fell.  The sprawled village began to be called Krivoshchekinskaya, nicknamed "Krivoshchek", with which the people awarded its founder - Krenitsyn Fedor.  By the end of the 18th century, the entire left bank of modern Novosibirsk was inhabited, while the right was notorious.  Apparently, representatives of the indigenous population, whom the Russians nicknamed "chat rooms," did not differ in special friendliness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-378987" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18493/378987.jpg?1567316208"></div><h2>  Alexandrovsky village </h2><p>  The right bank of the future capital of Siberia was actively mastered by settlers in 1893, on April 30, when the first batch of bridge builders arrived on the Ob.  Now Novosibirsk people consider this date the official birthday of their hometown.  Workers built their homes near the ruined fortress, at the <span>mouth of the</span> Kamenka <span>River</span> .  Soon, the Ob <span>railway station</span> and a small settlement were erected here.  After a short time, the settlements of the right and left banks merged, and two years later the Russian press reported that the village that had grown with incredible speed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe construction of the bridge across <span>the Ob River was</span> destined to become a large shopping center.  Two years later, the village was named Alexandrovsky, and later - Novonikolaevsky, in honor of the new tsar. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-378977" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18493/378977.jpg?1567316208"></div><h2>  City Status </h2><p>  Why did Novosibirsk become Novosibirsk?  The growth of the Novonikolayevsky village was so rapid that already in 1908 it received the status of a full-fledged city.  Branches of the largest Russian banks appeared here, having their branches in the capitals of the whole world.  The "International company of reaping machines" has opened - the main Siberian office.  In 1912, the authorities of Novonikolaevsk introduced universal primary education, which until then existed only in Yaroslavl.  In the same year, another event takes place that fundamentally changed the fate of the ordinary Russian town, which Novonikolaevsk could become.  The origin of the name Novosibirsk is partly due to this historical moment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-378976" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18493/378976.jpg?1567316208"></div><h2>  Trans-Siberian Railway </h2><p>  In St. Petersburg, it was decided to build the Trans-Siberian railway, which will connect Siberia with Altai.  The starting point of the road to Semipalatinsk (the terminal point of the Altai branch) Novonikolaevsk was chosen as the highest approval.  This fact instantly made an ordinary Russian town the country's largest multimodal hub.  Why was Novosibirsk called Novosibirsk?  In part, this name is associated with extraordinary economic growth that took place at that time in the territory of the future metropolis.  In 1915, when the construction of the railway was not even completed, 7 banks operated in the city.  With 70 thousand of the population.  In 1914, on the main street of Novonikolaevsk, the chapel of St. Nicholas was inaugurated and proclaimed the place where the exact <span>geographical center of Russia is located.</span>  Until 1917, the city remained a commercial and industrial center that did not carry any administrative functions.  However, in April 1917, Novonikolaevsk became the county town of <span>Tomsk province.</span>  Its population is 107,129 inhabitants, the largest cooperative organizations of the country are concentrated in it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-378975" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18493/378975.jpg?1567316208"></div><h2>  Power of the Soviets </h2><p>  The further history of the largest Russian metropolis brings us to the answer to the question why Novosibirsk was called Novosibirsk.  The post-revolutionary riots bled the once rich, life-filled city.  During the period from December 23, 1917 to April 1920, power in Novonikolaevsk changed several times.  After the civil war, state institutions, including the railway, did not function in the city.  Hunger and poverty reigned.  Realizing the need to restore the most important road junction, the Soviet government first, in 1921, made Novonikolaevsk the center of the Novonikolaev province, and already in 1925 - the main city of the Siberian Territory, a territorial entity that for 10 years absorbed the Yenisei, Tomsk, Altai, Novonikolaevskaya , Omsk province.  Why was Novosibirsk called Novosibirsk?  Because the largest settlement of the new Russia could no longer be called after the ousted ruler.  This fact was of fundamental importance to the Soviet government. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-378965" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18493/378965.jpg?1567316208"></div><h2>  The origin of the name "Novosibirsk" </h2><p>  In 1925, at the First Siberian Regional Congress of Soviets of Peasants, Workers, and Red Army Deputies and in the Russian press, there was a heated discussion of options for a new name for the city: Smirnovsk, Krasnoobsk, Oktyabrygrad, Leninoznamensk-on-Ob, Sibkraigrad, Krasnograd and many others.  Why is the city of Novosibirsk so named?  This name of the authorities was considered sonorous and politically neutral.  The Central Executive Committee of the USSR approved the Resolution of the Novonikolayevsky District Congress of Soviets of November 17, 1925 on renaming the city.  The status of the <span>capital of Siberia</span> determined the fate of Novosibirsk for decades to come.  From now on, the city has become the largest administrative, cultural, economic, political center of the country. </p><p>  Why is Novosibirsk so named?  This name carries a positive meaning.  The hope for a new, progressive future is concentrated in the name of this metropolis.  And today, this city is not losing ground.  In 1990, Novosibirsk was granted the status of a historical city, the center of culture and science of Siberia. </p>
