But still, there were some drawbacks.  Let's try to figure out whether this is a miracle of technology of the declared amount or the bar is slightly overpriced. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The main material for the manufacture of the body was plastic.  The assembly is performed at the highest level: no creaking and play is observed.  Iuni U3 is pleasant to the touch and perfectly lies in the hand, due to which it is pleasant and comfortable to use.  The side frames near the screen are minimal, there are no mechanical or touch keys on the front panel, so almost the entire front side is occupied by the display.  Above are the earpiece and <span>front camera.</span> </p><p>  The device looks very large, and therefore is not suitable for every user.  It‚Äôs obviously impossible to freely control one hand with such a screen, and this should be considered when buying.  In extreme cases, you can opt for the Iuni U3 mini. </p>

    <p>  There is only one speaker, and it is located on the back of the device.  The sound hole is muffled somewhat if the smartphone is facing up.  Also on the back are the camera and flash.  Under the cover are the compartments for SIM cards. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Overall dimensions of the device: 145 x 75 x 10.3 mm, weight - 176 grams. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of Iuni U3 is a screen with a diagonal of 5.5 inches, which supports 2K resolution (2560x1400).  The pixel density is 538 ppi.  Such an impressive resolution with the support of the IPS-matrix allows to achieve unusual picture quality, which is why the color rendering and image quality are truly amazing.  Watching movies on a device such as the Iuni U3 smartphone is a pleasure: a smooth image, natural colors and a large number of pixels make the picture very realistic.  It is also worth noting the high-quality viewing angles, which almost do not distort the information, and colors.  It is comfortable to work with the smartphone in clear weather and on a winter day: the screen almost does not fade in the sun, and the sensor has a mode due to which the device can be used with gloves. </p>

    <h2>  Iuni U3: characteristics of iron </h2><p>  The processor here, although of high quality, is, unfortunately, only quad-core: each core operates at a frequency of 2.3 MHz.  3 GB of RAM ensure the correct operation of even the most demanding applications, and the quad-core graphics accelerator Adreno 330 allows you to play toys from the top category.  The platform is Android 4.4.4. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As for the memory for storing data, about 32 GB are available to users without the possibility of expansion with the help of memory cards.  However, this volume is quite enough to create music and game libraries, download the necessary applications and several films in high resolution.  Those who do not have enough memory will probably have to opt for another smartphone. </p><p>  Among the interfaces and networks we single out Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, a micro-USB connector and LTE support.  I was pleased with the excellent work of the GPS-receiver, which instantly searches for satellites and quickly draws routes, so this option will be for users a great guide to the city‚Äôs routes and more. </p>

    <h2>  games and applications </h2><p>  In AnTuTu, Iuni U3 was pretty average: in our time, four cores are not enough.  But as noted above, the device copes well with advanced software and toys.  For example, such popular games as World of Tanks and GTA San Andreas are perfectly launched on the phone.  The picture is displayed without brakes and glitches, the colors are bright, and thanks to the operating system and hardware everything is reproduced correctly and without errors.  Plus, on the gadget there is a decent video player on which you can watch movies with a resolution of up to 2K.  Watching a video with this pixel ratio is a pleasure, so the device is able to serve as a kind of portable video player. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The speaker here is quite loud and clear: the music tracks sound great.  Even on a noisy street, it‚Äôs hard enough to miss an incoming call when setting the maximum volume level.  The audio player is endowed with a set of modern codecs that allow you to run music files of various formats.  If you have good headphones, the sound quality in the headset is quite acceptable, so users who are tolerant of sound quality can very well use the gadget as an mp3 player.  Of the shortcomings, we note only the excessively saturated high frequencies in the predefined profile.  But this defect is referred to as conditional, since with the help of an equalizer the problem is easily solved. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera has 13 megapixels, aperture F / 2.0, autofocus, flash and optical image stabilization.  In the daytime and in good light, the pictures come out magnificent: this applies to both panorama and macro photography.  There is almost no noise, the color rendering is excellent, and all objects are displayed clearly.  When photographing text documents, letters and numbers are visible very well.  The impression spoils when it comes to pictures in conditions of lack of <span>light: the flash</span> does not cope with lighting in the best way, the colors are pale and unnatural, the amount of noise increases.  Sometimes it is possible to achieve an acceptable result during night shooting, but rather rarely, therefore, in this aspect, optics let us down. </p><p>  The following functions are available from the camera settings: digital zoom, geographical marks, <span>white balance,</span> exposure compensation, face recognition, self-timer, macro mode, touch focus and more.  These useful options allow you to improve image quality and customize various effects, focusing on the type of terrain and the level of lighting currently available. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth noting the front ‚Äúeye‚Äù, which has 4 megapixels and is well suited for the role of a selfie camera, and the ability of the main optics to record video with a resolution of 1080 r at 30 frames / s. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh, although it looks quite decent, is nevertheless clearly small for a screen with a resolution of 2K.  With active use, the smartphone may not survive until the end of the day.  In any case, almost every night the device will have to be charged.  However, a large number of users praise the Iuni U3 battery.  W3bsit3-dns.com provides a lot of discussion on this subject. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Of course, the gadget has more advantages than disadvantages.  The assembly turned out flawless, and the smartphone is easy to use.  The screen has high resolution, high-quality color reproduction and good viewing angles.  Cameras behave well in conditions of plenty of light, but during night shooting show themselves far from the best side.  Technical specifications are very impressive: the only drawback is the presence of only 4 cores.  There is no slot for flash drives, but the amount of memory available by default is pretty decent.  It is up to the users to decide whether the lack of a USB flash drive connector is a minus or not: it all depends on the preferences and tasks that need to be addressed on this device.  For many, the lack of NFC technology will become a drawback: after all, in most advanced gadgets it is invariably present. </p><p>  Everything would be fine, but the cost of the Iuni U3 is embarrassing: the price starts to vary from the mark of 17,815 rubles.  Is a smartphone worth so much money?  If not for the screen resolution, then the answer would be unequivocal - no.  But the presence of such a high-quality and large display makes you think about this issue.  If the model had an 8-core processor, then the price would probably have paid off. </p>

    <h2>  Iuni U3: user reviews </h2><p>  Attractive appearance, high-quality assembly and practicality of the device delight users.  It was noted that the device is pleasantly in the hand and it is convenient to work on it.  The screen for some is too large, but nevertheless, this aspect does not affect the quality of use of the device in a special way. </p><p>  The Iuni U3 screen, a review of this confirmation, could hardly have won at least one negative review.  Innovative resolution, excellent color reproduction, good viewing angles and an advanced matrix allow you to enjoy movies and games for hours.  On such a display, it is convenient to surf the Internet: scroll through pictures on the World Wide Web, read information and watch videos. </p><p>  The camera is another advantage of the smartphone, which users appreciated, unless, of course, not counting the failed night shooting.  Some claim that the gadget is quite capable of replacing a budget camera.  The set of various functions present in the arsenal of optics makes a great impression.  For video enthusiasts, the developers took care of high-quality shooting with a resolution of 1080 r at 30 frames / s. </p>

    <p>  Most owners of technical specifications are quite enough: the amount of RAM is especially noted.  The gadget is not buggy, the multitouch works fine, the device thinks pretty smartly.  It was noted that developers regularly create new firmware for this model, because of which users can always change the version of the assembly if there are any problems in use.  Communication tools work fine, but there have been complaints that, far from the source, the Wi-Fi receiver is working slightly worse. </p><p>  For a more detailed review of the reviews of the owners of the device, you can use special Internet portals that provide information about Iuni U3.  W3bsit3-dns.com is perfect for this task. </p>
