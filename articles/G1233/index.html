    <p>  For craftswomen who have a certain knack, it is possible to <span>crochet</span> more complex children's <span>sundresses.</span>  It is not easy to cope with schemes and descriptions of such models: an ornament can consist of several patterns or separately connected motifs.  As for the details of such sundresses, then for their manufacture a pattern or drawing may be required.  Calculations on paper alone are not enough. </p><h2>  Pink children's sundress crochet: diagrams and descriptions </h2><p>  This model is suitable for knitters who have just learned how to perform basic techniques: single crochet (STB) and double crochet (STS). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="children's crochet sundresses with diagrams and description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1790382.jpg" width="393"></div>

    <p>  The border, which runs along the bottom of the product and is clearly visible in the drawing with patterns, is performed after the completion of the main work.  This openwork pattern is depicted in the diagram under the marking A.2. </p><h2>  Operating procedure </h2><p>  First you need to run a control sample to find out the density of your canvas.  Then you can start crocheting a children's dress.  Schemes and descriptions allow you to create a product for children from three to twelve years old, you need to focus on the sizes indicated on the pattern. </p><p>  Main stages: </p><ol><li>  Production of parts before.  The amount of STSN calculated in advance is carried out and knit according to scheme A.1 to the level of the armholes.  If you need a silhouette extended from top to bottom, then as you knit, you should evenly reduce the columns at the beginning and at the end of R. </li><li>  To form the armholes, symmetrical bevels should be made on both sides of the canvas.  To make the line come out smoothly, do not immediately tie 8-10 columns on each side, and then cut four times in each second P one column. </li><li>  Next, the fabric is knitted evenly. </li><li>  For the formation of a neck in the center of the row, a quantity of columns corresponding to 15-16 cm is left untied. Then, on each side, one column is cut in every second P until the neck is 17-18 cm wide. </li><li>  The remaining canvases (shoulders) are performed in turn: for example, first left, then right. </li></ol><p>  The back is knitted in the same way.  Details of this model have the same contours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strapping </h2><p>  After the back and front parts are sewn, you can start tying the bottom of the product.  To do this, the bottom of the sarafan is treated with STB.  In this case, the direction of knitting will be the opposite of that which was used in the manufacture of the main parts.  If the back and front are tied from the bottom up, then the border is made from top to bottom. </p><p>  Crocheting children's sundresses is convenient because you can change the direction of work at your discretion.  If necessary, the number of binding rapports can be increased, then the product will be longer. </p><h2>  Red sundress with a yoke </h2><p>  This model differs from the previous one in that it runs in a circle.  Such a children's sundress crochet (diagrams and descriptions are attached) consists of two parts: coquette and skirt. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet baby sundress description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1790379.jpg" width="391"></div>

    <p>  The first is executed by STSN, the second is knitted with an openwork pattern. </p><p>  The first row is the neckline.  The designer who developed the model suggests making a cut on the back for the fastener.  This is not an obligatory element; you can close the first row in a ring and knit a yoke around. </p>

    <p>  If the craftswoman decided to knit as shown in the drawing, she will have to work in straight and return rows. </p><p>  Flirty Extension: </p><ol><li>  New elements are added in four places.  For this, the craftswomen mark four StSn markers.  In every second row, double the STS to the marked element and after.  As a result, each row will expand by eight STS. </li><li>  The yoke is ready when the armhole of the required depth is formed.  Further, all STS that fall on the parts of the front and back, are closed in a circular row, and several rows of STB are performed. </li><li>  Then you need to proceed to the implementation of the openwork pattern.  To do this, you must perform the algorithm: five air loops (VP), skip three base stbn and connect the stbn in the fourth.  The sequence is repeated as many times as necessary until the end of the row. </li><li>  In the next P, three STSN, one VP, three STSN are performed in each arch.  Repeat this P until the skirt is tied to one third. </li><li>  The second third of the skirt will be wider than the first: four STSN, one VP, four STS are knitted in each VP of the previous row. </li><li>  The last part of the skirt should be the widest: five STS, one VP, five STS are knitted in each VP of the previous row. </li></ol><h2>  Sundress decoration </h2><p>  The neck of the finished product is tied in several rows of stbn.  Armholes should be processed as follows: </p><ol><li>  One row of stbn. </li><li>  VP, skip two loops of the base and knit five stsn in the third, skip the next two loops and in the third perform one stbn. </li><li>  The resulting ‚Äúshells‚Äù are repeated until the end of the row.  The second armhole is tied in the same way. </li></ol><p>  Any harness always decorates a children's sundress with a crochet.  Crocheted description and photo of the openwork pattern will allow the craftswoman to quickly and accurately knit a children's product of the desired size. </p><p>  This model with a white petticoat looks interesting.  It is important that its length be greater than the length of the sundress itself, since the lace edge should peek out from under the knitted skirt. </p>
