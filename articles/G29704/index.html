In this regard, many citizens began to have questions regarding payment methods for this payment.  Indeed, some of them, because of the busy work schedule, have no time to visit settlement centers and housing and communal services offices once again.  For such people, a number of payment options are provided.  You can pay for overhaul now without even leaving home.  In this case, you only need Internet access and a bank card.  Important nuances of payment, for example, how to pay for overhaul without a commission, we will consider below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="itstillworks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overhaul contributions" class="if uuid-3192755" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192755.jpg"></div><h2>  How to find out the amount of debt </h2><p>  Before you pay for overhaul, you should find out the debt.  The amount may vary due to fines, delays and penalties. </p><p>  To date, the amount of debt can be determined as follows: </p><ol><li>  Turning to the office of the management company. </li><li>  In the organization of a resource-supplying nature (water utility, energy companies and others). </li><li>  Central settlement offices. </li></ol><p>  All these organizations, in accordance with 155 articles of the LC, are required to provide information regarding the citizen's debts for utility bills in full.  This data can be reflected in the payment receipt or in a single payment document. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Accrual of non-existent amounts </h2><p>  It is necessary to be extremely careful - many housing and communal services offices may charge a non-existent amount: for example, spend the same debt twice or not set off a certain payment.  It is worth noting that this applies not only to overhaul, but also to other services - garbage, gas, water, electricity. </p><p>  It is recommended that you keep your own records of payments made and if you find an error, contact the organization that made it for proceedings. </p><p>  If the organization does not respond to the appeal, which often happens, it is necessary to file a complaint with the judicial authorities.  The court will take into account the real payment data and oblige the management company to recalculate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessinsider.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overhaul for pensioners" class="if uuid-3192759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192759.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment using the Gosuslug portal </h2><p>  It is interesting to many: how to pay for overhaul through "State Services"?  Utility payments, including overhaul, can be paid using the public services portal.  To use this functionality, you will have to go through the registration procedure in the system and confirm your identity in advance.  This can be done absolutely free of charge, by personally contacting the MFC or through the Sberbank Online service. </p><p>  After authorization in your personal account, you can pay for overhaul as a service by following the following instructions: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  It is necessary to go to the section on apartments, construction and other things, and then to the subsection for housing and communal services. </li><li>  Next, you need to click on the button to receive public services. </li><li>  Then you should choose the city in which the housing is located and, accordingly, the management company.  As a rule, the location is determined automatically, but an error cannot be ruled out. </li><li>  Indicate the TIN ZHEU and the management company that will be the recipient.  This information can be viewed in the receipt received. </li><li>  The service will redirect the user to the payment page, where it will be necessary to enter the details of his card and confirm the operation using a special code that will come in the form of SMS. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="iz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay for overhaul online" class="if uuid-3192760" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192760.jpg"></div><h2>  No commission </h2><p>  Such payment for overhaul is suitable for pensioners.

To conduct a transaction: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into the card reader and enter an individual security code. </li><li>  Go to the utility payments section. </li><li>  Enter the necessary data in the appropriate fields.

In other banks, the conditions may vary, they should be clarified in advance. </p><h2>  Payment for overhaul using the terminal </h2><p>  Payment via self-service terminals is carried out in exactly the same way as through ATMs.  But a bank card and the introduction of an access code are not always required - in some cases you can pay for a communal apartment by depositing cash and without going through the authorization procedure.  The instructions for how to pay for overhaul are as follows: </p><ol><li>  You must go to the section of transfers and payments. </li><li>  Select the section of utility bills. </li><li>  Next, you should scan the barcode located on the receipt, or enter the TIN to find the organization that will be the recipient of the payment. </li><li>  It is important to check all the details and data, after which the operation can be confirmed by pressing the payment button and making the necessary amount in the bill acceptor. </li></ol><p>  You should wait until the terminal prints the receipt, pick it up and save it.  It is the main proof of payment.  The cost of payment depends on the terminal used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.freepik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay for overhaul without commission" class="if uuid-3192757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192757.jpg"></div><h2>  Payment using the Sberbank Online service </h2><p>  How to pay for overhaul online?  This service is available around the clock, you can use it through a browser on your computer.  For authorization, you will need a username and password.  You can get them through an ATM.

Entering it is more convenient and faster, as it is carried out using a four-digit code. </p><p>  To make a payment, you must follow the following instructions: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the service. </li><li>  Go to the section of payment for services and purchases, and then to the subsection Quarter payments, home phone and utilities. </li><li>  Select the overhaul fund tab of the region in which the payment is made. </li><li>  Enter the TIN indicated on the receipt to find the recipient of funds. </li><li>  Check all the information entered and confirm the operation using the confirmation received in the form of SMS code. </li></ol><p>  Before you pay for a major overhaul through Sberbank, you should be aware that the bank charges a commission for this operation, which is 1%.  In some regions, there is no commission at all. </p><p>  After successful payment, the service will display a report on successful completion.  You can not save the receipt right away, but do it if necessary - it will be stored for 3 years in the service, in the section of operations performed. </p><h2>  Payment through the personal account of the capital repair fund </h2><p>  Another way to pay for overhaul over the Internet is to create a personal account in the capital repair fund.  The official portal allows not only to keep abreast of all the news regarding federal, regional and regional legislative decrees in the field of housing and communal services.  It also helps to know the amount of the overhaul debt and pay it. </p><p>  To get the opportunity to work with the site, you will need to go through a quick registration and create a personal account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneymagpie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay for overhaul through public services" class="if uuid-3192761" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192761.jpg"></div><h2>  Entering personal data </h2><p>  The registration procedure involves entering personal data (full name, address of residence, email, mobile phone number - keys with access codes will come to it).  After confirmation of registration, a letter will be sent to the specified e-mail containing a link to activate your personal account.  It should be followed, and if it does not work, copy and paste into the address bar of the browser.  Typically, a letter arrives within a couple of minutes. </p><p>  If the activation code does not arrive on time, which can happen for one reason or another in the evening or because of a malfunction on the site, then the request for a letter with an activation link must be repeated. </p><h2>  What to do next? </h2><p>  After registration on the site is completed, you should: </p><ol><li>  Go to your personal account. </li><li>  Then to the payments tab. </li><li>  Next, you must sequentially press the payment buttons of the housing and communal services, service provider, service name. </li><li>  In the window that appears, enter the address by which the debt and the personal account of the payer are determined. </li></ol><p>  The system will check the data, make a corresponding request to the database and offer to select a period.  After the user confirms the action, the service provides all the necessary information in the form of a file in the * .pdf format. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.moneymagpie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to pay for overhaul over the Internet" class="if uuid-3192762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46486/3192762.jpg"></div><p>  You can pay retirees with a similar method: </p><ol><li>  By going to the payments tab, in the debt payment subsection. </li><li>  Then you should enter the name of the service provider, its name, the amount payable. </li><li>  After the service processes the information, it will display a window in which you need to enter the bank card details.  She will be charged. </li><li>  The operation must be confirmed with the corresponding button. </li><li>  In the new window, you must enter reliable information, since false data will lead to the fact that the funds will be debited from the card account, and the debt will not be repaid.  Fields to be filled in are as follows: Name, surname, payer ID, address, amount to be transferred, account code, payment period. </li><li>  Confirm the action and wait until an SMS with a confirmation code is received at the phone number specified during registration.  He will need to enter in the appropriate field. </li></ol><p>  Next, the service will again offer to verify the entered data.  If an error is detected, you can go back a few steps.  In case of correct filling, you need to confirm the operation again. </p><p>  After that, money will be deducted from the card in payment for the overhaul of the house for the selected period.  As you can see, this method is the most costly in terms of time - to pay off debt you have to perform too many actions and manually enter a lot of information, an error in which can also lead to a loss of money. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There are several ways to pay for overhaul, and some of them allow you to do this without leaving home.  If access to the Internet is not available, then you can use an alternative method - payment through a self-service terminal or ATM.  A small fee, about 1-2%, is charged for the payment.  But sometimes a payment can be made free of charge - it all depends on the bank.  So, the most profitable way is to pay with a Sberbank card through a terminal or ATM of the same bank, or through Sberbank's online banking.  In addition, you can conduct a transaction for free on the official website of the FCR. </p>
