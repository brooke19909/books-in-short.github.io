    <h2>  Picturesque places </h2><p>  Borovoe Lake is one of the most famous sources from the group of reservoirs, united by one name.  This complex is located in the eastern part of the Kokchetav Upland.  There is clear and clean water: the bottom is visible even at great depths.  Lakes, surrounded by pine and birch green areas, purify the air and create certain climatic conditions. </p><h2>  Offers for vacationers </h2><p>  Rocky mountains, clean air, <span>pine forests</span> and pristine lakes are the criteria that will help anyone who comes here to relax and gain strength.  For active pastime, horseback riding, catamarans, hiking with climbing elements to local peaks are offered.  For others, it will be more interesting to lie down on the beach during the day, swimming and sunbathing, and in the evening to sit in pleasant company by the fire. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The programs of some resorts cover not only medical procedures, but also horseback riding and skiing in winter.  One of the important advantages is the fact that thanks to coniferous forests there are absolutely no mosquitoes on the territory.  Steppes, ponds and forests - this is what visitors can see when they visit the territory where Borovoe Lake is located. </p>

It is also known that the water and clay of the local salt pond Maybalyk have healing properties. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The composition of the water includes many useful elements, so some resorts located near this lake offer a similar service.  For example, the Shchuchinsky sanatorium works in a similar way, which was reopened after the Great Patriotic War.  The recreation center is popular not only among local residents, but is also popular with foreign tourists.  The treatment program includes the use of koumiss - mare‚Äôs milk, which, combined with a calm and measured life in the paradise of Borovoe Lake, has a beneficial effect on the treatment of diseases of the nervous system and heart. </p>
