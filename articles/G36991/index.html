In the store or on the Internet sites there is a huge selection of goods, however, it is difficult to find the right cover for your bedroom, to guess that it matches the color of the curtains or wallpaper.  And the prices of such goods, frankly, bite.  But you don‚Äôt want to buy a cover for one year, which can significantly change the color or size after the first wash. </p><p>  There is always a way out - to sew the bedspread yourself.  It is enough to have minimal skills with a sewing machine to create a beautiful product.  Its cost will depend only on the purchased materials, and this in any case will not be as expensive as when buying a finished product. </p><h2>  Style Selection </h2><p>  Before stitching the bedspread on the bed, you need to consider the style of the product.  The choice of options depends on your skills and needs.  You can, of course, just get a dense tapestry fabric, process the seams and throw on the bed.  But if you want something special, unique, then you need to try.  We list the most popular models: </p><ul><li>  flat with frills on the sides; </li><li>  quilted; </li><li>  a cover from shreds of different fabrics (patchwork); </li><li>  knitting from yarn with knitting needles; </li><li>  crocheted from the same size of squares; </li><li>  blanket with puffs; </li><li>  a bedspread decorated with cords, tassels, fringe; </li><li>  product with inserts from another fabric; </li><li>  option with ruffles sewn over the fabric in the form of an ornament; </li><li>  with embroidery or applique. </li></ul><p>  You can list endlessly, since you can fantasize over the creation of bedspreads for a long time.  After choosing the necessary style, you need to calculate the size of the future product in order to know exactly how much fabric you need to buy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Fabric calculation </h2><p>  Before you sew the bedspread on the bed, you need to make the right measurements.  Three main parameters are measured: the length, width and height of the bed from the mattress to the floor.  It is necessary to add 20 cm to the width of the bed to cover the entire surface, because under the coverlet there can be a blanket and pillows.  If it is necessary to hide the base, then the height of the bed is additionally added. </p><p>  It is possible to sew a bedspread on the bed into the bedroom with ruffles, then it is additionally necessary to stock up with material to design the bottom.  In this case, the length and width of the berth from three sides are measured and the fabric is added depending on the number of shuttlecocks. </p><h2>  Patchwork patchwork </h2><p>  Stitched bedspreads on the bed (photo is in the article) made of rags will fit the bedroom in a country style.  Sewing such products will take a lot of time and require accuracy in work.  Such bedspreads are made of shreds of various shapes, it is easiest to create a composition of square elements.  The fabric is selected of the same quality, the colors should also fit together.  When cutting flaps, it is necessary to take into account that you need to leave a couple of centimeters at the seams.  When assembling all the elements, you should get a rectangle of the right size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patchwork style" class="if uuid-2397390" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2397390.jpg"></div><p>  After measuring the width of the bedspread, you need to calculate the number of shreds and cut out all the elements according to the pattern.  Then they need to be ironed with a hot iron and sew together.  It is better to sketch all the details and iron all the seams again.  First they sew the strips, and then they are joined together.  Then the work goes on sewing the filler and the back.  It is best to use a thin synthetic winterizer and a single piece of fabric. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  How to sew a bedspread on a bed so that it is of high quality?  After connecting all the layers, the crafts need to be quilted.  To do this, all three layers are stitched at once with squares or rhombuses.  In the end, you need to beautifully design the edges of the bedspread with an inlay or piping. </p><h2>  Large square item </h2><p>  It is much easier to make a coverlet, which consists not of small, but of large elements.  According to the pattern, you need to cut the fabric into equal squares, then mark the seams and iron it so that there are no wrinkles.  Then on a sewing machine parts are attached to each other and again everything is ironed.  The back side of the bedspread is plain, made of one of the pieces of fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.oscar-india.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="square alignment" class="if uuid-2397395" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2397395.jpg"></div><p>  Since the edges of the bedspread are smooth, without additional edges, the parts are sewn together on the wrong side.  The last side is sewn with an inner seam.  You can seal the cover by adding an extra layer of dense fabric. </p><h2>  A cover from different types of fabric </h2><p>  Sew the bedspread (the master class is in the article) can be made of different fabrics, combining them with stripes in the form of piping.  To create such beauty you just need to correctly execute the product drawing, having drawn all the strips.  You can use a right angle, but the blanket will look prettier if the edges of the strips are cut at an angle of 45 ¬∞. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vidpoviday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bedspread from different fabrics" class="if uuid-2399973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2399973.jpg"></div><p>  First, the central square of the fabric is cut out according to the size of the mattress.  Then add two strips of other fabrics, matched to the tone.  They can have completely different colors.  First, all the strips are sewn, then the corners are carefully marked and bent with a needle.  When everything is ironed, it will be seen whether they are clearly aligned.  If everything is in order, you can stitch all the details on a sewing machine.
