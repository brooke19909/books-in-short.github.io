Its indisputable advantage is its low price.  The gadget BQ-5022 Bond has become a worthy representative of the budget segment.  Although its characteristics are not top-notch, the device copes with everyday tasks with a bang. </p><h2>  Design <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq bond 5022 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075048.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Smartphone BQ-5022 Bond is made in the usual design.  It is not much different from other devices, presented in the budget price category.  The plastic case with a metal frame looks harmonious.  The corners are a little rounded, so you cannot call the device bulky, although its thickness is as much as 10 mm.  The back cover is interestingly decorated.  Its surface imitates raw metal.  The camera lens, flash and scanner are framed by a chrome insert that protrudes slightly on the surface of the case.  The output speaker hole is displayed at the bottom.  During operation, you can accidentally cover it with your hand.  Also, the sound is greatly muffled if you put the device on a soft surface. </p><p>  <span>Phone BQ-5022</span> Bond weighs 181 g. In the hand, and in your pocket, its mass is quite noticeable.  All controls and connectors are in the usual place.  The battery cover is removable, so the slots for SIM cards and flash drives are located under it.  To install them, you will have to remove the battery. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Camera and Display Specifications </h2><p>  The BQ-5022 Bond camera features are hardly relevant.  The optics are pretty weak.  The main one uses an 8 MP matrix, the front camera uses 5 MP.  Owners and settings will not please either.  All of them are standard.  There is an HDR mode, thanks to which the pictures taken on the street are clear and detailed.  In poor lighting conditions, getting a quality shot is a real problem.  The photo shows noise and blur. </p><p>  But here is what the BQ-5022 Bond really boasts - screen features.  The five-inch display displays the picture clearly and richly.  The maximum resolution is HD.  Thanks to a good density (320 ppi), the image is detailed.  Juicy colors and wide viewing angles are provided by the IPS matrix.  The brightness margin is not enough for comfortable work on the street, so there may be problems with the perception of information.  The manufacturer claims that the gadget has an anti-reflective coating, but it does not cope with the task.  Multi-touch supports five touches.  The touchscreen is good, it works correctly. </p><h2>  Hardware equipment </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bq 5022 bond reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075050.jpg"></div></h2><p>  The BQ-5022 Bond's performance characteristics are poor.  Its ‚Äúbrain‚Äù is the outdated chipset of the Chinese brand MediaTek.  The MT6580A processor cannot boast of high power.  The row of the system is 32 bits, which greatly upsets the owners.  All new applications will be unavailable.  For the graphics meets the Mali-400 MP, RAM - 1GB.  The system works smoothly only if you do not overload the gadget.  When launching "heavy" applications, freezes appear. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Manages the Android 6.0 device.  From myself, the manufacturer did not install add-ons, except for a few applications.  The interface is standard.  Pleasantly pleased with the ability to update by "air". </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone bq 5022 bond" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075054.jpg"></div></h2><p>  Reviews about the BQ-5022 Bond can be found different.  Frankly negative are addressed to autonomy.  The reason for this was the 2.3 thousand mAh battery.  If you take into account all the characteristics of the phone, then this is critically small.  During testing, with active Wi-Fi and brightness at maximum, the gadget lasted a little more than 4 hours.  In a combined mode of operation, the owner can count on no more than a daylight hours, and the load should be average. </p><h2>  BQ-5022 Bond: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the description of the smartphone, we highlight all the advantages and disadvantages discovered by the owners.  In numerous reviews there were comments on <span>shockproof glass.</span>  Unfortunately, in practice it turned out to be useless, since cracks form on the screen when it falls.  You can also pay attention to poor quality assembly.  The back cover does not have stiffeners, so it bends when pressed.  And the most critical minus of the BQ-5022 Bond is the battery characteristics.  The phone hardly survives until the evening. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone bq 5022 bond" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2075049.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But users are not the only weak points.  During the interaction with the smartphone, advantages were discovered.  The most important thing is the low price (up to 6,000 rubles).  The owners were pleased with the presence of a scanner, which is rarely found in "state employees".  A good screen and the sixth "Android" increase the score.  On average, out of five points, users give the smartphone a solid three. </p>
