How to get there and not spend a lot of time?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Krasnodar and Voronezh are two cities that differ from each other not only in architecture and local flavor, but also in climate, which is very important for those who like to soak up the sun.  How to overcome the distance between these settlements?  Now we will tell. </p><h2>  Distance </h2><p>  Between Krasnodar and Voronezh a little more than 830 kilometers, if you count on the roads.  Naturally, the duration of the railway is somewhat different, and the plane flies directly.  But for the average distance from Voronezh to Krasnodar, it is easiest to take exactly 800-900 kilometers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Voronezh Krasnodar" class="if uuid-2418385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2418385.jpg"></div><h2>  Traveling by car </h2><p>  The most common way to travel to the Russian south is to autotrip on your own vehicle. </p><p>  There are two ways to cover the distance from Voronezh to Krasnodar by car. </p><p>  1. Traffic on the M-4 federal highway. </p><p>  If you prefer large roads or you are a novice driver, then this method is for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.businessgreen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="travel by car" class="if uuid-2418386" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2418386.jpg"></div><p>  About the pros: </p><ul><li>  the ability to accelerate to an impressive speed of 110 km / h; </li><li>  excellent road quality; </li><li>  SOS buttons along the route; </li><li>  well-developed infrastructure in the form of hotels, cafes and driver's resting places. </li></ul><p>  About cons: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  many paid sites, the trip becomes more expensive by 500-600 rubles one way; </li><li>  most of the journey will take place away from interesting places. </li></ul><p>  2. Traffic on suburban roads towards the cities of Liski, Rossosh, Millerovo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripsavvy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car rides on the road" class="if uuid-2418389" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73489/2418389.jpg"></div><p>  This is an option for thrifty people who are in no hurry and believe in themselves. </p><p>  About the pros: </p><ul><li>  the path will pass through several interesting provincial cities, overcoming the distance from Voronezh to Krasnodar will be a very contemplative process; </li><li>  there will be no paid sites, you won‚Äôt have to overpay for travel. </li></ul><p>  About cons: </p><ul><li>  the traveler will spend 1.5 hours more, since the road will pass through settlements; </li><li>  the second minus comes out of the first - the maximum speed in places will be 40 km / h; </li><li>  the quality of asphalt leaves much to be desired, as on any municipal motorway; </li><li>  Traveling can be tedious due to heavy traffic in settlements; </li><li>  the road is single-lane in many places, if a truck is in front of the traveler, you will have to go 15-20 kilometers behind it; </li><li>  difficulties with infrastructure, hotels and cafes will be encountered, but not in such numbers as on the route along the M-4. </li></ul><h2>  Bus road </h2><p>  If the car is a means of transportation that is inaccessible to you or it‚Äôs just scary to drive, then you can consider overcoming the distance Voronezh-Krasnodar by regular bus. </p><p>  There are no permanent flights from the central bus station, but there is a flight from the Tvoy Dom shopping center on the left bank of Voronezh.  The ticket price ranges from 1000 to 2000 rubles, depending on the availability of amenities in the bus in the form of air conditioning and a toilet. </p><p>  The road will be long and not the most comfortable, you should immediately prepare for it. </p><h2>  Railway </h2><p>  The longest way from Voronezh to Krasnodar is a train trip.  Russian Railways does not provide the services of the fastest locomotives, which means that even on the fast train you will have to travel more than 17 hours.  For such a distance, this is a lot, but a huge number of long stops, sanitary areas and a leisurely train make the road just endless. </p><p>  The average ticket price ranges from 1,500 to 4,000 rubles.  Long, expensive, uncomfortable. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  The only alternative to public transport is the car.  You can team up with friends and share the cost of gasoline and car depreciation.  And you can use the service to search for travel companions.  This is the most acceptable option.  As a result, you don‚Äôt have to drive and spend a lot of money on gas, but you can chip in 500 rubles and get from Voronezh to Krasnodar in the most comfortable conditions. </p><p>  And now we‚Äôre quickly looking for partners and hit the road, because life is so short, which means you need to saturate it with events and do it as soon as possible! </p>
