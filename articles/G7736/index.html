It is she who is the hallmark of this area.  Here, elements of vegetation and wildlife landscape are fully preserved. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The height of Mithridates does not exceed 92 meters above sea level, and it is visible from anywhere in the city.  To admire the beautiful landscape and the azure of the Kerch bay, you will have to climb the observation deck up the stairs, which has 436 steps.  It was built in the 19th century.  The unique design with the extension of steps from bottom to top was designed in the style of classicism by Italian architect Alexander Digby.  On the columns along the stairs there are majestic griffins with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion.  At the foot of the mountain is the Church of St. John the Baptist. </p><p>  This attraction has become one of the favorite places for the indigenous people and often visited by tourists coming to the city of Kerch.  Mount Mithridates, whose history holds many secrets and secrets, is a mysterious object.  For many centuries, neither scientists nor archaeologists have been able to completely solve many of them. </p>

    <h2>  Antique history </h2><p>  On its slopes, Mount Mithridates (see photo in the article) stores the prints of the history of one of the oldest cities in the world - Panticapaeum.  About 26 centuries ago, it was majestically located on its peak and slopes.  Nowadays, ruins that survived many eras have become a place for excursions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The mountain got its name in honor of the great ruler of Bosporus - Tsar Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontius, who held this post in 120-63 BC.  Occupying such a large position, he built his palace on the top, and churches in honor of the Greek gods, luxurious houses of noble people were erected along the perimeter of the mountain.  During his reign, the kingdom was buried in wealth and luxury. </p><p>  Being a descendant of Alexander the Great, the king of Pontius was a unique person and combined in his character two opposite features: a love of art, science and special cruelty to enemies.  He was in good physical shape.  According to legend, the ruler was very rich, but, fearing betrayal and treason, he ordered that all his gold and jewelry be melted into two horse heads that were buried in the ground.  Nobody has managed to find such treasures yet. </p>

    <h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><p>  Due to his strong character, he dared to challenge the prosperous Roman Empire.  This series of wars concluded three main stages and lasted for 26 years.  Twice Mithridates VI Eupator became the winner in the battles, but in the last battle he did not win.  Returning home from the battlefield with the goal of gathering an army and coming out with new forces, he learns about the treacherous conspiracy of his son Farnak.  In order not to allow himself to be captured and disgraced, the ruler decides to end his life by drinking poison, but for many years he gradually got used to the poison and did not let him die.  And then he ordered his faithful servant - the chief of his guard - to stab himself.  That is how the story of the great man ended, whose name will be borne by Mithridates (mountain) for centuries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the death of his father, his place was taken by the traitor son, but the rule of Farnak did not last long - five years later he died in a battle with Julius Caesar near the city of Zela.  Caesar announced the news of his success in the Roman Senate with an expression that is relevant in our time: "Come, see, win!" </p>

    <h2>  Monument of our time </h2><p>  In addition to the antique, Mithridates (the mountain) will reveal a more modern history for tourists and vacationers.  It's no secret that Kerch is a hero city.  It was here, on the top of the slope, that fierce battles were fought to liberate the city from Nazi invaders. </p><p>  In the fall of 1944, the first monument to the soldiers who died during the Great Patriotic War, the obelisk of Glory to immortal heroes, was erected on the mountain.  The design is a stele directed to the sky, 24 meters high, mounted on a multi-stage base.  On its central side is the Order of Glory. </p><p>  At the base of the monument are three artillery pieces. </p><p>  Nearby is a memorial plaque in the form of book pages with the names of all the dead, made of marble. </p><p>  Fourteen years later, on the Victory Day, there was a solemn lighting of the Eternal Flame, which burns in the place where, according to legend, the chair of Tsar Mithridates stood. </p>

    <p>  The monument was designed by A.D. Kiselev, and it was built from the stones of the Trinity Cathedral.  Thanks to the special design, the obelisk of Glory can be seen with the naked eye at a distance of 20 km.  It was erected in honor of the dead soldiers of the ninth motor-engineering battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. F. I. Kinevsky. </p><h2>  Great moments </h2><p>  Over the past millennia, Mithridates Mountain has seen a lot.  Very significant historical events for mankind took place on its slopes.  She saw the prosperity and destruction of the great Bosporus kingdom. </p><p>  Many great people came here to admire the beauty of the landscape, which opens from the top.  So, in 1699, the Russian Tsar Peter I ascended the stairs, who arrived in the expanses of the Black Sea in his ship with the name "Fortress".  Other historical figures from the ruling dynasty came here: Alexander I, Nicholas I. </p><p>  The great poet A. S. Pushkin drew his inspiration from the writing of Onegin, walking along the slopes of the mountain.  It was this work that laid the foundation for the poetic discovery of Crimea. </p>

    <p>  The signing of a peace treaty in 1774 for the place where Mithridates (the mountain) is located was of great historical significance.  Kerch became part of the Russian Empire. </p><h2>  Relive everything </h2><p>  It is safe to say that one of the main historical monuments of the Crimean peninsula is Mithridates (mountain).  Kerch is a city that appears before you as a large open-air museum.  Here you can get unforgettable sensations, realizing the full extent of the events that took place on this slope.  And walking along the underground necropolis of Panticapaeum, you can touch antiquity, see rock paintings. </p>
