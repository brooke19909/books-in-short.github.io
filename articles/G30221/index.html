It was there that 10 rubles of 1993 were minted. This coin was a means of payment on the territory of the Russian Federation in the nineties.  Outwardly, 10 rubles in 1993 looked quite usual. </p>

    <p>  On the obverse in the center is the image of the double-headed eagle, and at the very bottom around the circumference is the two-word inscription “BANK OF RUSSIA”, written in capital letters.  The reverse of the coin 10 rubles 1993 consists of several images.  In the center is the denomination (digital).  Under it is the inscription of the monetary unit.  A little lower there is a dividing line, in the middle of which there is a sign of a particular mint.  And under it, near the edge, is the year of manufacture.  The figures are engraved on the sides of the numbers: on the right is an oak branch with one acorn below, and on the left is a wheat spikelet.  On the rim of the coin from the outside, its face value is once again registered, the words in which are divided among themselves by several squares. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of coinage </h2><p>  Over the entire period of its existence, the state sign of 10 rubles 1993 was published in four different types.  They differed from each other in two ways: </p><ul><li>  the location of the mint; </li><li>  manufacturing material. </li></ul><p>  Numismatists are well aware of these features.  The value of a single coin depends on them.  The following varieties are known 10 rubles 1993: </p><ol><li>  Coin made of steel coated with a copper-nickel alloy, made in Moscow. </li><li>  The same coin made in St. Petersburg. </li><li>  Banknote, cast entirely from a copper-nickel alloy in Moscow. </li><li>  A similar copy made in St. Petersburg. </li></ol><p>  This money has one feature.  The first two of them are made of steel.  They are also called "magnetic." </p>

    <p>  This ability is easy to verify.  One has only to bring closer the usual magnet for the refrigerator, and he will immediately attract a coin.  The remaining two types are made of a special alloy and do not have this ability. </p><h2>  Where is the money made? </h2><p>  All money related specifically to the Russian Federation began to be produced since 1992.  They were made at two state-owned enterprises, which are now called mints. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In our country there are only two of them: </p><ol><li>  Moscow, which is officially considered founded in April 1942. </li><li>  St. Petersburg.  It was founded in 1724 by Tsar Peter the Great. </li></ol><p>  The coin of 10 rubles of 1993, like all other similar payment units, on the reverse has a letter designation, by which you can easily determine the place where it was minted.  In the first case, these are the three letters "MMD".  In the second case, the letters changed, since from the beginning of its creation to the revolution it was St. Petersburg.  Then until 1924 it was considered Petrograd.  After that, until 1996, he was called Leningradsky, and now he, after returning his name to the city, again became St. Petersburg.  In <span>1993, the</span> image “LMD” was minted on coins.  Later, since 1996, this sign was placed on the obverse under the left paw of a lion. </p><h2>  Real price </h2><p>  Over time, coins of past years are perceived as a rarity and acquire a completely different price.  Some of them are recognized so rare that the cost can be increased at times.  Typically, such details are of interest to numismatists.  These people collect banknotes based on their importance.  In this regard, many are interested in whether it has a value of 10 rubles in 1993?  This question cannot be answered unequivocally.  It all depends on the material from which it was made, and the company where it was minted. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, all ten-ruble coins of 1993 release are completely different.  They can be divided into four different groups: </p><ol><li>  All magnetic specimens made of steel are not particularly valuable.  They have been issued in sufficiently large circulation and are currently out of circulation.  But they can still be sold at a price of up to five rubles. </li><li>  Magnetic coins issued in those years in Leningrad are not like the others.  They do not have the usual image of an eagle.  All feathers have special notches except four.  One of them is located on the body itself, and three are on the side.  For such copies, you can get up to seven hundred rubles. </li><li>  Non-magnetic coins of Moscow production, some manage to sell for 1500-2000 rubles. </li><li>  The same copies made in Leningrad are considered unique.  At auctions, the price of these rare coins reaches seventy thousand. </li></ol><p>  Collectors try to have all the varieties in order to be able to demonstrate the difference and emphasize the uniqueness of the rarest specimens. </p>
