From most tourists staying at Sylva Hotel 2 *, reviews about local beaches are very positive.  Many travelers, first vacationing in Limassol, are surprised by the unusual color of sand on the beach: instead of white or yellow, sea sand due to the high content of silicon is a grayish tint.  In addition, tourists often tell the following about local beaches: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The beaches and sea water in Limassol and the surrounding cities are clean. </li><li>  All beach equipment is paid, but renting it for recreation is not necessary.  Many tourists enjoyed relaxing on the sand in the shade of trees. </li><li>  Sunset at sea is gentle and safe.  Near the shore, the depth is shallow. </li><li>  Water activities and sports are available on the beach.  You can use the services of instructors from the diving school, try your hand at windsurfing, water skiing, canoeing and more. </li></ul><p>  The conclusion that can be drawn by studying the reviews of former guests of Sylva Hotel 2 *: Limassol is an ideal place for a beach holiday for the whole family.

    <h2>  Opinions of tourists about hotel rooms </h2><p>  Talking about the quality of service and conditions in the rooms of Sylva Hotel 2 * (Limassol), guest reviews often characterize the hotel as very decent for the declared "two-star" level of comfort and low cost.  About this Cretan hotel you can find the following information: </p><ul><li>  Many guests like the design of the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel and the room in which they are accommodated.  Paintings on the walls, unusual interior, serviceable windows and balcony doors, blackout curtains leave pleasant impressions. </li><li>  Air conditioners are in good condition and do a good job of cooling.  However, in some rooms, guests encountered a faulty air conditioning system: there are complaints of too loud noise during operation or dripping condensate. </li><li>  In some hotel rooms, far from new furniture with obvious cracks.  It is noticeable that the repair was carried out for a long time.  Because of this, the interior of the room is compared with the "Soviet hotel". </li><li>  Tap water is suitable for drinking and making tea. </li><li>  The pool view rooms are less noisy, the sea view is more aesthetic. </li><li>  Pets allowed. </li><li>  A feature that all tourists mention is the unusual shape of the sockets in the room - with three holes instead of the usual two.  On the island to recharge the phone you need to buy a special adapter.  The nearest outlet where you can purchase it is the Alfamega supermarket.  Other tourists simply connected the charger in two holes without an adapter.  At the reception of the hotel such a device is not issued. </li><li>  The number can be replaced with a surcharge by contacting the reception. </li></ul>

    <h2>  About staff </h2><p>  The main staff of Sylva Hotel 2 * are employees from India and Bangladesh.  There are Russian employees, for example, a clerk at the reception.  In addition to Greek, the staff speaks English, Russian, Italian. </p><p>  Among the positive qualities of employees from India or local residents, as a rule, they call courtesy, willingness to patiently listen to the guest and understand the problem, courtesy, smile and friendliness.  At the same time, there are often complaints of unhurriedness, slowness, and a somewhat detached attitude to one's duties.  In particular, the cleaning of the room is not carried out very carefully, but the request of customers to correct the defects is carried out politely and with a smile. </p><p>  Oddly enough, Russian-speaking tourists have, oddly enough, Russian staff.  Guests express dissatisfaction with the sullen look and incompetence, although they acknowledge that having a person with "knowledge of the language" greatly simplifies life at the hotel. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Meals in the hotel restaurant must be ordered in advance when booking.  The choice of guests are offered the system of "Breakfast" or "Half Board".  Dishes are served on the basis of the "buffet".  In most reviews, hotel guests indicated that they chose to pay only for breakfast.  This is explained by the fact that in the city of Limassol there is a huge selection of cafes, bars and restaurants of various price categories, offering tourists the opportunity to taste traditional Greek dishes or cuisine from around the world. </p><p>  About food in Sylva Hotel 2 * (Cyprus), guest reviews say almost the same thing: </p><ul><li>  The hotel restaurant is quite clean, no gross violations of sanitary standards. </li><li>  Meals are served freshly prepared.  For breakfast every day, the composition of the buffet changes. </li><li>  The set of dishes is quite traditional: eggs, slices, coffee, vegetables, sometimes fruits, granola, toasts, tea and more.  Some reviews call the choice of food "not rich."  However, experienced guests say that it is better to arrive early for breakfast, then the choice of dishes will be quite acceptable. </li></ul><p>  Hotel guests who prefer to pay only breakfast, talk about a wide selection of cafes and restaurants near the hotel, in which the service is aimed at Russian-speaking tourists. </p>

    <h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  For guests coming to rest with children, the hotel provides additional services and equipment: </p><ul><li>  Possibility to install a cot in the room and a baby chair in the restaurant. </li><li>  Baby stroller rental. </li><li>  Babysitting service. </li><li>  Children's mini-pool. </li></ul><p>  Information on the cost of all services can be obtained at the reception.  In addition, within walking distance from the hotel there are many eating establishments offering a special children's menu, and in the city there are many interesting entertainments for parents and children. </p><p>  Limassol is known for its park, which is inhabited by exotic animals: from tropical birds to African elephants.  The city has two water parks with water attractions for adults and children of different ages. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  A lot of attention in the reviews is given to the organization of excursion trips for hotel guests.  It is no secret that there are many interesting historical sites in Crete for viewing: monuments of antiquity, medieval architecture, reminiscent of the times when Limassol was an important seaport or was under the rule of invaders. </p><p>  There are several ways to explore local attractions.  The easiest is to book a sightseeing tour of the main historical places of Cyprus at a travel agency on site or with any city tour operator.  For 2016, a one-day excursion, including swimming at the ‚ÄúAphrodite‚Äôs stone‚Äù, wine tasting and lunch, cost about 50-55 euros per place. </p><p>  Another no less exciting way to organize a cultural program is to rent a transport, purchase a guide to the island and explore the sights on your own.  Tours around the city of Limassol, the most resourceful tourists spent just sitting on the "bus number 30", running along the coast. </p>
