A large proportion of its shares are currently owned by VTB 24, while the rest is owned by Russian Post.  The young institution is developing rapidly.  It offers banking services that are aimed at customers of different social strata along with the possibility of obtaining loans through online applications.  Next, we will figure out how to leave a loan application at the Post Bank, find out what documents are necessary for its preparation, and also get acquainted with some recommendations. </p><div class="photo" data-original="top-rf.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank find out the status of a loan application" class="if uuid-2960127" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960127.jpg"></div><h2>  What kind of loan can customers get online? </h2><p>  In this financial structure, only one loan product, called the "First Post", is issued for an online application.  It is versatile, in addition, they make it out under the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  The loan amount starts from fifty thousand and ranges up to one million Russian rubles. </li><li>  The loan term is from twelve to sixty months. </li><li>  The interest rate is selected individually, as a rule, it ranges from 17 to 30%. </li></ul><p>  It is not difficult to send an application for cash loans in Post Bank.  We will talk about this below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Additional options </h2><p>  In addition to standard lending conditions, Post Bank offers additional services: </p><ul><li>  ‚ÄúGuaranteed rate‚Äù is a unique opportunity available to absolutely all borrowers.  It is connected not earlier than one year after signing the agreement, that is, immediately after making twelve payments.  The service provides a reduction in the current rate to 15% per year.  The connection price is equal to three percent of the loan amount. </li><li>  Providing the possibility of free reduction of the amount of the monthly payment. </li><li>  Skip the first installment for three hundred rubles.  This service is available only once during the whole loan term. </li><li>  Possibility to change the payment date for free. </li><li>  Depositing money by debiting from a card or from an account twenty-nine rubles per transaction. </li></ul><p>  The ability to completely close the loan ahead of schedule for two percent of the remaining amount.  This service can be issued online. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fastpaydaycashadvanceloans.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online application for a loan in a mail bank" class="if uuid-2960118" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960118.jpg"></div><h2>  How to apply for a loan at Post Bank: instructions and recommendations </h2><p>  You can always find a form for an online request on the official website of the financial institution in question.  There is another service, namely a loan calculator, through which you can calculate loans online.  Simply select the amount of the loan, set the terms and calculate monthly payments.  An online loan application at Post Bank is filled out in accordance with some parameters.  It indicates: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Information about the loan. </li><li>  Passport details of the borrower. </li><li>  Information about the official place of work. </li><li>  Personal information about the composition of the family, contact phone numbers and more. </li></ul><p>  Filling out an online loan application at Post Bank, as a rule, takes about ten to fifteen minutes for customers.  After the questionnaire is sent for verification, which lasts twenty minutes.  In the event that the online application is approved, and the client is confirmed with a loan, he will need to contact one of the branches of this financial organization in order to sign documents and receive money.  It is required to come to the bank no later than seven days after the approval of the request.  In the event of a later deadline, the approval is simply canceled, and in order to obtain credit, the borrower will have to go through the entire verification procedure again.  Now let's talk about the requirements that apply to customers. </p><h2>  Who can take loans on an online application? </h2><p>  Every Russian citizen who meets the following conditions will be able to get a loan through an online request: </p><ul><li>  Has a civil passport. </li><li>  It is registered in any region of the country. </li><li>  Has a permanent place of work or receives a pension. </li><li>  May present the bank with its individual account insurance number. </li><li>  Suitable for the financial structure by age (i.e., from eighteen to seventy years for women and from twenty-one years to sixty-five years for men). </li></ul><p>  How to check the loan application "Mail Bank", often asked.  You can get comprehensive information by calling the numbers indicated on the official website of a financial institution, or by contacting the office.  Also, SMS with the application status will come to your number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.jpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank apply for a loan" class="if uuid-2960117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960117.jpg"></div><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  To apply, you will need to provide: </p><ul><li>  Passport data. </li><li>  TIN of the employer, according to which the bank‚Äôs employees will calculate the size of the client‚Äôs salary. </li></ul><p>  Pensioners who receive money to a card or account in the Post Bank must leave a tick on their consent to inquiries to the Pension Fund.  Those who receive payments in any other way should take a certificate from the PF on their assignment of cash benefits on their own and attach it to their main request. </p><h2>  Methods of obtaining and paying a loan </h2><p>  The procedure for receiving cash and paying the monthly installment for a loan that was issued online is absolutely no different from loans in a branch of a financial institution.  Most often, money is transferred to the Bank Post card, which is issued simultaneously with the loan.  You can cash out the amount at ATMs of the same bank without any commission or by contacting any other financial institution for a nominal fee.  You can repay loans in the following ways: </p><ul><li>  By transfer from a card or from another bank account online. </li><li>  By postal order. </li><li>  By depositing cash through the terminals. </li><li>  Through automatic charges. </li></ul><p>  Thus, each client can independently choose how to pay his loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pdenterprises.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank consumer loan apply" class="if uuid-2960134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960134.jpg"></div><h2>  Three main advantages of loans </h2><p>  Before applying for a loan at Post Bank, you need to know about the features of this product: </p><ul><li>  The presence of individually selected bets. </li><li>  The opportunity, without leaving your home, to find out about whether they will give a loan to this organization or refuse. </li><li>  Possibility of independent scheduling of payments and selection of the deadline for making a monthly amount. </li></ul><p>  The inconvenience of registration, as a rule, is that there is no opportunity to complete the procedure online, since you still need to visit the bank. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Consider now the list of services that this organization offers to the public. </p><ul><li>  Providing loans for consumer purposes. </li><li>  The possibility of issuing credit cards. </li><li>  Providing an educational loan. </li><li>  Ability to pay for purchases on a loan. </li><li>  Providing refinancing loans. </li><li>  Getting loans on the card. </li></ul><p>  Each of these products differs in its requirements for customers, which must be followed.  In general, they are quite simple, and the differences are usually not significant. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bacu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank send a loan for cash" class="if uuid-2960115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960115.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  So, now we will consider the question of how to apply for a consumer loan at Post Bank in such a way that the client is not denied it, that is, with the maximum possible approval.  There are a couple of recommendations for this. </p><ul><li>  It is necessary to provide as much documentation as possible. </li><li>  You should carefully check the information you fill in, and in addition, in no case make mistakes. </li><li>  In the event that there is an opportunity, it is necessary to attract co-borrowers. </li><li>  It will not be superfluous to read reviews with tips from already experienced customers. </li></ul><p>  As part of applying for a loan, employees must check their credit history.  And in this case, some nuances may also arise.  It is very good when the client previously took any loans, and repaid them in a timely manner.  This will characterize him as a bona fide borrower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.goodfinancialcents.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank check loan application" class="if uuid-2960131" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960131.jpg"></div><p>  In the event that a person received loans and delays in payments were recorded, this somewhat reduces the likelihood of receiving a positive answer, but even then there is nothing to worry about.  It will be much worse if the client did not take out a single loan at all, and his story is simply empty, or he showed himself to be a malicious defaulter who constantly violated his obligations. </p><p>  When the borrower currently has an open loan, but there are no problems with timely repayment, then he also has no obstacles in processing, and he should not torment himself at all about the issue of how to borrow money from this bank so that not refused, especially if you are interested in refinancing. </p><h2>  How many do you consider applying for a loan at Post Bank? </h2><p>  The request can be considered from one to three business days, depending on the characteristics of the borrower's credit history.  Next, find out how you can check its status. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.brennancenter.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mail bank how many are considering a loan application" class="if uuid-2960119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/59175/2960119.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking the submitted loan application </h2><p>  You can find out the status of a loan application at Post Bank as follows: </p><ul><li>  Via SMS from this financial structure. </li><li>  As part of the appeal to the office. </li><li>  By calling the hotline. </li></ul><p>  Often, for information on the application, you must contact the bank directly.  Credit institutions usually independently inform their customers in an SMS message about what decision was made. </p><p>  We examined how to apply for a loan at Post Bank. </p>
