  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Krasnodar reservoir: history and modernity</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Krasnodar reservoir - an artificial reservoir on the Kuban River.  Its size exceeds the size of all such storage facilities throughout the North Caucasus, therefore it is popularly referred to as the Krasnodar Sea.  Some coasts are so far apart that it is impossible to see the opposite side with the naked eye.  When strong winds begin, the waves in the store can reach 2.5 meters in height. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  <span>The Krasnodar reservoir</span> is 40 kilometers long.  In the widest parts, the width of the reservoir reaches 15 kilometers. </p><p>  The total occupied area is 420 square kilometers.  Throughout the water, the water <span>level</span> differs by 8 meters. </p><p>  Several rivers flow into the body of water: Shunduk, Belaya, Marta and several others. </p><p>  On the banks is the city of Krasnodar itself, several urban-type villages and the Lenin farm. </p><p>  The depth of the artificial storage is from 5 to 16 meters.  The dam covers 11.6 meters of the river bed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reservoir dam" class="if uuid-2245671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245671.jpg"></div><h2>  Economic value </h2><p>  As soon as the construction of the reservoir was completed, shipping was established here.  And over time, the bottom of the reservoir rose strongly: due to the operation of the pumps a lot of shallows appeared and the movement of ships stopped.  Another purpose of the reservoir is the irrigation of rice fields in the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Adygea.  Also, the reservoir was intended to prevent possible flooding of the lower Kuban. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="krasnodar.bezformata.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Water discharge" class="if uuid-2245713" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245713.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The construction of the Krasnodar reservoir took place in 1973, although the decision on the construction was made back in 1967. The dam was finally put into operation in 1975.  Initially, the reservoir was connected to the Teshchik reservoir, and then the rest was filled with water. </p><p>  During the construction of the reservoir, 26 villages were flooded.  And this is 35 thousand hectares of land and 46 cemeteries (25 cemeteries were transferred and 5 mass graves), of which not all were transferred, but were covered with a thick layer of concrete.  More than 30 thousand people were resettled.  Two cities were built for immigrants: Tlyustenhabl and Adygeysk, formerly Teuchevsk.  For these people, who lived all their lives in rural conditions, relocation was a big stress.  The urgent problem of landscaping new cities, especially Adygeisk, remains, because it was erected on a swampy territory.  The city is constantly damp, but not only because of the marshes, but because of its proximity to the Krasnodar reservoir.  And given that this is a seismically active region, 3-4 points are enough to destroy a settlement. </p><p>  But in addition to settlements flooded about 25 thousand arable Adyghe fields, which are famous for their black soil.  In addition, about 16 thousand hectares of forests were cut down. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flooded 12 settlements belonging to the Maikop culture.  They really tried to save archaeological artifacts, but everything was done in a hurry.  They saved what could be carried away, the remaining artifacts were buried under the water column. </p><p>  To this day, as soon as the water level decreases, the inhabitants of the coastal zone on the banks discover ancient artifacts (amphorae, household items). </p><h2>  The prospect of building a hydropower plant </h2><p>  In the 90s, they tried to abolish the reservoir, but the plan was never implemented.  Much later in 2008, they announced the start of construction of a hydroelectric power station, with the date of commissioning as early as next year, but this project was not implemented. </p><div class="photo" data-original="exordinary-krd.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Teschskoye reservoir" class="if uuid-2245674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245674.jpg"></div><h2>  Teschskoye reservoir </h2><p>  The old and abandoned dam of the Krasnodar reservoir separates it from the Teshchik reservoir, which is absorbed by the Krasnodar Sea.  The absorbed lake is located in the area of ​​Vasyurinskaya station. </p><p>  A truck water reservoir was created in 1940.  At that time it was a grandiose building.  Around the reservoir constructed shafts with a height of 4 to 8 meters.  However, the construction was carried out by the so-called folk method, that is, the collective farmers participated in the process (about 64 thousand people).  Moreover, almost all work was carried out manually, but with overfulfillment of the plan by 2, or even 3 times.  The spillway dam was made of reinforced concrete and had ten meter spans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The reservoir was used during the war years, they drained water as needed, and the ramparts were used as firing points.  But because of the constant need to eliminate leaks, they were abandoned for this purpose.  As a result, the lower part of the reservoir was disconnected from the rest of the water area.  Now, even with the full discharge of the Krasnodar reservoir, part of Tshchisky is still filled with water. </p><h2>  Monument to the inhabitants of auls </h2><p>  A memorial complex has been erected on the Enem-Adygeysk-Bzhedugkhabl highway, perpetuating the memory of the inhabitants of five villages, whose houses disappeared from the map due to the construction of the reservoir.  These are six granite steles, which are designed to preserve the memory of the ancestors who lived on the site of the Krasnodar Sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="anapacity.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bird's-eye view of the reservoir" class="if uuid-2245680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245680.jpg"></div><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The Krasnodar Sea is located in the steppe zone, on the shores there are many cereal plants, tansy, colchicum.  In the district there are even special fields where medicinal herbs are grown.  There are many bushes, mainly rose hips and sea buckthorn, hawthorn and buckthorn.  Of the trees, poplars and oaks are often found. </p><p>  In the zone of the Krasnodar Sea you can meet hares and foxes, weasels and rodents live here.  Of the birds, ducks, pheasants and quail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="avtobus-sochi-transfer.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fishermen on the reservoir" class="if uuid-2245709" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245709.jpg"></div><h2>  Fishing </h2><p>  <span>The Krasnodar reservoir</span> was stocked up at one time, so there are always a lot of fishermen on its banks, including winter.  Freeze-up starts in November and ends at the end of March.  The thickness of the ice allows ice fishing. </p><p>  There are a lot of bream, silver carp and common carp, roach and rudd, there are also pike perch and perch. </p><p>  Experienced fishermen recommend fishing from a boat; it bites best in the middle on the Krasnodar reservoir.  Fishing near the dam is prohibited. </p><p>  In the southern part of the water area, there are caught hoes and bleak, sabrefish and pike perch.  The upper reaches of the storehouse were chosen by carp, catfish, ram and roach.  And along all coasts crucian carp and carp are always caught. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.00651239999999" data-lng="39.36390389999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/8/8/488.png"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Swimming <span>in the Krasnodar Sea is</span> prohibited.  But, despite this, a picnic can be organized on the shore.  There is an opportunity to even settle in a recreation center.  It offers guests a base called "Forest Tale".  There is absolutely everything to relax.  Pool with clean water, a playground for children's games.  There is an opportunity to ride ATVs and bicycles.  And in the surrounding area is a forest. </p><p>  Rest on the Krasnodar reservoir on the basis of "Forest Fairy Tale" is an opportunity to disconnect from problems without leaving the city limits.  Here you can rent a house or a gazebo, if you are not supposed to spend the night. </p><p>  You can arrive at the base at any time of the year.  Disco parties, entertainment events are held here.  For lovers of quiet hunting - a forest in which you can even pick berries.  You can also go fishing from the shore.  Base location: Lenin farm, about 20 kilometers from the city. </p><p>  Rest on the Krasnodar reservoir can be on the basis of Lukomorye.  There are two pools and gazebos.  The base is located in the village of Starokorsunskaya on the highway Krasnodar - Kropotkin.  It can be reached not only by personal vehicles, but also by minibus and regular bus.  The base is very well maintained, with many ornamental plants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kotenarina.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the shore of the reservoir" class="if uuid-2245701" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245701.jpg"></div><h2>  Myths and Reality </h2><p>  A lot is written and talked about the state of the Krasnodar reservoir.  In particular, the discussion begins on the eve of the flood season.  But, according to the assurances of the specialists of the reservoir, there is no danger. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Myth </p></td><td><p>  Reality </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  It is believed that the region did not need the Krasnodar Sea at all. </p></td><td><p>  In fact, before its construction there were many floods.  So, in 1956, 156 settlements were flooded.  And in 1966, the flood caused damage of 60 million rubles.  And if you interview the old-timers, they will remember how two, or even three times a year, flooded some areas of the city.  To date, 13 major floods have been prevented, and more than 100 <span>floods in Krasnodar</span> until 1973, that is, until the construction of the reservoir, were recorded in the entire history of observations. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  There is an opinion that the reservoir is located in a seismically dangerous place, in the place of a deep fault, which can lead to an earthquake. </p></td><td><p>  In fact, there is no scientific evidence.  According to scientists, in the Krasnodar Territory there are indeed several faults, but they are located in completely different places. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  The reservoir of the Krasnodar Territory is rapidly silty and will soon turn into a swamp. </p></td><td><p>  Indeed, all channel reservoirs are silted up, however, all measures are regularly held to prevent the appearance of silt.  Some of the work is carried out under water, and another can be seen on the surface.  Blasting experts are involved in these activities. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  On the reservoir, only scheduled repairs are carried out. </p></td><td><p>  Indeed, the facility was recognized as dangerous in 1999, and after the disastrous flood of 2002, funding increased.  The shipping lock was completely restored and anti-corrosion measures are carried out on a regular basis, pumps are regularly changed. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  The water in the water area is very dirty. </p></td><td><p>  Recent research data indicate that the hydrochemical situation is stable, and water quality is normal, and a high content of pollutants has not been identified. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  And finally, for those who still suspect that something is wrong with the Krasnodar Sea: the volume of water is below the retaining level, and the flood tank is completely empty.  The volume of the water area periodically decreases, as rice checks are poured.  The only thing that violated the ecological situation after the appearance of the reservoir was that the water indicators in the wells deteriorated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="webmandry.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dam of the Krasnodar reservoir" class="if uuid-2245691" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2245691.jpg"></div><h2>  Unique find </h2><p>  In September 2007, fossilized bones of three mammoths and skeletons of two bison were discovered on the banks of the Krasnodar reservoir.  Researchers say these fossils are over 35 million years old.  Now they are in the National Museum of the Republic of Adygea. </p><p>  A similar find was discovered 10 years earlier, then the fishermen found a mammoth skeleton on the shore, which is also in the museum.  It is an amazing fact that this type of mammoth has not yet been encountered anywhere and has not been studied at all. </p>
