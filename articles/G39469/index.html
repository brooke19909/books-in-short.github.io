Ferry: prices, timetable, duration of travel</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kaliningrad region is a unique subject of the Russian Federation.  This is not only the westernmost point of the country.  <span>The Kaliningrad region</span> is also notable for the fact that it does not have land communication with the rest of Russia.  From the west it is washed by the Baltic Sea.  Lithuania surrounds it from the north and east, and in the south this region of Russia borders on Poland.  Both countries are members of the European Union and are members of the Schengen Agreement.  Therefore, in order to come to Kaliningrad and its region by land transport from the rest of Russia, you need to open a transit visa.  There are two ways to get to Kaliningrad without these bureaucratic delays: by air and by sea.  In this article we will consider the second possibility.  Fortunately, other cities of Russia go to the Baltic coast.  How to get the route St. Petersburg - Kaliningrad by ferry, how much it costs and how long such a trip will take - read this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg Kaliningrad ferry" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1209806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Exact route </h2><p>  For a long time, two Russian cities were connected by the cargo and passenger ship Georg Ots.  But time passes, and it "has retired."  Now, Georg Ots will be moored off the coast of Vladivostok as a floating hotel.  But the shipping link between the two <span>ports of Russia</span> continues to exist.  But the route of freight and passenger traffic is only conditionally called "St. Petersburg - Kaliningrad."  The ferry does not actually leave the city on the Neva, but from the port of Ust-Luga.  This village is located in Kingisepp district of the Leningrad region.  The <span>port is</span> almost one hundred and fifty kilometers from <span>St. Petersburg</span> .  And the ferry arrives not entirely in Kaliningrad, but in the city of Baltiysk.  It is forty-five kilometers from the regional center.  From St. Petersburg to Ust-Luga can be reached (if there is no own car) by bus.  Not only minibuses, but also electric trains run from Baltiysk to Kaliningrad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Petersburg Kaliningrad by ferry" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1209799.jpg" width="600"></div>

But in winter, when the Baltic usually storms, flights are made once a week.  During the summer navigation season, sea trips between two Russian ports become more frequent.  Transportation during the high tourist season is especially lively.  Passengers, railway cars, cars and cargo are currently transported by three ferries: Petersburg, Baltiysk and Ambal.  All ships during the busy navigation period travel two to three times a week.  The journey is long and takes an average of at least thirty-six hours.  But often the gloomy Baltic Sea does not please with a fair wind, and the trip drags on for up to two days.  Yes, of course, it will be faster by plane.  But many tourists regard the ferry St. Petersburg - Kaliningrad, the photo of which looks like an image of an ocean liner, as an opportunity to make a mini-cruise.  The schedule of these ships often changes.  Every spring, some changes are made.  Therefore, the availability of seats and the nearest exit from the ports should be found in ticket offices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Passenger ferry Kaliningrad St. Petersburg" class="if" height="282" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1209814.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Conditions on board </h2><p>  Baltiysk is a cargo <span>ferry.</span>  <span>St. Petersburg</span> - Kaliningrad - the route is long, and the ferry can take on board only twelve passengers to stay in cabins.  A two-day trip in the car does not seem very comfortable.  For passenger traffic, Petersburg is best suited.  On its decks are placed not only goods and cars.  All three upper platforms are cabins of different levels of comfort and, accordingly, prices.  The cheapest ‚Äúbeds‚Äù are located on the lower passenger deck.  These are cabins in the middle row - they are windowless.  Three meals a day are already included in the fare.  The highest deck is the so-called "Solar".  If the weather is favorable, you can sunbathe in a sun lounger and breathe in the sea breeze. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ferry St. Petersburg Kaliningrad photo" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1209816.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prices for Baltiysk on the route St. Petersburg - Kaliningrad </h2><p>  The ferry, as we have already mentioned, provides cabins for only twelve passengers.  Directions (three meals included) costs six thousand one hundred and fifty rubles.  Separately paid for the transport of vehicles.  So, for a motorcycle you have to pay ten and a half thousand rubles, and for a passenger car - from sixteen to twenty-five thousand.  Oversized baggage is also charged.  Since the ship has only six double cabins intended for passengers, many drivers send their cars with ‚Äúunaccompanied cargo‚Äù, and they themselves go to meet them in Kaliningrad or in St. Petersburg by plane.  Cheaper rates on the Ambal vessel. </p><h2>  Traveling in comfort </h2><p>  Passenger ferry Kaliningrad - St. Petersburg is a wonderful opportunity to see the Amber Region without a transit visa through Lithuania.  After all, when buying a ticket and for travel, you only need an internal passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation.  Of course, the Petersburg ferry cannot be called a cruise liner.  But still the cabins, especially on the upper decks, are very comfortable.  Previously, the Petersburg ferry operated flights on the Black Sea, between Sevastopol and Novorossiysk, and only last year was transferred to the Baltic.  This summer, most likely, a new route will be introduced.  The ferry will depart from Ust-Luga (Leningrad Region) and immediately follow to Sassnitz (Germany).  After this, the ship will turn in the direction of Baltiysk.  And then from the Kaliningrad region it will deliver passengers to St. Petersburg.  This new route, of course, will please those residents of the city on the Neva who have a passport with a Schengen visa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cargo ferry St. Petersburg Kaliningrad" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1209834.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Not many tourists managed to ride on a new ship on the route St. Petersburg - Kaliningrad.  This ferry moved to the Baltic recently.  But whoever managed, they say that the double and triple cabins are very comfortable and clean.  The food on board is good.  But if you have motion sickness, do not lean on food.  The Baltic Sea is a stormy sea, and the ferry during the storms significantly shakes.  But the trip is quite safe, although it may be delayed due to weather conditions. </p>
