Among others, Samsung devices, which attribute the honorary title of No. 1 manufacturer in the world, are especially popular. </p><p>  But against the background of other brands, the Japanese company Sony is proudly holding its head.  Without special ambitions, she produces high-quality equipment in all respects and simply collects laurels as the best of the best.  Sony knows the value of its products and has long proved to everyone its superiority.  The brand has many fans around the world, including in Russia. </p><p>  The equipment from this Japanese company is an indicator of the status of the owner and his good taste.  And the main qualities, judging by the reviews of Sony TVs, are its solid appearance, exceptional build quality and realistic picture.  The assortment of models presented on the domestic market inspires respect.  And getting lost in all this diversity is very easy. </p><p>  In the article, read about the best, by reviews, Sony TVs, which can be found in our stores.  The noteworthy qualities of the models, key characteristics, and the advantages and disadvantages of each device are considered.  It‚Äôs worth starting with budget TVs, and finishing with premium ones. </p><h2>  Sony Bravia KDL-32WD756 </h2><p>  In addition to a good picture on the output, the TV boasts an advanced sound reproduction system built on Bass Reflex Speaker technology.  Such a solution allows you to transfer the audio track with proper quality even on small speakers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.simplyelectricals.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Bravia KDL-32WD756" class="if uuid-3129585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129585.jpg"></div><p>  Users in their reviews of the Sony 32 TV note that the device feels great in tandem with the Android platform.  You can connect any prefix on this OS to the device and fully reveal all the possibilities of the pair.

In its price category it can be called the best.  It quite easily outperforms its Chinese and South Korean competitors both in terms of build quality and realistic images. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shop.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Bravia KDL-43WF805" class="if uuid-3129587" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129587.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews on the Sony KDL-43WF805 TV are all positive.  The users liked the modern design of the case of the model and its ergonomic qualities.  Especially users like neat, countersunk legs and thin frames.  The latter, albeit made of plastic, but extremely high quality. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Pleased with the picture.  The matrix, built on VA-technology at a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, produces an excellent image.  It complements its sensible Edge LED backlight.  There are also noise reduction systems, color gamut enhancements, clarity enhancement, plus full HDR support (version 10 + HLG).  Judging by the reviews on the Sony TV, 43 ‚Äùis an excellent choice for viewing content in the 720-1080r layout. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  good picture quality; </li><li>  the presence on board the intellectual platform "Android TV"; </li><li>  good sound; </li><li>  5 kHz Wi-Fi wireless protocols </li><li>  advanced universal tuner (DVB-T2 / S2 / C); </li><li>  full HDR. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  sometimes software freezes; </li><li>  not everyone liked the design of the legs. </li></ul><p>  The price is 45 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony Bravia KD-49XF7596 </h2><p>  The Bravia XF series - already with a 4K / UHD scan and corresponding price tag.  A sensible IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãresponsible for picture quality.  Naturally, there are no problems with viewing angles with this technology - they are maximum - 178 ¬∞ in both planes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ceneo.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Bravia KD-49XF7596" class="if uuid-3129590" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129590.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews on the Sony Bravia KD-49XF7596 TV are mostly positive.  Users note that the output image is accurate, bright and saturated.  Some complain about small problems with contrast, but everything is solved by fine tuning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The design, judging by the reviews on the Sony Bravia TV, also pleased.  The case of the device turned out thin, thanks to the use of Edge LED side illumination.  Stylish frames made of very high-quality plastic successfully imitate aluminum and harmoniously blend into the overall design.  The legs are also stylized in metal, plus everything got an intelligent cable management system. </p><p>  A set of chipsets based on the X-Reality PRO processor, which works closely with Motionflow 400 XR and Live Color technologies, is responsible for image processing.  Judging by the reviews on the Sony 49 TV, users also liked the software filling. </p><h2>  What is remarkable model </h2><p>  The Android platform of the Nougat series copes with its tasks perfectly, even without a hint of lags.  It is also possible to update the stock firmware to version 8 of Oreo.  Both there and there you can control the basic functionality of the TV using voice commands. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent picture quality; </li><li>  full support for HDR; </li><li>  universal receiver (terrestrial, satellite, cable TV); </li><li>  an abundance of interfaces for connecting peripherals; </li><li>  ChromeCast support; </li><li>  good sound with ClearAudio +. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: the frequency sweep of the panel is 50 Hz (only TV without connecting to a PC). </p><p>  The price is 65,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony Bravia KD-49XF8596 </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of the Sony 4K TV, many fans of high-quality equipment consider the model the best in the mid-price segment.  Due to its characteristics, the device can compete even with premium devices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.plasmavisie.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Bravia KD-49XF8596" class="if uuid-3129589" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129589.jpg"></div><p>  The model is offered in two colors - black and silver.  The matrix may also be different - IPS or VA.  Reviews of Sony TVs in this series indicate that the latter option is preferable both in terms of cost and impact (refresh rate of 120 Hz versus 60 for IPS).  In both versions, Edge LED type backlight is installed. </p><p>  Motionflow 1000 XR is responsible for the dynamic scenes, ensuring extremely smooth playback.  The main advantage over the younger generations of the series is the presence of the X1 processor, which provides excellent HDR implementation at 4K resolution.  Reviews on Sony's smart TV TV are also positive.  The platform is responsive and works even without a hint of errors. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  image enhancement systems Object-based HDR, Super Bit Mappin; </li><li>  10-bit matrix; </li><li>  fast platform "Android TV"; </li><li>  Easy integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  comfortable legs and cable management system. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: no Dolby Vision support. </p><p>  The price is 85 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony Bravia KD-55XF9005 </h2><p>  This is a serious premium model with a diagonal of 55 inches.  The TV performance materials are appropriate: no plastic, only aluminum and other metal alloys.  Judging by the reviews of Sony TVs in this series, the quality of the models is fully consistent with their high cost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.desibela.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony Bravia KD-55XF9005" class="if uuid-3129591" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129591.jpg"></div><p>  The device turned out really good: a matrix on VA technology, advanced Direct LED backlight with local dimming, an impressive margin of brightness with contrast, well, and, of course, excellent picture detailing, including HDR and Dolby Vision class. </p><p>  Image processing is handled by a powerful set of chipsets, led by the X1 Extreme processor, supporting X-tended Dynamic Range PRO, X-Motion Clarity, and Triluminos Display technologies.  The latest version of the smart Android TV is used as the main platform.  It provides not only a lot of opportunities for managing functionality and content, but also opens a wide door to the world of online entertainment. </p><h2>  Distinctive characteristics of the model </h2><p>  Very warm reviews about Sony TVs in this series are left by gamers, namely the owners of the fourth generation Playstation consoles, including the Pro version.  The device is ideal for gaming and streaming, perfectly coping with the most complex dynamic scenes. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  great picture on the output; </li><li>  image scaling to the UHD level; </li><li>  Motionflow 1000 XR system at a frequency of 120 Hz; </li><li>  universal tuner (cable, satellite, terrestrial TV); </li><li>  broadcast recording; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  aluminium case. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Not everyone liked the stand; </li><li>  local speakers do not best implement bass (stew). </li></ul><p>  The price is 100 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony KD-75ZF9 </h2><p>  The model is a kind of intermediate flagship of last year in the segment of LED devices.  The backlight is direct here, so the case looks massive.  But in principle, the expression ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is inapplicable to a 75-inch device, so the slightly larger thickness of the case does not spoil the appearance of the TV. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.simplyelectricals.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony KD-75ZF9" class="if uuid-3129592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129592.jpg"></div><p>  The model received a VA-matrix with support for a resolution of 3840 by 2160 pixels.

There is much better scaling from HD to UHD with the expansion of the dynamic range to the HDR format. </p><p>  The output image is obtained with an exceptional degree of detail and optimal contrast thanks to the X-tended Dynamic Range PRO technology used.  The dynamic X-Motion Clarity system is responsible for processing dynamic scenes.  Also, many owners in their reviews note the perfect color reproduction of the image.  The original brand development - the Triluminos Display system - contributed to this. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The software part fell on the shoulders of the Android platform version 8.0 Areo.  The latter allows you to control almost all the tools using voice commands.  Also pleased with the abundance of various interfaces for connecting peripherals, including the Dolby Atmos soundbars. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  great picture on the output; </li><li>  accurate color reproduction regardless of viewing angle; </li><li>  support for all HDR and Dolby Vision formats; </li><li>  latest generation processor; </li><li>  an abundance of interfaces for connecting almost any peripheral; </li><li>  attractive appearance; </li><li>  exceptional build quality and materials used. </li></ul><p>  No flaws identified. </p><p>  The price is 420 000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony KD-65AF9 </h2><p>  This is the flagship OLED model of last year.  Judging by the reviews of the owners, this TV is the best that not only Sony can offer, but also the premium sector in general, taking into account the size of the diagonal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="abtelugutech.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sony KD-65AF9" class="if uuid-3129588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109482/3129588.jpg"></div><p>  The front of the model is a high-tech panel with self-illuminating dots.  Thanks to this decision, the owner receives not only exceptional color reproduction, but also endless contrast, as well as a strikingly deep black color. </p><p>  The latest generation chipset, led by the X1 Ultimate processor, is responsible for image processing.  The company also introduced its innovative Pixel Contrast Booster system to further expand color gamut and increase detail. </p><h2>  Model benefits </h2><p>  The owners in their reviews mentioned the sound of the model.  Technology Surface Audio + copes with the processing of multidimensional 3D-sound.  There are no problems with the distortion of low frequencies during wall placement, which are characteristic of such a technique.  Everything was decided with the help of 3 drivers and 2 good subwoofers. </p><p>  Many owners quite successfully use the TV as the main speaker system.  So there is no need to spend money on home theater accessories.  The model, stuffed to the limit with modern technology, is the best option for the most ambitious consumers who do not accept compromises. </p><p>  TV advantages: </p><ul><li>  exceptional image quality and realistic gamma; </li><li>  reproduction of content of any format and complexity; </li><li>  smooth and true processing of dynamic scenes (120 Hz); </li><li>  Android platform version 8.0 with advanced voice control; </li><li>  perfect viewing angles without a hint of color distortion (178/178). </li></ul><p>  No flaws identified. </p><p>  The price is 450 000 rubles. </p>
