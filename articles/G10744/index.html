For most, it is tempting to make an unconscious purchase.  It‚Äôs not easy to repay borrowed money, because there is no exact amount for monthly payments on such cards.  Credit programs help reduce credit burdens.  In the article, we will consider where it is possible to refinance a Sberbank credit card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.majestymortgage.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card refinancing" class="if uuid-2938847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938847.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is it recommended to refinance cards in other financial institutions? </h2><p>  Sberbank credit card refinancing is used for certain purposes, for example: </p><ul><li>  Lower monthly payment. </li><li>  Interest rate cuts. </li><li>  Combining several loans at once. </li></ul><p>  Most modern financial institutions offer customers cards with grace periods.  This means that if the debt is repaid quickly within a short period of time, interest will not be charged.  However, in the event that the borrower does not have time to return the money on time, they will take a rather high interest rate on the loan.  Moreover, in most situations, interest is accrued from the moment the funds are withdrawn.  In this case, refinancing cards helps to optimize the burden on budget expenditures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Such a procedure can be useful even when the card has been issued for a long time.  In this situation, most likely, the borrower will be forced to pay huge interest.  Considering that in most examples banks do not set monthly payments, many holders of such credit cards deposit a small amount as part of paying the loan.  Subsequently, they wonder why the main debt is not reduced.  In fact, the funds contributed are barely enough to pay interest. </p><p>  Regardless of the purpose for which refinancing is planned, it is important to calculate any costs of the procedure with the benefits of it.  Only after comparing the results of the calculations can we say with certainty whether it is profitable to apply the proposal in question.  Next, find out which financial institution should refinance a Sberbank credit card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card refinancing at another bank" class="if uuid-2938844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938844.jpg"></div><h2>  Refinancing offer from Alfa Bank </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank proposes to refinance credit cards and other loans.  In this case, you can combine up to five contracts, provided that their total amount does not exceed three million rubles.  If necessary, you can get some of the funds in cash and spend on personal needs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The rate starts, as a rule, from 12% per annum, which is significantly lower compared to many credit cards in other structures.  At the same time, the size of the insurance policy does not affect its size.  Absolutely all salary clients can count on the lowest possible rate. </p><p>  The procedure with the design is simple.  It is enough to leave a request on the official website and, after waiting for a preliminary decision, go to the bank with the original documents.  After receiving the loan will be converted into payment of refinanced funds.  When they are closed, you need to get a certificate of debt repayment. </p><p>  Where else can I refinance a Sberbank credit card? </p><div class="photo" data-original="telugu.goodreturns.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tinkoff credit card refinancing at Sberbank" class="if uuid-2938846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938846.jpg"></div><h2>  Offer from Raiffeisenbank </h2><p>  Up to four credit cards can be refinanced at Raiffeisenbank.  In this case, the rate starts at 12% per annum, and the maximum maturity can reach 60 months.  Customers are given the opportunity to receive part of the cash.  In this case, the amount of the issued loan should not be more than two million rubles.  A distinctive feature of the program are not only favorable conditions, but also the complete absence of the need to obtain permission from an existing creditor for the possibility of refinancing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is important to keep in mind that this financial structure will require confirmation of the repayment of loans that have been submitted for re-lending.  During the quarter, information on the complete closure of the loan must necessarily appear in the credit bureau, or the borrower can bring the appropriate certificate.  In the event that this is not done, the rate will increase by as much as 8 points. </p><p>  Now we find out what are the proposals of Tinkoff Bank on refinancing a Sberbank credit card to an individual. </p><h2>  Refinancing at Tinkoff Bank or 120 days without interest </h2><p>  The balance transfer service is a type of refinancing developed by Tinkoff Bank.  Debts on any credit cards, including Sberbank, can be transferred to this organization.  At the same time, the refinancing amount is limited by the limit set by the client on the Tinkoff card.  For those who do not have a card, it is enough to leave a request online and get the necessary consent on it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="homeguides.sfgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card refinancing to an individual" class="if uuid-2938845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938845.jpg"></div><p>  Reverse refinancing of the Tinkoff credit card is also carried out in Sberbank. </p><p>  If the program is used, the client can return the debt to this bank without any interest within 120 days.  The only condition is to make a monthly payment of at least 6% of the amount owed.  This approach to the refinancing procedure allows not only to reduce the overpayment, but also completely get rid of interest in the first four months. </p><p>  Are Sberbank credit cards refinanced at VTB? </p><h2>  Profitable refinancing at VTB Bank </h2><p>  In this financial institution, you can make a refinancing of a credit card from Sberbank to those who conscientiously pay their loan.  The service is provided practically without refusal to those who have been servicing a credit card for more than twelve months.  At the same time, it is important that a person has not received any new loans in the last six months. </p><p>  The offer of VTB 24 Bank on refinancing a Sberbank credit card allows you to combine up to six loans at once.  The rate starts from 12.9% per annum.  To participate in the program in question, it is recommended first of all to place an application on the official website.  In the event that it is approved, it is required to bring the following documentation to the office for refinancing: </p><ul><li>  passport along with a copy of the current loan agreement; </li><li>  certificate of debt balance; </li><li>  SNILS certificate; </li><li>  proof of income (reference); </li><li>  labor book. </li></ul><p>  Credit card refinancing at Sberbank for individuals is also provided. </p><h2>  SKB Bank </h2><p>  Making a list of profitable banks this year, which refinance Sberbank loans, it is impossible to ignore this structure.  Despite the fact that this organization is less popular than most of the above, and offers higher rates, it has a huge advantage.  Here you can combine up to ten cards and credits into one. </p><p>  This option is suitable, first of all, for those who managed to grab a large number of loans and now with great difficulty they are oriented.  An important condition is the following: the total amount of refinanced debt should in no case exceed 1.3 million rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thelendersnetwork.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card refinancing in VTB" class="if uuid-2938840" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938840.jpg"></div><p>  The refinancing rate is set at twenty percent per annum.  They must be returned within five years.  In this case, early repayment is allowed without any restrictions.  Those with insufficient income to receive the required amount will be able to attract a co-borrower. </p><h2>  Bank Uralsib </h2><p>  This institution offers refinancing of various loans, including credit cards of Russians aged twenty-three to seventy years.  One of the best offers has been developed here, because the restrictions on the number of consolidated loans have simply not been established. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.westpac.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card refinancing reviews" class="if uuid-2938842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938842.jpg"></div><p>  The interest rate is also quite profitable.  It starts at 14.5%.  If you refinance a credit card, using this offer, you can significantly reduce the overpayment.  If you need to not only refinance, but also to borrow certain amounts of money, then the bank will issue it by transfer to the account or in cash.  For the convenience of payment and debt tracking, it is proposed to connect to an online bank.  Application review is carried out, as a rule, within one day.  Next, we move on to reviews of Sberbank credit card refinancing. </p><p>  Judging by customer reviews, Sberbank has fairly good conditions for credit cards, but in some cases it is required to be re-credited.  What do people say about this? </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Experienced clients advise in their reviews to check with the bank that provided such a service as refinancing whether it is worth closing a credit card.  It is reported that in most situations, borrowers receive an affirmative answer to this question.  This is explained by the revolving credit limits.  In other words, using the card, its holder has the right to withdraw it again after depositing funds on it. </p><p>  Even in situations where the bank does not force you to close the card and all you need is a certificate of depositing money, customers are advised not to neglect the possibility of refusing credit plastic in their reviews.  In particular, this applies to long-drawn up and therefore very disadvantageous payment instruments.  Their closure will make it possible to completely get rid of the temptations to use other people's money again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pt.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank credit card refinancing in VTB 24" class="if uuid-2938843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55045/2938843.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We examined how Sberbank credit card refinancing proceeds in another bank.  In fact, the final decision as to where and how to refinance a Sberbank credit card is made by each client exclusively independently.  The main thing is that it be as balanced as possible, and the savings from such a procedure correctly calculated. </p>
