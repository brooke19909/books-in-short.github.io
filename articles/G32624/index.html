    <h2>  Official country data </h2><p>  "371" is the phone code of Latvia.  Riga adds ‚Äú2‚Äù to these numbers.  If you are calling on a mobile phone, you do not need to add the area code.

    <h2>  Tours to Latvia </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, this small country with a population of only two million people provides a very diverse holiday.  Residents of St. Petersburg, Pskov and Novgorod quite simply (with a visa) to get to this Baltic country.  Therefore, travel agencies in these regions of Russia offer weekend bus tours.  For more than two days you can explore the sights of the capital, visit the seaside and enjoy the delights of local cuisine. </p><p>  There is a very interesting sea tour ‚ÄúLatvia (Riga) - Sweden (Stockholm)‚Äù.  During the night, a handsome liner crosses the Baltic Sea.  After an eventful day, the same ship will take you back to Riga.  Wellness tours are offered by <span>Latvian</span> sea <span>resorts.</span>  SPA treatments include staying in sanatoriums for at least a week.  Independent travelers can recommend trips to Latvia with their own car.  The driver needs to issue a Green Card, as well as bring his "iron" horse in line with European standards (tinted windows are not allowed).  You can get to Riga by train from Moscow (‚ÄúLatvijas Expressis‚Äù) and St. Petersburg (‚ÄúBaltia‚Äù). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beach holidays and SPA </h2><p>  The coast of the Baltic Sea is not very happy with the warm sea and cloudless sky, but in the summer months tourists still flock to Jurmala.  This city with its unique microclimate fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape.  It is surrounded by pine forests, and around dozens of kilometers stretch of golden sandy beaches.  Not lucky with the weather on the Riga seaside?  No problem.  It‚Äôs so good to wander along the coast and breathe in the healing air filled with iodine and the aroma of pine needles.  Or drink healing mineral water from a spring.  Jurmala is known as the capital of the song festival.  During their conduct, a direct train is sent from Moscow.  To get to the golden beaches of Jurmala at another time, you need to make only one change.  First you should come by train to a republic like Latvia.  Riga and Jurmala are connected by an excellent road.  Minibuses will deliver you to your destination.  They depart from the main railway station of the capital. </p>

    <h2>  Riga Attractions </h2><p>  This city is called the "capital of Art Nouveau."  A lot of houses (about 800) are built in this architectural style.  Most of the buildings are located in the Old Town.  Incidentally, it is fully and completely included in the UNESCO List.  That‚Äôs how unique Latvia is.  Riga, whose streets breathe antiquity, will delay the tourist for a long time.  This city is just crowded with museums.  It is necessary to walk along Alberta along a number of houses in the ‚Äúart nouveau style‚Äù (as modern is called here).  You don‚Äôt have to go around much: the Old City is just "packed" with sights.  Next to each other are: Riga Castle, Dome Cathedral, churches of John, Jacob and Peter, Powder Tower.  If you have time, look at a museum, for example, the Occupation of Latvia or the history of Riga. </p><h2>  What to try </h2><p>  When visiting <span>Turaida Castle</span> or basking on the beaches of Jurmala, do not forget to pay tribute to national cuisine.  The dishes of Latvians are delicious and satisfying.  National dishes are served in the appropriate setting.  The small towns are full of restaurants with a cozy homely atmosphere.  Embroidered tablecloths, cleanliness and smiling, calm, hospitable people - you will remember such Latvia.  Despite the medieval surroundings, Riga can offer guests stylish modern cafes. </p>
