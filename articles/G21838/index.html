The Epiphany Cathedral in this city is located within its historical center and is considered a true decoration of this place.  It is completely unlike the classical Orthodox church, as it has an unusual appearance.  This building survived many earthquakes and fires in its lifetime, therefore it has been reconstructed more than once. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  So, in what year was this cathedral built?  It turns out that the history of this temple begins almost from the very foundation of the city, since the inhabitants of Irkutsk built it back in 1693.  Initially, the building was wooden, and it was called the Peter and Paul Church.  In the eighteenth century, they were going to expand it, but did not have time to do it, since the temple completely burned down during the fire that happened in August 1716. </p>

A temple located in the city of Verkhoturye was taken as an example of construction.  But just at that time, a royal decree was in force prohibiting any stone buildings, so the construction of the church had to be temporarily postponed.

This time the Epiphany Cathedral was built for five whole years on donations from local residents and visitors. </p><p>  In 1729, a bell tower appeared in the church, and in 1755 a large stone fence was built around the building.  Five years later, three more chapels were added.  For Irkutsk, then a small prison, it was a truly grandiose architectural structure, requiring huge expenses and creative efforts of many masters. </p><h2>  Further construction </h2><p>  In this form, the Epiphany Cathedral stood until 1804, until a strong earthquake occurred.  As a result of this natural disaster, the church lost its cross and fifth dome. </p><p>  Ten years after this event, new large ditches were excavated for the second bell tower.  The bell itself, whose weight was about twelve tons, was poured back in 1797 and was called Bolshoi.  In 1815 it was installed on a new church building, built in the style of classicism and completely covered with iron. </p>

    <h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  At the end of December 1862, the city of Irkutsk again shuddered from a strong earthquake.  The temple was also badly damaged as a result of these events.  In this building, almost all the arches were destroyed, the walls were covered with numerous cracks, and in many places arches burst, frames fell at the windows, columns moved from their place.  Therefore, the decision was made by the townspeople that the Orthodox <span>church in Irkutsk</span> should be restored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the second half of the nineteenth century, a bishop's house was erected next to the cathedral building.  In his rooms were the bishop's chambers, as well as various administrative buildings and a spiritual consistory.  Over time, there was still a library room, where there was a large collection of Orthodox books and an annex, in which the school was located. </p><p>  Thus, for two centuries, the entire spiritual life of the city was concentrated in this cathedral church of the Apparition of the Lord (Irkutsk).  The Epiphany Cathedral lost this status only in 1893, when the Kazan temple construction was erected, into which the existing department of the diocese was transferred. </p>

    <h2>  Rebirth of the building </h2><p>  In the first half of the twentieth century, the temple experienced its hard times.  This <span>church in Irkutsk</span> was closed for worship and parishioners, and a bakery was located in its building.  In this period of time, the cathedral has changed more than once to fit the production premises of the workshop.  All of its architecture of past years was completely destroyed.  In the cathedral building, in addition, the hostel of the workshop employees was located, which led to the complete decline of the structure. </p><p>  In 1961, it was decided that the Church of the Apparition of the Lord (Irkutsk) should be demolished.  The Epiphany Cathedral, to the great joy of the townspeople, was able to avoid this tragic fate thanks to the metropolitan architect and engineer G. Oranskaya, who came here specially to sign papers on its complete elimination.  The woman liked the building so much that, instead of demolishing it, she gave the order for its reconstruction.  Thus, the bakery was evicted from the building, overhaul of all its premises began. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It lasted for eighteen years and ended only in 1986.  Then, after the restoration work was completed, the temple was transferred to the possession of the museum of regional importance, which opened its exposition there.  For several years, public lectures on Russian culture and its revival were read in its premises, and various concert events were often held. </p>

    <h2>  A new stage in history </h2><p>  In 1993, the temple was again transferred to its rightful owner - the diocese - and consecrated by the bishop on the feast of Easter.  This day marked the beginning of a new period in the spiritual life of the city.  Ten years later, the city of Irkutsk and its residents saw the new look of the cathedral with a beautifully painted facade, over which icon painters worked.  In addition, all the vaults of his refectory, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is 300 square meters, were still updated. </p><p>  The scenes are based on various scenes of the appearance of the Lord, as well as the birth of Christ.  Also on the paintings you can see all kinds of prophets, new martyrs, saints and other Orthodox heroes.  The modern appearance of this temple is very different from its original appearance and looks elegant from anywhere in the city. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  At present, the church is decorated with real works of art, which depicts many saints and wonderworkers in full growth.  In addition, the temple is beautifully decorated with a variety of unique samples of ceramic tiles, and its walls are originally painted with all kinds of popular prints.  The facades include elegant window trims that still adorn magnificent, intricately profiled cornices. </p><p>  In the architecture of the temple building, various variations of the Old Russian style and Baroque are traced, which are mainly found in the northern part of Russia.  The basis of the composition is a combination of two verticals - a tiered temple and a tent bell tower, which plays a leading role in the overall silhouette of the structure.  The amazing beauty of the cathedral impresses all the guests of the city, so it was chosen as the place where the annual opening of the festival dedicated to Russian culture and spirituality takes place. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  It turns out that this temple is considered the oldest stone building not only in its hometown, but also in Eastern Siberia and the Far East.  This church has been damaged several times due to various natural disasters, including storms, earthquakes and fires.  Only once did this building escape the flame, which in 1879 severely damaged the Spassky Church, but stopped at the gates of this building. </p><p>  This cathedral, having passed the years of its desolation, has truly revived and is now attracting the majestic and holy beauty of the minds and souls of people.  This Russian church has a very solemn and peaceful appearance, thanks to which all parishioners after their visit gain a certain calm and pleasant lightness.  This building can be considered a worthy architectural monument and a real decoration of the city of Irkutsk. </p>
