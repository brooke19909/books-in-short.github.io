Its protection, as a rule, is limited to acquiring a beautiful cover on the back cover, a ‚Äúbumper‚Äù or film on the screen (and, possibly, all at once). </p><p>  At the same time, we are also used to the fact that in the event of any physical impact on a particular model, the phone receives serious damage.  So, when it falls to the floor, the touch screen is often broken - and this is if the operation of the device‚Äôs system as a whole is not disturbed.  But this does not apply to all smartphones. </p><p>  There is a category of devices (and you probably already heard about it more than once) that behave quite differently.  They can be taken without any fear with you on a hike, on a hunt or in any other place with adverse conditions for operation.  Moreover, the operation of such an apparatus is not easy enough to disrupt, even if you want to.  One of them will be the subject of our review. </p>

    <p>  Meet in front of you - a shockproof phone ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù, provided with all possible means of protection.  Read more about how the device differs from other phones, including the same - protected ones, read on. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About smartphone </h2><p>  First of all, I would like to clarify that the phone that we are describing is not one model from any particular manufacturer.  No, this phone is produced by different companies, but it combines all of them with a similar design and identical name, derived from the brand of the car. </p><p>  It must also be said what exactly means such a characteristic of the device as ‚Äúincreased degree of protection‚Äù.  Indeed, without that, many smartphones have certain elements that can protect them from damage.  For example, such can be <span>Gorilla Glass, a</span> thick plastic case, or, for example, the use of metal elements in the case. </p><p>  But ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù (the phone that became the subject of our review) is a slightly different device, and its degree of protection is an order of magnitude higher.  In addition to the standard ones - resistance to bumps and scratches - the smartphone is also not afraid of moisture and dust due to complete isolation from them.  And this is quite noticeable in its appearance. </p><p>  Although we will talk about the design of the model a little further in the text, in general, it can be noted that he strongly emphasizes the essence of the device, its powerful protection and the ability to withstand any conditions.  And all this - at a very affordable price of 100-120 dollars.  Really unique device! </p><h2>  Appearance </h2>

    <p>  The case of the device, as befits a <span>secure phone,</span> is painted in bright colors and has an angular surface.  With her, as we have already noted, the phone looks more massive and stronger.  In addition, the developers did not adhere to the classic form of the body of their ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù phone.  The phone is made in the shape of an irregular octagon.  Its center is decorated with a darkened display (which visually does not distinguish the model from many other modern smartphones);  while along the perimeter there is an orange-gray edging.  Its ribbing and rubber texture also emphasize the sporty style of the phone.  Plus, of course, the entire case is covered with a relief, which makes the device incredibly practical in every sense. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On all sides, the model is covered with plugs and latches (in other words, with screws that fulfill the decorative meaning and, most likely, hold the external panels of the phone).  Rubber plugs can also be found on the charging holes, as well as on the headphones. </p><p>  The model controls are located in the same classic pattern as on other Android smartphones.  In particular, under the screen (on the front panel) there is a row of three system keys - ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù.  <span>The side panel</span> also contains a pair of buttons that act as a volume control.  On the top face, a button to unlock the screen is noticeable.  The buttons are covered with rubber pads that accurately protect against dust and moisture (as mentioned earlier). </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  Since the phone in question has a high degree of protection, the developers obviously had to sacrifice its screen, making it based on IPS technology with a size of 3.5 inches.  An older Hammer cell phone is generally equipped with a TFT screen.  Due to this color and the saturation of the picture on the screen, of course, you can not compare with what manufacturers of modern smartphones offer.  The resolution of 800 by 480 pixels is just another confirmation - the picture is less clear, and if you want, you can see the graininess on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The phone screen is covered with a massive protective glass, which in thickness is clearly superior to Gorilla Glass.  According to the declared technical characteristics, it is capable of transferring a drop from a height of two meters to a concrete surface. </p><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  In addition to the simplified screen, ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù is a telephone that also has not the <span>most powerful processor.</span>  At least the model parameters claim that the smartphone operates on the basis of MTK6515, which has one core with a clock frequency of up to 1 GHz.  Such a ‚Äúfilling‚Äù allows you to talk about smooth operation in the menu with some basic functions and simple applications.  At the same time, launching games that are cumbersome in terms of graphics and operating resources is unlikely to succeed. </p><p>  The reviews describing the Hammer phone indicate that the model freezes periodically, which causes a lot of inconvenience to the user.  This is logical - the processor used here is not the most powerful. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  In the process of preparing the review, we were able to find out that the ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù is a telephone that does not have any one clearly defined version.  Those representatives of it that are present on the market have different volumes of both operational (from 128 MB to 2 GB) and internal memory (from 2 to 8 GB).  Many devices also support memory cards in order to increase the space for placing personal files. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, the capabilities of the device that falls into your hands should be clarified by the seller offering the model. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Unchanged for all versions of the ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù mobile phone, is the work on the Android OS.  This is a common platform that many developers interact with.  Its version depends on how long the device was introduced.  Most often <span>this is a modification of</span> 4.1.1 or 5.1 (on newer models).  It is also possible that you can independently flash the phone to the version that you need. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  According to the reviews that we were able to find about the ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù, the phone has a powerful battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh.  Again, this indicator may vary depending on who produced the model - but, in general, it should be noted the large capacity of the device‚Äôs batteries and, as a result, long-term operation and a high degree of model autonomy.  This feature is very handy, since the phone is positioned as a ‚Äúmarching‚Äù device, helping out where there are no power sources. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  In order to increase the versatility of the smartphone, manufacturers have taken care of supporting them with two SIM cards at once.  Moreover, this option has recently been present on many phones, given the user's needs to work with two operators at once.  As you understand, the Hammer phone is no exception. </p>

    <p>  The manual for the device indicates that both cards are supported by the phone in 3G networks, which makes it possible to also work with high-speed Internet.  It, in turn, can be useful, for example, for navigation or sending / receiving messages. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù phone, the photo of which you could see in this article, are very different.  Some praise the device, noting its ability to withstand moisture and dust, shock resistance.  Others testify that the phone works with delays, often ‚Äúglitches‚Äù and freezes due to its weak processor.  It can also be said that the model may fall into factory defects when one or another system malfunctions.  For example, there is information about a fairly common problem, namely, that the phone does not catch the GSM signal if it is in navigation mode (GPS).  This is a significant problem, since it implies incorrect coordination of the smartphone, its insufficient optimization and imbalance. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  What can be said about the phone?  First of all, it should be noted the absence of any guarantees for your model.  Since no company officially launches Hammer smartphones, in fact, there will be no one to make a complaint about the poor quality of the device. </p>

    <p>  In contrast, it can be noted that the gadget has a high degree of protection (at least, user tests carried out at your own peril and risk showed that the smartphone really works in the water) and is offered at a low price.  This means that you can buy it, for example, on the same hunt, provided that you need an inexpensive device that is not a pity to operate in such conditions, with the necessary functionality. </p>
