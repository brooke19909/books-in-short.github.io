It is worth noting that it is urgently needed not only by adolescents, but also by adults.  The manufacturers of these devices have provided a huge choice for the buyer.  In stores you can find both budget models and expensive ones.  Of course, the latter are well equipped, but not everyone can afford them.  If the buyer is limited in funds, then you can pay attention to more budget <span>tablet models.</span>  As a rule, they are produced by Chinese manufacturers.  They are less functional, but individual preferences and needs will be a decisive factor here.  Basically, children buy such devices, since they still do not know how to handle expensive equipment. </p><p>  So, in this article we will review the 4Good T700i 3G tablet.  Reviews about the model, it is worth noting, are twofold.  Since the sale, buyers have been divided into two categories.  One states that for such a price you can‚Äôt find a better option, the other categorically negatively refers to the performance of the gadget.  Having studied the opinions of the owners, we can conclude that the tablet has flaws, but they are quite worth the low cost.  However, the decision to purchase should be made only individually.  And in order to make the choice easier, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the detailed characteristics of the gadget. </p><h2>  4Good tablet: description and equipment </h2><p>  The 4Good T700i 7 3G tablet is an exclusive line assembled in China by 4Good by order of MVideo.  The main and most important advantage is its price (from 1990 rubles), which is much lower compared to analogues of top brands. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The device measuring 188/108/10 mm (length / width / height) and a display diagonal of 178 mm (7 inches) is painted black, has ports for 2 mini-SIM cards in mini format and supports 3G networks.  The kit includes a USB cable, charger, instructions for use and adaptation, headphones.  The body of the gadget consists of high-strength plastic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4good t700i 3g reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1101815.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Hardware Base and Performance </h2><p>  The tablet runs on the Android 4.4 operating system.  Together with Intel's dual-core processor (Atom x3-C3130 model), which delivers power up to 1 GGz, it provides high-speed performance in almost any operation.  512 MB of RAM also contribute to fast data processing.  The internal volume is 4 GB, but thanks to the present microSD card slot (microSDHC), the disk space can be increased up to 32 GB. </p><p>  However, in practice, when working with a memory card, problems may arise: applications are not transferred to the external, but are saved only on the emulated, which is built into the 4Good T700i 3G.  Owner reviews indicate that, due to this shortcoming, there is simply not enough volume for full-fledged work. </p><h2>  Connections and Internet access </h2><p>  This device supports Internet access via SIM, and also has a built-in Wi-Fi network signal reception function, which provides data reception / transmission up to 300 Mbit / sec.  To further enhance the capabilities of exchanging data, a Bluetooth device running on v4.0 is built into the tablet.  Connection to a PC is made using the microUSB port with a cable included in the basic kit.  It is worth noting that to connect the tablet to the computer, additional software is not required (all necessary components are built into the device). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  cellular </h2><p>  Incoming / outgoing calls are made using 3 communication standards: </p><ul><li>  via GSM networks (voice call); </li><li>  via 3G networks (video call only works in 3G coverage areas); </li><li>  by sending SMS / MMS messages. </li></ul><p>  However, there is a small nuance that buyers of the promotional 4Good T700i 3G tablet have encountered.  Reviews from numerous people allowed us to deduce one pattern: for 1500‚Äì2000 rubles.  a model with a binding only to the MTS mobile network is offered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4good t700i 3G tablet" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1101809.jpg" width="432"></div>

    <h2>  Headset </h2><p>  4Good T700i 3G in stock has 2 cameras / camcorders: </p><ul><li>  the main one, with a photo resolution of 2 Mp, with a video quality of 1024x768 pixels; </li><li>  frontal - 0.3 Mp. </li></ul><h2>  Battery and power </h2><p>  The device is able to work up to 5 hours without recharging with a battery.  Its capacity is 2800 mAh.  However, in practice, the 4Good T700i 3G tablet (reviews confirm this) shows the best results.  With moderate load and off Wi-Fi, you can use it without recharging for about 1 day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="4good t700i 3g price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1101824.jpg" width="287"></div>
