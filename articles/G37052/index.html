  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to transfer money to a Sberbank card and how quickly can I use it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Bank payment cards have already become very popular in our country, so the cashless service system in stores and supermarkets has reached a high level.  Sberbank in this regard holds a leading position, as it is one of the largest Russian banks whose capital is owned by the state.  Thanks to Sberbank payment cards, many people can conveniently pay bills, utilities, buy various goods, and also take part in charity events.  It is thanks to the widespread use of banking services that many today have the question of how to transfer money to a Sberbank card?  It turns out that there is nothing complicated in this, and Sberbank made sure that the transfer of payments was as convenient and fast for the <span>bank's customers</span> as possible.  So: </p><p>  Option number 1.  Replenishment through a branch of Sberbank.  The easiest and cheapest way to replenish bank payment cards.  When replenishing a <span>credit card</span> through the bank cash desk, no commission is charged, and the transfer is completely free.  If you replenish your salary or personal card, then interest for this operation is also absent.  The only exception is that in case of replenishment of your card account not by the owner himself, but by a third party, the bank may take a small commission, according to the tariff plan. </p><p>  Option number 2.  Top-up through another bank.  If you go to a branch of any other bank and ask a client manager how to transfer money to a Sberbank card, he will not only tell you how to do this, but he will also be happy to help.  As for crediting payments to card accounts, there are no problems.  Through a branch of any bank, you can replenish your card account opened with Sberbank, regardless of whether it is a credit card or a debit one. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Option number 3.  Top-up via ATM.  Banking machines are so firmly entrenched in our lives that you simply can‚Äôt do without them.  If earlier ATMs had the function of exclusively issuing cash, today many of them can accept money.  This is very convenient, since it greatly facilitates the work of both economists at the bank and the clients themselves.  By the way, the opportunity <span>to transfer money</span> from one card to a Sberbank card is also realized here, and the procedure is made as easy as possible.  To do this, you need to insert into the ATM the card from which the money will be withdrawn, and then use the funds transfer function.  There you should dial the number of the card to which you want to transfer the money, and the payment will be made. </p><p>  Option number 4.  Transfer of funds through the client-bank system.  In our age of electronic technology, more and more people prefer to use remote access to their bank accounts, which not only facilitates the work with card accounts, but also makes it more convenient and comfortable.  Sberbank has a reliable system for managing its accounts, and funds can be transferred quickly enough.  To learn more about the answer to the question of how to transfer money to a Sberbank card, you should use the help option or a round-the-clock telephone of service support. </p><p>  Funds are usually credited to the card account within three business days, however, there are exceptions to some card accounts.  So, elite plastic cards (Gold, Platinum and Infiniti levels) can be credited instantly.  Thus, one of the most convenient banks to service is Sberbank.  Transfer of funds in this place will be made as quickly and conveniently as possible. </p><p>  In many CIS countries there are representative offices of the Russian Sberbank through which it is also possible to carry out the necessary banking operations. </p><p>  Thus, we now know how to transfer money to a Sberbank card and what is needed for this.  You never need to be afraid of technological progress, but rather, constantly monitor the development of banking technologies and maximize the achievements of our civilization to your advantage. </p>
