    <p>  “Gold Coast” (Yevpatoriya) gets positive reviews when it comes to rooms for accommodation and treatment.  Most of the former guests of the sanatorium claim that the rooms are comfortable and equipped with everything necessary, and the work of the medical staff and the health-improving base of the health resort are beyond praise.  But when it comes to food in a sanatorium, then everything is not so rosy here.  Many complain about the lack of variety in the daily diet and the lack of fruit, even at the height of summer.  Therefore, before choosing the “Golden Coast” for your vacation, it is worth weighing its pros and cons. </p>
