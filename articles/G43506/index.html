Many ancient buildings reached the descendants in poor condition, so the perfectly preserved architectural and historical monuments, open to visitors, attract travelers from different countries. </p><h2>  Oldest attraction </h2><p>  Getting to know the Bled Castle shrouded in legends is a unique opportunity to touch the evidence of past eras.  Fascinating in its appearance, it conjures up images of medieval knights who staged tournaments in honor of beautiful ladies.  A powerful building towering above Lake Bled (Slovenia), as if floating in the air, forcing tourists to believe in magic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bled Castle" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2115785.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Located in the most beautiful corner of the country, it is one of the oldest on our planet (the age of buildings exceeds a thousand years).  Despite this, the famous attraction has been perfectly preserved, and now every guest of the country will be able to appreciate the architectural heritage. </p><h2>  Work of architectural art </h2><p>  The first mention of the Bled Castle (Slovenia), which was erected on a high cliff above the lake, in historical records is made at the beginning of the XI century.  The German emperor, who wanted to prove his loyalty, presented the estate in Bled to the Freising bishop, which becomes a turning point in the history of a small town.  The new owner is building a dungeon tower in the Romanesque style, which was used as not only housing, but also a defensive structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The location of the fortress on a high 130-meter cliff was not chosen by chance.  Based on the principles of military expediency, a complex of buildings grows behind powerful fortress walls.  In the Middle Ages new towers appear, and all fortifications are strengthened.  The buildings are being erected around the lower one, where the outbuildings are located, and the upper (living quarters) of the castle courtyards, connected by a wide staircase.  It was then that the citadel takes on a modern look. </p><p>  One of the objects of great interest is the chapel, which is dedicated to bishops.  It was built much later, in the XVI century.  And after a hundred years, talented craftsmen paint it with colorful frescoes.  Near the altar you can see images of Emperor Henry II and his wife. </p><p>  The heirs of the bishop appeared on the estate only in the summer, each time rebuilding the buildings decorated with ancient family crests in the Baroque style.  Until today, a beautiful arch has been preserved that adorned the entrance gate, and a drawbridge towering above the dug ditch. </p><p>  In the Bled Castle there is always a knightly garrison that helped maintain power on behalf of the bishops.  After peasant uprisings, the owners of the architectural complex change, but they rarely appear in the fortress. </p><h2>  The castle turned into a historical museum </h2><p>  When a small city is part of Yugoslavia, the majestic Bled Castle first turns into the residence of the monarchs, and soon the politician Broz Tito often comes here to visit in the summer.  During the Second World War, a historical attraction was occupied by German troops, who posted their headquarters here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bled castle slovenia reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2115782.jpg"></div>
