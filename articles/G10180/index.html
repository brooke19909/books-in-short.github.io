Is it suitable for seafarers?  Yes, when you consider that the emirate of Sharjah is washed immediately by two bays - Persian and Omani.  No, if a tourist cannot live a day without alcohol.  Indeed, in the emirate of Sharjah, “dry law” is an absolute rule.  Alcohol will not only not be sold to you in the store, but also will not be served in the restaurant.  Therefore, a Russian person willy-nilly needs to look for alternative entertainment.  And the most fascinating attraction for tourists of all countries is shopping.  In this sense, the Marbella Resort hotel is located very well.  The very center of the city of Sharjah, picturesque oriental bazaars ("golden", vegetable, fish) rustle nearby.  Dubai International Airport is just fifteen kilometers away.  At the same time, the hotel is located on the third line from the beach.  To the sea - about a kilometer, which is not so bad for a city hotel.  What is the conclusion?  Hotel Marbella Resort 4 * is equally well suited both for business tourism, and for those who arrived in the <span>United Arab Emirates</span> for a sea holiday. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marbella Resort 4" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1108644.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Weather in Sharjah: when to go? </h2><p>  UAE welcomes guests all year round.  The winter sale does not have time to die out, as the spring begins immediately.  Shops, shopping centers and malls lure buyers with constant discounts and promotions.  Well, what about a beach holiday?  Wise experience tourists strongly recommend visiting the UAE in November.  Although there are lovers and winter holidays in this country.  But it must be borne in mind that the continental climate of the Emirates determines rather cool and windy evenings from December to the end of February.  In the summer, in the UAE, and in Sharjah in particular, incredible heat reigns.  In July, <span>vacation in the Emirates</span> can be called extreme.  Not everyone can stand plus forty-one in the shade.  All reviews agree that the most comfortable stay will be in the last month of autumn.  Then the average daytime air temperature is +30 degrees, and the summer nights are warm: + 25 ° C. It is quite possible to afford long <span>evening walks.</span>  The sea also pleases with warmth.  Its temperature in early November is +28 degrees, gradually decreasing to +26 ° C by the end of the month.  It should also be noted that autumn in the Emirates is very clear and dry.  The number of cloudless days is twenty-nine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Weather in Sharjah" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1108667.jpg" width="600"></div>

But the guests of Marbella Resort forget that they live in a metropolis.  The entire territory of the hotel is a huge park, ledges descending to the Khalid lagoon.  About a hundred small bungalows and villas are hidden in it in lush tropical greenery.  So the guests have the feeling that they live among pristine nature, away from any civilization.  But this is if you do not pay attention to the skyscrapers towering nearby.  All bungalows are built in such a way that guests can be kept private.  The hotel positions itself as a place of family relaxation.  For children there is a playground for games.  But the Marbella Resort 4 * hotel also accepts business people.  A daily and free shuttle service to Dubai malls is arranged for them. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Reviews mention that all rooms for guests are apartments, that is, they have a full kitchen for self-cooking.  The bungalow houses the junior and master suites.  The first category of rooms is an extensive bedroom with a living area adjoining it, in which there is a folding sofa bed.  The “master” differs from the “junior suite” in that the room consists of three separate rooms.  It has a bedroom, a bathroom and a living-dining room.  Large families or companies can rent an entire villa at the Marbella Resort 4 * hotel.  The room, which is called Full villa, consists of a lounge, a fully equipped kitchen, a living-dining room, three bedrooms and two bathrooms.  As for the technical equipment of the guest rooms, they are air-conditioned, have a free safe, a minibar with soft drinks and Internet access. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marbella Resort 4 (Sharjah)" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1108646.jpg" width="500"></div>

Most tourists were satisfied with them.  Delicious stewed bell peppers, grilled sausages, beans are always available.  Adherents of European breakfasts also do not complain.  You can order a cook an omelet or scrambled eggs, and he will immediately prepare it all for you with the selected additives (tomatoes, cheese or champignons).  Sweet tooth notes a large selection of pastries and a huge amount of fruit.  There were always peaches, melons, watermelons.  No queues were observed, and even if people came to breakfast under the very curtain, then everything was plenty.  You can also have lunch and dinner at the hotel.  The Rendezvous Restaurant serves both à la carte and buffet meals.  At Cesars Palace you will be offered Italian dishes, as well as in the cheaper version - Undichi Cafe.  In the last institution, reviews especially praise coffee, ice cream, desserts.  The Cascade Pool Bar serves a bite to eat.  What is interesting: in this catering establishment there is a children's menu.  The hotel often hosts weddings, so it has a banquet hall.  If the weather in Sharjah allows, guests are covered in a huge tent in the open air (up to two hundred people). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marbella Resort 4 Sharjah" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1108657.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Marbella Resort does not have its own stretch of coast, but its guests can use the beach of the Lo Lo Beach hotel.  There tourists take several times a day a free bus.  You can also use the same shuttle to get to the beach with more developed infrastructure.  Entrance to it costs thirty drams for an adult and twenty for a child.  Many tourists took a taxi or traveled on foot to the city's free beach.  Such a walk has its advantages: you do not need to constantly look at the clock and guess the time to the bus.  In addition, there are few people on the municipal beach.  The hotel has two fairly spacious freshwater pools.  Their shores are surrounded by sunbeds and umbrellas.  <span>Beach towels</span> are free. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  We already mentioned the free shuttle service to Dubai and the beach.  But this is not the only service at the Marbella Resort 4 * hotel.  The hotel has an excellent spa.  His services (except massage) are free for guests.  For those who care about their health, tennis courts are created.  The fitness center, according to reviews, is full of the latest fitness equipment.  You will have to pay for the services of a tennis coach, but the coverage of the courts in the evening is free.  Also at the hotel you can freely play darts, squash, join aerobics classes, play billiards.  Many conditions are created for the smallest guests.  They have a mini club, a children's pool and a playground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="UAE in November" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1108662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  The UAE in November is also good because you can go on small trips in a comfortable environment.  And Sharjah inspires on excursions.  The city has the royal Faisal mosque, watchtowers along the Al Khan lagoon, the old Meredzh quarter.  Shopaholics should visit the Blue Souk, Iranian Bazaar and the Gold Market, walk along the shopping streets of Jamal-Abdul-Nasser and al-Fahd.  If you came to Sharjah with children, then you should go to the national park.  There is a model of the city where the child himself can drive cars and boats on a remote control.  In Al Majaz Park, it is recommended to ride a huge Ferris wheel.  Well, anyone who misses the vibrant evening life (and alcohol) can take a ride to Dubai. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  The lion's share of tourists who visited the hotel, praise Marbella Resort 4 *.  Reviews even claim that the hotel is worthy of five stars.  The rooms are very spacious, with perfect cleanliness.  Many people like the location of the hotel (in the center of Sharjah). </p>
