Forex dealing centers: ranking of the best</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A few decades ago, all transactions in the stock and commodity markets were carried out by telephone or even in writing.  To buy or sell shares, their owner called or wrote to the broker, who executed the deal.  Today, trading in financial markets is carried out with the help of dealing centers or brokerage companies.  What is DC, about its properties, functions and what opportunities it provides for traders, the reader will learn from this article. </p><h2>  What is a dealing center? </h2><p>  Modern trading most often occurs via the Internet.  To understand what DC is and how it works, you need to know about its functions and what opportunities it provides to traders.  The dealing center is a brokerage organization.  Most often, he is simply called a broker.  He is an intermediary between exchanges and traders. </p><p>  There is also over-the-counter trading in the financial markets, which includes Forex.  Forex dealing centers do not place transactions on exchanges, and they occur inside a brokerage company between participants.  As a result, speculative sales and purchases are made in the foreign exchange market, the difference of which traders earn. </p><h2>  Types of DC </h2><div class="photo" data-original="redascla.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dc forex rating" class="if uuid-3267329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267329.jpg"></div><p>  In trading in financial markets, there are three types of dealing centers.  It: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Centers for intermediary services in the stock market. </li><li>  Dealing companies for commodity exchanges. </li><li>  Dealing centers "Forex". </li></ol><p>  The first two options of DC provide financial services for the purchase and sale of assets such as stocks, securities (bonds), metals (gold, copper, silver) and various commodities (coffee, wood, wheat).  All transactions without fail occur through exchanges.  The broker sets a commission for his services.  The size of the commission on transactions can vary from a few dollars, to hundreds and even thousands. </p><p>  In the foreign exchange market, as mentioned earlier, transactions on exchanges are not displayed.  Therefore, traders do not have to pay commissions, but they pay the spread for each open transaction.  Depending on the dealing center or brokerage company, it can be from several points to tens. </p><p>  For example, in the Alpari dealing center, for the euro / dollar currency pair in the cent account, the spread is two points.  In the same dealing center, but for other assets, it can be more or less depending on trading conditions and specialization of contracts. </p><h2>  Brokers Functions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.forexsi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dealing center broker" class="if uuid-3267322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267322.jpg"></div><p>  Knowing what functions a broker performs, it is easy to understand what DC is.  Dealing companies provide intermediary services for traders in the financial markets.  After choosing a broker, each client opens a trading account in the DC and replenish it with a convenient method and currency. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The broker provides for the trader several options for trading platforms.

The most popular, according to traders, is MetaTrader. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="alpari dealing center" class="if uuid-3267316" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267316.jpg"></div><p>  In order to trade on it, it is necessary that the dealing center and broker have integration with it.  Only in this case, all transactions that a trader opens will be displayed not only on the trading floor, but also in your personal account, on the website of the DC. </p><p>  And also brokerage companies provide the necessary financial services, for example, such as withdrawal and deposit of funds, transfer between accounts, and ensure their financial safety. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="reliability of DC" class="if uuid-3267332" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267332.jpg"></div><p>  In dealing centers, the client gets access to various trading assets, reference and analytical materials.  Almost all brokers conduct free training with clients and even provide a special demo account for these purposes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, brokers ensure timely execution of opening and closing orders and perform other technical functions. </p><h2>  Opportunities for Traders </h2><p>  Any dealing center (DC) provides traders with the opportunity to trade online.

The advantages also include a constantly updated information base, reviews and expert opinion.  Many brokers offer their customers to subscribe to the daily analytics newsletter. </p><p>  It should also be noted that many brokers provide their clients with the opportunity to use automated trading programs, such as robots and experts, in trading.  By connecting such a program to the trading platform and setting it up, the trader does not have to do anything at all, since the robot trades on its own.  As a result, the trader receives passive income, without his own participation. </p><p>  According to most traders, brokerage companies and dealing centers really provide an opportunity for everyone to earn money, and unlimitedly, and withdraw the profit in a short time.  Many of them practice weekly and even daily withdrawals. </p><h2>  Negative characteristics </h2><p>  From the negative reviews about brokerage companies, you can understand that most often people complain about fraudulent activities.  For example, unscrupulous and dishonest dealing centers not only delay, but generally do not withdraw earned money. </p><p>  A lot of complaints come about the provision of poor-quality services, for example, slippage on trading floors and other technical problems. </p><p>  Therefore, when opening an account, it is necessary to devote the maximum time to studying information about DCs.  So that in the future there would be no problems, it is very important to choose a reliable broker with an impeccable reputation. </p><h2>  Rating of the best brokers </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.usgfx.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is dts" class="if uuid-3267313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41139/3267313.jpg"></div><p>  Forex brokers are the most popular among traders.
