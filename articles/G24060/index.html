Textiles are also on top.  Slippers and a bathrobe are provided for each guest. </p><p>  The apartment has panoramic windows with stunning views of the city or temple.  According to reviews, in Radisson (Kaliningrad) there are no problems with sound insulation.  The rooms are completely inaudible to the neighbors, as if you live yourself on the entire floor.

If you are not satisfied with the time you visit the maid, then at your request they will clean the room at a convenient time for you. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gs-moscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Conference hall" class="if uuid-2538368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2538368.jpg"></div><p>  The apartments have a minibar with water and other drinks.  Its contents are also replenished every day.  Thanks to the presence of sets for making tea or coffee, you can make a hot drink for yourself at any time. </p><p>  The inhabitants of the rooms note their increased comfort and spacious size. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  The hotel restaurant offers its visitors good food.  In the morning, meals are served as a buffet.  According to tourists, the breakfasts are hearty and decent.  You can order an omelet or scrambled eggs with mushrooms, bacon, vegetables and other toppings.  There is also a good selection of pastries, cheeses, sausages, sauces, jams, bread.

You can also order food in your room if you do not want to go to the restaurant.  The hotel is in a very good location.  Nearby there are many different food establishments that you can visit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gs-moscow.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Institution Apartments" class="if uuid-2538375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2538375.jpg"></div><p>  In the building of the complex, in addition to the hotel, there is a shopping and entertainment center, in which there are many bars and cafes.  They can also be eaten.  It is especially convenient that a direct transition leads from the hotel to the center.  This allows not only to go shopping without leaving the building, but also to have a bite. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  Numerous positive reviews about the hotel are its best feature.  Tourists and guests of the city are satisfied with their stay at the hotel.  Lovely comfortable rooms are very comfortable.  In addition, the hotel staff always pleases with a high level of service.  A quick settlement upon arrival, a willingness to help in solving any issue - all this leaves only the most pleasant experience. </p><p>  Tourists recommend a spa and sauna.  For hotel guests, use of the gym is included in the price.  Therefore, if you are used to regular training, a business trip is not a reason to miss classes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agoda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Complex bar" class="if uuid-2538376" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2538376.jpg"></div><p>  The only minor drawback of the hotel is the lack of private parking in front of the building.  The staff offers to leave cars in the covered parking lot under the shopping center.  This is not always convenient.  The rest of the hotel is thought out to the smallest detail so that guests of the establishment feel comfortable. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  All hotels of the Radisson chain offer a high level of service and an excellent number of rooms.  Hotel Kaliningrad is no exception.  High ratings and positive reviews give reason to recommend the hotel to accommodate guests of the city.  If you are planning a business or leisure trip to Kaliningrad, then it is worth choosing a time-tested hotel that is guaranteed to offer a decent level of service, which the whole Radisson chain is famous for.  Thanks to its convenient location, you can quickly reach all key locations. </p>
