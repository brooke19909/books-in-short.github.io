After all, the life path of cities is unique, and soon you begin to think about the purpose of each of them in the life of the country. </p><h2>  Overview </h2><p>  In our article we will talk about the history of Tomsk, about why it has progressively grown and developed over the course of four centuries.  Surprisingly, this settlement was intended for prisoners and service people, but in a short period it became more significant than many other domestic cities.  In 1991, Tomsk was granted the status of a historical city, since unique historical buildings, landscapes, etc. were preserved in good condition. An asteroid was named in honor of this city (4931).  The nuclear submarine K-150 Tomsk, which is part of the Russian Pacific Fleet, is also named after the city.  The writer A. Volkov was delighted with the greenery and vegetation of the city, which is why the wizard from the fairy tale was from the Emerald City! </p>

    <p>  The history of Tomsk told us that the city had another name - Siberian Athens.  You already wanted to know why he was called that?  Then go ahead! </p><h2>  The foundation of Tomsk fortress </h2><p>  This amazing old <span>Siberian city</span> excites historians and archaeologists even today, and all because in 1604 Tsar Boris issued a decree on the foundation of the city in “a strong place by the grace of the Lord ...”.  The history of the city of Tomsk has more than four centuries! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Prince Toyan asked the king for help in the defense and defense of his lands.  Then the autocrat came up with the idea of ​​founding a city at the cape of the Resurrection Mountain on the Tom River.  The history of the name of Tomsk is simple: the city is named after the river on whose banks it was founded.  At the end of September of the same year, the construction of the settlement was completed. </p><p>  Tomsk fortress was built in the technique of "gorodni".  At the base of the fortress had a quadrangle, with an occupied area of ​​0.2 hectares.  The height of the prison walls reached a maximum of 6.5 meters.  There were 4 deaf towers at the corners.  On the north and opposite, south, sides of the walls, road towers were built, their height was 13 and 22 meters.  In the settlement there were a moving hut, a governor’s yard, various granaries and barns, as well as the Trinity Church, founded in 1606. </p><p>  That was such a small city of Tomsk.  The history of the foundation is simple, but the importance of the city in the fate of the Russian state cannot be overestimated. </p>

    <p>  Tomsk citizens continued to strengthen and erect new walls of the settlement.  So, in 1609, another “prison” was chopped to the north side of the fortress “in three walls”.  The total length of its walls was about 604 fathoms and two arshins.  Two deaf and passing towers were completed.  Now the area of ​​all Tomsk buildings was about 4 hectares.  The story of the creation of Tomsk does not end there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The next stage of construction </h2><p>  Another prison was erected in 1634 on both sides of the Ushayka river, since most of the townspeople lived there.  The locals called it “Lower Ostrog”.  The fire element took Tomsk by surprise in 1639 and 1643.  The city was badly burned out.  At that time, two thousand people already lived in Tomsk.  Of these, more than 700 peasants, townspeople and service people. </p><p>  After the fires, by 1652, townspeople and architects completed the construction of the fortifications of the city. </p><p>  Towards the end of the seventeenth century, Tomsk is a wooden fortress surrounded by a picket fence, with 7 built driveways and deaf towers.  The upper jail adjoined the fortress on the north side of the walls, where there was a large roadway tower. </p><p>  In 1734, G.F. Miller, a domestic historiographer, arrived in Tomsk.  In his diary, he writes that the history of the founding of Tomsk is amazing, its growth delights in its pace.  He also notes that the fortress was built "on the model of houses made of wood", and on the towers near the gate there is artillery for shooting.  There was another tower - the seventh, with cunning.  It belonged to the Trinity Church.  There was a small prison behind the fortress; in the 18th century, captured Swedes languished in it. </p>

    <p>  By the end of the 18th century, the city was divided into seven parts.  The fortifications of the city were no longer saved.  And in the city itself were: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  7 churches. </li><li>  1 monastery. </li><li>  237 shops = 3 shopping rows. </li><li>  1500 city houses. </li><li>  7500 inhabitants. </li></ul><p>  The history of Tomsk, recorded in the annals, says that in 1723 about 9 thousand citizens of different classes lived in the city. </p><h2>  What did the city live </h2><p>  Tomsk has become a Siberian center in terms of economics, geography and military policy for several reasons.  Let's look at them. </p><p>  Firstly, Tomsk is the center where Cossack detachments came out to scout around the non-peaceful lands from the Altai Mountains, the Yenisei Upper reaches to the steppes of Transbaikalia and even the shores of the Pacific Ocean!  It was the service people of Tomsk who paved the first roads in these Siberian open spaces. </p>

    <p>  Secondly, the first economic basis for the development of the city was arable farming.  It follows that Tomsk belonged to the plow cities of Russia.  Soon, a craft emerges and develops in the city.  Already in 1626 in the city there were more than 20 artisans.  After 30 years, this number increases by 2.5 times.  In another hundred years, among the Tomsk citizens there are more than 380 artisans of various specialties.  Among them were professional masters: icon painters, armored men, watchmakers, etc. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, as the history of the city of Tomsk testifies, iron smelting from ore was born on an industrial scale.  Woodworking and carpentry reached high peaks.  Tomsk architecture is a confirmation of this.  The history of Tomsk buildings we will consider a little later. </p><p>  Thirdly, the city very early and quickly became the largest shopping center, as it was founded next door to the southern Siberian regions.  Tomsk is the center of the transit movement of the peoples of Siberia. </p><h2>  Educational institutions </h2><p>  In the Siberian region, Tomsk has been a leader in the ranking by the number of educational institutions for 100 years.  Already in 1878, the first Imperial University in Russia beyond the Urals was opened in this city. </p><p>  University named after <span>V.V. Kuybyshev</span> is considered the oldest university in Siberia and the Far East.  The history of Tomsk showed that it was founded in 1880.  A few years later, medical and law faculties opened in the institution.  In addition, pedagogical and medical institutes have been created on the basis of <span>Tomsk State University</span> . </p><p>  In 1976, faculties were opened at TSU in the following areas: </p><ul><li>  physical; </li><li>  radiophysical; </li><li>  mechanical and mathematical; </li><li>  physical and technical; </li><li>  geological and geographical; </li><li>  applied mathematics; </li><li>  chemical; </li><li>  soil biological; </li><li>  legal; </li><li>  philological; </li><li>  historical; </li><li>  economic; </li><li>  advanced training; </li><li>  graduate school; </li><li>  preparatory and correspondence departments. </li></ul>

    <p>  Research institutes in the fields of mechanics and mathematics, biology, and also biophysics were opened at TSU.  The university has its own botanical garden and many museums: </p><ul><li>  mineralogical; </li><li>  paleontological; </li><li>  zoological; </li><li>  archeology; </li><li>  ethnography; </li><li>  herbarium. </li></ul><p>  The scientific library contains on its shelves three million volumes. </p><p>  A dormitory for TSU students was built in 1883 entirely with donated funds raised.  The rooms had furniture and utensils necessary for a comfortable stay of students.  A dining room and a library were open for them.  And the order in the dormitory was monitored by a minister of inspection. </p><p>  As for the leisure and cultural spheres of the city’s life, in the 19th century there were opened a philharmonic society, theaters and museums. </p><h2>  Some statistics </h2><p>  The opening of Tomsk State University significantly affected the standard of living - it has improved qualitatively.  This is not surprising, since 100 years after the opening of the university almost 2,000 teachers, teachers and researchers were recorded in documents, of which about 70 were professors and doctors of various sciences, about 450 associate professors and candidates, and the number of students exceeded 8,000. </p>

    <h2>  The exterior of the city </h2><p>  The history of Tomsk houses suggests that the wooden and <span>architectural architecture of</span> that era possessed not only rigor, but also picturesque forms, attractive facades, quality factors and amazing carved decor. </p><p>  Today, many buildings have survived that will demonstrate to the guests of the city the appearance of two centuries ago.  The Church of the Resurrection, made in the Baroque style, is very beautiful.  The Gostiny Dvor on Bazarnaya Square, made of stone, also looks amazing.  There are buildings made in the style of classicism: </p><ul><li>  Magistrate (1802-1812). </li><li>  <span>Offices</span> (1830-1842). </li><li>  Exchange complex (1854-1854). </li><li>  The first building of TSU (1880-1885 gg.). </li></ul><p>  Abundant greenery, preserved forest areas, many stone and wooden buildings with unique carvings are the features that distinguish the streets of Tomsk.  History shows us the unique wooden architecture in the city, but, unfortunately, a large number of wooden buildings were destroyed by numerous fires.  And today, buying a country house, Tomsk citizens decorate its windows and doors with wooden carvings, they carefully preserve the traditions of the Siberian hinterland.  Peasants also decorate their homes in the suburbs of Tomsk. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width: 650px; height: 1150px;"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><p>  Institution </p></td><td align="center"><p>  Address </p></td><td align="center"><p>  Features </p></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><p>  Museum of Local Lore </p></td><td align="center"><p>  Prospect Frunze, </p><p>  D 2 </p></td><td valign="top" width="213"><p>  It was founded in March 1922 in the house of Tomsk gold miner I.

Ancient Russia comes to life in front of museum visitors </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  What else deserves the attention of city guests </h2><p>  Since Tomsk is an ancient Siberian city, there are many historical buildings.  Today they house a museum, banks, administrative services.  There are many Orthodox churches in the city, there is a church and even a mosque.  Today, five universities work on the lands of the once Tomsk fortress; actors play on the stage of the drama theater.  A huge number of unique and funny monuments adorn the streets of the city.  But outside the city there are attractions that are no less interesting and significant! </p><p>  So, for example, about 15 springs with wonderful healing water beat at the top of the Basandayki river.  The townspeople called the three keys as "Talov's bowls."  They got such a figurative name due to the lime salt that they contain.  Coming to the surface of the river, the components form an oval wall, and it darkens due to the content of manganese oxide.  The largest bowl has parameters: </p><ul><li>  wall thickness - 30 cm; </li><li>  height - 1 meter; </li><li>  length - 4 meters. </li></ul><p>  They say that Talovskaya water is not only healing, but also tastes good.  Surprising is the fact that in a harsh winter, these keys never freeze. </p><p>  Tomsk nature is rich in unique monuments that deserve no less attention than a temple or Gostiny Dvor. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The history of Tomsk is rich in events and facts.  This city is growing and developing rapidly.  For 4 centuries, it has achieved what many cities could not realize for a thousand years. </p><p>  The city created and developed a diverse infrastructure.  Today, the main problem is to maintain and modernize it.  In addition, Tomsk has another concern - the preservation of the historical face, the creative ambitions of Siberian Athens - the historical cultural center.  A large number of measures have been taken, but a lot remains to be done by the authorities. </p>
