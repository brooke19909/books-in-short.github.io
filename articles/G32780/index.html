  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electricity from the air</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nikola Tesla is one of the great scientists and inventors, thanks to whom modern society can use the benefits and unique things that have become familiar to us. </p><p>  One of Tesla's favorite topics to study was electricity and energy.  He was the first to be interested in the so-called ‚Äúfree energy‚Äù.  Tesla believed that its source is the Sun.  It is thanks to him that energy comes from nothing.  The scientist developed a theory according to which the Sun emits particles endowed with small charges.  They move at a speed that exceeds the <span>speed of light.</span>  In the process of studying these phenomena, a device was created that allows you to receive electricity from the air. </p><p>  This device accumulates <span>static electricity</span> and converts it into a convenient form for consumption. </p><p>  Tesla patented his concept in 1901.  She received the name "apparatus for the use of radiating energy."  The scientist was fascinated by radiant energy and the ability to receive electricity from the air.  He called the famous Crook radiometer the most beautiful invention, which has blades rotating in vacuum under the influence of radiating energy.  He was convinced that in the near future it would be possible to obtain energy from nature itself and the processes occurring in it.  At a press conference, answering various questions, he said that the cosmic radiation engine is thousands of times more powerful than the Crook radiometer. </p><p>  <strong>How to get electricity from the air?</strong> </p><p>  There is <span>electrical potential</span> between the base and the raised plate <span>.</span>  This energy accumulates in the capacitor and, after a certain period of time, manifests itself in a powerful discharge capable of performing work.  Thus, you can get electricity from the air.  The capacitor, according to Tesla, must meet certain requirements: have a significant electrostatic capacity;  its dielectric must be made of the highest quality mica;  resist potentials capable of breaking a weak dielectric. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tesla has developed several options for switching devices.  One of them was a rotary switch, similar in principle to the circuit regulator developed by Tesla.  Another is an electrostatic device.  It consists of a pair of light webbed conductors that are in a vacuum.  As a result of their work, condensate must be created, negatively and positively charged.  In addition, Tesla mentions the work of another similar device.  It consists of a small gap in the dielectric film or air, which bends when a certain potential is reached. </p><p>  <strong>What is electricity from the earth?</strong> </p><p>  The goal of Tesla's experiments was to obtain a certain amount of energy, which is between the upper atmosphere and the surface of the earth, and then converting it into <span>electric current.</span>  He represented the Sun in the form of a huge electric ball, which is infected positively and has a potential of about 200 billion volts.  At the same time, the Earth is negatively charged.  As a result of the interaction of these two bodies, a huge electric force appears, which is called cosmic energy.  Its amount may vary depending on the time of day and season.  But this energy is always present. </p><p>  Positively charged particles accumulate in the ionosphere.  Between it and the negative charges of the Earth there is a huge potential difference (about 360,000 volts).  Considering that atmospheric gases act as an insulator, a space with a large energy reserve is formed. </p><p>  Earth in this case acts as a capacitor.  It holds negative and positive charges separately, while using air as an insulator. </p>
