For Canon cameras, it is recommended that you purchase lenses from the same company.  The quality of shooting depends on many factors.  This article is dedicated to the Canon EF 135mm f / 2L USM lens, which has established itself among amateur photographers. </p><h2>  General lens specifications </h2><p>  A good photographer will pick up not so much high-quality equipment as exactly the one that suits him.  The search will help the characteristics.  Of course, the numbers indicated in the parameters do not mean anything to the novice and amateur.  Especially for such people all points will be described as accessible as possible.  The Canon EF 135 lens has the following features: </p><ul><li>  <em>The type of lens is a telephoto lens.</em>  It is suitable for shooting any objects that are at a great distance from the photographer.  For example, an air show, a stadium, a concert.  It should be noted that this lens is fixed, that is, you cannot change the focal length.  Therefore, in order for the object to get into the frame as needed, you will have to run in search of a good place. </li><li>  <em>Focal distance - 135 mm.</em>  It is these figures that indicate how far you need to stand and what objects it is advisable to photograph.  The larger the focal length, the stronger the magnification of the subject in the camera.  Televisions with a <span>focal length of</span> about 400 mm can even photograph <span>craters on the moon.</span>  Everything below 100-120 mm does not apply to telephoto lenses (except for zoom lenses). </li><li>  <em>Aperture - F2.</em>  This option is very important for shooting, especially indoors and in bad weather.  What is this parameter?  Aperture.  It will seem to beginners that the more F, the better.  This is actually a mistake.  If the working aperture of the lens is more than 2, then the frames will be of poor quality most often, you will have to use an additional flash.  For taking pictures in fine weather, lenses with F 3.5-4 are also suitable.  The Canon EF 135mm f / 2L USM lens makes it possible to shoot anywhere, because its aperture allows it. </li><li>  <em>Mount - Canon EF.</em>  If you buy only Canon lenses, then mounting is not important.  But when studying and <span>choosing a lens of</span> other brands (Sigma, Tamron, Zeiss and others), you will have to look carefully at which camera is designed.  There are exceptions for Canon, when in the "carcass" is a mount type EF-M. </li><li>  <em>Autofocus - available.</em>  This is a very important parameter.  Without it, even professionals will not be able to photograph normally.  Lack of autofocus can be torture.  The techie will immediately recall the theory of probability and understand that trying to adjust the focus is the same as looking for a needle in a stack of dried grass. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon ef 135" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1015058.jpg" width="539"></div></li></ul><p>  In general, about the Canon EF 135 we can say that the lens is perfect in any shooting conditions.  You don‚Äôt have to worry about the need for extra light in the room.  The camera can use manual settings without a flash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Shooting options </h2><p>  All lenses have necessarily optical characteristics.  But, as a rule, they are interconnected.  For example, with a <span>wide-angle lens</span> with a focal length of 18 mm, the angle will be quite large, and for the most powerful ‚Äútelephoto‚Äù - the smallest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon ef 135 mm" class="if" height="370" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1014422.jpg" width="500"></div>  The Canon EF 135 mm lens has the following features:

    <ul><li>  <em>Viewing angle - 18 <sup>about</sup> .</em>  For a telephoto lens, this figure is small.  For example, for wide-format lenses with a small focal length, the viewing angle will be the largest, you can photograph a large friendly team, a <span>beautiful landscape.</span>  The landscape lens will not capture the whole landscape, even if there are three Christmas trees in the distance and on the sides of the birch. </li><li>  <em>Focusing distance - from 90 cm.</em> In photography, there is macro photography, which allows you to shoot tiny objects, insects in colors, radio components, snowflakes.  But the focusing distance for such objects should be much less than 90 cm. Simply put, the ‚Äútelephoto‚Äù is not intended for shooting small objects and insects. </li></ul><h2>  External data </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but the external parameters are only interested in deciding on the dimensions, the model of the camera case with a Canon EF 135 lens, and, of course, if there is already a bag or case, the main thing is that everything fits. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  External characteristics are as follows: </p>

    <ul><li>  <em>The diameter of the thread for the filter is 72 mm.</em>  This parameter is needed in order to </li><li>  buy additional filters for the lens, as well as new protective caps if the original one is lost or broken. </li><li>  <em>Dimensions - 82.5 mm diameter, 112 mm - length.</em>  Most often they pay attention to the length of the lens in order to decide on a bag or case for the camera.  Women and girls can be confused by surprised looks if they are noticed with a large lens, so they tend to take a smaller one. </li><li>  <em>Weight - 750 grams.</em>  This item also applies to ladies who are going to work with heavy equipment, holding it in fragile hands.  It must be remembered that the total weight of the "carcass and lens" must be taken into account, and not just just one. </li></ul><h2>  Additional properties </h2><ul><li>  <em>Ultrasonic motor - available.</em>  Of course, it is present, since there is autofocus in the characteristics. </li><li>  <em>Internal focusing - available.</em>  A group of lenses moves inside the lens, making the picture clear. </li><li>  <em>The number / groups of elements is 10/8.</em>  We are talking about lenses interconnected and separate. </li><li>  <em>The number of finely dispersed elements is 2.</em> These elements eliminate blue-violet stripes along the border of the subject and the background <span>(chromatic aberration).</span> </li><li>  <em>The number of aperture blades is 8.</em> The more, the better.  This lens makes a beautiful bokeh (blur the background).  Aperture petals form a circle in the background, which is very important when shooting a portrait, close-up. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="canon ef 135 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39076/1014424.jpg" width="500"></div></li></ul><h2>  Reviews of happy owners </h2><p>  Most users share the joyful experience of shooting with a Canon EF 135 lens. They leave reviews mostly positive.  It was said above that the telephoto lens is designed for shooting distant objects, but the Canon EF 135 is perfect for <span>portrait shooting.</span>  Many photographers write that even a random shot becomes a masterpiece.  Paints, colors, style - everything is professional and tasteful.  This lens is perfect in everything. </p>
