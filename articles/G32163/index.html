Located in the north of Brittany, on the English Channel, it attracts a special atmosphere.  This is not to say that this is a resort in its usual sense, although there is a sea, and sandy beaches stretch for several kilometers. </p><p>  The unique Saint-Malo (France) is often called the city of corsairs, and its fascinating history gives the port pearl of the country an incredible charm.  Tourists who visited the village surrounded by granite walls note that this was the most unusual trip in their life. </p><h2>  History tour </h2><p>  The historical center got its name from the name of the English monk Malo, who preached Christianity.  A <span>gloomy fortified city</span> based on a rocky island becomes famous after it was chosen by sea robbers, desperate and not subject to anyone.  In 1590, Saint Malo even proclaimed itself an independent republic, and corsairs collect tribute from all ships passing through the English Channel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sen little france photo" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1425953.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the XVII - XVIII centuries, it begins to develop rapidly thanks to its seafaring merchants who go to trade in different countries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During the Second World War, the ancient city was seriously destroyed, but after a long reconstruction it rose from the ashes. </p><h2>  Port Pearl Business Card </h2><p>  Full of historical monuments, the city of Saint-Malo (France), surrounded by forts from the sea, impresses with the architectural treasures of even the most sophisticated tourists.  Connecting Great Britain and French Brittany, it is famous for its citadel built in the 15th century.  The main part of the fortifications of the city consists of a castle erected to repel a military threat. </p><p>  Later, a bastion was added to a very complex architectural structure, which surprises with an unusual shape - in the form of a ship's bow.  In 1690, the citadel of Saint-Malo underwent modernization, however, during the French Revolution, the rebuilt barracks and fortified walls were destroyed.  After restoration in the last century, part of the military structure went to the city hall, and a museum was opened in two towers of the citadel, the exhibits of which trace the history from Roman times. </p><h2>  Saint-Malo (France): attractions </h2><p>  The resort is rightly proud of the fortifications encircling the city, one of the largest nationwide.  Built in a single architectural style, they protected local residents from attacks from the sea, and it is no coincidence that for several centuries a small city was considered a real fortress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sen little france" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1425943.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  More than 30 years ago, a new organ was installed in the cathedral, and solemn music gathering many listeners fills the walls of the city‚Äôs religious monument. </p><h2>  Walk along the seabed </h2><p>  Saint-Malo (France), which has preserved the spirit of the era of sea robbers, is one of the few resorts in the world that allows you to stroll along the seabed.  The gaze of tourists offers a truly unreal spectacle of an empty shore at low tide.  Many do not even understand where the water goes, and are afraid to step on the ground.  But those who decided to take an unusual walk admit that they have received incomparable pleasure. </p><h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  Guests note narrow streets, almost devoid of greenery and reliably protected from the northern winds by a powerful ring of city walls.  The appearance of gray granite houses, looking gloomy, has not changed at all since the founding of Saint-Malo (France), and those who expect a riot of colors from the resort, this can first push away.  Everywhere the influence of military architecture is manifested, which immediately catches the eye and distinguishes the resort from everyone else.  In the historical part of the city preserved wooden buildings, their shape resembling the stern of a ship. </p><p>  However, such a harsh appearance of a small city does not scare hundreds of thousands of vacationers seeking to visit the main jewel of Brittany. </p><p>  Guests admire the tall buildings that appeared several centuries ago, and in the lower floors of the old buildings are souvenir shops and cozy restaurants.  By the way, Saint-Malo (France), whose photo perfectly conveys his strong character, remembers that he was once the base of corsairs, and carefully stores stories about brave filibusters.  First of all, this was done to attract tourists, and for the sake of their fun, a pirate ship was moored in the port, where you can feel like a real robber. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof seine little france" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1425979.jpg" width="329"></div>

    <p>  Even in the high tourist season, there are not so many vacationers on city beaches that those who dream of privacy with nature will like it. </p><p>  Having retained an amazing atmosphere, Saint-Malo (France) welcomes every guest.  A gloomy and welcoming corner at the same time will return the lost peace of mind, and the magnetism of the unique city is also valid after vacationers leave it. </p>
