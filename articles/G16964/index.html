This is due to the diversity of natural landscapes, as well as affordable pricing.  At the same time, one resort is distinguished by special hospitality on the entire Black Sea coast.  It's about Sudak.  Holidays with children here can be as comfortable as possible if you take care of housing, food, and entertainment in advance. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The easiest way to get to the city of Sudak in the Crimea is to travel by private car.  For families with small children - this is the best option, as it is quite fast and comfortable.  When leaving Moscow, you must overcome 1,500 km.  There are several ways to enter the peninsula: </p><ol><li>  Using the ferry crossing the port "Caucasus".  The cost of an adult ticket is 150 rubles, for children under 6 years of age the right to travel is free, and for children over the age of 6 years the ticket price will cost 80 rubles.  Also, for the transportation of a car, you will need to pay 1700 r if the car does not exceed the size of 5.3 m, or 4800 if its length is more than 5.3 m. </li><li>  Travel on the bridge across the Kerch Strait. A pleasant moment is the fact that today the passage on the bridge is free. <div class="photo" data-original="emerging-europe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kerch bridge" class="if uuid-3224410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224410.jpg"></div></li><li>  You can also get to Sudak by regular intercity buses.  The fare from Moscow varies from 2500 to 3000 p.  Travel time is 1.5 days. </li><li>  There is also the possibility of air travel to the airport in Simferopol.  The cost of a plane ticket in high season is about 8000 r in economy class.  At the same time, travel time is significantly reduced.  From the airport you can get to Sudak by bus or by intercity taxi. </li></ol><h2>  When to go? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the sea season in Crimea begins in May, the peculiarities of young children should be taken into account.  For example, in May and June, the sea for swimming can still be cool, while in August the so-called ‚Äúflowering‚Äù begins and the sea becomes dirty, jellyfish appear.  The ideal option is July. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It should also be noted that in the presence of children of preschool age, attention should be paid to Crimea in September.  The cost of holidays with children in Sudak in the best hotels this month is significantly reduced, people on the beaches are getting smaller, and the sea is still warm. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.maxpixel.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black Sea" class="if uuid-3224412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224412.jpg"></div><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  To relax with children in Sudak, they try to choose hotels on the coastline.  This is due to the fact that the sea is the main entertainment for children of all ages.  It should be noted that the cost of rooms in such hotels can be high.  For those who want to save money, you can pay attention to small guest houses and mini-hotels, as well as private houses and apartments, the owners of which offer their tourists in high season. </p><p>  Despite the fact that public transport in Sudak runs extremely irregularly, you should not be afraid of the sleeping areas of the city, since you can even reach the beach from the most extreme point in just 30 minutes.  This time is significantly reduced if you use a personal car.  In addition, the cost of housing in such areas will be approximately 1000-1500 per room, which is quite inexpensive in the holiday season.  Also a good bonus is the proximity of markets, grocery supermarkets and pharmacies. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the comfortable hotels for relaxing in Sudak with children, the following can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  "Soldaya Grand Hotel &amp; Resort"; </li><li>  "Villa Fellini"; </li><li>  "Aquatel"; </li><li>  "Barcelona Hotel". </li></ul><p>  The cost of living varies from 2000 to 15000 per night in a room. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Reviews of holidays in Crimea in Sudak with children explain that the city is quite small, so there are also few attractions in it.  Children from 5 years old and teenagers will be interested in visiting the Genoese fortress, as well as taking a walk along the Cypress Alley.  Every year, various events are held in the fortress, such as festivals, reconstructions, tournaments, which can be quite interesting for older children. </p><div class="photo" data-original="visittoukraine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Genoese fortress" class="if uuid-3224415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224415.jpg"></div><p>  Holidays with children in the Crimea in Sudak can be interesting if you travel outside the city and visit the village of Novyi Svet, where you can take a walk along the Golitsin trail, which includes such attractions: </p><ul><li>  Green bay. </li><li>  Grotto Chaliapin. </li><li>  Blue bay. </li><li>  Lake cave. </li><li>  The through grotto. </li><li>  Royal beach. </li></ul><p>  No less interesting attraction is Cape Alchak, from where you can enjoy views of the incredible natural landscapes. </p><h2>  Where to have lunch? </h2><p>  Going on vacation with children to Sudak, many families think about food for the holidays.  Fortunately, there are no problems with this.  So, as in the city there are many cafes and restaurants that, in addition to the main menu, offer their guests also children‚Äôs.  Which is very convenient.  Sudak hotels for families with children often offer breakfast in the form of a buffet, where you can also find dishes for feeding small children.  In addition, the institutions have restaurants or cafes in which you can eat daily. </p><p>  For more budget tourists, there are dining rooms with home cooking in Sudak. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tomato.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="canteen perch" class="if uuid-3224417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224417.jpg"></div><p>  Unfortunately, in hotel rooms there is no way to cook their own meals, however, when renting rooms in private houses, the hosts suggest using a shared kitchen. </p><p>  From May to October in the Crimea you can try a large number of local fruits and vegetables, which have an affordable price.  Guest reviews recommend tasting local grapes and figs. </p><p>  Establishments that offer takeaway food just like regular restaurants carefully monitor the quality of products, so you can fearlessly eat pizza, boiled corn or sweet baklava on local beaches. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  The best vacation with a child in Sudak is time spent with the family.  A variety of entertainment that will be of interest to both adults and children of different ages can contribute to this.  In this regard, the resort is also at a decent level.  Reviews of holidays with children in Sudak indicate the presence of such entertainment: </p><ol><li>  Water park with a large number of water slides of various sizes, a pool and a cafeteria.  The institution is located outside of Sudak, however, the distance is only a few kilometers.  It is recommended to go all day.  The entrance fee is 900 r from 13.00 to 17.00 and 1100 from 10.00 to 17.00.  Children whose height does not exceed 100 cm do not need to pay entrance fees. <div class="photo" data-original="www.visitcrimea.guide" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="water park zander" class="if uuid-3224418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224418.jpg"></div></li><li>  There are water slides on the beaches, the price for a single use of which varies from 50 to 150 rubles. </li><li>  Guides may be interesting for teenagers on horseback tours around Sudak. </li><li>  There is also a petting zoo.  There are not so many animals in it, however, you can pet and feed them all with your hands.  Such entertainment will appeal to both children and adults. </li></ol><p>  In the embankment area there are a large number of playgrounds aimed at children from 1 to 12 years old.  Their visit is free.  There is also a Nemo Dolphinarium, in which you can not only watch the performance with aquatic mammals, but also swim with them in the pool and take a photo for memory. </p><h2>  Beaches of Sudak </h2><p>  Almost the entire coastline of the city is built up with hotels and pensions.  Unfortunately, only guests are allowed to enter the quartz beaches of hotels, while everyone can visit the beaches of sanatoriums and pensions.  The disadvantage of such beaches is the fact that they close in the evening.  This is mentioned in the sign at the entrance, however, those who overlooked this fact and did not manage to go beyond the beach will have to climb over the fence. </p><p>  Sudak also has a city beach, which does not close at night.  It is also equipped with sun loungers and beach umbrellas, which can be rented for a comfortable stay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimean beach" class="if uuid-3224420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224420.jpg"></div><p>  Another advantage of local beaches is the abundance of small shopping stalls that offer soft drinks, ice cream and takeaway.  In addition, right next to the beach you can buy a variety of tanning products, inflatable toys or towels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.todaysparent.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation with children" class="if uuid-3224419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53896/3224419.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is worth noting that it is necessary to think about rest with a child at sea in advance.  Experienced tourists recommend that you book hotel rooms in advance for the desired date, as well as worry about tickets to the Crimea.  It is also important to think over the luggage that children may need to travel to Sudak. </p>
