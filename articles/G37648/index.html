  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Egg Shell Crafts: Creative Ideas</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now needlewomen use completely different materials in their work.  They practically do not need to spend money; for the most part, they are in every house.  If you wash and lay eggshells after cooking, you can later create bright and beautiful mosaics, original frames for photographs or paintings, crafts for Easter and many other wonderful things. </p><p>  We offer some interesting master classes in egg shell crafts.  Painstaking work, requires perseverance and patience, but the result is worth it. </p><h2>  Raw material processing </h2><p>  Starting to make crafts from the egg shell, you need to properly prepare the shell itself.  After all the material is washed and dried, you need to remove the inner thin film from the shell.  If you plan to paint in different colors, use food coloring.  Dissolving them in water, soak the shell for half an hour.  Then we take the material out of the cup and lay it out on paper napkins for drying with the face up.  When everything is dry, break large pieces into small pieces for crafts from eggshells with a hammer. </p><p>  Then we collect all the fragments by color in different bowls, so that it is convenient to use them when working. </p><h2>  Painting "Butterfly" </h2><p>  As a craft from an egg shell, you can create such a picturesque picture.  As a basis, take a square piece of fiberboard in white.  A future drawing is transferred to it with a pencil, then pasting begins with a butterfly.  It is necessary to adhere to the color scheme according to the sketch.  After the butterfly is made, the voids are filled with fragments of white shell. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="insect butterfly" class="if uuid-2295927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295927.jpg"></div><p>  For gluing, you need to purchase PVA glue and a thin brush.  The work is scrupulous and time-consuming, but the result is worth it.  After finishing work on the egg shell craft, you need to coat the whole picture with acrylic varnish so that the fragments do not fall out over time.  Then it is inserted under the glass into the frame and mounted on the wall. </p><p>  It is possible to make such a picture of an egg shell differently.  First, stick all the details, filling in the whole square of the fiberboard, and only then apply the picture with acrylic paints with a brush.  Then the work still needs to be varnished. </p><h2>  Bottle decoration </h2><p>  You can make an original craft from an egg shell with your own hands on a glass bottle.  It is advisable to take wine or champagne.  First, the container is washed and the sticker and glue are carefully removed.  The surface should be smooth and clean.  After drying, you can begin to cover its surface with fragments of an egg shell.  How to cook it for work and stain, described earlier in the article.  We will not repeat.  PVA glue is applied with a brush to the splinter and applied to the glass.  Hold the part slightly with your hand to glue it.  Use only thick glue for crafts made from eggshell, otherwise the details may crumble. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decorative bottles" class="if uuid-2295958" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295958.jpg"></div><p>  You can decorate a glass bottle with a picture or a mosaic of eggshell.  The parts are glued tightly to each other so that the glass base is not visible. </p><p>  After finishing work on pasting, do not forget to cover the surface of the bottle with acrylic varnish to fix the shell on the container for a long time. </p><p>  Decorate the surface by applying additional elements.  It can be half beads or transparent pebbles, rhinestones and jewelry made of ribbons or fabric.  Basically, fabric parts are placed on the thin neck of the bottle. </p><h2>  Earrings </h2><p>  Egg shell mosaics can also be made on plastic earrings.  If you are tired of wearing plain unattractive products, then thanks to your skills you can transform them beyond recognition.  First, the shell is prepared and stained with its dyes in the selected colors.  After drying, lay out and fix the fragments on the plastic surface of the earrings.  In the same way, you can make a pendant, creating a beautiful set of jewelry. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shell decoration" class="if uuid-2295963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295963.jpg"></div><p>  Perform a picture of the eggshell on the front and on the back of the workpieces.  At the end of the work, acrylic varnish is applied.  After drying, it is necessary to walk again with a brush with varnish, so the jewelry will beautifully sparkle in the light of the lights.  None of your friends will guess that such beautiful earrings are made of eggshell. </p><h2>  Crafts for Easter </h2><p>  You can decorate an Easter table or basket with such funny rabbits.  They are made from whole shells.  To do this, holes are made in the lower and upper parts of the egg and the contents are pulled.  This can be done with a tube or syringe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="parentinghealthybabies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rabbits from eggs" class="if uuid-2295996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295996.jpg"></div><p>  Then soft felt ears are glued onto the shell.  The pink center is attached to the material with PVA glue.  Then markers draw the eyes, stomach, nose and mouth.  A cloth bow can be sewn onto the ears.  In order for the egg to stand exactly on the table, you need to glue the rabbit's legs cut out of plastic or foam. </p><h2>  Egg shell decoupage </h2><p>  The Easter table can be decorated with decorative eggs made using different techniques.  A chicken with a flower is decoupage, and the rest of the decoration is an egg shell, broken into small pieces. </p><p>  Recall how decoupage is done.  You need to find a napkin with your favorite pattern.  Carefully peeling off the napkin layer on which the image is located.  This is done carefully, as the paper is very thin. </p><p>  The background color is first applied to the egg.  To do this, acrylic paint is poured into a bowl and a piece of foam rubber is dipped into it.  Then, with a soft tangential motion, they process most of the shell.  The place where the chicken will be placed is left untouched. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage eggs" class="if uuid-2295973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295973.jpg"></div><p>  After the paint dries, a decoupage is made, namely: the unpainted area is smeared with PVA glue, a picture cut from a napkin is laid out on it.  Then, with gentle movements, attach it over the entire width of the egg.  Then, another layer of PVA is applied over the image with a brush.  Having carefully fixed the picture, they begin to decorate the rest of the shell with fragments.  They are also glued to PVA, pre-painted in the desired colors with acrylic paint. </p><p>  After the shell has dried on top, the egg is covered with a layer of transparent varnish. </p><h2>  Shell carving </h2><p>  Start work by freeing the egg from its contents.  To do this, with a thin needle, you need to dig small holes from the bottom and top of the egg.  Then just blow it into the container, applying lips to the hole.  Then water is poured into the larger hole with a syringe and the inner surface of the egg is washed several times. </p><div class="photo" data-original="it.nextews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shell carving" class="if uuid-2295929" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2295929.jpg"></div><p>  When the material is ready for carving, a pattern or picture is applied with a simple pencil.  So that the craft does not crack during drilling, it is strengthened by applying several layers of acrylic varnish.  Then a soft sponge is placed on the table, on which the shell rests and drilling of parts begins.  Various tools are used for work, for example, a drill, a miniature drill or a special set for manicure on an electric drive. </p><p>  The partitions between the drilled holes should be thick so that a piece does not fall off and does not spoil the whole picture. </p><p>  After final <span>processing, the egg is</span> gently blown <span>with a</span> dry brush so that no dust remains on the product, then the surface is again varnished. </p><p>  This article presents several crafts from the eggshell with a detailed description of the stages of work.  After studying it, it will be easy for many to do this work on their own. </p>
