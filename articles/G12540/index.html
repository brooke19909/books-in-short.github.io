And to this day, many scientists, historians, archaeologists have not decided when the first time people began to put on something.  Every year, the requirements for clothes only increased.  For a modern person, it is already important not only to cover your body, but also to have quality things. </p><p>  Professionals have created new technologies for processing fabrics, seams, sections.  They also invented slanting inels.  This is a very convenient way to process any slices.  The finish is neat, even, and sometimes interesting.  The same option allows you to make an attractive trim on any clothing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slanting inels" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443291.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Neck <span>treatment with an</span> oblique trim </h2><p>  If you do not need a tight or deaf collar on the dress, then you can beautifully cut the neckline.  For this, oblique bakes are suitable.  Make them easy.  You need to take the fabric and draw segments with a width of 4 to 5 cm. It is important to place them not along the shared thread, but at an angle of 45 degrees.  The length of such an edging is calculated as follows: cut length plus 2 cm for the seam.  The fabric for processing can be selected according to the color of the dress, and you can contrast or satin.  This will give the clothes an elegant and original look. </p><h2>  Slice processing </h2><p>  How to make a slanting inlay was discussed above.  And now we‚Äôll figure out how to sew it correctly.  There are several ways.  For the first, the cooked strip must first be folded in half (inside with the wrong side) and ironed.  To make it easier to work on and grind it more carefully, it is necessary to bend the fabric again by 0.5 mm from the cut and slightly iron.  This will be the outline-line along which you need to sew everything.  Then attach the prepared inlay from the front of the dress to the cut, and then take small stitches along the ironed line.  The remaining ends on the collar are then swept away and stitched by car.  Excess tissue needs to be cut off.  Now bend the tape itself to the back of the cut and sweep it with small stitches.  It is important to do this closer to the fold of the finish and so that the seam on the front side is right in the wrong side.  For beginners, we will give advice: you can make a seam directly on the collar, but at a distance of no more than 1 mm from the edge.  If the mark is satisfied, then you need to iron it again, and then grind it on a typewriter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neckline oblique trimming" class="if" height="452" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443302.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Another way </h2><p>  This option is slightly different from the one described above.  But a similar treatment of the neckline with an oblique trim is quite acceptable.  First of all, oblique beques are cut out from any fabric, their width should be from 2 to 3 cm. The fabric is not located along transverse threads, but at an angle of 45 degrees.  This allows for a neat finish.  Next, you need to bend both edges by five millimeters and lightly iron.  The length of the fabric strip should be equal to the length of the cut and plus 2 cm per seam. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bevel foot" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443673.jpg" width="499"></div>

    <h2>  Special foot treatment </h2><p>  The cut oblique inlay with your own hands is sewn very quickly.  This work will take just a couple of minutes.  Attach the prepared strip of fabric to the cut on the front of the product and sweep it with small stitches.  If necessary, grind sections at the edges of the inlay, and cut off excess tissue. </p><p>  In the <span>clothing industry</span> , new technologies are being developed.  This allows not only to facilitate the work process, but also to improve the quality of products.  So there was a device for a slanting inlay.  It is installed instead of the foot.  With it, the fabric is sewn faster, during work creases or pinches on the fabric will not form.  A similar treatment of the neck with an oblique trim will be easy and quick. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the grinding is swept, you need to grind it.  The seam is desirable to lead along the intended line.  Then remove the extra threads, and throw the tape onto the wrong side of the cut.  The second bent edge should be noticed again and try to make both edges of the inlay coincide in one seam.  Experienced craftswomen hide the seam directly in the fold of the inlay on the front side of the product, and novice tailors can do this on the inlay.  The distance from the edge should be no more than 1 mm.  Then you need to grind.  It is advisable that the machine has a foot for a slanting inlay.  It remains only to iron, although the method of processing the neck or other cuts depends on the type of fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a slanting inlay" class="if" height="415" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Slice processing on knitwear </h2><p>  The knit fabric itself is very complex.  To sew a product from it, you will need special equipment.  If a slanting inlay is used to process the neck, a special foot is simply necessary.  Cut a strip of length from the fabric as well as the cut to be cut plus 2 cm.The strip width should be from 1.5 to 2 cm.If the <span>knitwear is tight,</span> then it is advisable to cut one cut, which will be on the wrong side of the product, on an overlock or zigzag seam.  Iron the other edge slightly.  Now you will need to sweep the tape to the cut. </p><p>  After the work done, check whether everything turned out as it should, and then you can proceed with the stitching by car.  When working with knitwear, it must be borne in mind that the fabric itself is very elastic, so it‚Äôs better to adjust the stitch a little zigzag.  Strongly stretching and stretching such a fabric is also not necessary, otherwise the product will lose its shape.  Then remove the extra threads, and throw the tape on the wrong side.  The swept section is no longer required to bend.  You just need to carefully grip it, and preferably right in the seam.  To grind more evenly, it is better to iron first and only then grind on a typewriter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="oblique foot" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443675.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Neckline trim </h2><p>  You can make slanting inels from satin.  The outfit will immediately become solemn and refined.  As an option, use ready-made tapes, which you will not be able to purchase today.  Only when buying, you need to pay attention to the fact that the product was not from <span>shared threads.</span>  Slanting <span>satin ribbons are</span> always available.  They will lie flat on the cut.  Processing such an inlay is very easy. </p><h2>  Satin Ribbon Processing </h2><p>  To trim a cut with a satin slanting inlay, it is better to buy it about 2 cm wide. You can sew in two ways: with an open end and with a closed one.  The edges of such a tape do not crumble, so the processing method can be chosen as you wish.  In order to trim the products with an open edge, you do not even need to iron.  The tape can be swept immediately at a distance of about 1 mm.  Then you need to grind it and go around the cut itself.  The second edge of the tape is also not required to be bent, it can immediately be swept to the product.  In this case, the second seam should completely coincide with the first.  If the level of skill in working with the sewing machine is not high enough, then you can make the second <span>seam hidden</span> or use another processing method. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bias" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443676.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <h2>  A simplified version of processing a cut of a satin ribbon </h2><p>  You can trim the cut with a satin ribbon very quickly.  Just need to make a little effort and do everything carefully.  To begin, fold the tape in half with the front side to the very top and iron.  And then attach one edge of the tape with the wrong side to the front of the product and sweep.  Stitching is not necessary yet.  In the same way, grip the second edge of the tape to the wrong side of the product.  Sweep again.  This is done so that there are no two lines on the finish.  For those who can not make a double line, this option is ideal.  Then it remains only to sew on a typewriter at a distance of 1 mm from the edge of the tape.  At the end of the work, you need to iron everything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="slanting device" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/443677.jpg" width="600"></div>
