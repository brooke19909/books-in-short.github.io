  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The concept and types of civil relations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Individual citizens (individuals) and their organizations, in view of their various activities, constantly enter into social <span>(social) relations</span> among themselves <span>.</span>  Certain types of such relations are governed by special legal norms, that is, rules of conduct that are generally binding in nature, which is why they are called legal relations. </p><p>  Civil legal relations are one of the types of such legal relations, respectively, they also have all the common features for any legal relations (in particular, the basis of laws and social character).  Civil legal relations are conscious, strong-willed, because they reflect the individual will of the subjects of relations.  Below, let us consider what types of civil procedural relations exist.  The created classification pursues both theoretical and practical goals, which consist in correctly understanding the obligations and rights of the parties, determining the range of legal norms that should be applied at all stages of legal relations (the occurrence of civil legal relations, their implementation and subsequent termination). </p><p>  <strong>Classification of civil relations</strong> </p><p>  This classification according to various criteria helps to clearly understand the diversity of a civilian nature. </p><p>  Types of civil legal relations by the nature of the relationship of the obligated and authorized person: </p><p>  a) Absolute legal relations - when on the one hand there is an authorized person, and on the other - opposing obligated persons, the circle of which is not defined.  For example, civil relations between third parties and the owner, between those who have exclusive rights to any work (literary, musical, artistic) and, again, third parties.  In this case, the rights of the authorized person are considered absolute, and third parties acquire obligations that are promising regulatory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  b) Relative legal relations - this is when the authorized person (or persons) is opposed by a specific obligated person (or persons), that is, when the parties to the relationship are strictly defined and have corresponding duties and rights to each other.  The concept of such civil relations can include various <span>types of activities.</span>  This is the relationship associated with the implementation of measures for civil protection, and relations associated with the transfer to use of inventions and works. </p><p>  <strong>Types of civil relations in content:</strong> </p><p>  a) Property - relations arising in connection with any property (or material good).  They can be associated either with the transfer of goods from one owner to another (in particular by inheritance), or with the presence of property of a particular person (in particular, ownership).  To carry out the protection of property rights, measures of a property nature are applied: compensation for damage, forfeit, etc. </p><p>  b) <span>Non-property relations</span> arise regarding <span>intangible goods,</span> for example, honor, <span>business reputation,</span> dignity, copyrights.  Along with measures that are proprietary in nature and have been indicated above (for example, <span>compensation for non-pecuniary damage),</span> non-property measures are also used to protect such rights (public refutation, recognition of authorship, etc.). </p><p>  <strong>Types of civil relations for the distribution of duties and rights:</strong> </p><p>  a) Simple legal relations, when one person has only one right, and the other person has only one obligation.  For example, under a loan agreement, the lender has the right to demand a refund, and the borrower is only obliged to repay the debt. </p><p>  b) Complex - when each subject of relations simultaneously has a number of duties and rights. </p><p>  <strong>Types of civil relations, depending on the subject of regulation:</strong> </p><p>  a) Proprietary - carried out through the actions of an authorized entity (use, disposal, possession of a thing that belongs to him by right of ownership).  Such relationships govern the statics of property relations. </p><p>  b) Obligatory - they mediate the dynamics of property relations (transfer of a thing for use, for sale or gift, provision of services, performance of work). </p><p>  <strong>Types of civil relations by the time during which they exist:</strong> </p><p>  a) Urgent, which are limited to a specific period (for example, copyrights, which are valid throughout the life of the subject of law and another 50 years after his death). </p><p>  b) unlimited, which are not limited by any period (for example, ownership). <em> </em></p>
