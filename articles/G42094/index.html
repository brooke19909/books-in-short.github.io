What does this concept include?  To find out, you should refer to the reference literature.  Elling (netherl. Helling) - the spacious rooms intended for construction, repair of various objects or their storage. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  In shipbuilding, this is the name for covered structures located on the banks of reservoirs, where the stages of construction and repair of marine vessels go.  Inside the boathouses there are slipways (inclined base) along which the finished vessel is lowered into the water or pulled inward for inspection of the hull and repair work.  At water stations, the boathouse on the seashore is intended for storage and minor repairs of sports yachts and boats.  They also store the necessary equipment: oars, sails, masts, rescue equipment. </p><p>  In aviation, spacious rooms were created for balloons or airships.  Here was the construction and repair of aircraft. </p>

What this means today for Crimeans and their many guests is worth considering in more detail.

    <p>  The general purpose of boathouse as a garage for boats over time has been transformed.  The main type of income for the coastal areas has always been tourist services.  The lack of territory for the construction of hotels pushed some enterprising people to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing boat garages for other purposes.  So the boathouses in Crimea became private hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  The main advantage of the premises was their advantageous location on the seashore, almost at the water's edge.  The former garage has become a tourist destination and received a new status - boathouse.  That this is an inexpensive and profitable type of accommodation, it immediately became clear to the first settlers.  Indeed, in such places there were almost no amenities familiar in the civilized world.  Payment was only charged for providing a roof over your head and sleeping places. </p>

    <p>  The lack of comfort was offset by a favorable location right on the beach, and for a moderate fee.  Later, the owners managed to add a number of amenities to unusual housing.  Original interior decoration appeared, electricity was carried out.  This allowed residents to cook their own food and use various household appliances: a TV, a refrigerator, a fan. </p><p>  The combination of several garages in a single complex has allowed to increase the number of places of residence and expand housing opportunities. </p><p>  Some boathouses turned into two-story buildings and became a kind of mini-cottages.  They began to equip kitchens for vacationers.  Those who do not intend to burden themselves on vacation with a grueling standing at the stove are given the opportunity to eat in numerous cafes and restaurants.  As a rule, the food there is offered simple and inexpensive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Shower rooms are rarely equipped with boathouses.  That this inconvenience can be overcome by contacting the owners for help, is known to all tourists.  Owners of mini-hotels usually live nearby and are ready to provide showers and an opportunity to do laundry for a fee. </p><p>  When settling, vacationers are usually provided with a standard set of bed linen and towels.  Other household items (iron, hair dryer, electric kettle) can be obtained at will for an additional charge. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  In general, rest in a boathouse is affordable for almost any vacationer, regardless of the thickness of his wallet.  It is especially convenient to campers in such housing.  Traveling around the Crimea by car, people tend to go around as many places as possible, they want to visit all corners of the peninsula.  Therefore, parking for rest and overnight, as a rule, are short.  And settling in the boathouses is the best option for such travelers. </p><p>  Year after year, the price of land in the coastal zone is growing at an inexorable pace.  Therefore, the owners of private territories began to invest more and more money in the re-equipment of ex-garages and the construction of completely new buildings.  So, a large number of elite hotels appeared on the Black Sea coast, providing maximum comfort to everyone who wants to relax, not only in the summer season, but also in the remaining months of the year. </p><p>  What kind of services are not offered to vacationers: restaurants, bars, swimming pools, bath complexes, tennis courts and much more.  Since such hotels are built on the ground in the first line of the sea, they also got called boathouses. </p>

    <h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The relative disadvantages of rest in boathouses can be attributed only to their solitude, remoteness from crowded places.  Although for many, detachment from civilization is extremely necessary.  Tired of a long year from work, fuss and problems, a person seeks to hide from the whole world at least for a short while.  And if there is a desire to return for a short time to noisy places, to visit excursions, then you can always easily get to the city or village with your car or minibus, which runs smoothly. </p><h2>  Where are such buildings? </h2><p>  Following the residents of Crimea, they began to convert the boathouses into elite coastal housing in the Baltic states, the Krasnodar Territory, and on all coasts of the post-Soviet space. </p>

    <p>  There are many former boat garages in the suburbs, on the shores of lakes and reservoirs.  The cost of living in them directly depends on the number of services and the quality of room equipment. </p><h2>  What do people think? </h2><p>  Today, boathouses are gaining more and more popularity.  The reviews of those who at least once lived in such a dwelling are only positive.  The advantages of accommodation include the location of housing directly on the beach.  Some have a rest and having united several families.  For children in this case, you can allocate a separate room for living and recreation.  The low cost of living speaks in favor of such a holiday on the beach.  The seclusion of location creates a special microclimate and independence from the outside world. </p>
