That is why the hotels and pensions Olginka enjoy tremendous success. </p><p>  Many tourists relax here more often than in larger resorts.  To accommodate guests in the village, many luxurious hotels and health resorts have been built with their own dendrological park and pristine beach.  The largest and most popular boarding houses in Olginka are Impulse, Svetlana, Orbit, Olginka.
