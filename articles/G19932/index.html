There are many legends about seven Stalinist skyscrapers built in the post-war years.  Despite their venerable age, these buildings today amaze tourists, and many indigenous Muscovites would be happy to purchase apartments in them. </p><h2>  History and description of the Stalinist skyscraper on Barrikadnaya </h2><p>  In January 1947, I. Stalin signed a decree of the Council of Ministers "On the construction of high-rise buildings in Moscow."  Kudrinskaya Square (formerly Uprising Square) was chosen for the construction of one of the magnificent buildings.  For the simultaneous construction and similar architectural forms, these houses were later poetically called the "Seven Sisters".  The building on <span>Kudrinskaya Square</span> will go down in history as a skyscraper on Barrikadnaya, by the name of the nearest metro station. </p>
