You can take a loan over the Internet using instant loans.  The borrower can receive the funds within a few minutes after filling out the questionnaire, since the decision to issue a loan is made almost instantly.  Most borrowers prefer to borrow money on a bank card: it is fast, convenient and safe.  The most popular in Russia are cards of Sberbank - the largest bank in the country.  Before applying, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with companies where you can quickly take a loan on a Sberbank card. </p><h2>  Documents for obtaining an instant loan online </h2><p>  Despite the fact that filling out an application in ‚Äúquick loans‚Äù differs from submitting a request to the bank, these lenders also make demands on the borrower.  In 9 out of 10 <span>microfinance organizations (MFIs), the</span> main and only document for obtaining a loan is the passport of the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quickly take a loan on a savings bank card" class="if uuid-2934388" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934388.jpg"></div><p>  Before taking a loan on a Sberbank card, the client must provide the details of his document.  Some companies require you to enter information in the questionnaire on the site.  Others require a copy of the client‚Äôs photo. </p><p>  If a client wants to take a long-term loan on a Sberbank card, the lender may require additional information, for example, about the client‚Äôs income.  Refusal to provide may result in a negative decision on the application for a loan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  MFI Borrower Requirements </h2><p>  Microloans are more loyal to their customers, but they cannot ignore the prerequisites for obtaining a loan.  A borrower can borrow a loan or a loan on a Sberbank card, who: </p><ul><li>  is an adult.  Some companies give loans to people over 18 years old, others - only to citizens from 21 years old; </li><li>  has Russian citizenship.  This is one of the prerequisites for obtaining a quick loan; </li><li>  uses a bank card.  The presence of a means of payment is necessary for the issuance of a loan, which will be transferred to the client's card; </li><li>  has income (with a microloan, official certificates are not required if the amount is up to 50 thousand rubles, but the borrower is obliged to repay the loan in any way); </li><li>  did not allow delays.  Not all lenders are willing to give loans to customers with bad credit history, but there are also MFIs that credit loans to Sberbank cards even to unreliable payers. </li></ul><h2>  Which card is better to use to get a loan? </h2><p>  If you want to take a loan on a Sberbank card without refusal, you should correctly select a bank card for crediting a loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="culturaliteraria.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="take a long-term loan with a Sberbank card" class="if uuid-2934536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934536.jpg"></div><p>  Not all debit cards are suitable for microloans.  It is not recommended to enter data: </p><ol><li>  Credit card.  It already contains the funds of the bank.  In addition, it is not a savings account designed to store the client‚Äôs own funds. </li><li>  Instant card.  These are unnamed banking products that not all MFI sites accept.  If the client has only an instant card, it is recommended to issue a reissue to a personalized one or order a new product. </li><li>  Card owned by another person.  The discrepancy between the data of the borrower and the cardholder may serve as a reason for refusing to receive a microloan. </li><li>  Expired card.  If the term of plastic has come to an end, it must be replaced at the office at the place of the account. </li><li>  "Maestro".  It is not possible at all companies to get a loan on the Maestro card of Sberbank, as these are old-style cards with the least protection.  Social cards are also not always suitable for obtaining an online loan. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="penzanews.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="take a loan on a card maestro sberbank" class="if uuid-2934393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934393.jpg"></div><p>  Until 2017, the card of the MIR payment system could also not be used as an account for crediting a loan.  But at present, customers can take a loan on the MIR card of Sberbank without restrictions (with the exception of the MIR Social product). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose a microloan? </h2><p>  The choice of lender must be approached with the greatest responsibility.  The company depends on the interest rate, the possibility of obtaining a loan, its payment and loan servicing.  It is recommended to give preference to well-known MFIs, which are trusted by thousands of Russians.  For example, "Zaymer", "Quick money", MoneyMan, Lime, Kredito24, Moneza. </p><div class="photo" data-original="newsworld.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="to take a loan to a Sberbank card without refusal" class="if uuid-2934391" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934391.jpg"></div><p>  These companies issue dozens of loans per day and have earned a reputation as reliable lenders.  Financial organizations that provide loans do not always have favorable conditions, therefore it is better to borrow money from trusted sources. </p><p>  You can find out the company's reputation by reviews on the network.  Sometimes borrowers leave them on the lender's official website, but more often on larger portals, for example, banki.ru. </p><h2>  Loan interest rate: how to get a profitable loan </h2><p>  After familiarizing yourself with the reviews of real customers, you should review the loan conditions in the company.  Online loans differ from consumer loans in terms of fees.  Banks offer interest based on an annual overpayment, and MFIs charge a fee on a daily basis. </p><p>  The minimum interest rate in MFIs is 0.5% per day.  At first glance, this seems much more profitable than 12.9% per annum.  But if the client is interested in obtaining a loan for 3 months or more, the overpayment on a microloan in this case will be 200-300% more than on a bank loan. </p><p>  To obtain a favorable interest rate, it is recommended to comply with the conditions of the lender, for example, provide additional documents, avoid delays and choose a special type of loan. </p><div class="photo" data-original="paymentweek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get a loan on a sberbank card" class="if uuid-2934543" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934543.jpg"></div><p>  Some companies are willing to take interest on the first loan of the client if the borrower complies with the terms of the refund.  For example, the first loan at 0% can be obtained at Moneza and Ezaem.  These are the most profitable options how to get a loan on a Sberbank card without commission.  Subsequent loans will cost Sberbank cardholders 1% to 5% per day. </p><h2>  Filling out an application for an online loan: features </h2><p>  The most important step in obtaining a loan online is to fill out an application for a loan.  The decision to issue a loan depends on the correctness of the design of the borrower's questionnaire.  Most questionnaires on MFI websites are simple and logical: filling them out will take no more than 10 minutes. </p><p>  Before taking a loan on a Sberbank card, the client must indicate in the application: </p><ul><li>  FULL NAME; </li><li>  address; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  contact information: phone number, email address; </li><li>  income information: name of organization or individual entrepreneur, position, size of earnings; </li><li>  loan amount and term; </li><li>  a method of obtaining a loan on a bank card of Sberbank. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="r.search.yahoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="card world sberbank take a loan" class="if uuid-2934537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934537.jpg"></div><p>  After filling in all the data, it is necessary to check the questionnaire for errors and correct them.  Next send for processing. </p><h2>  The term for receipt of funds on the card of Sberbank </h2><p>  Having learned how to take a loan on a Sberbank card and filling out an application, the client can only wait for a loan decision.  The maximum loan review period is 48 hours.  In many microfinances, the answer comes almost immediately: after 5 minutes after the application is submitted, the client receives an SMS for approval.  After that, the loan is sent for crediting. </p><p>  The time period for receipt of money depends on the system of the bank.  Sberbank does not delay customer funds: request processing takes several seconds.  The term for receipt of credit money, on average, is from 1 to 6 hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realnoevremya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="take a loan loan on a card of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2934532" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/2934532.jpg"></div><p>  If the client received a notice of crediting the loan, and the funds were not received within 24 hours, it is recommended to contact the loan support service.  If the delay occurred due to the fault of the bank, then it is not necessary to visit the office.  You can call one of the numbers indicated on the back of the card, for example, dial "900". </p><h2>  How to pay off a loan: recommendations </h2><p>  After the borrower has received the loan and used it, he must return the funds to the lender.  Unlike banks, MFIs provide loans for the short term.  Some of them are returned immediately in full, taking into account interest for use, while others can be paid on schedule. </p><p>  To quickly return the funds, it is better to choose loans with a full refund of the entire payment amount.  These are loans for small amounts, from 1,000 to 10,000 rubles.  If the borrower took money for urgent needs, for example, before the salary, he can return them immediately after receiving it.  So you can save on interest for use, which are charged in microloans for each day of the contract. </p><p>  It is difficult to repay loans worth over 10,000 rubles right away, so a payment schedule is issued to the client for their repayment.  To reduce the overpayment, you should repay the loan ahead of schedule, given its solvency. </p>
