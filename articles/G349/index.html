The Temple of Hephaestus is very well preserved, there are few analogues in the degree of preservation in the world.  He has native columns, pediments and almost the entire roof.  Decorations and murals were most affected. </p>

    <h2>  Economics and Monuments </h2><p>  Only in Greece, which is currently experiencing difficulties in the economic sphere, can one see many historical monuments and other interesting places created by our distant ancestors long before the <span>birth of Jesus Christ.</span>  In ancient times, the country experienced both prosperity and <span>periods of stagnation,</span> but, unfortunately, mainly on this land there were fierce wars between strangers who dreamed of taking control of this country.  The Temple of Hephaestus in Athens still attracts tourists. </p><p>  All these facts influenced the preservation of a large number of temples and shrines, some of them at the beginning of the XX century, archaeologists literally dug up.  Among the small number of buildings that have survived to this day is the world famous Temple of Hephaestus.  A large number of preserved written sources speak of the Athenian agora, but the meaning of this word is difficult to find.  To understand the significance of the building, you need to tell what this agora was for the inhabitants of Greece at that time.  The Athenian agora was located in the center of Athens and served as a venue for gatherings, ceremonies, competitions and fairs.  We can say that it was an analogue of the forum among the Romans, erected before the birth of Jesus Christ. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On this place and near it only temples, theaters and other constructions significant for the population were built.  The temple of Hephaestus on the Agora was one of them.  Now it can be seen by tourists who visit Athens.  Interestingly, the temple survived to this day not because of the love of the Greeks for paganism, but thanks to Orthodoxy. </p>

    <h2>  Hephaestus </h2><p>  Myths of <span>Ancient Greece</span> say that Hephaestus was the <span>son of Zeus</span> and Hera.  According to legend, during the next quarrel between Zeus and the Hero of Hephaestus they threw him on a volcanic island.  Divine origin did not save him from injuries - he received a broken leg and began to limp.  The Temple of Hephaestus is a building populated by myths and various stories. </p><p>  A detailed examination of all the mosaics and images, legends and myths that tell about the life of the gods, we can conclude that all the gods constantly feasted.  And only as an entertainment did they come down to people.  And only Hephaestus worked without interruption, because he was a blacksmith and had power over fire and volcanoes.  He made the best weapons and equipment for the ancient Greek warrior Achilles, who became famous for his vulnerable place - the "Achilles heel."  The life of the blacksmith god was difficult and passed by the insanely hot fire hearth.  Fans of mythology seek to visit the temple of Hephaestus.  Photos of the monument can be found in many guidebooks. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Temple history </h2><p>  According to scientists, researchers who studied various written sources and traditions, this temple was erected during the reign of Pericles.  He possessed the ability to convince citizens with speeches, and his talented command and control helped to defend himself against enemy attacks with minimal losses.  It is believed that the reign of Pericles is the golden age of Athens.  On his orders, this famous building was erected. </p><p>  It was built over 35 years, starting from 450 BC.  It is not difficult to notice that during this time there was the possibility of building several such facilities.  But sources tell us that many of the people involved were sent to erect the huge Parthenon.  The majestic turned out to be the temple of Hephaestus.  Athens is more famous for it. </p>

    <h2>  Magnificent gardens </h2><p>  Despite the records of the traveler Pausanias, which even ancient Corinth has, available to historians, the name of the architect who developed the plan for this temple is not known for certain.  Some of the ancient written sources say that in the adjacent territory of the Temple of Hephaestus there was a magnificent garden.  In this place, philosophers, under the shadow of trees, reflected on life. </p><p>  The pagan temple was converted into the Church of St. George in the 7th century AD.  This happened due to the fact that the former greatness of Athens has already passed: the city lacked money and workers.  By the way, Christians often turned ancient buildings into temples.  Take, for example, the world-famous ‚ÄúTower of the Winds‚Äù, which is one of the oldest weather monitoring stations.  King Otton forced the Christians to leave this building and made a museum out of it.  Such a story survived the temple of Hephaestus.  Greece is a country of myths and legends. </p>

    <h2>  Temple architecture </h2><p>  The Temple of Hephaestus is one of the few structures that have survived to this day in excellent condition, this is its amazingness.  It is located on the hill of Agoraios, the dimensions of the building are 31.7 x 13.7 m. Thirty-four columns and the roof of the building have been miraculously preserved.  It should be noted the ionic style of the frieze of the temple where Hephaestus was revered.  Eighteen of the sixty-eight metopes are made in the form of sculptures.  Metope will tell travelers about the exploits of Hercules and the adventures of Theseus. </p><h2>  Sculptures that are not </h2><p>  The famous thinker Pausanias, who described what he noticed during his wanderings around the world, in his notes tells that in the middle of the temple there were 2 large bronze sculptures: </p><ul><li>  the lord of fire Hephaestus; </li><li>  patroness of the capital of Greece Athens Pallas. </li></ul><p>  Unfortunately, these statues, like many murals and mosaics, are destroyed and stolen by enemies and robbers. </p><h2>  Temple of workers </h2><p>  <span>Famous architects</span> think that the Temple of Hephaestus was created in the image of the Parthenon, as well as many other smaller temples that used to be in Athens.  Their opinion is not unfounded, because at that time most of the shrines for worshiping the gods were built in the Doric style.  By the way, archaeologists found in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Temple of Hephaestus many remains of the workshops of blacksmiths and potters.  This fact indicates the desire of the masters of that time to perform work near the lord of fire and his temple. </p><p>  It is worth adding to the above that most Greeks today are sure that this building was erected in honor of Theseus, who won in the complex and intricate tunnels of the terrible Minotaur.  In support of the strange version mentioned, they indicate the statue of Theseus, who competes with Hercules.  It used to be that the body of the brave hero of Theseus was buried under the building.  But the excavations carried out did not reveal any graves under him.  However, the researchers made another discovery: the modest sanctuary, which existed much earlier than the temple itself.  It is almost impossible to find out its purpose and other details, since only the remains of stone walls are left of it. </p>
