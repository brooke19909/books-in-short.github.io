The city was founded in 1382, and it was originally named <span>Sveta Stefan.</span>  Three hundred years the Turks ruled here, having seized power, later the settlement became the property of the Spaniards, and in the XVII century the Venetians included it in their lands. </p><p>  Herceg Novi was controlled by Austria-Hungary, the Russian Empire and France, in the last century it was part of Yugoslavia, and now the city belongs to the European state of Montenegro. </p><p>  The resort received the prefix Herceg after it was controlled by Duke Stepan Vuksiƒá, and when the Venetians entered the former Turkish territory, they called it Castelnuovo - New Castle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions in Herceg Novi Montenegro" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1430696.jpg" width="600"></div>

The sights of Herceg Novi left over from the Middle Ages resurrect past events.  Visitors are delighted to wander through the narrow streets that look like a maze, noting that everything here is saturated with the spirit of history. </p><p>  As the locals say, this area is the heart and soul of the beloved city, so the authorities are anxious to preserve an important object for posterity, and even the structures destroyed by time are undergoing thorough reconstruction.  Separated by the road from residential buildings, the Old Town is rich in monuments, and Herceg Stjepan Square is a favorite place for festivities of Herceg Novi residents. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Herceg Novi" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1430652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The attractions located here delight vacationers with an unusual appearance.  The majestic Orthodox Church of St. Michael the Archangel combines the features of Gothic and Romanesque architectural styles, and the attached minarets, erected in the era of the Ottoman Empire, add to the religious structure of charm.  According to tourists, the interior decoration of the bright monument of Christian architecture is striking in its special grace, and the unique iconostasis of Italian marble is the main value of the ancient temple. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interesting fountain </h2><p>  Tourists pay attention to the Karacha fountain in the form of a cone in the square, which is also called Bellavista.  The building, traditional for the Ottoman culture, is evidence of Turkish rule in Herceg Novi.  Sights (reviews of vacationers confirm this), reflect the past of the glorious city and always arouse curiosity among guests enjoying the rich history of the green resort. </p><h2>  Sugar Kula <em> </em></h2><p>  Before entering the Old Town, tourists discover a 16-meter clock tower, which currently houses the archive.  Built on the orders of the Turkish ruler in the 17th century, it connects the two squares.  The resort's visiting card is the most recognizable monument of Herceg Novi, the sights are even depicted on the emblem of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Herceg Novi Attractions" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1430660.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Sahat Kula was built so that Muslims do not miss prayer time in the mosque.  In 1995, mechanical watches controlled by heavy weights were replaced by electronic ones. </p><p>  At the bottom of the architectural monument is a beautiful bas-relief of burnt wood "Black Madonna." </p><h2>  Sea fortress </h2><p>  The city with a difficult fate is rich in <span>fortifications,</span> and the numerous attractions of Herceg Novi are proof of this.  The ruins of the Sea Fortress, towering in the old part of the Montenegrin resort, attract the attention of all tourists.  It was once a powerful defensive fortification laid down by the Bosnian king.  The new owners, who came to power, modified and expanded the Forte Mare growing from the water. </p><p>  With the development of tourist infrastructure, a fortress on a rock becomes the main monument of Herceg Novi.  Sights, reviews of which are full of words of delight, are liked not only by connoisseurs of history, but also by young people, because more than 60 years ago, local authorities built a summer cinema on the site of the fort, which hosts the main city discos and performances by popular music groups. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="herceg novi attractions reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1430666.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who visited the resort with admiration respond to the observation deck located on the highest point of the fortress, noting the stunning views that open to the city surrounded by greenery and the picturesque bay. </p><h2>  Fortress and Prison </h2><p>  The main attractions in Herceg Novi (Montenegro) are associated with the period of Turkish rule.  Kanli-Kula Fortress is a famous historical monument, the name of which translates as ‚ÄúBloody Tower‚Äù.  Built by the Ottomans at an altitude of about 90 meters above sea level, it hangs over the city.  There was a prison in the protective structure, where everyone who was against the established regime was tortured, and city guests with bated breath examine drawings and inscriptions left in stone casemates by fighters for the country's freedom. </p><p>  The entrance to Kanli-Kula for tourists was opened relatively recently - in the 60s of the last century.  Then, at the top of one of the most unusual sights of Herceg Novi, an amphitheater was built in which various festive events, shows and festivals are held.  And the newlyweds rent the building to conduct a memorable wedding ceremony in the spirit of the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  Spanola </h2><p>  Another fortress - Spanjola - is located above the city at an altitude of 170 meters, and not every tourist will get to its top.  However, such a strategically important location gave many advantages, and all the owners of the city used it.  The Ottomans who came to power in every way strengthened the territory and tried to make their defenses completely autonomous.  That is exactly what Spagnola was, named after the Spaniards, who briefly captured the fort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Herceg Novi Montenegro" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1430669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The fortress, which is a square with bastions in the corners, had everything necessary for the life of people inside.  Unfortunately, now only its ruins are opening before the eyes of travelers. </p><h2>  Savina Monastery </h2><p>  Defensive structures that give the city a formidable look are not the only monuments left over from past eras.  The Orthodox sights of Herceg Novi are popular with visitors who admit that they are shocked by the local shrines. </p><p>  Located two kilometers from the city, in a dense forest, Savin‚Äôs Monastery is named after Saint Sava.  According to scientists, the first buildings appeared in the XI century, but the main part of the architectural complex, consisting of a cell building, three churches and a cemetery, appeared much later. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="attractions of Herceg Novi" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1430689.jpg" width="480"></div>
