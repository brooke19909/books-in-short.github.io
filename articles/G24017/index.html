    <p>  <strong>Khovrinsk abandoned hospital.</strong>  <strong>History of occurrence</strong> </p><p>  As you know, all the buildings of the times of the USSR did not differ from each other in originality, but not the Khovrinsky hospital!  <span>This building</span> differs from its peers in its original design and a very unusual layout: its buildings are arranged in such a way that a geometric figure in the form of a triangular cross is obtained.  The hospital has three main wings.  They are interconnected in the center.  Its side parts form cozy courtyards in the amount of three pieces.  There are extensions. </p><p>  Since the Khovrinskaya abandoned hospital is an unfinished building, in some places it lacks interfloor partitions and ceilings, the interior walls are completely painted with graffiti, and the cellars are flooded with water.  By the way, that is why the construction was frozen!  The fact is that under the foundation of the future hospital, <span>groundwater was</span> found <span>,</span> and funding for their drainage was not allocated.  More than once they tried to resume the construction of this facility, but all in vain: the building was completely declared unfit for operation.  But why is this, so to speak, hospital so frightening people?  What is going on inside her walls? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Khovrinsk abandoned hospital.</strong>  <strong>Legends</strong> </p><p>  <em>Umbrella</em> </p><p>  Indigenous Muscovites call this place the outstanding word "Umbrella."  Personally, I never understood what this means, but now I figured it out.  The fact is that from an aerial view, the Khovrinsk abandoned hospital resembles the logo of biological danger and the secret corporation from the well-known film Resident Evil.  That is why the building was chosen by stalkers.  But is it about stalkers?  No friends!  And not even in extreme tourists! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khovrinsk Legendary Abandoned Hospital" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/273595.jpg" width="509"></div>

    <p>  <em>Legend one</em> </p><p>  For a while, members of the Nemostor sect lived in this building.  The Satanists were in an unfrozen basement, where complete darkness reigns, because there are no windows, and any exposure to sunlight is excluded!  Satanist sectarians settled down according to their activities: they built stairs, created their own sanctuary with the goal of constant rites of the black mass. </p><p>  It was during this period that quite a lot of attacks by sectarians against ordinary Muscovites were recorded.  They say that they abducted children, adolescents, homeless people and even pets!  It must be assumed that the sectarians sacrificed to their Satan, burning people and animals in a large furnace. </p><p>  When these facts became known to law enforcement agencies, they hastened to restore order in Khovrinka.  It became known that in the unfrozen cellars of the building there are as many as two Satanic churches and two ritual furnaces for the rite of sacrifice!  The OMON detachment, arriving at the scene, blew up the entrances to the cellars, which, in turn, led to the collapse of the structure and the complete flooding of the premises.  It is believed that the sectarians who were in the basement at that moment died, and their dead bodies still float in the rotten and muddy water of the Umbrella cellars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khovrinsk abandoned hospital history" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13151/273593.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <p>  <em>Second legend</em> </p><p>  After these events, the Khovrinsk abandoned hospital turned into the most favorite place of suicides, rapists and pedophiles!  Dozens of people here settle accounts with their own lives.  Even dogs and cats come here to die as they seek a secluded place.  This is a well-known fact.  Rape is committed here.  Often, young people choose this particular unfinished place of seclusion for sexual intimacy, etc. In addition, this "underperformance" has its own god named Raf.  It is believed that he is his talisman and sometimes saves people in distress. </p><p>  According to unconfirmed information, "a god named Raf" is a certain private security company that took control of this facility.  In general, we have nothing to do with you there!  Friends, I conjure you!  Do not get close to this "hospital"! </p>
