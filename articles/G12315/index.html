    <h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The hotel complex is located one kilometer from the village of Mahmutlar and 10 kilometers from the city of Alanya.  Xeno Hotel Alpina is a convenient, comfortable hotel complex that provides its guests with a good four-star guesthouse. </p><p>  It offers tourists - five of its hotel buildings, built in a line perpendicular to the coast. </p><p>  The wonderful nature makes the resort, where the hotel complex is located, attractive to millions of tourists.  Why is Alanya healing?  The map brings some clarity to this issue.  The climate in this region is classic Mediterranean, it is determined by the fresh breeze blowing from the side of the Mediterranean Sea.  The cyclones and wind formed on the continental side do not reach this resort.  They are detained by the Toros Mountains.  The local coast is also rich in comfortable bays for a beach holiday. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is also famous for its banana and orange plantations Alanya.  The map of attractions of this resort even contains objects of the Hellenistic period, not to mention the monuments of the history of our era. </p><p>  It takes an hour and a half to get to the hotel we are considering from the Antalya Airport by car. </p><p>  It was built in 1998 and was thoroughly renovated and modernized two years ago.  This is a first line hotel.  Private sand and pebble beach is located very close - at a distance of 50 meters from the territory of Xeno Hotel Alpina 4. </p><p>  The description of the hotel complex in the reviews of spa residents is colorful and, in general, objective. </p><h2>  Territory </h2>

Along the facades of the hotel's buildings there is a spacious outdoor pool with combined depth.  At the same time, two water slides are equipped in the pool.  One of them is more suitable for recreation for adults, the second - for children and people of mature age.  There are relaxation terraces around the pool.  There are rows of stylish sun loungers with umbrellas for vacationers.  There are enough of them.  Situations when a spa man wants to relax by the pool, and ‚Äúno places‚Äù are, in principle, impossible here.  There is always a free deck chair.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The open part of the main restaurant from the Xeno Hotel Alpina 4 hotel complex, designed for simultaneous service at the tables on the terrace of 300 people, also goes to the pool.  Its territory is quite compact, so it has a minimum of lawns and trees.  Mostly the area is reserved for the pool and terraces.  However, the exterior of the hotel is significantly enlivened by means of design.  Bright multi-colored facades of its buildings are combined with individual appropriately planted chic royal palm trees, with bright blue pool water.  Similar practice of not boring design of facades is practiced by architectural bureaus in Rio de Janeiro. </p><p>  Xeno Alpina Hotel <span>(Turkey, Alanya)</span> 4 also has several tennis courts. </p><p>  A private terrace leads to the beach, but pedestrians should cross the road using an underpass. </p><h2>  Recreational opportunities </h2><p>  Not the unified pools determine the recreational opportunities of the hotel field.  As part of the free, or rather, already included in the price of the tour, the service includes a daily Turkish bath (hammam).  A Finnish sauna is also available here, but it is paid.  Xeno Hotel Alpina also offers an optional course or massage for an additional fee. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alanya map" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/506874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By the way, we recommend that newcomers visit the hammam immediately and immediately book a massage.  This will help to better prepare for a beach tan, cleansing the pores and toning the body as a whole. </p><p>  The hotel complex has a well-equipped gym, trainers conduct free classes in aerobics, water aerobics. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  The room fund of the hotel complex Xeno Hotel Alpina includes 160 family two-room rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã50 m <sup>2</sup> , 42 standard rooms with a balcony with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 m <sup>2</sup> , 30 economy rooms (without a balcony) with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã25 m <sup>2</sup> .  The furniture is new, in the rooms there is an economy-style European-style repair: walls, ceiling - monochrome white;  floor - with ceramic or carpet.  The rooms are fully equipped with household appliances necessary for a good-quality guesthouse: TV, minibar, air conditioning, hairdryer.  However, there is a paid equipment in the rooms.  In particular, the Xeno Hotel Alpina provides a safe for guests on a fee basis. </p><p>  The rooms of the hotel complex are supported by the efforts of the staff order.  Cleaning is daily and thorough.  The bed is changed twice a week.  However, filling the vacationers minibar is not the responsibility of the hotel; vacationers themselves take care of this. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the beach is sandy and pebble.  Its length is quite impressive - 500 meters.  The entrance to the sea is smooth, but rocky.  Mattresses, sun loungers, umbrellas - everything is free.  Towels - paid.  On the beach from 12-00 to the evening there is a bar.  Juices, buns, local fruit drinks are free (as part of the all inclusive service). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Alanya 4" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/506872.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  Here on the beach, guests of the Xeno Hotel Alpina regularly play beach volleyball among themselves.  Despite the pleasant guaranteed free rest on the hotel‚Äôs own beach, we still recommend that vacationers at least once visit the <span>Cleopatra beach</span> in Alanya <span>,</span> famous in Turkey and in the world.  Here you will feel what a paradise is.  To get there on your own, take the MAHMUTLAR-ALANYA (CENTER) minibus in front of the hotel and drive to the market, and the famous beach is nearby.  By the way, many guests of the Xeno Hotel Alpina regularly go there.  Photos of this beach are in many tourist booklets.  So do not hesitate, go ahead!  On the way you will see a water park, which we also recommend to visit later, especially for families with children. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  According to vacationers, the main restaurant of the hotel provides a level of assortment and quality of dishes that exceed the level of 4 *.  The main dishes are prepared from chicken, turkey, liver, fish.  Beef occasionally appears on the menu.  Poultry and fish are cooked in a variety of ways, including on the grill and in pots.  Even gourmets, having tasted the grill prepared by the culinary specialists of the restaurant, shawarma and barbecue recognize that they are perfect. </p><p>  The side dishes from Xeno Hotel Alpina 4 (Turkey) for its guests include, in addition to french fries, rustic potatoes, mashed potatoes, pilaf, rice, pasta, and also many vegetable side dishes.  Delicious mashed soups.  About 15 salads are always prepared.  The assortment of dishes allows guests to eat (meaning breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner) for four days without ever repeating a single meal in their diet during this time.  We must pay tribute to the skill of the chef and the conscientious work of all staff. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="xeno hotel alpina photo" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/506873.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Quite decent for a four-star level is the choice of fruits: watermelons, apples, grapes, oranges, grapefruits.  Of alcoholic drinks - good beer and whiskey.  There is also gin, rakia and local wine.  Low-alcohol drinks of local production are most often sold on the spill of <span>hotels in Alanya.</span> </p><p>  Photos of the buffet assortment from Hotel Alpina 4 is a strong argument in his favor on the websites of various travel agencies. </p><p>  Tea and coffee are prepared by specialized vending machines.  Juices are powder.  However, it is worth saying that vacationers buy sparkling water and juices of acceptable quality. </p><p>  Generally speaking, the hotel has five bars.  Two of them we have already mentioned: by the pool and on the beach.  There is a 24-hour bar in the lobby area.  There is a paid disco bar near the dance floor for vacationers.  Here the prices are quite high.  Also during cultural events, the Dolfin Bar is located on the rooftop of the hotel complex. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Xeno Hotel Alpina is a worthy launching pad for excursionists.  A good level of four-star economy service is the base, and then vacationers will have to do creative work - choose exciting objects for themselves to visit and contemplate.  Of course, a special bonus is the proximity of the city of Alanya. </p><p>  Corakesion (as the city was called in ancient times) was a Mediterranean pirate base.  In Rome, the corsairs were defeated by Pompey, and the city itself became part of Rome.  Later, the triumvir <span>Mark Anthony</span> presented it to his wife Cleopatra.  Sounds romantic: "Alanya - a city - a gift ..." </p><p>  Tourists should not buy excursions from the guides of Xeno Hotel Alpina 4. After all, this category of hotel personnel is forced, according to official duties, to sell excursions at double prices.  It is more reasonable for excursionists to purchase excursions at specialized excursion agencies in Alanya. </p><p>  The following excursions are especially popular: Pamukkale, Mira-Kekova-Demre, Cappadocia, Dalmatash grotto, Side excavations, Geynuk canyon, Ich-Kale fortress.  Let's talk about some of them. </p><h2>  Briefly about excursions to Mira-Kekova-Demre </h2>

After all, a great man lived and preached in Demre - the canonized <span>bishop of this</span> city, known to us as Nicholas the Wonderworker.  Until our time, there is a church where he once ruled the service.  Sailing on a yacht to the island of Kekova, vacationers can see the remains of the Hellenistic city, unfortunately, half flooded by the sea after the earthquake.  In the World, the remains of the ancient agora (city center) with an amphitheater and preserved foundations and fragments of public buildings are opened to the gaze of those who have fallen.

    <h2>  Pamukkale </h2><p>  The name of this world famous natural travertine cascade of thermal baths translates as ‚Äúcotton castle‚Äù.  The reason is the pearly salt deposits on the bowls of the baths.  Moreover, in different vessels, the temperature is also different.  In this natural complex stands out a pond, known even by the ancient Romans and called them Cleopatra's Basin.  They trimmed it in marble, providing columns and porticoes.  Unfortunately, this creation was not preserved, it was also destroyed by an earthquake.  Tourists can not only contemplate Pamukkale, but also swim in the Cleopatra basin. </p><h2>  Cappadocia </h2><p>  Freakish creations of nature ... What made the rocks turn into numerous freakish conical inclined objects?  To contemplate them, hundreds of thousands of tourists a year come to Cappadocia.  Also, local residents of these places keep the original traditions of arranging their homes.  From the beginning of our era here, in the rocks, the first Christians carved their underground temples.  The fruits of their titanic labor can be seen today.  However, many modern residents of Cappadocia and now live in houses partially built, and partially carved in the rocks. </p><h2>  Grotto Dalmatash </h2>

A huge cave is located below sea level.  At the same time, a stable temperature of + 22C <sup>0 is</sup> maintained in it all year round.  It was first used as a secret hideout by corsairs.  As an excursion object, this underground cavity was discovered by chance in the middle of the last century.

    <p>  The spectacle of a stalactite cave illuminated by accent lighting is impressive. </p><h2>  Ich-Kale Fortress </h2><p>  A large sightseeing object, built on the land of the Land of the Stars and the Crescent, at a time when the state - Byzantium existed here.  That Byzantium, which once brought the Orthodox Christian faith as a gift to Russia. </p><p>  Ich-kale is well preserved.  To explore this huge stronghold, a one-day excursion is organized for excursionists. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  For shopping without intrusive guides who do not always advertise the best price / quality shops, hotel guests should go to Alanya.  The fare in a fixed-route taxi is $ 2‚Äì4.  Drive to the central market.  By the way, it is the endpoint of most routes.  What should you buy in the market?  Bed linen and towels, sportswear and jeans, suitcases and bags, souvenirs and jewelry, oriental sweets and spices.  You have to bargain here.  Do not initially expect from traders that they will immediately tell you the real price.  What you hear should be divided into two and, without hesitation, voice the entrepreneur as his price.  However, having named your price, you should buy.  East ... do you understand ... </p><p>  However, good shoes and clothes cannot be bought on the market.  If there is such a desire, then it is best for you to pay attention to shops located on Ataturk Street, as well as closer to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city port.  The format of such stores is impressive: shopping centers.  As a rule, an entire floor is reserved for a uniform type of clothing.  The clothes sold are manufactured in the factories of Bursa and Istanbul.  According to tourists, its quality is wonderful.  Such a store located in the port area, in particular, is Alanya Textil Market. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

After all, it is soundly basic services - their features.  One should not expect from a 4 * comprehensive cultural program.  Vacationers of the "four-star" themselves plan their excursion program for the duration of the tour.
