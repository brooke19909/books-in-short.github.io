It has a wonderful mild climate.  The mountains of Granada cover Torrevieja from the winds that dry up everything living in <span>the Sahara</span> African <span>desert</span> , and Central Cordilleras block access to the cold northern vortices.  Therefore, the local heat is easily tolerated by the northerners.  The average July temperature is only +25 ° C.  And in winter, the thermometer’s column rarely drops below +12 ° C.  What else is unique to Torrevieja?  On its streets you can often hear Russian speech.  Here lives the largest diaspora in Spain, consisting of many emigrants from our country.  And on the outskirts of the city grows a huge citrus plantation.  It also ranks first in Spain in terms of area and productivity.  Citrus fruits from Torrevieja fall on the table not only locals, but also diverge far beyond the borders of the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torrevieja Spain" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450769.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Torrevieja (Torrevieja) in translation from Spanish means "old tower".  Administratively, this city belongs to the Vega Baha region of the province of Alicante.  But any seasoned tourist will tell you that Torrevieja (Spain) is the most popular Costa Blanca resort.  Not far from the city, the Segura River (“safe”) flows into the Mediterranean Sea.  The resort is also popular for its many lakes.  Since these reservoirs have an underground connection with the sea, iodine-rich sodium chloride is extracted from them.  Of the ninety thousand inhabitants, a good half are immigrants from the countries of Northern Europe and Britain.  Some Russian emigrants live here more than three thousand.  Therefore, in all hotels, according to reviews, there are Russian-language channels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torrevieja Spain Airport" class="if" height="298" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450777.jpg" width="448"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the resort </h2><p>  Many independent tourists fly to Spain with low-cost flights to Barcelona, ​​and from there already by train to the city of Torrevieja (Spain).  <span>Alicante Airport</span> is located thirty-five kilometers north of the resort.  You can also fly to Murcia.  It is separated from Torrevieja for more than fifty kilometers.  Spain has excellent bus connections, which makes it easy to go to the Costa Blanca resorts from almost anywhere in the country.  Between cities it is also convenient to travel by commuter train - “sercanes”.  From Alicante airport every hour shuttle buses to Torrevieja station.  Travel time will take about forty minutes. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Most of the hotels here were built in the 70-80s of the last century, when the tourist boom began.  However, do not be afraid of dilapidated buildings and old furniture.  The hotel base is constantly updated and reconstructed.  In the resort of Torrevieja (Spain), hotels are usually located on the front page.  It can be both huge tourist complexes, and mini-hotels.  The lion's share of such hotels has two or three stars, but in terms of service they correspond to the “four” or “five” in Turkey.  But with the all-inclusive system, problems may arise: either “only breakfast” or “half board” are popular here.  There is a large selection of apartments where you can completely refuse centralized food and cook yourself (or use the many cafes and restaurants in the city).  The cost of a hotel room ranges from forty to one hundred and fifty euros per day.  Prices vary by season.  For 400 € per day you can rent an entire villa on the beach. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  With the growth of the city, the snow-white dunes did not disappear.  They just became more comfortable.  Torrevieja (Spain) boasts twenty kilometers of beautiful beaches, the lion's share of which is awarded the Blue Flag for the cleanliness of the water and coast, tourist infrastructure and amenities.  Nature itself, dividing the coast into many small bays, created protection from large waves.  But in spring and autumn, strong undercurrents begin off the coast of Torrevieja.  The fact that swimming is dangerous or generally prohibited is indicated by the flags - yellow or red.  Del Cura is convenient for those who do not want to go far for the sea and the sun.  This beach is located in the center of Torrevieja.  However, in the summer it is crowded.  South of the center is Naufragos - a great place for lovers of outdoor activities.  Along the northern outskirts of the city, Los Lokos stretches first, and then the vast La Mata.  Fans of peace and quiet, as well as those who prefer to sunbathe in costumes of Adam and Eve, will also like the resort of Torrevieja (Spain).  Reviews say that in the village of La Marina, fifteen kilometers north of the city, there is an excellent nudist beach. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torrevieja spain attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450772.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Natural attractions </h2><p>  No wonder the coast is called the Costa Blanca.  Snow-white sand is the main attraction of the resorts in this area.  It should be said that even 50-70 years ago the city was not here.  Only a sparkling sea, sand dunes covered with sparse pine trees, and a small fishing village guarded by ancient watch towers.  Rapid construction, which began in the mid-twentieth century, did not damage the ecology of this fabulous place.  Even the nesting sites of pink flamingos, which since ancient times settled on <span>salt lakes, have</span> not declined.  The government of Spain immediately declared these places a nature reserve.  However, mud baths grew along the shores of the lakes.  Not only wraps and baths in salt-saturated water are useful.  Lake Salinas de Torrevieja (Spain) is known throughout the country and is considered the local equivalent of the Israeli Dead Sea.  Powerful fumes saturate the air with salt.  Even a simple stay near Lake Salinas de Torrevieja cures asthma. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Torrevieja Spain Hotels" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/450773.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Things to Do in Torrevieja (Spain) </h2><p>  The city got its name from the towers that defended the village during the Middle Ages from pirates from the sea and from other enemies from the land.  Therefore, reviews recommend visiting them first.  A tourist train departs every half hour from the Paseo de La Libertad promenade, which will take you directly to the foot of the Moorish Tower.  From the observation deck on the top of Torre del Moro, the construction of which dates back to the XIV century, offers amazing views of the harbor.  Torre de la Mata is located away from the city center.  Many reviews are dedicated to the local church of Iglesia de la Concepcion Inmaculada.  On the square in front of the temple are all the celebrations in the city.  Museums in Torrevieja are absolutely free for visitors.  Reviews recommend visiting the exposition “Sea and Salt”, which fully reveals the history of production of this indispensable product.  Concerts are periodically held at the Palace of Music, as well as the Habaneras festival of Cuban music. </p>
