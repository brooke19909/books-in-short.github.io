Inexplicable but the fact</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Humanity has always been interested in eternal questions about how many years our civilization has existed, are we alone in the Universe and what happened before the appearance of people on Earth?  Has anyone ever wondered how to establish the age of important finds found in archaeological expeditions? </p><h2>  Conventions in dating </h2><p>  There are several methods for determining the dating of historical artifacts that have come down to us, but none of them is accurate.  And the radiocarbon method, which is considered the most faithful, has been found to determine the age only for the last two thousand years. </p><p>  Therefore, many experts argue that the dating we know is more than conditional, and scientists of the world are in a real dead end due to the inability to accurately establish a clear chronology of human development.  It is possible that historical facts known to all will have to be re-examined, rewriting many chapters of civilization that seem unshakable truths. </p><h2>  Ignoring evidence ruining the theory of human evolution </h2><p>  Modern scientists set the boundaries of the evolution of mankind in the last few millennia, and before that, according to authoritative researchers, there was a <span>Stone Age,</span> which lasted an indefinite amount of time. </p><p>  Surprisingly, science ignores recorded archaeological artifacts that do not fit into the history of the development of life on Earth, helping to skeptically look at the established theory of the reckoning. </p><p>  Let's talk about the amazing finds found in various parts of our planet, causing shock not only among the layman, but also famous researchers who do not want to take them into account as not fitting into the established framework. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Man-made products embedded in rocks </h2><p>  Some of the most famous finds are items made by human hands, which turned out to be walled up in a stone monolith, whose age is several million years.  For example, strange artifacts were found in limestone and coal quarries at the end of the 19th century. </p><p>  Then a small note appeared in the American press about a gold chain found literally soldered into the rock.  According to the most conservative assumptions of scientists, the age of the block exceeded 250 million years.  And in a scientific journal, an article about a very strange find was almost unnoticed - two halves of a vessel like a modern vase, decorated with flowers, were found after an explosion in a quarry.  Geologists who carefully studied the rock in which the mysterious object was located, established that it is about 600 million years old. </p><p>  Unfortunately, such unusual artifacts are hushed up by scientists, because they jeopardize the theory of the origin of a person who could not live at that time.  Discovered objects that violate the generally accepted truths about evolution are much easier to ignore than to try to explain them scientifically. </p><h2>  Chandar Plate </h2><p>  Unique artifacts appear quite often, but they are not always known to a wide circle of people.  One of the last sensations that surprised all scientists was a huge stone slab found in Bashkiria, called Chandarskaya, on the surface of which a map of the area is reliefly printed.  There is no image of modern roads on it, but instead of them, incomprehensible sites, later recognized by airfields, are carved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="strange finds" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1207922.jpg" width="354"></div>

In any case, a relief explanation of how the block, whose age is estimated at 50 million years, appeared relief outline of a map of the area, from scientists have not received. </p><h2>  Denial of highly developed civilization </h2><p>  Skeptics fiercely argued with the defending version of the aliens by a scientific brethren, explaining all the strange finds with one single hypothesis - the existence of a highly developed civilization that died as a result of some kind of catastrophe, but left a real reminder of itself to posterity.  True, modern science rigidly denies such assumptions, breaking the scope of the alleged evolution of man, declaring such artifacts as fakes or referring to their manufacture by extraterrestrial civilizations. </p><p>  On this occasion, physicist and researcher V. Shemshuk evenly spoke out, confronting modern science: ‚ÄúMany finds - historical artifacts that confirm the existence of ancient civilizations, are declared hoaxes or relate to the activities of alien beings.‚Äù </p><h2>  Strange underground passages </h2><p>  Archaeologists from around the world have accumulated enough material that does not fit well with the concept of the development of life on Earth.  Expeditions are known in Ecuador and Peru, which discovered an ancient multi-kilometer maze deep underground. </p><p>  Research by archaeologists was recognized as a real sensation, but at present access to the anomalous territory is prohibited by local authorities who do not want to share the most secret with the whole world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Secrets of a labyrinth laid according to highly developed technologies </h2><p>  The leaders of the group believe that they are faced with a real <span>mystery, the secret of</span> which has not been solved to this day.  Having gone through a huge network of <span>underground passages,</span> scientists discovered a huge hall in which were made of real gold statues of animals, including dinosaurs.  In a huge cave resembling a library, ancient manuscripts were kept with the thinnest sheets of metal, on which unknown letters were knocked out.  In the center of the far hall sat a strange figure with a helmet pulled over his eyes, and an unusual capsule with holes in it, resembling a dialed telephone dial, hung on its neck. </p><p>  It should be noted that no reliable evidence exists, except for the descriptions of archaeologists, and the expedition leaders refused to give the exact location of the labyrinth, worrying about its safety. </p><h2>  Unknown origin of the underground labyrinth </h2><p>  After such unusual confessions about the existence of an amazing underground world, other groups traveled to the area, but only Polish scientists managed to find it and get into the strange maze.  Several boxes with exhibits were taken out, but gold sculptures and books written in a language unknown to science were not found in the spacious underground halls. </p><p>  However, the main result of all underground research was the confirmation of the existence of a multi-kilometer maze, laid with the help of high technologies, which could not be applied several millennia ago.  Inexplicably, but a fact: no one can shed light on the origin of the underground passages, access to which is now closed. </p><h2>  The official "reference" of the development of civilization is in question </h2><p>  Few people know about the existence of "forbidden" archeology, the founder of which is M. Cremo.  The American anthropologist and researcher officially announced that, on the basis of the data available to him, civilization was born much earlier than official science says. </p><p>  He mentions an <span>unusual finding of</span> geologists during excavations in the Urals, which does not fit into the standard concepts of evolution.  Inexplicable artifacts were found at a depth of about 12 meters in soil layers, whose age is set in the range from 20 to 100 thousand years.  Miniature strange spirals with a size not exceeding three millimeters were found in the untouched layers of soil, which was immediately recorded by the geological leadership in order to avoid further talking about falsification of objects. </p><h2>  Amazing composition of spirals </h2><p>  Ancient artifacts surprised with its composition: the spirals were made of copper, tungsten and molybdenum.  The latter is used today to harden steel products, and its melting point is about 2600 degrees. </p><p>  A logical question arises as to how our ancestors were able to process the smallest details made during mass production, because they did not have the corresponding special equipment.  Many scientists are inclined to believe that even today, with the use of high technology, it is unrealistic to put the production of millimeter spirals on stream. </p>

    <p>  At the first glance at small details, an association with nanoparticles used in microequipment arises, and some of the developments of our scientists of this kind have not even been completed.  It turns out that archaeological artifacts that do not fit into the history of the development of mankind are made in production, whose technical level is an order of magnitude higher than modern. </p><h2>  Was there a super civilization? </h2><p>  The findings were dealt with by many researchers who admitted that tungsten cannot independently take a spiral shape, and we are talking here about molecular technologies that could not be used by our ancestors. </p><p>  There is only one answer - the excavation of archaeologists once again stirred up talk that there was a super civilization with powerful knowledge and high technology before us. </p><p>  They do not write about these findings in the newspapers, and few people know about the research of scientists.  However, the ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù archeology has plenty of evidence confirming that in prehistoric times supermen (or aliens) lived on our planet, and the age of mankind is ten times older than it is considered today. </p><h2>  Elongated skulls </h2><p>  World science is afraid of sensations that will call into question the immutable truths about the stages of evolution, trying to hush up inexplicable artifacts.  However, some of them, such as elongated skulls, are becoming known. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unusual artifacts" class="if" height="190" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1207917.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In Antarctica, archaeologists have discovered human remains that have become a real surprise in the scientific world.  On a continent that was considered unpopulated before the modern era, strange elongated skulls have been found that turn over views on the history of mankind.  Most likely, they belonged to a mysterious group of people who differed in physical parameters from ordinary representatives of the race. </p><p>  Earlier, the same skulls were found in Egypt and Peru, which confirms the version of the contact between civilizations. </p><h2>  Shigir idol </h2><p>  At the end of the 19th century, near Yekaterinburg, an amazing archaeological monument was discovered, made, according to scientists, in the Mesolithic era.  <span>The Shigir idol,</span> as scientists called it, has no analogues in the whole world.  The oldest wooden sculpture is well preserved due to the fact that it was in a peat bog that protected it from decay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unique artifacts" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1207912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The idol, covered with obscure geometric ornaments, does not reveal the secrets of archeology, on the contrary, with its appearance new questions arise.  Seven figure shapes carved in wood are also found in other ancient cultures.  No one will answer for what purpose this idol served and what knowledge he possesses for posterity.  It is strange that civilizations that existed in different eras and on different continents have the same symbols and signs that our ancestors wanted to share.  But what information they carry - scientists are powerless to decipher. </p><h2>  Guatemala Ancient Artifacts </h2><p>  <span>Researchers in South America</span> found a gigantic human head with delicate facial features and eyes directed to the sky.  The appearance of the monument, similar to a white man, was strikingly different from the representatives of pre-Hispanic civilization. </p><p>  It is believed that the head had a torso, but it is impossible to find out anything anymore, since the statue was used during the revolution as a target for shooting, and all the features were destroyed.  The sculpture is not a fake, but questions about who created it and why, remain unanswered for a long time. </p><h2>  A disk whose images can only be viewed under a microscope </h2><p>  In Colombia, a disc made of durable material was discovered, the surface of which shocked all researchers.  It was applied to all stages of the emergence and appearance of man.  Inexplicably, but a fact: images of processes are drawn with jewelry accuracy, they can only be viewed under a microscope.  The ‚Äúgenetic‚Äù disk is at least six thousand years old, and it is unclear how such a relief was applied without the corresponding devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting artifacts" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1207903.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Strange looking human heads are different from ordinary images, and researchers wonder what kind of people these are.  Archaeological artifacts that do not fit into history raise many questions.  It is already clear that our ancestors, the authors of this disc, possessed perfect knowledge, as evidenced by the application of microscopic drawings. </p><h2>  Unusual wing shape </h2><p>  Colombia is rich in amazing archaeological finds, and one of them, the most famous, was an airplane made of real gold.  His age is about a thousand years.  Surprisingly, the wing shape of a strange object is not found in nature in birds.  It is not known where our ancestors took the special structure of the aircraft, which seemed very unusual to contemporaries. </p><p>  Interesting artifacts stored in Colombian museums interested American designers who created the famous supersonic aircraft with the same deltoid wing as the find. </p><h2>  Iki Province Stones </h2><p>  The drawings on the boulders found in the province of Peru contradict the theory of the origin of mankind.  It was not possible to determine their age, but the first mention of them was known back in the 15th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="historical artifacts" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1207901.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But who could have a gun with gunpowder, which was invented much later? More than 35 thousand years ago? </p><h2>  Version by M. Cremo, who spoke about the ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù archeology </h2><p>  All such <span>archaeological finds</span> do not fit into Darwin's harmonious theory of evolution.  The same <span>Michael Cremo</span> in his book provides convincing evidence that destroys modern ideas about the age of mankind.  For more than eight years, the researcher has been discovering unique artifacts, making his stunning conclusions. </p><p>  In his opinion, all the findings indicate that the first civilizations originated about six million years ago and there were creatures similar to humans on Earth.  However, scientists are silent about all artifacts that contradict the official version. </p><p>  It is claimed that a man appeared one hundred thousand years ago, and not before.  ‚ÄúOnly when convincing data is presented to me, how did the structure of monkey DNA change so that people eventually appear, I will believe Darwin.  But so far no scientist has done this, ‚Äùsaid the American archaeologist. </p><p>  There is enough evidence in the world to confirm the existence of highly developed civilizations before the advent of modern man.  While these artifacts are carefully hidden, but I want to believe that soon the "forbidden" knowledge will be revealed to everyone and the true history of mankind will cease to be secret. </p>
