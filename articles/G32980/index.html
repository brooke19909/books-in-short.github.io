    <h2>  Samsung SM-G920F Galaxy S6 </h2><p>  To begin with, the best smartphone in the world is one that will differ in its capabilities, quality and price.  Of course, in accordance with your personal preferences.  So you have to try very hard to make a choice.  But if the price is not as important as the features offered, then you can pay attention to <span>the Samsung Galaxy</span> Es-6 <span>model</span> . </p><p>  Samsung is a worthy manufacturer.  And he offers mostly the best smartphones.  True, an amateur.  The proposed model will cost approximately 20-25 thousand rubles.  And at the same time she will please you with her abilities. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For example, the diagonal is 5.1 inches, which is perfect even for games and Internet surfing.  Built-in memory - 32 GB, there is the possibility of additional connection of the card up to 128 GB.  RAM is 3 GB, and the processor - on 8 cores with a clock frequency of 2.1 GHz.  This is perhaps the most powerful model you can imagine.  The best smartphone in all respects is the Samsung SM-G920F Galaxy S6.  He has two cameras, like most modern phones, two - front (5 megapixels) and rear (16 megapixels).  The case is aluminum, which protects against damage.  But stopping only on one model of smartphone is not worth it.  In the modern world there are many alternatives. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Z2 </h2><p>  For example, you should pay attention to Sony products.  Today they are very popular among young people.  Which smartphone is the best?  Of course, it's up to you.  But if you do not really like the Samsung Galaxy Es-6, then you should look at a more budget option - Sony Xperia Z2. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="which smartphone is the best" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967090.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The screen of this phone is slightly larger - 5.2 inches.  Suitable for books, internet and games.  In addition, the display is protected by a special water-repellent glass.  So you can use your smartphone even in rainy weather.  This is sometimes very helpful. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  RAM is 3 GB, and there is enough free space - 16 GB.  There is also the ability to connect a special memory card up to 64 gigabytes.  For many advanced users, this is more than enough.  The processor is also quite powerful - 4 cores at 2.3 GHz.  But the <span>front camera is</span> inferior to Samsung.  It is 2.2 megapixels.  But the rear camera is better - 20.7 megapixels.  Quite decent performance.  Such a model is, of course, cheaper - about 18,000 rubles.  Probably, all the best smartphones will have similar characteristics with the options already offered to us.  Just not always.  After all, the modern technology market is so diverse!  Therefore, you will have to work hard to find there a more budget, but no less powerful phone. </p><h2>  LG H818P </h2><p>  Further in our ranking appears a little non-standard manufacturer.  This is LG.  These phones are usually really good.  But it‚Äôs hard to call them the best.  Although there are exceptions.  For example, as in our case.  LG H818P is a very good option for fans of this manufacturer.  If you are initially not particularly prone to LG products, then you can ignore the proposed phone. </p><p>  This model is not so cheap - about 38,000 rubles.  The fact is that this is perhaps the best secure smartphone in the world.  After all, it is trimmed with genuine leather.  Probably for this reason, the model is so expensive.  In general, it differs little from a modern smartphone.  RAM is 3 GB, normal - 32 GB.  In addition, there is the ability to connect cards up to 128 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best smartphone in all respects" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/967091.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But the cameras in the LG H818P are encouraging.  There are two of them, as in many models - front and rear.  The first offers a quality of 8 megapixels, the second - in 16 megapixels.  Very good performance, especially when you consider the presence of a face and smile recognizer.  The processor in the phone is 6-core, with a clock frequency of 1.8 GHz.  Typically, this model is perfect for both study and entertainment.  Plus, with it, you can be calm for the performance of the gadget.  It‚Äôs hard to break it.  True, sometimes after several years of operation it is necessary to take the phone for repair.  Usually there are system problems related to updates, or damage to the touch screen.  But if you follow the operating rules, you can reduce the risk of malfunctions.  LG H818P pleases that it is well protected.  Of course, you can break the model.  But you have to try very hard. </p><h2>  Samsung N910C Galaxy Note 4 </h2><p>  The <span>best smartphones,</span> frankly, are not much different from each other.  Therefore, if you do not particularly like the already proposed models, then it is quite possible to turn to the Samsung N910C Galaxy Note 4. This is quite a decent phone from Samsung.  Yes, and it costs a little cheaper than the Galaxy Es-6.  It will cost about 20,000 rubles.  In doing so, you will get good opportunities. </p><p>  Some even claim that the Samsung N910C Galaxy Note 4 is the best smartphone in the world.  It is not very expensive, but extremely functional.  One cannot disagree with this opinion.  After all, for a small fee you will receive a well-protected smartphone that will delight you with work for a long time.  The Android-based operating system is easily updated, a processor with 8 cores of 1.9 GHz each, more than enough RAM - 3 GB. </p><p>  With the built-in memory, too, everything is in perfect order - 32 GB.  Of these, approximately 2 are occupied by the operating system and telephone resources.  But if 30 GB is not enough for you, then you can always insert an additional microSD memory card into the Samsung N910C Galaxy Note 4.  True, there is a slight limitation - the volume should not exceed 128 GB.  Perhaps, while this is the maximum figure. </p><p>  The cameras are also worthy of attention.  There are two of them, as in many phones.  The rear has a flash, autofocus, face and smile recognition, and 16 megapixel quality.  But the front camera is slightly inferior in terms of these indicators - 3.2 megapixels.  But the pictures are still obtained quality.  The Samsung N910C Galaxy Note 4 is in active use for approximately 3 days.  Enough to constantly have fun with this gadget, as well as always stay in touch.  With this model, you can even use a modern 4G network. </p><h2>  HTC One M9 </h2><p>  We repeat: the best smartphones in their capabilities are often similar.  Only among them are there some differences.  Minor, but sometimes very important.  If you need a really high-quality phone that will last a long time, then pay attention to the HTC One M9. </p>

    <p>  Like most analogs, this model has standard characteristics - a powerful processor (in our case, very powerful - 8 cores at 2 GHz), good RAM - 3 GB, ordinary memory here is also enough - 32 gigabytes.  True, the operating system in this model is perhaps different.  It is also based on Android, only its version is 5.0.  At the moment, it is considered the very last.  Previous models had versions from 4.1 to 4.4.  But updating the operating system on the phone today is not such a problem. </p><p>  The camera on HTC One M9 is perhaps the most pleasing - the front camera shoots with 4 megapixel quality (for comparison: webcams on average offer from 2 to 3 megapixels), and the rear - 20 megapixels.  At the same time, you get a great opportunity to shoot in Full HD video format.  Your videos and pictures will be simply amazing quality.  Especially if you use autofocus or flash. </p><p>  This model works for a long time.  Standby time is about 2 months, and with active use - 4 days.  True, the dimensions of the HTC One M9 are not suitable for everyone.  This smartphone is good, but it is also bulky.  Rather, it can be categorized as "the best smartphone models for men."  HTC One M9 is hardly suitable for a female hand.  Although if you really want to, it‚Äôs worth a try. </p><h2>  Samsung G900F Galaxy S5 </h2><p>  And we continue to make our rating of the best smartphones.  As already mentioned, here Samsung is showing itself quite worthy.  So you can buy the Samsung G900F Galaxy S5.  Design, style, quality and features are what make this model special. </p><p>  On average, the price of this smartphone is about 20,000 rubles.  Sometimes you can find the Samsung G900F Galaxy S5 even for 15 thousand.  Compared to many peers, this is a very good price tag. </p>

    <p>  As in most cases, the RAM of this phone is 2 GB, and the built-in memory is 16 GB.  The processor is 4 cores with a clock frequency of 1.9 GHz.  Many will say that this is not such a good option.  For lovers of the last word of technology, this is indeed so.  But the average buyer would prefer such a model for 15-20 thousand, than the more ‚Äúcool‚Äù, but 3-4 times more expensive.  Especially if there are problems with the budget. </p><p>  Which smartphone is the best for shooting?  The Samsung G900F Galaxy S5 is a great option.  True, the rear camera here let us down a little - it is only 2 megapixels.  But the rear takes beautiful pictures with its 16 megapixels.  There is autofocus and flash.  Sometimes these features are extremely useful. </p><p>  The communication quality of the Samsung G900F Galaxy S5 is only pleasing.  However, if you are counting on the active use of the 4G network, you will have to choose another phone.  There is no such possibility in this.  But 3G works no worse. </p><p>  What about quality in general?  It pleases.  Especially at the screen.  It is protected by a special glass from scratches, drops and moisture.  But the side panels are not very high quality.  If you fall onto the asphalt from a great height, cracks will most likely appear.  So with this model you have to be very careful. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Z3 </h2><p>  If you still have not seen anything that might interest you, then you can search for Sony Xperia Z3.  You should not expect anything special from this model - it, like all the previous ones, simply takes its rightful place among modern phones. </p><p>  The screen size is 5.2 inches, the operating system is Android 4.4, and the processor is 4-core at 2.5 GHz.  True, there is a 4G network.  The Sony Xperia Z3 is the latest generation phone.  And it costs from 30,000 rubles.  There is not much RAM - 3 GB, built-in 16. If there is not enough space, then you can insert a special MicroSD card up to 128 gigabytes.  The front camera, however, is weak - 2.2 megapixels.  But the rear is decent - 20 megapixels.  There is the possibility of shooting in Full HD. </p><p>  The case of the Sony Xperia Z3 is durable and high quality.  It is well protected from falls and other damage.  So with this smartphone you can even engage in active sports.  If you fall from a great height, the model is unlikely to be damaged. </p>

    <h2>  Nokia 5800 </h2><p>  Perhaps the best budget smartphone of the last generation is the <span>Nokia 5800.</span> This model still pleases many with its quality.  But to buy it is quite difficult - Nokia 5800 ExpressMusic has been withdrawn from sale.  If you manage to find such a phone, then you will not regret it. </p><p>  In truth, this option is more suitable for work and study than for games.  The old Symbian operating system does not allow launching the latest innovations in the gaming mobile industry.  And the memory here is not enough for a modern phone - 8 GB.  RAM - only 1 GB.  Not so much as it might seem at first glance.  But if you need a phone mainly for work (+ internet), then you should pay your attention to the Nokia 5800.  Such a model will cost approximately 8-9 thousand rubles.  Sometimes cheaper.  This phone attracts attention with its quality - no matter how you hit it on the asphalt, the panel and the system will still remain safe and sound.  Yes, you can break the device.  Just have to try pretty hard for this. </p><h2>  Apple iPhone 6 </h2><p>  The best smartphones are often expensive.  Often you have to overpay for a brand.  Many pay attention to a big name.  Therefore, among the best phones of the new generation, you can find the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 6. </p><p>  This smartphone is not much different from its "non-brand" counterparts.  In many cases, even inferior to them.  For example, the front camera is 1.2 megapixels, the rear camera is 8 megapixels, the memory on the phone is only 16 GB.  RAM - 2 GB.  Such a phone works in active mode for about 2 days.  And it costs about 40-50 thousand rubles.  In practice, it is clear that the "iPhones" often break.  If the brand is important to you, not the quality, then you can buy the <span>Apple iPhone</span> 6. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy 4S Lite </h2><p>  It is also worth paying for a product such as the Samsung Galaxy 4S Lite.  This is perhaps the best budget option you can imagine.  Such a model will cost about 5,000 rubles, but it will last you a long time. </p>

    <p>  There is not a lot of RAM here - only 1 GB, and the built-in memory is 16. A 1.5 GHz processor with 4 cores.  In principle, for work and study is enough.  Only here the quality of the device allows you to run on it the latest games of the mobile industry.  The Android-based operating system is easily updated to the latest version without consequences for the phone.  The screen is well protected from moisture and scratches.  True, it is better to save Samsung Galaxy 4S Lite from crashes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Today we have studied the top best smartphones that the modern market of goods and services can offer.  In general, this list can be continued for a very long time.  But, as you can see, the characteristics of all models are similar. </p><p>  What kind of smartphone to choose?  It all depends on your preferences.  Perhaps it is best to look at the models of Nokia or Samsung firms.  These two manufacturers most often produce affordable and high-quality gadgets.  Which smartphone is the best?  This you must decide for yourself. </p>
