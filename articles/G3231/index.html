The interest rate is set individually, most often it is 5-6% per month of the loan amount.  Naturally, it is more profitable to lend to such large amounts in classic banks, but not all citizens can apply there because of a previously damaged credit history. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From time to time, the financial organization has a promotion “First loan without interest”.  Then the amount of up to 10 thousand rubles can be borrowed for up to 7 days, while the client does not pay anything for using the money. </p><h2>  Borrower Requirements </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.mymillennialguide.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money instantly customer reviews" class="if uuid-3080704" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3080704.jpg"></div><p>  The company understands that people with an impeccable financial reputation are applying for loans to classic banks, therefore they deliberately do not overestimate the requirements for their customers: </p><ol><li>  The borrower must be a capable citizen of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  Permanent registration in the region where the microfinance company is present. </li><li>  Age from 18 years. </li><li>  The absence of the client’s participation in court cases, which he did not report to the creditor, and which pose a danger to the client’s property. </li><li>  Lack of open arrears in other financial institutions. </li><li>  The borrower may not have more than one current agreement in the company “Money in an instant.” </li><li>  A citizen must have full ownership of the property, which is indicated as collateral for the appropriate loan. </li></ol><h2>  Applying for a loan </h2><p>  You can apply for a loan in two ways at Money in an Instant.  Customer reviews call the more convenient option for submitting profiles via the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="online application" class="if uuid-3080700" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3080700.jpg"></div><p>  To start the procedure, you should create a personal account on the site, where you need to specify the following information: </p><ul><li>  FULL NAME; </li><li>  passport data; </li><li>  place of work; </li><li>  salary amount; </li><li>  marital status; </li><li>  the presence / absence of dependents; </li><li>  TIN; </li><li>  presence of obligations to other credit institutions; </li><li>  card / account details if necessary. </li></ul><p>  After indicating all the information, the user selects the desired amount and period of use, sends a request using the "Checkout" button.  To confirm the identity, a code will be sent to the specified phone number in SMS, it must be entered in the designated window. </p><p>  If a person applies for money to this IFC for the first time, on the Internet he can receive only preliminary approval.  For a final verdict, he needs to pay a visit to the company’s office, submit documents and sign an agreement.  If the client wishes, he will receive the money in a bank account or a plastic card. </p><p>  For all subsequent loans, after the first payment, the borrower can apply online and receive money in the same way, without leaving home. </p><p>  If the application is filed in a stationary office, the client will need to fill out the same application form with a loan officer, presenting the requested package of documents. </p><h2>  Documents </h2><p>  Microcredit is different in that the lender does not request a lot of documents, including an income statement is not required.  But in most cases, it is precisely getting it that is a problem for many people who want to get a loan, but who are not officially employed. </p><p>  According to reviews of “Money in an instant,” it is known that the company asks for documents and copies of the passport, TIN, as well as a certificate with the details from the bank where the client has an account or deposit. </p><p>  The lender, in its sole discretion, may request additional documents: </p><ul><li>  Certificate of pensioner status. </li><li>  Driver's license. </li><li>  Pension certificate of SNILS. </li></ul><p>  People wishing to obtain a mortgage loan will also need property documents. </p><h2>  Arrears Actions </h2><p>  Citizens are afraid of microloans because of high interest rates, but this feature is a necessity for MFIs.  Thus, the company balances its risks.  By lending finance without a thorough banking check, the lender often has bad unpaid debts. </p><p>  According to the feedback of debtors in “Money in an instant”, many of them turned to the organization with the firm intention not to give back the borrowed funds.  It turns out that bona fide borrowers are forced to pay for negligent customers. </p><p>  Since January 2017, the Central Bank decided that interest on an unpaid loan cannot increase by more than 3 times.  Thus, the maximum total amount of debt can consist of a loan body and interest in three times. </p><p>  Usually, any lender tries to get his money back on a voluntary basis.  Then the representatives of the lender come in contact with the debtor through telephone conversations, mail, text and personal meetings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money instantly reviews of workers" class="if uuid-3080721" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3080721.jpg"></div><p>  When this does not bring any results, the creditor, regarding the situation as a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, has the right to go to court or transfer the right of claim to third parties. </p><p>  If it is impossible to pay off the loan and extend it, it is not recommended to hide from the creditor, in the interests of both parties to resolve this situation peacefully.  You should contact the company and explain the situation.  If the reason is good, “Money in an instant” will suggest restructuring. </p><h2>  Reviews about work in “Money in an instant” </h2><p>  Among the features of work in microfinance organizations, the optional presence of an economic education stands out.  And in most federal banks, this is a standard requirement for the applicant.  The management is ready to independently conduct training for employees “Money in an instant.”  Staff feedback on ongoing corporate events and training is proof of this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glassdoor.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Management conducts trainings." class="if uuid-3080747" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3080747.jpg"></div><p>  There are also such advantages of official work as timely wages, paid leave and sick leave, convenient jobs and career opportunities. </p><p>  If we talk about the shortcomings of work, then this is the implementation of the plan.  When the department did not cope with it, the premium is not paid in full.  Among the employees' comments about “Money in an instant” one can often hear about the system of fines, which was developed directly by the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.salary.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="money instantly work reviews" class="if uuid-3080738" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/81634/3080738.jpg"></div><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  At the beginning of 2018, there were 2271 microfinance organizations in Russia.  Despite the diversity, the company “Money in an instant” stands out from its competitors.  Regular customers note the transparent terms of the contracts, as well as the absence of hidden fees and penalties.  The organization is always ready to offer a borrower who finds himself in a difficult situation, restructuring the loan. </p><p>  Among the advantages of the lender, customers also highlight the opportunity to get a large loan for a long term even with a bad credit history.
