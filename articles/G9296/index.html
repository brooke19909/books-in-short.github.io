Land lease from the city administration: necessary documents</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Currently, more than 60% of real estate is owned by municipalities (city, region, district).  This means that the administration is actually a monopolist in the market for land and real estate.  Given this fact, it makes sense to learn how to rent land from the city administration. </p><h2>  Is it possible to rent a municipal plot </h2><p>  If you pay attention to the legislation that is currently in force, you can find out the following fact: both legal entities and individuals have the right to lease land from the state and municipal institutions.  The exception is those sites that are used for state and urban needs.  In other cases, <span>renting land</span> from the city administration is more than realistic.  The main thing is to correctly choose a site and provide the whole package of documents. </p>

    <p>  The task is also facilitated by the fact that in connection with the crisis, many municipal premises are vacated. </p><h2>  Who and how much can rent a plot? </h2><p>  The possibility of renting is provided to both ordinary citizens and various organizations.  Land can be transferred without any problems for the period specified in the contract with a specific individual or legal entity.  It is important to take into account the fact that land is leased from the city administration according to a specific purpose.  This should be understood as follows: if the site was originally planned to be used for construction work and this goal was documented, then for other purposes it will not work to use the land received. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Site selection </h2><p>  Understanding how to rent land from the city administration, you first need to pay attention to the process of choosing a site.  Initially, it is important to correctly evaluate all relevant options within the city.  At the same time, it is necessary to study the infrastructure: the presence of kindergartens, trade institutions, entertainment complexes, schools, financial organizations and, of course, the transport network. </p>

    <p>  In addition, it is worth making sure that all types of communications are connected to the selected site. </p><p>  As for the financial side of the issue, any land that is in municipal ownership can be leased only on a fee basis.  An important point is that the legislation does not provide for reasons why the city administration may refuse to rent if the site is free and all the necessary documents are provided. </p><p>  But thinking about how to rent land from the administration, <strong> </strong>  you need to understand that <strong> </strong>  if the site is reserved for state and city needs or withdrawn from circulation, they will not be able to give it. </p><p>  At the same time, it is possible to obtain a priority right to lease land if a real estate property located on the site is owned by an individual or legal entity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What techniques can be used in the process of selecting a site? </h2><p>  Those who are interested in renting land from the city administration, can achieve several goals in order to achieve their goal.  The first and most logical is to go directly to the administration itself, which has municipal land at its disposal.  If we take the capital as an example, then the district councils are engaged in such issues.  In the case of filing an application with such state bodies in response, you can get options for those territories that can be rented. </p>

    <p>  You can start searching for suitable land on your own.  To do this, you need a printed map of the area with a scale of 1: 500.  Those who are close to the Internet, it makes sense to pay attention to the cadastral map of the area, which can be found on the website of Rosreestr.  To search on this resource, you need to select the "Map Management" section and find the item on cadastral division and land plots in it.  As a result, a scheme opens, on which it will be possible to find territories registered.  Considering that the purpose of the search is to lease land from the city administration, <strong> </strong>  pay attention to <strong> </strong>  those sections of the map that do not have a square with the cadastral number. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After a specific site is selected, it is necessary to calculate its area and contact the administration with accurate data. </p><p>  Understanding how to rent land from the city administration, it is important to pay attention to the possibility of open bidding.  In each village there is at least one popular auction, which offers the possibility of renting various sites.  Such lands are not encumbered and are already registered with the cadastre. </p><h2>  What can I rent from the administration? </h2><p>  Given that state institutions dealing with land issues have the right to own more than half of the plots and objects in the city, there are plenty to choose from.  You can rent not only land, but also a room for an office, office building, residential and office space. </p>

    <p>  The benefits of renting municipal property are obvious: </p><p>  - the scheme for the provision of land ownership can be described as relatively transparent; </p><p>  - The prices that are offered to a potential tenant are much more attractive than in the case of private traders; </p><p>  - there remains the possibility of a subsequent repurchase, and on preferential terms; </p><p>  - Municipal facilities are concentrated in areas with developed infrastructure. </p><h2>  Determining the status of the site </h2><p>  Before renting land from the city, you must make sure that it is free.  To do this, an application must be submitted to the authorized body, to which the exact data will be attached: the area, its location and a map with the marked area. </p>

    <p>  Next, you need to wait until officials check the land for existing leases and property rights.  If as a result of the audit it was found that the owner of a certain plot does not have and no one rents it, then the application for the right to use can be approved. </p><p>  But it will be possible to use the site in accordance with the general plan of the area, the rules of development and operation.  At the same time, representatives of the administration should inform the tenant regarding the regulations, the territorial zoning scheme and the intended purpose of the areas. </p><h2>  The scheme for obtaining the site </h2><p>  The key information under the topic "How to rent land from the city" is the algorithm for obtaining the site. </p><p>  Before you make a lease, you need to decide how it will be used.  It is this fact that determines the features of actions regarding the registration of a lease.  If the land is acquired, for example, for the construction of a building object, then you can use two methods to obtain the territory: with the approval of the location of the building or without it. </p><p>  - When a method with coordination is chosen, the tenant can choose land through the executive body or independently.  This is followed by the submission of an application, carrying out a cadastral assessment of the site, entering it into the register and receiving a resolution of the commission on the lease of land.  The final action is the <span>conclusion of the contract.</span>  If, in the opinion of the tenant, the refusal was unfounded, then he has the right to appeal it in court. </p><p>  - When the procedure is used without approval, the site is selected and purchased at open bidding.  In this case, the tenant will be able to obtain land for use if he offers the most relevant amount. </p><p>  In the event that the purpose of the lease is not related to construction work, the first scheme is used.  That is, an application is submitted with accurate data regarding the site.  But in this case, an individual or legal entity, if necessary, will have to independently cover the costs associated with the registration of the site cadastral records. </p>

    <p>  If the question is: ‚ÄúIs it possible to rent land from the administration with subsequent redemption or not?‚Äù, Then the answer will be positive.  The specifics of this <span>type of lease</span> must be obtained from a specific municipal authority.  At the same time, such a lease is theoretically possible, according to which all payments will be considered as payment of the cost of the site.  Thus, when the lease expires, land can be acquired minus the amount paid. </p><h2>  Registration of a site </h2><p>  If the land was received without bidding, then the tenant is engaged in the process of land surveying and he puts the land on cadastral registration.  You will also have to write a land survey application to the land committee.  This procedure is necessary for entering the territory into the Federal Register.  As a result, the site will be inspected by a <span>cadastral engineer</span> who will make <span>topographic surveys,</span> measure the land and issue technical documentation.  These papers will be needed for a visit to the Office for Unified Registration of Land, where the plot will be entered into the database.  As a result, the tenant receives a copy of the land plan and an extract from the cadastral passport. </p><p>  One more question is relevant: ‚ÄúWhen land is leased from the city administration, do I need an invoice?‚Äù  The answer to it will be simple - yes, I need it.  It must be done in one copy and at the same time remember the mark ‚Äúwithout VAT tax‚Äù. </p><h2>  Lease contract </h2><p>  If you had to purchase a plot at the auction, you must draw up an agreement giving the right to lease.  It is compiled by the local administration and registered if its duration exceeds a year.  As for the lease term, it is determined by the lessor.  It is worthwhile to know that state land can be leased for a maximum of 49 years. </p>
