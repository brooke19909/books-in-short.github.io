  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Empirical Sociology in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  During the 20th century, Western sociology is marked by significant evolution, therefore, it is currently a complex system of concepts, ideas, methods and theories.  Empirical sociology refers to the significant concepts of 20th century sociology along with the theory of social conflict, <span>structural and functional analysis,</span> sociometry, the theory of symbolic interactionism, the concept of social exchange, and phenomenological sociology. </p><p>  Empirical sociology includes 2 main areas: </p><p>  - Applied empirical research in sociology, their tasks include conducting research that is aimed at solving practical, clearly defined problems. </p><p>  - Academic empirical research in sociology, their tasks include the formation of systems of scientific knowledge about the phenomena of public life and certain areas used as the methodological basis of certain sociological studies. </p><p>  Empirical sociology from the second half of the 20th century has been developing not only in the USA, but also in <span>Western Europe.</span>  Representatives of the empirical school are affected by a rather diverse range of interests, but the main problems to be solved are the theoretical and methodological substantiation of research, as well as the ratio and relationship of the volumes of applied and academic areas. </p><p>  Empirical sociology in Russia developed both before the revolution (P. Petrazhitsky, M. Kovalevsky and others), and in the first ten years after it (A. Gastev, S. Strumilin, A. Todorsky, N. Antsiferov, A. Chayanov, I. Bobrovnikov, A. Boltunov, M. Kornev, M. Lebedinsky, V. Olshansky and others).  Empirical <span>sociology in Russia</span> in the 1920s investigated the problems of organizing labor, improving the culture of education, life and production, and training qualified personnel.  In the early 30s, such studies were stopped and resumed only in the 70s (YuLevada, A.Zdravomyslov, I. Kon, G. Osipov, V. Rozhin, V. Shubkin, A. Kharchev, V. Yadov and etc.). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, the visual images of the methodology of cognition are changing.  For example, V. A. Yadov, a well-known <span>Russian sociologist,</span> proposes the following strategies for empirical research with various theoretical approaches.  He suggests taking as a basis such a formulation of the theoretical paradigm: the paradigm in sociology is a comprehensive view of the interconnections of various theories, including: </p><p>  a) the adoption of a general philosophical answer to the question "what is social"; </p><p>  b) the adoption of a certain general spectrum of problems that are subject to study within the framework of a specific paradigm; </p><p>  c) recognition of certain general criteria of validity, principles and reliability of knowledge in relation to <span>social processes</span> and phenomena. </p><p>  Three stages are seen in the development of Russian <strong>and</strong> Russian sociology: </p><p>  1st stage (60-80s of the 19th century).  Sociology arises in the West, and in Ross and.  It is considered as a science that uses other sciences as a "storehouse" of facts necessary for the development of its laws of social dynamics and statics.  At this time, sociology simultaneously developed as a geographical school, organism, psychologism: socio-psychism and a subjective school. </p><p>  Subjective sociology formed its principles before anyone else.  The motive was the desire to argue the ideas of Russian populism and socialism. </p><p>  Psychological ideas explored the crucial role of cultural factors that influence the motivation of human behavior. </p><p>  2nd stage (80 - 90s of the 19th century).  At this time, anti-positivist attitudes and Marxism were formed.  At this time, M. M. Kovalevsky released his work "Sociology".  He understood sociology as the science of evolution and the organization of society.  He emphasized that in sociology it is difficult to intertwine economic, psychological, geographical factors, but none of them, at the same time, is decisive. </p><p>  3rd stage (until the 20s of the 20th century).  The leading school is neopositivism.  At the same time, "Christian sociology" is being formed. </p><p>  4th stage (Since the 80s of the 20th century BC).  A new stage, marked by dramatic changes in sociology, which is recognized as an independent science. </p>
