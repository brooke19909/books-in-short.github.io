    <p>  How much money should the admirers of the Turkish Mediterranean take with them?  We will answer right away that it is generally difficult to determine the amount that a <span>vacation in Antalya</span> will require <span>.</span>  It makes no sense to calculate prices.  It all depends on the level of family consumption.  In this case, it is desirable to distribute the funds, for example, for a family with two young children, you can use two or three thousand dollars on several card accounts.  It is advisable to take 500-600 dollars and 12-15 thousand rubles in cash. </p><h2>  Meet: five-star hotel Aska Lara Resort &amp; Spa (ex. Aska Lara Deluxe) </h2><p>  The hotel is a 20-minute drive from <span>Antalya Airport.</span>  This is a completely new five-star hotel, which received its first visitors this year.  The start was successful.  In a single complex there are ten swimming pools (in two of them the water is heated), four restaurants with bookings by appointment (Turkish, Oriental, Italian cuisine), four fast food restaurants <span>(buffet),</span> spa, six bars, a mini club, children's and sports grounds. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Built in the relatively calm "family" resort center of Lara, the most popular in the Mediterranean region of Antalya, the Aska Lara Deluxe 5 * hotel (now called differently) meets the highest five-star hotel business standards.  The picturesque nature of Lara, decorated with waterfalls formed by a mountain river.  The beach located here, bearing the name of the area where it is located (Lara), is one of the best in Turkey. </p><p>  The architect's idea was to create a multivariate infrastructure Aska Lara Deluxe 5 *.  The reviews suggest that those who prefer active gaming, and those who like a measured, calm pastime, and those who are interested in vibrant nightlife, come here.  How was this done?  In Turkey, the hotel business is of national importance, as well as reliable scientific and educational support. </p><h2>  Zoning </h2><p>  The hotel project involves the zoning of a rather impressive boarding house (62 thousand m <sup>2</sup> ) into two differently functional parts. </p>

    <p>  Morning meals (as, however, both daytime and evening) are carried out according to the principle of a buffet, which has already become a world standard.  Therefore, the restaurant, which provides the main food for vacationers, has an appropriate design: a spacious buffet area is separated from several guest rooms.  Thus, hotel guests choose food in one area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant, and their tables, respectively, are located in another (something this logistics resembles a "classic" dining room). </p><p>  However, if you overslept breakfast or ‚Äúbought‚Äù lunch, this does not mean that you will remain hungry.  On the beach, in the water park, in the building of Aska Lara Resort itself, you will be offered a wide selection of sweets (to try everything at once you will have neither the strength nor the ability), assorted packaged juices, instant food.  In addition, from 15 <sup>00</sup> to 17 <sup>00</sup> for the hotel guests are offered six to seven types of ice cream (optional: in a bowl or in a waffle cup).  In the evening, near the pools, you can take grilled local culinary and smelling delicious meat and fish.  The system of ordering food in the room also works. </p><p>  In a word, if you are not without reason consider yourself a gourmet, then in this case you will be satisfied with your vacation at Aska Lara Resort &amp; Spa.  Guest reviews indicate the high qualifications of the cooks, about really tasty and healthy food. </p><h2>  Physiotherapy </h2><p>  Hotel guests, especially middle-aged and older ones, regularly visit the hotel spa.  Here, visitors significantly restore their strength thanks to the warmth of the Turkish bath (hammam), baths with rose petals, therapeutic massage.  With the help of steam, the airways are warmed up, muscles are relaxed, and diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems of the body are prevented.  In fact, the Turkish bath is a slightly modified ancient Roman one.  Vacationers unanimously reiterate: "She must visit!" </p>

Scuba diving, observing marine photographs and photographing them, searching at the bottom of archaeological finds - all this attracts people.  It is easy for hotel guests to choose their favorite diving courses from the many offers.  Among the courses popular in Antalya, there are oriented both for beginners (general rules for diving, breathing features, standard appropriate actions in various situations), and for people with <span>diving</span> experience <span>(deep sea dives,</span> boat <span>dives</span> , underwater shooting). </p><h2>  Mini club </h2><p>  The Aska Lara Deluxe 5 * hotel has a creative team of children's animators.  Young girls and guys are able to communicate with small hotel customers, they know how to interest them.  The mini-club uses different facilities: either it operates in the main building, then in different zones of the water park and on sports grounds specialized for different ages.  Every day with children competitions, contests are held.  And in the evening, diplomas are always solemnly awarded to the winners.  For children, more fun mini-discos are organized with qualified DJs - animators. </p><p>  The winning moment of the mini-club is the organization of kids' birthdays.  The action takes place during a disco (sometimes in the Panorama bar, sometimes in other places).  At the end, all the guests together sing a song for the little birthday boy, gifts are given to him. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Summing up the above, it should be noted that the Aska Lara Resort hotel can really be safely recommended for a wonderful holiday.  It has created a universal and efficient infrastructure, and the staff is trained and attentive.  However, for some reason, at the subconscious level, questions arise about the creation in the future of a fully competitive Black Sea Riviera ... </p>
