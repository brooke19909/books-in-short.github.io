  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Nai Harn Phuket 5 *: hotel description, photos and reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The west coast of Thailand's largest island - Phuket - is entirely occupied by resorts.  All of them, starting with Patong, are very noisy.  Therefore, tourists are of the opinion that for peace and quiet you should go to small islands such as Phi Phi, Koh Phangan or Koh Tao.  But few people know that the southern coast of Phuket is a paradise of nature.  Do not think that all the beautiful beaches are concentrated exclusively on the western side of the island. </p><p>  In the south, there is Nay Harn impeccable in every way.  This is exactly the place that a tourist looking for solitude and tranquility in the lap of tropical nature needs.  Nai Harn beach is still little "inhabited" and spoiled by civilization.  Only a few hotels have been built here, and today we will tell you about one of them.  Meet: The Nai Harn Phuket 5 *.  Photos of the territory, rooms and the beach, a description of the hotel and reviews of tourists about it can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Hotel History </h2><p>  If you start looking on the Internet for information about The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * hotel to read its description and reviews of tourists, then most likely you will not find much.  And all because the hotel recently changed the sign.  The first to start exploring the Nai Horn coast were sailors.  The bay was convenient for mooring ships, and a little further into the sea strong winds blew.  Somewhere in the mid-80s of the last century, a yacht club opened here.  Not all athletes wanted to spend the night on board their ships, and to go to Patong or Phuket Town was far away. </p><p>  Therefore, in 1986 the hotel opened.  It was called the ‚ÄúRoyal Phuket Yacht Club‚Äù and existed under this sign until 2014.  Gradually, neighbors appeared at the hotel, for example, the chic and new Sunsuri Nai Harn Phuket 5 *.  In the reviews of 2013-14, one can often read that this hotel was considered the best on the coast.  And the Royal Yacht Club is outdated - both physically and mentally.  Therefore, it closed with the end of the tourist season of 2014.  About 20 months was a complete reconstruction.  The new hotel, under the guise of The Nai Harn Phuket 5 *, received its first visitors in early 2016. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunsuri-phuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunsuri Phuket 5 * (Thailand)" class="if uuid-3215406" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215406.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The southern coast of the island can be called quiet and calm, but it is still not a wilderness or a separation from the civilized world.  There are a couple of shops, a fairly large selection of cafes.  At lunchtime, the beach is visited by mackerel (traders of hot dishes, soups and salads).  The two-kilometer Nai Horn beach itself stretches a long strip along a rocky cape.  At its top is a Buddhist temple.  On one side of the cape is the hotel Phuket Nai Harn, Sunsuri Phuket 5 * (Thailand) - on the other.  In the middle, away from the sea, there is another hotel - All Seasons Nye Harn.  And it's all. </p><p>  At one edge of the bay there is still a pier for snow-white beautiful yachts.  Phuket Airport will have to drive 55 kilometers.  And if you miss civilization and want to walk along the meander Bangla Road in Patong, then you will have to overcome 25 km.  Thus, it can be stated that the location of the hotel will appeal to families with children, people looking for a secluded and measured rest.  Young people who travel to Phuket for fun, it is better to look for housing on the west coast of the island. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="7.778509299999999" data-lng="98.3031575" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/3/6/6/17366.png"></div><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Since the hotels Phuket Nai Harn, Sunsuri Phuket 5 * (Thailand) and All Seasons are so far the only ones on the Nai Harn coast, they managed to capture a huge building space.  For example, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel we are describing is 17,600 square meters.  Most of the territory of ‚ÄúThe Nai Harn 5 *‚Äù is buried in lush tropical greenery.  Nine hotel buildings with elevators are built in such a way that the Andaman Sea is visible from each room. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The hotel itself is located on the side of a small hill.  Therefore, all the malls smoothly descend to the beach.  According to tourists, the hotel area is too built up, I would like more space.  But there is still a place for wildlife.  On the alleys, geckos warm up in the sun, birds sing in the branches of exotic trees.  The hotel has a swimming pool, which tourists are very praised.  We will talk more about him later. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Nai Harn Phuket 5 * - Reviews" class="if uuid-3215411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215411.jpg"></div><h2>  "Sansuri Nai Harn 5 *" </h2><p>  When there are only three hotels around several kilometers away, tourists involuntarily begin to compare them.  And in reviews of The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * hotel, references to the rival "five" are often found.  Let's immediately dot all the ‚Äúi's‚Äù.  Hotel "Sansuri Nai Harn" was built later, and it seemed to tourists, a large area.  But eight buildings in the same cascades descend to the sea, as in The Nye Harn.  There are two swimming pools in Sansuri.  One of them is the subject of constant envy of the inhabitants of the hotel we are describing.  It is built in such a way that people floating in it have the feeling of flying over the sea surface.  Some tourists from The Nai Harn made friends with the Sansouri guests and asked them about rooms, food and other services. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for the apartments, then in this "five" everything is at the proper level.  The rooms are spacious and bright, with white linen and lots of towels.  Breakfast is served in two rooms - with traditional European and Asian cuisines.  As for the services, Sansuri has a gym, fitness equipment, a spa with various types of massage and a jacuzzi.  The animation is presented in the form of aerobics classes in a small pool.  In a word, the inhabitants of Sansuri are also pleased with their choice of hotel.  There is only one small minus.  The Nye Harn Phuket is practically on the beach.  From the uppermost hull to the sea go 200 meters.  And "Sansuri" is located two kilometers from the beach.  A free shuttle bus brings guests to the sea.  He runs six times a day.  But some guests complained that they were tied to the bus schedule. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sunsuri-phuket.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunsuri Nai Harn Phuket 5" class="if uuid-3215404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215404.jpg"></div><h2>  Number of rooms.  Categories of premises </h2><p>  The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * hotel is designed for sophisticated guests.  The lowest room category is deluxe.  This spacious apartment consists of an entrance hall and a bedroom with a seating area.  These rooms are located on floors 8 and 9, and offer panoramic sea views.  All guest rooms have very spacious balconies, which some tourists even call ‚Äúverandas‚Äù in the reviews.  The bathroom is two steps below the bedroom.  It is huge, and it has its own window.  This bathroom, divided into three parts, has a bathtub and shower.  To the amenities that tourists expect from the "five" (hairdryer, expensive cosmetics, bathrobes, slippers), added floor scales and a yoga mat. </p><p>  From the first to the seventh floors of the building are occupied by rooms of the category of Grand Ocean View.  The epiciness of these apartments is evidenced by their size.  The number itself is 81 square meters.  m, and to it is added a veranda of 40 squares!  It has sun loungers, a table, and sometimes a couch under a canopy.  On the 7th and 8th floors, one-room suites are also located.  In size, they are the same as the rooms of the previous category, but the content in them is more elegant.  In addition, a butler is assigned to the services of VIP guests.  And finally, the most expensive room category is the Royal Suite.  These chic apartments are located on floors 3, 8 and 9.  This two-room suite consists of a bedroom and a living room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lhw.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * - Verandas" class="if uuid-3215425" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215425.jpg"></div><h2>  And what is in the rooms? </h2><p>  Everyone who stayed at The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * recalls giant beds covered with brand new white linen.  In general, it is clear that the hotel was recently opened after a major overhaul.  All furniture and plumbing are new, as if just from a store, everything is working properly.  Vacationers liked the decoration of the rooms - nothing more, but comfort is fully provided.  The rooms are bright and comfortable.  Everything is thought out to the smallest detail.  For example, air conditioning does not blow lying on the bed in the head.  And you can watch TV in the living room sitting on the couch or sitting comfortably in the bunk. </p><p>  All rooms have a kettle and a small set of dishes.  Maids put daily bags for self-preparation of drinks and bottles of clean water.  The rooms draw excellent Wi-Fi.  The maids are cleaned very carefully and clean, as in the operating room.  Of the technology, tourists mention the presence of a DVD player, an iron with an ironing board, and an electronic safe.  A large flat-screen TV broadcasts satellite channels (there is 1 Russian). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * - room description" class="if uuid-3215421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215421.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The lion's share of tourists who came to The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * paid for breakfast.  Later, already in place, some vacationers bought lunch or dinner, although the prices in hotel restaurants are higher than in neighboring cafes.  Breakfast is served at Cosmo.  This restaurant with European and Thai cuisine has both an air-conditioned lounge and an outdoor terrace with wonderful views of Nai Harn Beach.  Here you can also have lunch and dinner.  These meals are √† la carte and include three dishes. </p><p>  And right on the seashore is another hotel restaurant - Rock Salt.  He specializes in cooking fish and seafood.  For those who have bought the ‚Äúfull board‚Äù program, meals are possible in both restaurants.  The Cosmo-Bar operates in the building, and cocktails and refreshments can be ordered at the Reflection on the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.telegraph.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * - traveler reviews" class="if uuid-3215418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215418.jpg"></div><h2>  Nai Harn Phuket 5 *: nutrition reviews </h2><p>  Without exception, all tourists were satisfied with the breakfast.  The time allotted for the meal suited both those who get up at dawn and those who like to soak in bed.  The assortment of breakfast dishes was amazing.  There were sushi, rice with meat, and omelettes.  Many said that they left breakfast so well-fed that they began to think about food only in the evening.  It seems that the assortment of meals was the same every day, but nevertheless excellent in details: either they would bring new pastries, or papaya instead of pineapples.  In short, the food did not bother. </p><p>  Those tourists who catered for a full or half board system praised the √† la carte service very much.  You could always choose interesting dishes.  At Rock Salt, it's worth going out for dinner.  Shrimp and lobster are very tasty cooked there.  But a budget tourist will find many cheap cafes within walking distance.  Near the hotel there is a fruit market and a grocery store. </p><h2>  The Nai Harn Phuket 5 *: description of the beach and pool </h2><p>  A beautiful wide strip of pure white sand stretched for two kilometers.  Part of Nai Harn Beach is reserved for hotel guests.  Umbrellas and sunbeds on it are free for them.  Beach towels are provided at the hotel.  On the coast there is a free rental point for snorkelling equipment, you can also go kayaking or catamaran.  A little further is the surf school, where for a fee you can take lessons from a professional instructor. </p><p>  The pool at the hotel guests liked.  It is also made with panoramic views of the bay, and swimming in it is a pleasure.  The pool has a children's section and a relaxation area with shallow water.  The solarium terrace is lined with sunbeds and umbrellas.  The pool is always quiet and there are few people, since most tourists prefer to swim in the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thenaiharn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * - photo" class="if uuid-3215412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/3215412.jpg"></div><h2>  Services </h2><p>  The Nai Harn Phuket 5 * hotel (Thailand) has a spa center.  It also has pools.  Various types of massage, sauna, hammam are available.  Those who love sports can attend free yoga classes or work out on simulators, rent a bike, play volleyball or soccer.  Wedding ceremonies, celebrations or business meetings can be arranged upon request.  For the latter, the hotel has several conference rooms.  A shuttle service to the airport is available for a fee. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of vacationers enjoyed a stay at The Nai Harn Phuket 5 *.  Reviews of tourists are like laudatory odes.  Everyone recalls breakfast with nostalgia and assures that it is better for people on a diet not to go here - do not resist the temptation.  Tourists note the hospitality and professionalism of the staff.  A Russian-speaking employee works at the reception, so there should not be a language barrier.  The only minus of the hotel is the lack of services for children (except for a paid babysitting service).  But Nai Harn Beach is a great place for swimming for kids.  There is a shallow bottom and the smallest sand without stones and corals. </p>
