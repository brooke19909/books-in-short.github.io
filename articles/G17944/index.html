As a rule, these are lovers of extreme and unusual relaxation, where comfort is not the main criterion of pleasure.  One of the popular resorts in Africa is the Zanzibar archipelago.  It is not so easy to find it on a world map, so tourists often wonder where it is located.  This is an archipelago of 75 islands in the Indian Ocean.  Zanzibar (on the map you can see that it is opposite modern Tanzania) is a unique symbiosis of indigenous flavor and oriental exoticism, because for a long time Arabs ruled here.  The nature untouched by the human hand, unique flora and fauna, exotic jungle with baobabs and monkeys, as well as unique night beauty, the starry sky is what overshadows the consciousness and captivates the soul of every traveler. </p><p>  The peak of the tourist season is considered to be the period from July to March.  However, always when planning a vacation, you should look at the weather forecast so as not to get to rest in bad weather.  Amazing beaches, warm waters of the Indian Ocean and a delightful underwater world attract holidaymakers to these lands.  Three-star hotel Reef &amp; Beach Resort service offers at a sufficient level.  Here are modest but cozy living conditions, as well as a number of opportunities for entertaining. </p>

    <h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  The hotel began its countdown many years ago.  For all this time he was subjected to transformations and additions.  The last global renovation was held in 2015.  Its territory is a spacious garden, which is filled with widespread vegetation and places for relaxation: comfortable tables with benches, hammocks hanging from palm trees, straw arbors.  The cleanest air, the aromas of local herbs and flowers - have a beneficial effect on the well-being and general condition of the body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotel Reef and Beach Resort 3 * <span>(Tanzania, Zanzibar) is</span> located 7 km from the village of Jambiani and 32 km from the Josani forest.  The stone town is 60 km away.  In order to get here from the international airport, it is necessary to overcome the distance of 56 km.  This suggests the need after a long flight to overcome the path of 50 minutes, admiring the inviting views of the charming nature. </p><p>  Check-in time is 15:00.  Leave the apartment no later than noon.  Checking in with pets is not possible, as this is not provided for in the internal regulations.  Smoking in public areas is prohibited.  There are specially designated areas for this.  There are no rooms for disabled guests.  Payments are accepted in cash or by credit card.  Distance to the sea - less than 100 meters.  There is the possibility of placing extra beds in the form of folding beds and the establishment of a playpen in the room. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  Resort Reef &amp; Beach Resort 3 * includes 20 bungalows, 24 Luxury Rooms and one villa.  All of them offer views of the amazing azure shores.  There are private terraces equipped with wicker furniture: a table and chairs.  They make it possible to meet the first star or the rising rays of the sun in the fresh air with a glass of wine or a cup of aromatic coffee.  In addition to the furniture set, there are sun loungers with mattresses. </p><p>  The interior of these unique natural bungalows and rooms amazes with its simplicity and ease.  Most of the furniture was built with their own hands.  The arrangement of chambers fully reflects the brightness and coloring of these lands.  The floors are covered with ceramic tiles, the walls and ceiling are painted white. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the modest design, the rooms are cleaned every day.  There is a service for delivering food to the chambers.  In the evening, an amazing highlight is turned on throughout the area, creating the feeling of being in a fairy tale.  The dimensions of the rooms are quite spacious, which allows you to set several additional places at the same time. </p>

    <h2>  Aquazone </h2><p>  At the Reef &amp; Beach Resort, the description of which is presented to your attention in the article, there is a swimming pool with fresh water and a gradual increase in depth.  Straw umbrellas, homemade sunbeds and proximity to nature - inspire travelers.  Regular exercises with water aerobics allows swimmers to stay in a good mood and keep their body in good shape. </p><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  The reason for traveling to Zanzibar is often the desire to experience the unique underwater world of these surroundings, which is known throughout the world for its amazing unusualness.  Washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean, this island is surrounded by a coral reef around the perimeter.  The visibility distance reaches more than twenty meters.  That is why one of the main attractions is diving, which can be carried out by both professionals and novice divers.  Seen coral gardens lead to endless ocean distances, and the local inhabitants are incredibly beautiful and colorful.  Here you can even find dolphins.  Positive emotions, delight and joy are provided to everyone who decides to dive. </p><p>  No less common is snorkelling.  The study of coastal fish is interesting not only for adults, but also for young children.  Due to the abundance of underwater inhabitants, fishing is quite popular in these parts.  Access to the open spaces on a snow-white yacht - on the one hand, is romantic, and on the other - it can bring a significant catch. </p><h2>  Active entertainment </h2><p>  For outdoor enthusiasts, bicycles are available for rent to help you explore the surrounding jungle and clearings with a breeze.  In addition, the healing effect is no less important: muscles are in good shape, extra pounds are lost, blood circulation is improved. </p><p>  You can show your activity in the well-equipped gym.  Here there is all the equipment necessary to maintain the body in good shape and the acquisition of elegant forms: cardiovascular equipment, weight training equipment, treadmills and much more.  A spacious hall with mirrored walls can accommodate everyone. </p><h2>  Calm and health </h2><p>  The quiet and peaceful atmosphere of the library attracts lovers of solitude and literature.  Here you can relax from the hectic island life and take a trip through the pages of an interesting literary work, forgetting about pressing problems and time. </p><p>  Spa lounge - an area where every visitor experiences a sense of relaxation and blissful pleasure.  Procedures from local residents relax the body, instilling new forces and energy into it.  Concomitant massage requires an additional charge.  However, it is worth it.  The unique methods of exposure to every cell of the body, according to vacationers, are truly amazing.  Body and face care procedures smooth wrinkles, moisturize the skin, giving them a fresh and healthy color, and also saturate the skin with oxygen, which helps it stay taut for a long time. </p><p>  Facial peeling is another common service in this institution, which consists in removing dead skin cells, which significantly restores the process of nutrient delivery to cells. </p><p>  The evening usually ends with a game of billiards or an animated presentation from local Aboriginal people.  A professional team of local residents in the style of local customs and traditions organizes a number of entertaining contests and quizzes.  A fascinating show with national dances and skits, according to tourists, is a very interesting and intriguing sight. </p><p>  Travelers devote the lion's share of their time to excursions that Zanzibar is rich in. </p>
