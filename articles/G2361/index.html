There are definitely no numbers that suit all.  Today in Russia about 680 banks are registered.  And to some this quantity seems excessive, to others - obviously insufficient. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top 10 banks of Russia" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1123625.jpg" width="600"></div>  The population is more interested in not the quantity, but the quality of banking structures, so the top 10 banks in Russia will always be a very relevant rating.

    <h2>  1. Sberbank of Russia </h2><p>  This bank, according to the majority of the country's population, is the only financial institution that can be trusted.  This is especially true for people aged who still remember the Soviet era.  The predecessor of the current organization was Sberbank of the USSR.  Carrying out banking operations for a Soviet citizen was associated only with manipulations with a bluish little book, and the savings book was the only guarantee of relative financial prosperity. </p><p>  Today, the population has broader financial thinking, but the most advanced owner of a dozen bank cards understands that the most stable bank today is Sberbank of Russia.  Its power is based on state support, on control by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The volume of assets at the beginning of 2016 is about 226,433,146 dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  2. VTB </h2><p>  VTB Bank, formerly called Vneshtorgbank, is the second largest asset in Russia.  In terms of authorized capital, this banking institution is the first in the country.  The largest shareholder (60.9%) is the government of the Russian Federation represented by the Federal Agency for State Property Management, and the Minister of Economic Development of the Russian Federation Alexei Ulyukaev is the chairman of the VTB Supervisory Board. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="largest banks of Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1123325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The volume of assets is 8 742 464 dollars. </p><h2>  3. Gazprombank </h2><p>  The third largest bank in the country in terms of active assets, like all the largest banks in Russia, has a developed customer service network.  Originally created to serve enterprises associated with gas production, today Gazprombank is one of the largest investors in various sectors of the economy, industry, culture, sports, etc. </p><p>  A distinctive feature of this financial monster is its active work in the foreign finance market.  Its entry into the top 10 banks of Russia in terms of reliability is largely due to a successful <span>investment policy</span> in relation to securities of foreign origin.  At the beginning of 2016, Gazprombank's assets amounted to $ 4,984,239. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  4. VTB 24 Bank </h2><p>  This bank specializes mainly in servicing individuals and financing small and medium-sized enterprises.  Guta-Bank also dealt with this, unable to withstand the 2004 interbank crisis and bought back by the then Vneshtorgbank.

It is located exactly in the middle of the list of the top 10 banks in Russia (according to the Central Bank). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top 10 Russian banks according to the central bank" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29279/1123328.jpg" width="600"></div>
