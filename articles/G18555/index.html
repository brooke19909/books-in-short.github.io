From a small settlement located near the Tobol River, in a relatively short period of time, it has turned into a prosperous settlement.  Its history began in 1879, when the first settlers appeared on the shore of Tobol.  They came here from various provinces. </p><p>  The article presents the most interesting sights of Kostanay (photo and description), but before that a small excursion into history. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="53.2198089" data-lng="63.63542319999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="9"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/7/0/6/12706.png"></div><h2>  A brief history of the development of Kostanay </h2><p>  The history of this settlement begins in 1879.  At that time, a small settlement of Russians and Ukrainians formed on the left bank of the Tobol River, which in 1893 was given the status of a city with the name Nikolaevsk.  The booming village at the beginning of the 20th century turned into a large trade and fair center among the Kazakh steppes. </p><p>  Curious is the fact that in this city there is a brewery, built at the beginning of the XX century at the expense of the Swiss.  At that time, it was the largest in the entire Southern Urals and throughout Kazakhstan.  This is one of the oldest buildings in the city. </p><p>  On the territory of the city were built a church, courthouses and schools, as well as other public facilities.  The population by 1913 was 28,300 people.  The main activity is agriculture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One of the largest administrative centers and the largest supplier of grain crops in Kazakhstan is Kostanay.  There are many attractions in this city, both architectural and historical.  This is a modern city covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã240 square meters.  km  The population is approximately 220 thousand people. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions Kostanay photo" class="if uuid-3000447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3000447.jpg"></div><h2>  origin of name </h2><p>  The village, having become in 1895 a county town belonging to the Turgai province, was renamed and became known as Kostanay. </p><p>  This word in translation from Kazakh means "parking of the Kazakh tribe."  It arose from two components: ‚Äúbraid‚Äù, translated as ‚Äúyurt‚Äù, and ‚Äútanay‚Äù - ‚ÄúKazakh tribe‚Äù. </p><h2>  City features </h2><p>  The main direction of development of Kostanay is industry.  Machine building, textile production is well developed here, there are confectionery and food factories.  Buildings of the Soviet era are combined with new modern buildings and shopping and entertainment complexes. </p><p>  Such sights of Kostanay as original sculptural original compositions perfectly complement the appearance of the city.  There are pretty landscaped lawns and wonderful fountains.  Comfortable restaurants and hotels were built in various areas.  The bulk of the population are Kazakhs, Russians and Ukrainians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.meganstarr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Kostanay photo and description" class="if uuid-3000536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3000536.jpg"></div><h2>  Sights of the city of Kostanay </h2><p>  Among the cultural attractions, the regional Kostanai Museum of History and Local Lore, with 109 thousand exhibits, can be highlighted.  Unique finds of the Bronze Age and Stone Age are presented here.  Since 1995, the museum occupies the premises of the building, which is an architectural monument of the early XX century. </p><p>  Kazakh Regional Drama Theater named after  Omarova and the Russian drama theater are the cultural attractions of the city, and the buildings themselves have important architectural significance.  They play a large role in the life of not only Kostanay, but also of the entire state, participating in various republican and international festivals. </p><p>  The whole territory of the city is decorated with monuments, among which there are quite interesting architectural designs.  For example, a monument to Charlie Chaplin or a girl with a laptop.  The monument ‚ÄúConquerors of virgin lands‚Äù, installed on one of the squares of the city, is dedicated to people who participated in the development of virgin lands. </p><p>  Among the modern attractions of Kostanay (the photo is presented in the article), which are not only a decoration of the city, but also the most favorite places of relaxation, you can include the Octopus water park and the Ice Palace.  They are very popular among young people. </p><h2>  Tobol Embankment </h2><p>  Having become a favorite vacation spot not only for local residents, but also for guests of the city, the Tobol River embankment was built recently. </p><p>  After opening, this area has become a wonderful place for walking in the summer.  Here you can ride a boat, catamarans and boats.  There is a magnificent walking alley, stretching along the river, decorated with various sculptures and flowers. </p><h2>  Parks </h2><p>  Central Park is a landmark of Kostanay.  It is located in the central part of the city.  It can be called the heart of the city, as it is a favorite vacation spot for residents and guests of Kostanay, and the venue for various celebrations.  In the summer, a cinema and attractions work here, and fountains bring freshness in sultry weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="astanatimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Central park" class="if uuid-3000559" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3000559.jpg"></div><p>  Another recreation area is Victory Park, located not in the city center.  In terms of comfort and beauty, it is in no way inferior to the central brother.  He captivates with his silence and green lawns.  Recently, real military equipment was installed here. </p><h2>  Mosque "Maral Ishan" </h2><p>  This magnificent landmark of Kostanay, built in 1893, is known as Ak Mosque. </p><p>  Today, this sky-blue building, which has three minarets, has been restored.  The mosque is located in the central part of the city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kazakhworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Attractions of the city of Kostanay" class="if uuid-3000533" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3000533.jpg"></div><h2>  Kazakh-French Center </h2><p>  This center is located, reminiscent of a fabulous house, opposite the Central Park.  At the very entrance to it is a sculpture of Charlie Chaplin.  This is a gift from France sent in honor of the opening of the center. </p><p>  The fourth floor is occupied by the only toy museum in the republic with a unique collection of exhibits. </p><h2>  Restaurant "Knight's Castle" </h2><p>  This institution can also be called a landmark of Kostanay.  It is worth coming to this restaurant even in order to see the interior, painstakingly and diligently designed in the style of a medieval castle. </p><p>  Here there are a variety of decorative elements made of wood: soft and high sofas, massive tables.  All this plunges into the atmosphere of the times of European monarchs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allthecities.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kostanay Kazakhstan Attractions" class="if uuid-3000545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3000545.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The city of Kostanay is a typical Kazakh city that does not experience excessive tourist attention.  It fits organically into the vast valleys of the region and is an excellent occasion to get acquainted with the traditions and culture of the Kostanay region. </p>
