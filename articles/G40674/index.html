Instruction and photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Childhood is a wonderful time in which even a simple cardboard box can easily become a doll house, a spaceship or a funny robot.  It is not difficult for any parent to make a robot out of the boxes with their own hands, especially since you can easily involve your child in this process, which will be delighted with both the result and the manufacture of the craft.  In this article you will find detailed instructions for manufacturing a variety of robots from improvised materials. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sweet Robots" class="if uuid-2633864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2633864.jpg"></div><h2>  What you may need </h2><p>  Before proceeding with the manufacture of the robot from the boxes yourself, make sure that you have prepared all the tools that you may need during the work: </p><ul><li>  Several boxes of different sizes. </li><li>  Clerical knife and additional blades to it. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  White paper. </li><li>  Glue is the moment. </li><li>  Paper tape. </li><li>  Water-based white paint. </li><li>  Spray can with silver paint. </li><li>  Bottle caps. </li><li>  Another decor. <div class="photo" data-original="papermau.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box robot" class="if uuid-2633858" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2633858.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  In order for the work to bring you only joy, read these simple tips: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Do not stick the boxes to each other with PVA glue - it soaks the cardboard and prevents the product from holding well.  Also, do not resort to the help of glue-pencil - it is too unreliable.  The best solution would be glue - a moment or a glue gun. </li><li>  Let the emulsion ink layer dry well before coating the product with spray paint. </li><li>  Treat your robot with spray paint only on the street, balcony or porch to prevent inhalation of a large amount of harmful fumes. </li></ol><h2>  DIY robot made from boxes </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Robot blank" class="if uuid-2633859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2633859.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make such a blank for a robot: </p><ol><li>  Pick up boxes of different sizes and install them on top of each other. </li><li>  Swap boxes, try to make different compositions. </li><li>  Fasten the boxes with glue. </li><li>  Glue all the junction of the boxes with paper tape so that these joints are not visible under the paper or paint. </li><li>  If you wish, glue the entire surface of your future robot with white paper or simply paint it with water-based white paint. </li><li>  Decorate your robot as you wish. </li></ol><h2>  Craft with a baby "big robot" </h2><p>  A great way to cheer up your baby at a time when it is impossible to go for a walk and need to do something at home, can be making a robot out of the boxes with your own hands.  A great feature of this type of creativity is that you, most likely, will not fully represent the final version of your product, because you will come up with the appearance of your robot on the go.  To get started, gather around the house all the boxes that you have.  Immediately remove those that sold equipment whose warranty has not yet expired.  With the rest of the boxes you can create as much as you like.  It is advisable that the cardboard on the boxes is not glossy, since other materials do not adhere well to it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Fold the boxes in several ways.  Designate arms, legs, head.  Experiment!  Perhaps your robot‚Äôs hands will not be made of boxes at all, but, for example, of an old hose or foil pipe for ventilation.  Do not be too lazy to find the materials remaining after the repair - the remains of skirting boards, ceiling tiles, wallpaper and more. </p><p>  When the image of your craft is thought out, glue the parts together using glue-moment.  It is better to not trust a child under 10 years old to work with such material as quick-drying glue.  Take this part of the job for yourself. </p><p>  Now spread the entire robot with PVA glue or pencil and glue the paper on top.  You can leave the robot in its original form. </p><p>  Connect all the imagination when decorating it: give the child plasticine, paints, matchboxes, ropes, bottle caps of different sizes and colors.  Imitate levers and bulbs.  Such an activity for the evening will definitely be an excellent pastime for a child from 5 to 12 years old, the main thing is that the parent himself is passionate at this moment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="brianofmorbius.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Craft with a baby" class="if uuid-2633861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2633861.jpg"></div><h2>  DIY crafted robot costume from boxes </h2><p>  The popular Halloween holiday in the West is firmly taking its place in Russia.  Now, in many educational institutions, a party is dedicated to the day of all saints, when both children and adults with pleasure dress up in various characters.  A robot costume might be a great idea for a costume party.  To make it you will need: </p><ol><li>  Pick up two boxes for the head and torso.  One more, and the other, respectively, somewhat smaller.  Check that the head passes easily into one and the child‚Äôs torso into the second. </li><li>  Cut a hole for the head in one box, and in the second, remove the bottom edge, also cut the hole for the head and two holes for the hands on top. </li><li>  In the box, which should serve as the head of the robot, cut a hole for the eyes.  You can make antennas from wire and fix them from the inside. </li><li>  Paint and decorate both boxes.  Choose silver paint to simulate the steel body of the robot. </li><li>  Put foil pipes on your hands and feet or simply wrap them in foil. </li></ol><p>  In such a do-it-yourself robot suit out of the box, your child will definitely not have the opportunity to go unnoticed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="inhabitat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Robot suit" class="if uuid-2633853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2633853.jpg"></div><h2>  Matchbox Robot </h2><p>  The robot you are about to make with your child does not have to be full size.  It can well fit in the palm of your hand, while remaining absolutely charming.  In order to make a robot out of matchboxes with your own hands, take 8-10 boxes, fold the robots out of them and glue the boxes together with any glue.  It is possible to use even ordinary glue stick, as the boxes are very light. </p><p>  Now gently paint the product with a brush, after waiting for the glue to completely dry.  Decorate the product to your liking. </p><h2>  Robot head out of the box </h2><p>  In the event that you do not need a whole <span>robot costume</span> , and the child really wants to feel like this character, you can limit yourself to one helmet.  Make him the head of the robot out of the box with his own hands, and he will be incredibly happy.  To make such a toy: </p><ol><li>  Find a box the size of your child‚Äôs head or a little larger. </li><li>  Glue it well so that it does not open. </li><li>  Cut a hole in which the head could fit. </li><li>  Cut a hole for the eyes. </li><li>  From below, you can make ties so that the helmet hangs tightly on the baby's head. </li><li>  Paint the box with a water-based emulsion and tint it from the spray can. </li><li>  Add a grin or smile, make antennas or extenders, glue a pair of temperature sensors. </li></ol><p>  Done!  Your child will be passionate about playing a robot for more than one day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Box robot" class="if uuid-2633863" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/77269/2633863.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, you learned how to make a robot out of the boxes with your own hands and realized that such an activity can be turned into a hobby for you and your child.  Show a little imagination and even ordinary material can make your child happy. </p>
