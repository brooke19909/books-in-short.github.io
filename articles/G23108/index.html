Thus, Italians sacredly believe that ghosts roam here at night, which inspired the inhabitants of <span>Emperor Nero</span> and the powerful Olympia Pamphili, the daughter-in-law of Pope Innocent X, whom all the people hated. </p><h2>  The story of a true work of art </h2><p>  The colorful Piazza Navona in <span>Rome, the history of</span> which began even before our era, was previously a stadium built at the behest of the great Caesar.  The valiant emperor loved sports performances and indulged in various spectacles of the <span>Roman inhabitants.</span>  It was a place intended for athletic competitions, and, as the researchers believe, the word "match", sounding in Greek as "agon", and gave the name to the architectural object.  Over time, having undergone various changes, it turned into the name of the square - "Navon". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Navona in Rome Description" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1864411.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the year 85, when Domitian ruled, the oval-shaped stadium was significantly expanded and accommodated up to 15 thousand spectators.  Often the arena was filled with water to play sea battles before the amazed Romans.  The impressive structure was decorated with numerous sculptures and bas-reliefs with images of revered gods and courageous heroes, and merchants and artisans opened their shops here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The stadium turned into a square </h2><p>  Sports were held until the IV century, and during the Middle Ages the stadium, which was no longer used for its intended purpose, turned into a spacious square where churches grew, and houses appeared on the site of the stands.  It hosted fun fairs, colorful carnival processions, costume shows, and the place of folk festivals and festivals quickly became popular among residents. </p><h2>  Pamphili family decorating Piazza Navona </h2><p>  However, the appearance that reached the contemporaries, Piazza Navona in Rome acquired during the Baroque period, closely associated with the name of the oldest family in the city.  In the 15th century, Antonio Pamphili bought three magnificent buildings here, and two centuries later, one of the noblemen, who became the pope of Rome, wanted to erect a magnificent family palace.  Innocent X (in the world of Giovanni Battista) entrusted the project of the future palazzo to the famous architect D. Rainaldi. </p><p>  After the construction was completed, Pamphili presented a luxurious family mansion to his daughter-in-law Donna Olympia, who wanted to reconstruct the entire square in the likeness of a forum in Ancient Rome.  By her order, an aqueduct appeared, which later turned into the famous Four Rivers fountain, and a church in honor of St. Agnes was erected near the palace on the site of a former medieval church with huge arches.  It was within its walls that Innocent X rested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Navona in Rome History" class="if" height="416" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1864406.jpg" width="600"></div>

Fascinated by the architectural splendor, tourists are lost, not knowing what to look for.  There is something to stop our eyes on to an admiring guest. </p><p>  Of course, the main decoration of Piazza Navona in Rome is the snow-white family mansion of Pamphili, which today houses the Brazilian embassy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rome square navona fountain of four rivers" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1864427.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Palazzo Braschi, built for a relative of another pope - Pius VI - is now given over to the <span>Roman Museum,</span> where you can see a huge number of exhibits, and at the corner of the building is an ancient statue discovered by archaeologists in the early 16th century.  It is assumed that this is one of the sculptures installed in ancient times at the stadium, on which the inhabitants of Rome hung out incriminating power pascivili. </p><p>  One cannot ignore the religious monuments located on the square.  The majestic church of St. Agnes, seriously damaged during the Second World War, gained its original appearance thanks to the efforts of restorers.  In an elegant building, decorated with baroque script, there is an important relic for all believers - the head of the immaculate girl who suffered the martyrdom. </p><p>  Opposite the huge Palazzo Pamphili is the modest looking church of the Holy Virgin Mary, inside of which are stored the priceless murals of Raphael. </p><h2>  Admirable Architectural Buildings </h2><p>  Of course, one cannot fail to tell about the three fountains in Piazza Navona in Rome, for which the glory of the greatest works of architecture was entrenched.  The sculptural and water composition "Neptune" in the north of the square was originally an unremarkable stone pool, from which residents took drinking water for their needs.  Built in the 16th century, it turned into a real work of art at the end of the 19th century: it was decorated with a stone sculpture of a sea lord smashing an octopus with a trident. </p><p>  In the center of another fountain, called the "Moor", there is a statue of a giant fighting with a dolphin.  Initially, there were four stone newts in the waters of the structure, but in the XVII century the water source underwent restoration. </p><h2>  A true masterpiece of fountain art </h2><p>  But the most famous building is rightfully considered the fountain of the "Four Rivers" in Rome on Piazza Navona.  Created by a talented sculptor Bernini in the middle of the XVII century, he occupies an honorable place among the other architectural monuments of the Italian capital.  It was a rather expensive project, and the authorities repeatedly raised taxes to make the water source appear on time. </p><p>  In the central part of the baroque fountain, there is a tall obelisk with hieroglyphs with a sculptural composition, which depicts allegorical figures symbolizing the four rivers - the Ganges, Nile, Danube and La Plata.  Presented in motion, they are mounted on an equilibrium pillar.  A high obelisk was made in Egypt, and inscriptions were already applied in Rome.  At its top you can see a metal dove holding a sprig of olive - a symbol of the noble family of Pamphili. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Navona in Rome photo" class="if" height="457" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1864438.jpg" width="595"></div>
