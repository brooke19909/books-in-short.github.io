    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Grand Sole Hotel Pattaya, which we are reviewing, provides guests with breakfast only, many tourists in their comments note the quality of the food offered here.  So, our compatriots recall that breakfast consisted of cereals, delicious pastries, hot dishes (noodles, soup), croutons, pancakes, sweets, fresh fruits, a variety of jams and juices.  Everything was perfectly cooked, so hotel guests enjoyed breakfast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand sole hotel 3 central pattaya" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/996959.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  As for nutrition during the day, according to travelers, they did not have any problems with this.  So, it is possible to eat inexpensive and tasty in Pattaya in so many places.  In particular, in the vicinity of the "Grand Sole" there are several good, according to our compatriots, restaurants.  There are cafes on local beaches.  Many tourists preferred to have lunch and dinner at different establishments each time in order to be able to try new dishes. </p><p>  There is also no shortage of bars and party places in Pattaya.  A must-see place for almost every traveler is Woking Street.  There are lots of bars for every taste. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Grand Sole Pattaya Beach Hotel 3 * is a city hotel, so it does not have its own beach.  According to tourists, you can walk from the hotel to the sea in five minutes with a leisurely step.  The beach is municipal.  Some travelers claim that city beaches are not very clean.  However, many tourists enjoyed spending time here and did not express much discontent. </p><p>  In addition, vacationers have the opportunity to visit the beaches of Koh Lan.  The ferry departs from the local pier every hour.  Travel time is 30-40 minutes, and the trip will cost you only 30 baht.  There are six beaches on the island of Koh Lan, each of which is good in its own way.  You can move between them on a tuk-tuk.  The cost of the trip will be approximately 30-40 baht.  There are restaurants and bars on every beach, so you can spend the whole day on the island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand sole pattaya beach hotel 3" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/996957.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the territory of the ‚ÄúGrand Sole‚Äù has a swimming pool.  There is also a sun terrace with sun loungers and parasols.  If you do not want to go to the beach, then you can have a good time by the pool. </p><p>  The hotel also has a massage parlor.  However, not all of our compatriots were satisfied with the work of local masseurs and the prices for their services.  So, in their reviews, some guests are advised to visit one of the salons in the vicinity of the hotel.  According to them, prices are lower there, and the quality of services is higher. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Many tourists in their comments warmly recall the staff of the Grand Sole Pattaya Beach Hotel, the photo of which is presented in this article.  According to them, the staff here are very friendly, friendly and always ready to help.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact the receptionist at the reception, who will be happy to give you the most complete answer.  By the way, as our compatriots notice, this feature is generally characteristic of the inhabitants of Thailand.  In all the establishments here, tourists are very happy, they are greeted with a smile and do everything to make them satisfied. </p>
