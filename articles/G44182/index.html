    <h2>  What are the development cubes for? </h2><p>  Adults understand that a toy should help a child to develop, encouraging his imagination, accustoming to patience and attentiveness.  At the same time, it should be suitable for age, otherwise it will be difficult for a baby to understand it, and an older child can quickly get bored. </p><p>  Educational cubes that we will learn to sew are suitable for children from six months to 5 years.  They will help the baby not only develop coordination of movements, but also teach him to determine colors, recognize animals, distinguish letters or numbers.  It all depends on how exactly and what you will make them from. </p><h2>  Positive qualities of cubes </h2><p>  Some parents buy a bunch of toys for kids, some a small amount, but they all agree on one thing: handmade toys will remain a wonderful memory for many years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Such toys are made depending on which fantasy format you have and what your child likes.  In order to make a developmental cube for a baby with your own hands without a pattern, you need to have: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  filler; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  pen; </li><li>  the cloth; </li><li>  threads </li><li>  a needle. </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  As we have already said, making DIY cubes with your own hands will not be difficult.  To do this, adhere to the following action plan: </p><ol><li>  Cut 4 equal squares from the fabric. </li><li>  Sew them together upside down. </li><li>  Leave a small hole. </li><li>  Turn the product to the front side. </li><li>  Push the filler with the handle into the un sewn hole until the cube becomes elastic (try not to make the ball become a ball). </li><li>  Sew a hole. </li></ol><p>  That's all!  You made a developmental cube with your own hands.  The master class is the simplest and most straightforward - even a child can use it. </p><p>  In addition to simple crafts, you can use a more complex manufacturing scheme.  We offer a pattern for it in the article.  The sides of such a cube cannot be made colorful, but the craft will have a few seams, which will make it more durable. </p>

    <p>  If among the accessories with which you will decorate the cube there will be all kinds of simulators for scratching gums during teething, this will be a great help for a child. </p><p>  When there are older children in the house, you can ask them to help in making the blocks.  And the joint creation of a toy for the youngest member of the family will surely bring the older child closer to the crumbs he has taken care of. </p><h2>  Toys you need </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, toys should correspond to the age of the child, they should help the baby in development.  Each child should have a set of toys that really develop the necessary qualities. </p><p>  If the baby does not first play with the cubes or does not pay attention to them, do not be upset.  Just get him interested, it's easier than it sounds.  To get started, put the toy in the most prominent place.  If the baby doesn‚Äôt care, then try playing it yourself.  Such a temptation is beyond the power of even the most persistent child.  In any case, he will want to touch the developmental cube with his own hands.  The ideas of the game come to the baby in the process of its implementation, so you can not worry about his imagination. </p><h2>  Educational cubes for different ages </h2><p>  If your child is barely six months old, then a soft cube is suitable for him - a developmental one, made with his own hands, from materials that are pleasant to the touch, he will be very welcome.  Because in this period of life, the child explores the world by touch and by tooth.  And if your baby‚Äôs teeth are cut, then various large accessories in the form of wooden and plastic rings attached to this toy will be very useful. </p><p>  At the age of one, the baby is able to move the developing cubes from place to place.  You can already teach him to distinguish colors using these toys.  Everything is simple here - you make cubes of different colors and play with the child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY developmental felt cube" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1349072.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  After a year and a half, your child already knows how to build pyramids from cubes, if you used them in the game before.  Two to three tower constructions are enough for the child to be interested in this action.  He will be happy to try a new activity for himself.  And when he succeeds in building, it is likely that with even greater excitement he will begin to destroy the pyramids. </p><p>  Two-year-olds already imagine how animals look.  Therefore, having made educational cubes for them with your own hands with images of animals, birds and fish, you can ask the baby to show where someone is depicted.  It may not be easy for him at first, but you must convey the right information to the child before this request. </p><p>  One of the useful functions of the cubes is the conversion of complex, at first glance, information for the child into the desired form.  For example, cubes with the image of letters are perfect in learning the alphabet.  As a rule, on two sides of such a cube there are letters, on the remaining ones there are images that correspond to these symbols. </p><p>  Let your toys become the most beloved for your baby! </p>
