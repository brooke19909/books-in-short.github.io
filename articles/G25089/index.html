  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY sound amplifier</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Not every average user of a personal computer is sensitive to the sound quality that speakers connected to his digital friend produce.  Many people feel quite satisfied with the quiet and not very clear sound that cheap speakers can provide.  At the same time, the market for expensive equipment is growing every year, and an increasing number of people prefer high-quality and powerful sound.  One of the main components of an audio system is an amplifier.  At the same time, this is one of the most expensive devices.  Those who do not have enough money to buy equipment in expensive acoustics stores can be advised to make <span>a sound amplifier</span> with their own hands.  In addition, this advice can be useful to those who like to craft something with their own hands.  How to make a sound amplifier?  How difficult is it?  In fact, of course, you will need some skills, as well as some knowledge in the field of electronics. </p><p>  DIY sound power amplifiers are different.  Therefore, those who decided to make a sound amplifier with their own hands should first of all determine what this device is for and what devices it will be used with.  If the amplifier is designed for headphones or a subwoofer, you will need one set of components, if for a sound card, then completely different.  Below is a list of components that you will definitely need in order to make a sound amplifier with your own hands. </p><p>  So, the list of necessary to make a sound amplifier with your own hands is represented by a good <span>amplifier circuit</span> (there are a lot of similar ones on the Internet), the ability to solder correctly (in case of its absence, you need to learn from more experienced friends, or read textbooks);  necessary details, the list of which depends on the selected amplifier circuit.  In most cases, these parts are represented by a digital receiver, a DAC, an <span>operational amplifier, a</span> stabilizer for microcircuits, an active filter, a printed circuit board, and a housing characterized by a suitable appearance and size. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After each component is purchased and laid out on the desktop, you can begin the assembly.  Do not forget that quality costs money, so the acquisition of the cheapest parts can hardly be good advice, since you can forget about good sound in this case.  After all, a do-it-yourself amplifier is created in order to provide an unrivaled clear sound system, so it is better to spend more initially than not to get the desired results. </p><p>  You need to start with the printed circuit board, or rather its preparation.  It can be made independently, but it is better to purchase this most important component along with the rest of the system.  In addition, you can order a printed circuit board from people who have sufficient experience in manufacturing such devices.  In general, it does not matter how the board will be received, the main thing is that it should be made with high quality using the appropriate components.  After the board and other components are ready, the amplifier is easy to assemble using the existing circuit, this will not be difficult.  The main thing is to do everything carefully and clearly following the scheme. </p><p>  When each component from the list is mounted and fixed in place, each part will be carefully soldered and the quality of the soldering checked, you can proceed to connect the amplifier to the audio system.  Do not forget that, although the amplifier is an essential component of the audio system, the rest of its parts must also be at a high level.  Only then can you achieve high-quality and powerful sounding of the entire system as a whole, which means that you can fully experience the joy and satisfaction of your own work. </p>
