    <p>  What can be said about such an option as Thailand?  In this country, April can be considered a summer month.  The sun bakes quite strongly.  During the day, the air temperature ranges from 32 to 35 degrees.  At night it is equal to 25. The sultry sun, high enough humidity - all this positively affects the real heat.  If you do not know where to go to the sea in April, then it should be noted that not everyone will like the weather this month in Thailand.  After all, even the local population does not always tolerate heat with ease.  It is because of the intense heat of Thailand that tourists hardly visit Thailand in April.  But you can find your own pluses in this.  The beaches will not be crowded.  There will not be a large number of tourists in shops, bars and hotels. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Naturally, the heat of Russia is unlikely to frighten the inhabitants of Russia.  On the contrary, they will have a great part of their vacation, splashing around in the sea, riding motorbikes and water skiing.  If you do not know where to go to the sea in April, then another positive point is that this month you can find trips to Thailand with a good discount.  However, you should pay attention to exactly where you will go.  For example, in the south of the country at this time heavy rains begin. </p><h2>  Where can I go on excursions? </h2><p>  In April, the most common vacation in the country can be considered that takes place on the beaches.  Have a good rest in Hua Hin.  Excellent conditions are provided by Bangkok, Phuket and Phi Phi. </p><p>  Bangkok is a great option for those who like to visit the sights.  Temples are located near skyscrapers in this city.  There are a lot of them in the district.  If you are planning to visit Bangkok, then you should discuss in advance with the tour operator the possibility of living at least for a week.  But even this time may not be enough to inspect all the sights. </p><h2>  Do not forget about entertainment </h2>

    <p>  Where to go in April?  Of course, it‚Äôs worth a look at the sea, but don‚Äôt forget about entertainment.  Fans of nightlife can visit Pattaya.  In the northern part of this city are hotels.  In the Center there are retail outlets with inns.  In the south of the city there are a large number of entertainment venues.  Day trips to the islands, boat trips, sea scooters are often organized. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are an experienced diver, then you should visit the island of Phuket.  Here you will be offered many special programs that involve diving to the depths.  If you are an inexperienced diver, then the island of Phi Phi is best.  He will be able to hit the underwater life.  The current is relatively small, and the depth of immersion can reach 30 meters. </p><p>  A large number of trips <span>in April in Thailand is</span> better not to plan.  A strong heat will serve as an obstacle in this.  It is he who will not allow to fully enjoy the beauty of the country. </p><h2>  Where do many tourists go? </h2><p>  Where is the warm sea in April?  Despite the fact that the weather in Egypt at this time is not stable, it is this month that real warmth comes to the country.  The air temperature is around 30 degrees, and the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees.  It is in April in Egypt that the peak of the tourist season falls.  Therefore, one should not rely on ultra-low prices.  Hotels are sometimes fully loaded. </p><h2>  High temperatures are not observed. </h2>

    <p>  The weather, which is observed in Sharm El Sheikh and in Hurghada, is just wonderful.  There is no strong heat, the water is warm, the sun does not burn, but it warms affectionately.  In April there is an opportunity not only to have a good rest in Egypt, but also not to burn out at the same time on the beach.  It should be noted that the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh this month is more preferable than Hurghada.  This is due to the presence of a large number of coral beaches.  Powerful gusts of wind do not drive sand through the air. </p><p>  Where is it better to relax in April at sea?  There is no definite answer to this question, but it should be noted that Egypt becomes really sultry in resorts located on the <span>Sinai Peninsula.</span>  During the day, the temperature reaches 30, and at night it reaches 20 degrees.  The mountains hide the terrain.  For this reason, there is practically no wind.  Accordingly, the heat is felt stronger.  Water in this area warms up to a mark of 25 degrees. </p><h2>  What should i take? </h2><p>  In Egypt, you should take sunscreen, hats with you.  Do not forget about the dangers that lurk in the underwater world of the Red Sea - you need to take special rubber slippers that are perfect for swimming.  It is necessary to plan your time so that you can visit the beach only in the morning or in the late afternoon.  When you go on an excursion in the morning or in the evening, you need to bring long-sleeved clothing.  In the daytime, you need to grab a sunscreen and drinking water.  In Giza and Cairo, you need an umbrella, because of short rainfall. </p>

    <p>  And, of course, swimming in the Dead Sea will leave an indelible impression.  Since there is a lot of salt in sea water, you can stay afloat without making special efforts for this.  You just need to relax.  Swimming in the Dead Sea is very beneficial.  However, do not forget that in water it is allowed to spend no more than 20 minutes.  Otherwise, dehydration may occur. </p>
