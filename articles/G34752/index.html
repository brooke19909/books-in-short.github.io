Its length is 257 kilometers and its width is from thirteen to sixty kilometers.  Relaxing on the island is like falling into a fairy tale, the cultures and climatic conditions of the countries of Asia, Africa and Europe are so intricately interwoven here, since Crete is located at the busiest crossroads of these three <span>parts of the world.</span> </p><p>  A feature of Crete is that in spite of the large attendance, nature has been preserved here in its original form.  In the North of the island there are a long strip of wide sandy beaches that are washed by a crystal-clear sea. </p><p>  Some beaches are awarded with blue flags - symbols of cleanliness.  Thanks to the warm currents, the swimming season begins here much earlier than in Turkey, which is located in the neighborhood.  The western part of the island is buried in lush vegetation, here is a small lake and mountain rivers flow.  If you add to all of the above even the hospitality and hospitality of local residents, you get the perfect place for a spa holiday. </p><p>  Crete, whose hotels are distinguished by the highest level of service, are located on the resort island in the hundreds.  Thousands of tourists come here on vacation annually, but the island is especially popular among Russians. <br>  The reality in Crete is intertwined with mythology in such a way that it is impossible to understand which event is historical and which is mythological.  Many legends and myths of ancient Greece are associated with the island of Crete.  For tourists, Greece is interesting for its rich <span>ancient culture.</span>  Crete hotels which almost all are built in the Greek style, not only allows you to feel the Greek atmosphere, but even feel like some kind of mythological character. <br><br>  With the onset of darkness, the cheerful life on the island does not stop, it only moves to small taverns, where the famous "sirtaki" dance to the sounds of live music.  Under the feet of the dancers, plates are occasionally thrown, which beat with a cheerful ringing.  Beating plates has become a tradition.  All guests are offered a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù dinner of the Cretan peasant, consisting of twelve dishes, and since the portions here are traditionally huge, visitors, except the locals, usually take half the portion.  Crete hotels which also offer a varied night program, including night dances under the stars, theater performances and other cultural events, will not let anyone, even those who decide to stay in their rooms, get bored. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crete hotels which are very diverse, also provides a large selection of villas.  You can rent a villa directly on the coast, or in the mountains.  The best hotels in Crete need to be booked in advance, and some villas can be booked even a year in advance. </p><p>  The new Crete hotels, as well as the ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù hotels, fall into various categories - from the most modest to the exclusive and luxurious.  All of them are located in small resort towns or have their own territory on the coast.  The choice of any of the hotels will certainly be good, but, nevertheless, at first it is better to get acquainted with the reviews of tourists who visited this or that hotel. </p><p>  Reviews can be found on travel sites or directly on hotel sites.  By the way, most of the reviews are simply enchanting and, after reading a few of them, the vacationer can already competently choose for himself the most suitable one for the price, location and level of service.  After all, hotels vary in price categories - there are two-star hotels suitable for almost all guests, among them the Zervas Hotel located 30 kilometers from Heraklion International Airport, and five-star luxury hotels of the highest level of service, among which a luxury hotel Grecotel Kalliston, a boutique resort right on the shores of the Aegean. </p><p>  There is a huge selection of luxury villas on the island, and in any style, even ‚Äúunder a medieval castle‚Äù.  The villas can be located both in the mountains and on the coast, and can be designed for a family or a fun company. </p>
