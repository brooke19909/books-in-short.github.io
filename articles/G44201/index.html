    <h2>  Rest on the Beloyarsk reservoir </h2><p>  This place is famous for its birch and pine forests, which often attract vacationers.  Many come here for the picturesque beauties of nature - the rugged edges of the coast, small islands, several flowing rivers.  These amazing landscapes will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  For fishermen, these places are just paradise.  The Beloyarsk reservoir is rich in a variety of fish: perch, ruff, roach, burbot, crucian carp, tench, bream, pike perch and many others - all can not be listed.  There was also a single recorded case of a piranha catching a hook to a fisherman, but this happened purely due to the negligence of the employee who released predatory fish into the reservoir.  Fishing is possible both from the shore and by boat, both methods are easily feasible in these conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This place also will not leave hunters indifferent: in the autumn the hunting season for waterfowl opens.
