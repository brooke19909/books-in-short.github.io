    <p>  The indisputable advantage of the "velvet season" is the price of both accommodation and various services and meals. </p><p>  As for prices in Greece, here the opinions of people differ in many respects.  Someone considers this country a place with fairly affordable prices, but to someone it seemed expensive.  It all depends on the needs and capabilities of vacationers. </p><p>  Budget meals are available at local eateries and taverns.  Moreover, it should be noted that the Greeks are a generous people, and one serving here may well be enough for two.  If you move away from the crowded places of tourists, you can find very cheap catering establishments, and the quality and taste of dishes will not differ much from food prepared in an expensive restaurant.  Alcohol in Greek resorts is quite expensive, but entry to most clubs is completely free.  Prices for souvenirs here are slightly higher than in the resorts of Turkey or Cyprus, but excursions and clothes will cost about the same. </p><p>  <em>Approximate prices:</em> </p><ul><li>  An English breakfast in a cafe costs about 250 p. </li><li>  You can dine in Cyprus for 600-700 p. </li><li>  A standard dinner will cost about 1500-2000 p.  for two. </li><li>  Excursions - from 1500 to 5000 rubles. </li><li>  Car rental - from a thousand rubles per day. </li><li>  The cost of gasoline is 120 rubles per liter. </li><li>  2 sun loungers and an umbrella - 450 rubles. </li><li>  Souvenirs - from 400 rubles. </li></ul><h2>  Cost of rest </h2><p>  Minoa Hotel Malia 2 * refers to the budget and economical hotels in Greece.  Estimated cost of living in it is 50 thousand rubles per week from a couple (with breakfast).  At the peak of the season, the cost can increase by 10-15 thousand per person.  When choosing a tour, it should also be taken into account that Greece is a member of the Schengen area and a visa may be paid as an extra stay, which can be obtained through the regional department of the Greek Visa Center, independently through consulates or through a tour operator.  The cost of a visa varies from four to eight thousand rubles. <strong></strong></p><h2>  Reviews about Minoa Hotel Malia 2 * </h2><p>  When choosing a place to stay, tourists very often rely on the reviews of people who have already been there.  If you objectively look at the reviews about Minoa Guest House, you can conclude that the hotel is quite good and quite justifies its price.  Just those tourists who plan to stay here should understand that the hotel has only two stars, so you should not expect much from it.  The hotel is quite modest, but comfortable, has a great location.  The sea is close, a five-minute walk, the beaches are excellent, there are sandy and rocky, there are many shops and taverns nearby, in the evenings there is where to walk and where to go.  The only negative - the bus stop is far away. </p>
