    <h3>  The best beaches of Pattaya </h3><p>  This is the recognized capital of beach holidays not only in Southeast Asia, but almost the whole world.  The main thing people are going here for is beaches.  Pattaya is famous for them.  The city itself is located on the coast of the <span>Gulf of Thailand,</span> and its territory stretches very widely.  The long coastline of the bay is composed mainly of beaches.  Pattaya can boast of them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya beaches photo" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/222591.jpg" width="300"></div>

The central beach is located directly in the city, which ensures its easy accessibility - most hotels are located directly on the coastline.  Everything is quite comfortable here, but pollution of the coast can be attributed to the number of disadvantages.  A large number of light boats and pleasure boats are moored here.  Therefore, it is still better to turn your eyes to the north or south.  Beaches located south from the center are called Jomtien and Bang Sen Beach.  The nearest one is only two kilometers away, it is not difficult to get to it.  It is quite comfortable and not crowded, especially on <span>weekdays.</span>  This place is very popular among fans of surfing and other water sports.  There is a network of fairly comfortable and affordable hotels along the entire coast.  And a huge number of restaurants and bars for every taste and budget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best beaches of pattaya" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/222590.jpg" width="570"></div>  The North Beach, or Naklaya <span>Beach, is a</span> fairly quiet and peaceful place for a leisurely family vacation.  There is no noisy nightlife, but there is all the service and hotel infrastructure.  In addition, the islands in the bay also have excellent beaches.  Pattaya is very close, and transport links with it are stable.  You can get here pretty quickly, it's not very expensive.  According to many sophisticated vacationers, it is on the islands that the best beaches of Pattaya are located.  Photos taken there adorn both <span>family albums</span> and glossy travel catalogs.  And they always look spectacular, especially against the backdrop of the setting sun over the bay.

    <h3>  Pattaya in the rainy season </h3><p>  This period falls on the summer months, approximately from late May to early September.  The coast of Thailand is under the influence of monsoon rainfall.  But this does not mean at all that there is no need to go here at this time.  On the contrary, this season has its own charm and its advantages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattaya beaches rainy season" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/222594.jpg" width="490"></div>  Many tour operators during this period reduce prices in this area.  And the climate on the coast remains very comfortable for relaxation and quite mild.  Although the rains pass, they do not linger on the coastline for a long time.  At this time, many tropical fruits are singing, and their prices are very reasonable.
