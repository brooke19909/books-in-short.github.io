It can be quickly flown by plane, traveled by train in 35 hours, overcome by car or bus in transit through Ufa.  Since Magnitogorsk is located on the border of Europe and Asia, then during the trip you will have to cross almost the entire European part of Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gazelkin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Magnitogorsk - Moscow" class="if uuid-3163384" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56278/3163384.jpg"></div><h2>  Flight flight route </h2><p>  There is an airport in the city, so it is not surprising that the planes of different airlines fly from Magnitogorsk to Moscow: </p><ul><li>  Aeroflot. </li><li>  "North wind". </li><li>  Pegas Fly. </li></ul><p>  The flight takes 2.5 hours, aircraft land at Sheremetyevo.  The price of an economy class ticket starts at 4,300 rubles.  Departure time can be different: from 6 am to 9 pm. </p><p>  Conversely, from Moscow to Magnitogorsk, flights are operated by the same airlines (from Sheremetyev), as well as Ural Airlines (from Domodedovo).  A choice of night, morning and afternoon departures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Panorama of Magnitogorsk" class="if uuid-3162631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3162631.jpg"></div><h2>  Rail ride </h2><p>  From Magnitogorsk to Moscow there are only direct trailers with poisoning at 21:45.  The train is in transit 35 hours.  The ticket price depends on the type of car, and there are only two of them: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Reserved seat - from 2800 rubles. </li><li>  Kupeyny - from 5500 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The trailed car departs from the capital from the Kazan station at 21:22 and arrives in Magnitogorsk 32 hours later at 07:30 in the morning. </p><p>  It is much more interesting to get to Moscow with a change in Ufa. </p><p>  To the capital of Bashkiria from Magnitogorsk, the train also leaves at 21:45 and arrives there after 9 hours.  There are only two types of cars in it: reserved seats and compartment.  Tickets cost, respectively, from 680 and 1200 rubles. </p><p>  From Ufa to the capital, four trains depart with the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  01:47.  The composition of the local Ufa formation.  Before his departure, you will be able to walk around the city for a day: there are enough attractions. </li><li>  07:50.  Passing train from Chelyabinsk.  It has seating cars, a ticket to Moscow in them can cost about 1400 rubles. </li><li>  08:53.  Another composition from Chelyabinsk - branded and more expensive.

From 1600 rubles a ticket costs in a reserved seat car and from 3000 in a compartment. </p><p>  The trains depart from Moscow to Ufa according to the following schedule: </p><ul><li>  12:26. </li><li>  3:30 p.m. </li><li>  21:22. </li><li>  22:50. </li></ul><p>  Ride from 22 to 30 hours. </p><p>  When planning a trip, it is worth considering that the time difference in Magnitogorsk and Moscow is two hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station Magnitogorsk" class="if uuid-3162635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3162635.jpg"></div><h2>  Bus ride </h2><p>  There are no direct buses from Magnitogorsk to Moscow, so you need to go with a change in Ufa.  Before it, a ticket costs about 800 rubles.  There are 10 flights: from 3 nights to 10 pm.  The trip takes 4.5 hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Buses also run from Ufa to Moscow, despite the long distance and the availability of trains.  They depart at 10 and 11 in the morning and arrive in the capital after 20 hours, that is, at 4 and 5 in the morning, at the bus station near the VDNKh metro station or to the Kotelniki metro station.  A ticket costs 2200 rubles, that is, more expensive than a seated carriage in a train and the cheapest options for a reserved seat.  But you need to ride while sitting and long enough - this should also be taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The composition of Russian Railways at the station in Moscow" class="if uuid-3162657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/117615/3162657.jpg"></div><h2>  Car trip </h2><p>  From Magnitogorsk to Ufa along the picturesque eastern part of Bashkiria, the 80K-031 and P-316 routes lead.  They pass through a sparsely populated area among small settlements. </p><p>  From Ufa to Moscow, the M-7 highway leads.  It‚Äôs more interesting to ride along it, since along the way there are large cities: Naberezhnye Chelny, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod. </p><p>  The entire distance of 1700 kilometers can be covered in 22 hours, but along the way it will be necessary to stop at least once for the night.  For example, in Kazan, where there is a large selection of hotels and hostels. </p><h2>  Sights of Magnitogorsk </h2><p>  An interesting city in its own way - industrial zones occupy a significant part of it.  It is worth taking a walk at least one day.  Monuments in Magnitogorsk are diverse: from monumental, such as ‚ÄúRear to the Front,‚Äù to small modern ones for photo shoots, for example, with figures of elderly parents sitting on a bench. </p><p>  If you want to know more about the city, then you should visit the <span>museums: local history and factory.</span> </p>
