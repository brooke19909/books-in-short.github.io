Literally over the past few years, it has turned into one of the most famous recreation areas in Finland, while not losing at all its polar uniqueness. </p><p>  Yll√§s resort in Finland is a popular center for cross-country and skiing.  Many people know this region under the name "Yll√§s - number one!", Since the companies located in the vicinity also use this word in their names. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tui.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Yll√§s Resort" class="if uuid-3141122" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3141122.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Among the Finnish ski resorts, Yll√§s justifiably takes first place in the height of the slopes and the length of the slopes.  Inveterate skiers and those who simply love to spend time in nature are attracted to it by sufficiently stable snow cover, few people and huge open spaces. </p><p>  It is in this part of Lapland that the longest winter track of this country is located.  Its total length is about three kilometers.  In addition, the ski resort of Finland Yll√§s has the opportunity to ride on a gondola, which is located in the cabin of the ski lift, and it is the only such plan in the world. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The resort is located on the western edge of the province of Lapland (municipality of Kolari).  At the very foot of the hill, on its two opposite sides, villages are located.  This is Akaslompolo in the north and Yll√§s√§rvi in ‚Äã‚Äãthe south.  They are connected by a 11-kilometer long road running around the mountain.  Both settlements receive a good portion of tourism income. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nearest railway station from the Yll√§s resort in Finland is Kolari (the center of the municipality of the same name).  Airports: Kittil√§ (neighboring Finnish municipality of Kittil√§), Pajala-Yll√§s (Swedish municipality of Pajala). </p><p>  Nearby cities: </p><ul><li>  Kolari (35 km); </li><li>  Kittil (40 km); </li><li>  Akaslompolo (55 km); </li><li>  Payal (85 km); </li><li>  Rovaniemi (170 km). </li></ul><p>  Nearby resorts: Muonio, Levi and Rovaniemi. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.92410999999999" data-lng="25.748151099999973" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="4"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/5/7/2/15572.png"></div><h2>  Ski slopes </h2><p>  Yll√§s (Finland) is the largest resort, combining 63 slopes with a total length of 53 km, and with 29 lifts.  The main slopes at night are highlighted, so you can ride them until the very stop of the lifts.  The only slope in Finland for the super giant slalom is located here.  In Yll√§s, the ski season is quite long - from late November to early March. </p><p>  One of the most diverse resorts in Finland is Yll√§s.  Here you can find slopes for absolutely all types of skiing, including slalom, snowboarding, freeriding and telemark.  There are trails of varying difficulty - for beginners and experienced skiers alike.  There are also children's sites.  For lovers of exotic, there are slopes with pristine snow, including wooded and open. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It should be noted that for beginners there are two schools that offer group and individual lessons in snowboarding, skiing and skiing in the style of ‚Äútelemark‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discoveringfinland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Environment" class="if uuid-3141123" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3141123.jpg"></div><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  Yll√§s offers a wide variety of accommodation options.  You can stay here both in an upscale hotel and in one of the secluded cottages of Yll√§s.  Finland is a truly fabulous country, and the best options for relaxing in the lap of nature are houses in small towns.  A common type of accommodation are paired cottages, which are divided into two isolated zones.  Most of these structures are located at a distance of no more than 2.5 km from the ski slopes.  A special Ski Bus runs to the mountain. </p><p>  It should be noted that despite the huge size of the resort (it can accommodate 23,000 people at the same time) and its not very crowded, it is best to book hotel rooms and cottages in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.homeaway.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Cottages" class="if uuid-3141111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3141111.jpg"></div><h2>  Other entertainment </h2><p>  The best winter resort in Finland is Yll√§s.  Although the resort life in it is not as saturated as, for example, in Levi, here you can also find a lot of interesting entertainments.  For example, you can ride in the surroundings on reindeer sleighs, dog sledding, snowmobiling, etc. For thrill-seekers, ice-hole bathing is suitable, and for those who prefer a meditative and relaxing holiday, ice fishing in lakes rich in fish is suitable. </p><p>  In summer, you can pick berries and mushrooms, go canoeing, horseback riding and hiking along the hiking trails leading to the mountains and the Lapland forests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.laplandthemagazine.com" data-author=": Alexander Kuznetsov, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Attractions" class="if uuid-3141132" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3141132.jpg"></div><p>  Among the many interesting places of this resort area, it is worth noting this unusual place in all of Finland (Yll√§s).  This is a Snow Village, which is completely made up of ice and snow.  It is rebuilt annually.  Refreshing drinks can be enjoyed at the ice bar with snow and ice interiors, while the Snow Hotel can even stay overnight.  Guests here are provided with warm sleeping bags, a delicious breakfast and hot water. </p>
