Thus, the user has the ability to control the power of the device.  These devices are capable of working in networks with alternating as well as direct current.  Regulators are quite different in design.  The main part of the device can be called thyristors. </p><p>  Also integral elements of regulators are resistors and capacitors.  Magnetic amplifiers are used only in high voltage devices.  Smooth adjustment in the device is ensured by the modulator.  Most often you can find exactly their turning modifications.  Additionally, the system has filters that help smooth out noise in the circuit.  Due to this, the current at the output is more stable than at the input. </p>

    <h2>  Simple controller circuit </h2><p>  The current regulator circuit of a conventional type of thyristors involves the use of diode ones.  To date, they are characterized by increased stability and are able to serve for many years.  In turn, triode analogues can boast of their efficiency, however, their potential is small.  For good current conductivity, field effect transistors are used.  Boards in the system can be used a variety of. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In order to make a current regulator for 15 V, you can safely choose a model with the marking KU202.  The supply of the blocking voltage occurs due to the capacitors that are installed at the beginning of the circuit.  Modulators in regulators are usually used rotary type.  By their design, they are quite simple and allow you to very smoothly change the current level.  In order to stabilize the voltage at the end of the circuit, special filters are used.  Their high-frequency counterparts can only be installed in controllers above 50 V. They deal with electromagnetic interference quite well and do not give a large load on the thyristors. </p>

    <h2>  DC devices </h2><p>  The <span>DC</span> regulator <span>circuit is</span> characterized by high conductivity.  In this case, heat losses in the device are minimal.  To make a DC regulator, a thyristor requires a diode type.  The momentum in this case will be high due to the rapid process of voltage conversion.  The resistors in the circuit must be able to withstand a maximum resistance of 8 ohms.  In this case, this will minimize heat loss.  Ultimately, the modulator will not quickly overheat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Modern analogues are designed for a maximum temperature of 40 degrees, and this should be taken into account.  Field effect transistors are capable of passing current in a circuit in only one direction.  Given this, they must be located behind the thyristor in the device.  As a result, the level of negative resistance will not exceed 8 ohms.  High-frequency filters on the DC regulator are installed quite rarely. </p><h2>  AC models </h2><p>  The AC regulator is characterized in that the thyristors in it are used only of the triode type.  In turn, transistors are standardly used field-view.  Capacitors in the circuit are used only for stabilization.  It is possible, but rarely, to meet high-pass filters in devices of this type.  Problems with high temperature in models are solved by a pulse converter.  It is installed in the system behind the modulator.  Low-pass filters are used in regulators with a power of up to 5 V. The cathode control in the device is carried out by suppressing the input voltage. </p><p>  The stabilization of current in the network occurs smoothly.  In order to cope with high loads, in some cases reverse direction zener diodes are used.  They are connected by transistors using a choke.  In this case, the current regulator must be able to withstand a maximum load of 7 A. In this case, the level of ultimate resistance in the system must not exceed 9 Ohms.  In this case, one can hope for a quick conversion process. </p>

    <h2>  How to make a regulator for a soldering iron? </h2><p>  You can make a current regulator with your own hands for a soldering iron using a triode type thyristor.  Additionally, bipolar transistors and a low-pass filter are required.  Capacitors in the device are used in an amount of not more than two units.  The decrease in anode current in this case should occur quickly.  To solve the problem with negative polarity, pulse converters are installed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  They are ideally suited for sinusoidal voltage.  The current can be directly controlled by a rotary type regulator.  However, push-button analogs are also found in our time.  To protect the device, the housing is heat-resistant.  Resonant converters in the models can also be found.  They differ, in comparison with conventional counterparts, in their cheapness.  They can often be found on the market with the PP200 marking.  The current conductivity in this case will be low, however, the control electrode must cope with its responsibilities. </p><h2>  Charger Devices </h2><p>  To make a current regulator for a charger, thyristors are only needed for the triode type.  The locking mechanism in this case will control the control electrode in the circuit.  Field effect transistors in devices are used quite often.  The maximum load for them is 9 A. Low-pass filters for such regulators are not unambiguously suitable.  This is due to the fact that the amplitude of electromagnetic interference is quite high.  This problem can be solved simply using resonant filters.  In this case, they will not interfere with the signal conductivity.  Heat losses in regulators should also be negligible. </p>

    <h2>  The use of triac regulators </h2><p>  Triac regulators, as a rule, are used in devices whose power does not exceed 15 V. In this case, they can withstand the maximum voltage at 14 A. If we talk about lighting devices, not all of them can be used.  They are also not suitable for high voltage transformers.  However, various radio equipment with them is able to work stably and without any problems. </p><h2>  Active load controllers </h2><p>  The current regulator circuit for the active load of the thyristors involves the use of a triode type.  They are capable of transmitting a signal in both directions.  A decrease in the anode current in the circuit is due to a decrease in the limiting frequency of the device.  On average, this parameter fluctuates around 5 Hz.  The maximum output voltage should be 5 V. For this purpose, resistors are used only field type.  In addition, conventional capacitors are used, which on average are able to withstand a resistance of 9 ohms. </p><p>  Pulse zener diodes in such regulators are not uncommon.  This is due to the fact that the amplitude of <span>electromagnetic oscillations is</span> quite large and it is necessary to deal with it.  Otherwise, the temperature of the transistors rises rapidly, and they become worthless.  To solve the problem with a decreasing pulse, a variety of converters are used.  In this case, specialists can also use switches.  They are installed in the regulators behind field-effect transistors.  At the same time, they should not be in contact with capacitors. </p>

    <h2>  How to make a phase model of a regulator? </h2><p>  You can make a phase current regulator with your own hands using a thyristor marked KU202.  In this case, the supply of the locking voltage will pass unhindered.  In addition, care should be taken about the presence of capacitors with an ultimate resistance of more than 8 ohms.  The fee for this case can be taken by PP12.  The control electrode in this case will provide good conductivity.  <span>Pulse converters</span> in regulators of this type are quite rare.  This is due to the fact that the average frequency level in the system exceeds 4 Hz. </p><p>  As a result, a strong voltage appears on the thyristor, which provokes an increase in negative resistance.  To solve this problem, some suggest using push-pull converters.  The principle of their work is based on voltage inversion.  It is rather difficult to make a current regulator of this type at home.  As a rule, everything depends on the search for the necessary converter. </p>

    <h2>  Soft start models </h2><p>  In order to design a thyristor current regulator with a soft start, you need to take care of the modulator.  The most popular today are considered to be rotary analogues.  However, they are quite different from each other.  In this case, a lot depends on the board that is used in the device. </p><p>  If we talk about modifications to the KU series, then they work on the simplest regulators.  They are not distinguished by special reliability and nevertheless give certain failures.  The situation is different with regulators for transformers.  There, as a rule, digital modifications are applied.  As a result, the level of signal distortion is significantly reduced. </p>
