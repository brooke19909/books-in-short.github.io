One of the options that millions of credit card owners have come to love is a mobile bank.  As part of the service, you can bind up to 8 numbers to one or more plastic means of payment at the same time.  But how do you know which number is attached to the card?  There are several ways to do this, which are described below. </p><h2>  Service Features </h2><p>  A "mobile bank" is a notification from a financial institution that online informs the cardholder about operations with accounts or credit cards.  With the help of the service, the client receives information about the balance of funds after payment, transfer or cash withdrawal, payroll and other contributions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yourfreecreditcardreader.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out which number is attached to the card" class="if uuid-3199197" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3199197.jpg"></div><p>  The service allows you to use the Internet bank without restrictions.  SMS informing service is provided by financial institutions on a paid basis.  At Sberbank, customers must pay 30 or 60 rubles per month for it, depending on the tariff.  At Post Bank, the cost of SMS notifications is 49 rubles per month.  Tinkoff charges monthly fees for SMS Bank in the amount of 59 rubles. </p><p>  Most customers know which number is associated with the card.  They regularly receive notifications by phone, which is indicated in the application for connecting a mobile bank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find out about the availability of service </h2><p>  It‚Äôs pretty easy to find out that a phone is attached to a client‚Äôs card.  SMS will be regularly sent to the active number after the receipt of credit and debit transactions on the payment instrument.  If the number is simultaneously tied to several credit cards, a message will be sent for each of them. </p><p>  But without active SMS, the service can still be connected.  Some financial institutions, such as Sberbank and VTB 24, provide free notifications.  They serve for entry and operations in the Internet banking mode, payment on the Internet, quick transfers via P2P system.  Finding out about the availability of a free service is more difficult. </p><h2>  How to find out which number is attached to the card?  Practical methods </h2><p>  There are several options for obtaining information on binding the phone to plastic means of payment.  All of them allow you to quickly and effortlessly obtain information about the connected service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.intomobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="which cards are tied to a phone number" class="if uuid-3199213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3199213.jpg"></div><p>  How to find out which number is attached to the card: </p><ul><li>  perform an operation; </li><li>  use the functions of the "Mobile Bank"; </li><li>  use a self-service device; </li><li>  Log in to the Internet Bank </li><li>  come to the branch of the issuing bank; </li><li>  contact support. </li></ul><h2>  Getting information after surgery </h2><p>  The method is suitable for those who do not want to contact the bank or use other services.  But to receive information by this method, the card account must have funds, and the client has a telephone with an active number at hand, which should be tied to a credit card. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="paymentweek.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what number is the sberbank card attached to" class="if uuid-3199210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3199210.jpg"></div><p>  For the option to work, you need to perform any operation: withdraw cash or pay for goods in the store, for example.  The amount of expense or income does not matter.  If, after the operation is completed, the client receives a notification about the balance balance on the card via SMS, then his number is attached to the credit card. </p><p>  The method is suitable for those who use several SIM cards at the same time or want to find out which cards are tied to a phone number.  To do this, pay each of the credit cards. </p><p>  If you haven‚Äôt received an SMS about the balance within 24 hours, it‚Äôs possible that a different number is attached to the plastic payment tool, or the client uses an economical (free) version of the mobile bank.  In this case, a balance notice will not be received, but the owner will be able to make a transfer or pay online. </p><h2>  Getting help on the "Mobile Bank" </h2><p>  The availability of the service is easy to verify without making transactions on the payment card account.  To do this, the owner must know any of the service commands.  It is enough to request help on the "Mobile Bank": the service is free and allows you to get information about the capabilities of the service.  This feature is available to Sberbank customers. </p><p>  To find out which number the Sberbank card is tied to, instructions on requesting help will help: </p><ul><li>  number 900 should be sent a notification with the word "HELP"; </li><li>  if the service is connected, in response to SMS the client will receive a message about the capabilities of the mobile bank (in points from 1 to 5); </li><li>  you should send the number 5 to 900, the message will contain information about the list of cards connected to this phone number. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="awards.brandingforum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out which number is attached to the card" class="if uuid-3199230" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3199230.jpg"></div><p>  Message from number 900 may arrive with a delay of up to 5 minutes.  In the absence of binding, the client will receive an SMS that it is impossible to obtain information about the service.  If after 5 minutes SMS still has not arrived, you should check whether the phone‚Äôs memory is full and repeat the request. </p><p>  This is one of the fastest and easiest ways to check which number the card is attached to.  Clients of other banks should clarify which number and message should be sent for quick reference. </p><h2>  Getting information in a self-service device </h2><p>  Terminals and ATMs allow you to get information about the attached phone number at any time of the day.  To do this, you must have with you bank cards for which a certificate is required. </p><p>  To receive information through the terminal, the client must: </p><ul><li>  insert a credit card into the device and enter the code; </li><li>  find a section on mobile banking; </li><li>  check the status of the service, if information is not available, it means that phone numbers are not tied to this card. </li></ul><p>  Sometimes information is displayed incorrectly in the terminal.  For example, a client forgot to pay for a service this month, and an ATM will indicate that the service is completely absent from a mobile bank.  Therefore, it is recommended to check the balance and recent operations with a credit card: if there was a partial write-off in favor of SMS notifications, it means that they can be blocked due to non-payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to find out which phone number" class="if uuid-3199225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3199225.jpg"></div><p>  If the client saved the check when connecting the service in the terminal, he can check the current phone number in the document.  This is an easier way to find out which number is attached to the card using the capabilities of the self-service device.  But it should be remembered that over time, checks have the property of "burn out."  Therefore, it is not always possible to read what information was in the document, 6 months or more after the operation. </p><h2>  Appeal to bank employees </h2><p>  Having at hand a card and a passport, customers can obtain information about numbers associated with a payment instrument from bank managers.  It doesn‚Äôt matter what the client chooses: both a personal visit and a call to a contact center require identification.  Therefore, the cardholder must provide not only a credit card, but also passport data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gobankingrates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to check which number the card is attached to" class="if uuid-3199216" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96996/3199216.jpg"></div><p>  By contacting the office, the client can request a document on linking bank cards to phone numbers.  The service is provided free of charge.  By calling support, the cardholder may request information verbally.  In addition to passport and card information, you must provide a code word.  Some banks may send information by e-mail.  The deadline for receiving a notification is no more than 10 days. </p><h2>  Getting help in the Internet bank </h2><p>  More than 80% of customers use a mobile service to perform transactions in the Internet bank.  This is one of the quickest ways to find out which number the card is attached to. </p><p>  To get help, just log in.  If the main card is tied to the current number, the client will immediately receive a notification about the entry into the Internet bank. </p><p>  In the absence of SMS, you should enter the code from the check (if possible).  Next you need to go to your personal account.  In the section devoted to the mobile bank, there will be information about all the cards and the numbers associated with them.  For security reasons, in most Internet banks only the first 4 and last 4 digits of the payment instrument are indicated. </p>
