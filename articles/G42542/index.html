It mainly attracts with its accessibility.  Prices for <span>5 star hotels in</span> Turkey are quite affordable even for poor people.  But the low cost of rest is not the main advantage of Turkish resorts.  Variety is what makes tourists come again and again.  And each time, visiting new corners of a fertile country, they discover a completely new Turkey.  So what can she offer her guests? </p><p>  <strong>Diving.</strong> </p><p>  Someone will say that he is not in Turkey.  In vain.  Of course, these are not Egyptian coral reefs, but divers, both beginners and professionals, will be quite satisfied.  Kemer will open the eyes of divers a wreck of the Atlantis.  The strong currents of Kalkan will allow experienced scuba divers to test themselves for endurance, and as a reward for the test, they will open the colorful world of the underwater fauna.  Manavgat will provide an opportunity for divers to look at the sunken plane.  And this is only a small part of all the underwater secrets of Turkey. </p><p>  <strong>Skiing.</strong> </p><p>  It seems that sunny beaches and snow-capped mountains are incompatible.  But everything is possible in Turkey.  Erzurum, located in the eastern part of the country will give an exciting winter holiday.  From May to November, 40 km of certified tracks are waiting for their conquerors. </p><p>  <strong>Family holiday.</strong> </p><p>  Children's holidays in Turkey, reviews about which once again emphasizes its attractiveness, every year more and more relevant.  It is here that you will find everything for a complete pastime of children and their parents.  The best <span>5</span> star <span>hotels in</span> Turkey will offer your child pools, sandy beaches, playgrounds, a special entertainment program, water parks, a children's menu and maximum attention and care. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>VIP rest.</strong> </p><p>  Prefer an exclusive vacation?  So Belek is already waiting for you!  The most fashionable 5 star hotels in Turkey, an elite environment, chic entertainment, and an individual approach to each guest are the invariable attributes of a VIP vacation.  All this will appeal to selected people. </p><p>  <strong>Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãentertainment.</strong> </p><p>  Anticipating a ton of nightly entertainment, head to Antalya.  There you will definitely not sleep at night.  Clubs, bars, entertainment centers are always ready to turn ordinary everyday life into an endless celebration.  And if you think that nothing can compare with the fun of Ibiza, you should go to Marmaris. </p><p>  <strong>Shopping</strong> </p><p>  Istanbul is the place of any fashionable woman‚Äôs dreams come true.  Sales of famous brands will make your vacation not only enjoyable, but also beneficial.  First-class boutiques, bazaars and markets famous for their abundance, souvenir shops where you will find the best gifts for friends will never let you go empty-handed. </p><p>  <strong>Sunny beaches.</strong> </p><p>  Incekum with the longest swimming season and sandy beaches will be a paradise for those who love the sea.  Affordable prices make the resort attractive to young people.  <span>The white sand of the</span> beaches of Gelemish, its solitude and romance will turn Turkey into a paradise for two. </p><p>  <strong>And many many others‚Ä¶</strong> </p><p>  Sights, breathtaking landscapes, nature reserves and ancient cities are scattered in different parts of Turkey. </p><p>  Comfortable 5 star hotels in Turkey are able to provide a complete rest even without leaving their territory.  Beaches and gardens, restaurants and bars, outdoor activities and pacifying spas, grandiose shows - programs and romantic dinners - all this is possible in one hotel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Great relaxation is possible regardless of the time of year.  Choose a vacation in Turkey in the summer in the western part of the country, and you do not have to suffer from the scorching heat.  And in winter, in the southern regions, the temperature reaches + 20. A great alternative to the snowy December of Russia. </p><p>  Another plus of Turkish resorts is the Russian-speaking staff.  This will avoid misunderstandings and difficulties in communication. </p><p>  Among the most popular five-star hotels in Turkey, the following can be distinguished: </p><p>  <strong>Club Insula 5 *</strong> </p><p>  The hotel has a well-developed infrastructure.  Vacationers will be offered an entertainment program, a sauna, restaurants, bars, a tennis court, swimming pools and much more.  Power is all inclusive. </p><p>  For tourists, this hotel fell in love with a small but very clean and comfortable area, excellent <span>work of animators, and</span> varied cuisine.  Many appreciated the Club Insula as a hotel for families with children.  Another plus is the beach within walking distance. </p><p>  There are very few negative sides.  Relatively small rooms with poor soundproofing.  Furniture and electronics in some rooms are quite outdated.  The beach is not always clean. </p><p>  <strong>Amara Wing Resort 5 *</strong> </p><p>  Located near the Toros Mountains, very close to Kemer.  There is everything for a good rest.  Many bars and restaurants, sports grounds for every taste, swimming pools, shops, gardens, Internet cafes and more.  The rooms are very stylish and modern.  Each has a balcony.  In the minibar, beer and soft drinks are free.  Excellent conditions for children. </p><p>  Tourists emphasize several advantages of the hotel: clean and friendly staff, good food, interesting but unobtrusive animation, the close proximity of the city, a minimum of problems with accommodation. </p><p>  The disadvantages include not very clean water on the beach, slow service in some bars, the presence of ants in some rooms.  In addition, there are rooms in which city noise is heard. </p><p>  <strong>Delphin Botanik Hotel 5 *</strong> </p><p>  This hotel is famous for its botanical garden.  Tourists are offered a rich selection of entertainment.  The rooms have everything you need for a good rest.  Several restaurants with cuisines of different nations of the world amaze with the quality and variety of dishes.  The hotel has established itself as a great place to relax with children.  Luna Park, playgrounds and animations will delight your child. </p><p>  In addition, tourists note the quality service at the hotel and interesting entertainment programs.  A refrigerator and a minibar are generously replenished every day.  A children's playground in the main restaurant allows you to keep an eye on children while enjoying dinner. </p><p>  Cons of the hotel: pebble beach, and the need for repairs in some rooms.  In addition, over the past year, accommodation prices have increased markedly, due to the popularity of the hotel. </p>
