    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The three-star Palma Hotel has a very good location.  So, the city center can be reached on foot in just five minutes.  The hotel itself is located almost on the embankment, so there are a lot of restaurants, bars and cafes nearby.  As for the beach, like the vast majority of <span>Montenegro hotels,</span> Palma 3 * does not have it.  Basically, in this country the beaches are municipal.  The nearest to the hotel is only a couple of tens of meters.  So you have to, leaving the hotel, just cross the promenade, and you are already on the beach. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the city of Tivat itself, it is small, very green and ideal for a quiet measured rest.  It is very easy to find Tivat on the map of Montenegro, since one of the two airports in this country is located here.  As a rule, most tourists whose ultimate goal is the coast of a given state choose this air harbor as the place of arrival.  Most of all, of course, in this case, those who plan to stay at the Tivat hotel will be lucky.  So, the distance from the airport to the city center is only 2.5 kilometers.  So after landing in the air harbor, the path to the hotel takes only a few minutes. </p><p>  Travelers staying at the ‚ÄúPalm‚Äù or another Tivat hotel and planning to travel around the country will also appreciate the city‚Äôs good location.  So, it is located almost in the very center of the coast, therefore it is convenient to get from here both to the southernmost settlement of Montenegro - Ulcinj, and to Herceg Novi, located at the opposite end of the coast near the Croatian border.  The center of tourist life throughout Montenegro - Budva - is located 17 kilometers from Tivat.  And the distance to the ancient and interesting city of Kotor is only 8 kilometers. </p>

    <h2>  Three-star hotel "Palma" (Montenegro, Tivat): photos, description </h2><p>  This hotel is considered one of the best in the city.  Besides the fact that it offers guests excellent service and accommodation in comfortable rooms, it boasts a good location near the beach in a quiet place, within walking distance of all Tivat's attractions.  ‚ÄúPalma‚Äù is perfect for family tourists who come to rest with children, as well as for older people.  It will be comfortable here for young people.  In total, this hotel has 122 comfortable <span>rooms (suites,</span> standard and apartments).  Some of the rooms have a magnificent view of the <span>Adriatic Sea.</span>  The rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay.  By the way, unlike many hotels on the Montenegrin coast, Hotel Palma 3 * operates not only in the summer, but throughout the year.  Therefore, if you decide to make a pleasant trip to this amazing country in the fall, winter or spring, the Palma Hotel will open its doors to you with pleasure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Policies </h2><p>  As in the vast majority of hotels around the world, the "Palm" also set the time of check-in and check-out of vacationers.  So, check-in of the staying guests in the rooms of the category reserved by them is carried out from two in the afternoon to eight in the evening.  However, this does not mean that if you arrive earlier or later than the indicated time, you will be refused accommodation.  On the contrary, the hotel staff will do their best to populate you immediately upon arrival.  But keep in mind that if you arrive at the hotel early in the midst of the tourist season (July and August), there may not be any rooms available.  In this case, you will have to wait until the previous guests vacate the room, and the maids prepare it for occupation.  At this time, you can leave things in the luggage compartment and have a bite to eat in the restaurant, take a walk in the surroundings or go straight to the beach.  As for the date of departure, the occupied room should be vacated before noon.  When you are discharged from the Palma Hotel (Tivat, Montenegro), you should also pay for the entire stay (if you have not previously settled with a travel agency), as well as for using additional services. </p><p>  You can pay both in cash and with plastic cards of such systems as "Visa", "Mastercard", "Maestro" and "American Express".  In addition, please note that in case of self-reservation of a room in this hotel by credit card, the prepayment amount may be deducted from you.  At the same time, when you check out of the hotel you will only have to pay the remaining amount. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation for guests with children </h2><p>  Since the three-star Palma Hotel (Tivat, Montenegro) also positions itself as an institution for family vacations, guests with children of various age groups are always welcome here.  Moreover, if you place a baby up to two years old in your room on existing berths or in the additionally provided arena, then you will not have to pay for it.  If your child is from 2 to 12 years old, an extra bed will be provided.  Such accommodation will cost 60% of the cost per day per person.  Children over 12 years old or adults on an extra bed will have to pay 90% of the room rate per day for one guest.  Please note that only one extra or cot can be accommodated in each room.  In addition, the hotel should be informed in advance about the need for this service and wait for confirmation from it. </p><h2>  Pets welcome </h2><p>  This item will be very important for those travelers who do not want to leave their four-legged pet at home during their holidays in Montenegro.  So, unfortunately, the rules of the Palma 3 * hotel prohibit pets on its territory.  Therefore, you will either have to find another hotel from the Pets Friend category. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  As for the price of accommodation in the hotel in question, it is consistent with the three-star level.  So, a seven-day stay here at the height of the holiday season (July-August) in a standard room for one person will cost from 24 500 rubles, for two - from 32 000 rubles, and in a suite designed for a maximum accommodation of four guests - from 49 000 rubles.  In low season, the cost will be much lower. </p><h2>  Three-star hotel "Palma" (Tivat, Montenegro): reviews of Russians </h2><p>  In order for travelers to have a more complete picture of the hotel in question, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of our compatriots who have already stayed here. </p><p>  As for the location of the hotel, here the vast majority of tourists were quite satisfied.  So, all the main attractions of Tivat are within walking distance.  In addition, a hundred meters away there is a bus stop with which you can go to the nearest cities (Kotor, Budva, etc.).  Despite the proximity of the airport, you can sleep peacefully at night.  This is due to the fact that the air harbor operates only in the daytime. </p>
