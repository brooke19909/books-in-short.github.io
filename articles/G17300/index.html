However, in history, the quietest of all Russian monarchs was only Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov, the second representative of the Romanov dynasty on the Russian throne. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/68881.jpg" width="503"></div>  He was loved by the people, religious, kind, judicious and well educated for his time.  It would seem that the rule of the ‚Äúquietest‚Äù sovereign should have been distinguished by calmness, measuredness and prosperity.  However, during the years of his reign (1645 - 1676), there were many popular unrest within the country and military conflicts with neighboring states.

    <p>  The life story of a Russian monarch <span>named Alexei</span> Mikhailovich Romanov is a biography of a significant personality who made a significant contribution to the history and culture of the Russian state. </p><p>  The son of sovereign <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> was born on March 19, 1629. According to custom, up to 5 years old mothers and nannies took care of the boy, later boyar Boris Morozov was engaged in the upbringing of the future tsar.  After the accession of his pupil to the throne, <span>Boris Morozov</span> actually ruled the country, which led to the Moscow uprising of 1648 - the ‚Äúsalt rebellion‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov biography" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/68882.jpg" width="400"></div>  This riot was an event after which Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov began to independently solve the main political issues.  In later periods of his reign, the autocrat sometimes allowed his close associates to significantly influence state affairs, but only until they carried out policies that were in his interests.  In an era when Alexey Mikhailovich Romanov ruled, the <span>state system of the</span> Russian kingdom acquired the <span>features of absolutism.</span>  Code of Legislation - The Council Code, adopted in 1649, finally enslaved the peasants and, at the same time, expanded the rights of the nobility and merchants.  Church reform of <span>Patriarch Nikon</span> led to a split in the Moscow Church (the ‚ÄúOld Believers‚Äù appeared) and a fierce church-religious struggle.

    <p>  An important foreign policy event was the conclusion of the Pereyaslav Treaty of 1654 and the unification of the territory of Ukraine with the Russian kingdom.  Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov waged war with Poland.  The war with Sweden (1656-58) over access to the Baltic Sea ended in failure.  During the 70s of the 17th century, wars with the Crimea and Turkey did not abate.  Dissatisfaction of the population with the deteriorating situation due to constant hostilities led to severely suppressed riots and uprisings (1648 and 1662 in Moscow, 1650 in Novgorod and Pskov, 1670 - 1671 under the leadership of Stepan Razin in the Don, Volga region and south <span>Moscow state).</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Romanov alexey Mikhailovich" class="if" height="306" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10953/68883.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the behest of the Silent Tsar, who ruled during the "rebellious" age, the army underwent reforms and monetary reform.  In his reign, the first warship was built, "comedy performances" (theatrical performances) took place, European culture penetrated into various spheres of life, and secular literature and secular painting appeared in traditional Russian culture. </p><p>  Alexei Mikhailovich Romanov died on January 29, 1676, blessing the son of Fedor to the kingdom. </p>
