Why should you go to Malta in November for a vacation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This is a beautiful <span>island state</span> with a rich history, many ancient buildings and interesting sights. </p><h2>  When to go to Malta? </h2><p>  It is worth approaching the choice of the season of the year with all responsibility.  The height of the season begins here in June, when the average air temperature reaches + 25-26 degrees Celsius, and the water warms up to +21 (this is quite enough for most tourists, especially Russians). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malta november weather reviews" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/561834.jpg" width="600"></div>  The hottest time is August: it is difficult to walk along the street calmly, that is, without streams of sweat all over the body.  In the evenings, especially after sunset, the air becomes very stuffy and humid, which can adversely affect the health of some people, for example, those who have certain medical contraindications to being in this type of climate.  The season ends for the "thermophilic" in September.  Namely, in autumn, you can observe velvet summers, when the temperature of the air and sea is quite acceptable for swimming, but the sun no longer burns with all its might.  The weather in November in Malta is already cool, so this mini-season is perfect for tourists who want to explore the island's endless sights or deepen their knowledge of the English language without being distracted by the tempting Mediterranean Sea.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  <span>Holidays in Malta</span> in November </h2><p>  It is in the fall that many plants bloom on the island, in addition, it is time to harvest a rich harvest.  Therefore, Malta in November does not look like a typical autumn, rather like a real Indian summer.  Resting on the island at the height of the tourist season, you can not worry about entertainment.  In this calm time, when young people have already left the place to sit at their desks in the new school year, when the sun "keeps itself within the bounds of decency" (the weather in Malta in March is very gentle), when it becomes possible to completely immerse yourself in the Maltese atmosphere - people come here for the purpose of excursion vacations or to improve working qualifications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in November in Malta" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/561835.jpg" width="600"></div>  This topic is very popular at present.  Learning a foreign language in a foreign country provides many advantages, and a certificate of qualification will excel any employee in the eyes of superiors.  True, it is worth preparing with great care for a trip at this time of year.  For example, with the approach of the evening, the temperature in Malta in November decreases significantly (to + 13-14 degrees Celsius), which gives a feeling of a breeze of wet autumn.  Therefore, it is worth taking with you things not only summer but also winter: sweaters, warm pants, sneakers, light boots and windcheaters.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What to do on the island? </h2><p>  The opportunity to see a huge number of interesting excursion sites, such as the <span>capital Valletta, the</span> old city of Mdina, the Blue Grotto or temple and church buildings, will be provided by Malta in November.  Feedback from experienced travelers suggests that all the mini-tours shown are very informative. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature in Malta in November" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/561836.jpg" width="600"></div>  Once in the bus, you can hear stories and legends about ancient soldiers and Maltese warriors.  This month, locals call it ‚Äúdead‚Äù, because the gates of all cemeteries are constantly open, and residents come to visit their relatives and friends, at the same time adorning their graves with stunningly beautiful flowers.  This entertainment is rather unusual, but many people like it.  This can only be seen by acquiring a ticket and visiting the <span>island of Malta</span> in November.  Weather (testimonial evidence of this) is often rainy, so do not forget about the umbrella.

    <h2>  English language learning </h2><p>  Malta is one of the most common places for learning a foreign language (in addition to this island you can go to the USA, Great Britain, Australia, Austria and many other countries).  In addition, living here and at the same time studying, the tourist gets the opportunity to communicate with the Maltese in English, so the language barrier just melts.  Most often, students come here during the <span>summer holidays</span> so as not to miss school or university classes, have time to sunbathe and have fun in the fun place of Pacheville.  However, the weather in November in Malta contributes to a more in-depth study of a foreign language without distraction. </p><h2>  Features of schooling </h2><p>  There are several major specialized schools known around the world (for example, EF or Berlitz).  One of them is called EC. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Malta in November" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/561837.jpg" width="600"></div>  Teachers are young and energetic guys and girls (most often aged 20 to 25 years).  And the training is not in the form of "memorized, told, received 5".  Usually it‚Äôs fun contests, games, live charades or puzzles, but all in English.  Classes last only 4 hours (two pairs with a lunch break) from Monday to Friday.  The result of this experience is the emergence of many friends of interest from various cities of Russia, deepening knowledge and obtaining a certificate of achievement.

    <h2>  Accommodation Features </h2><p>  When leaving for Malta for a typical beach holiday, you can choose absolutely any hotel (even living in a hotel located on the first coastline, you will have to cross the road lane). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Malta in November" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/561839.jpg" width="560"></div>  There is a wide selection of five-, four- and three-star hotels.  However, if you wish or when you purchase a foreign language training program, you can settle in the apartment of the local Maltese.  Usually, not one individual student is housed in each family, but 5‚Äì9 people at once (but this is even more interesting).  All students communicate, eat with the locals, learning and immersing themselves in the true culture of the island.  It is difficult to feel it, living in an ordinary hotel with a European-quality repair.  In the evenings with new friends you can go to a club located on the coast, with delicious local food and fun dancing.  The weather in November in Malta gives a chance to swim, but for this you need to know the ‚Äúright‚Äù places: for example, the nearby small island of Gozo - there is a small hidden bay with a beach called Ramla with a water temperature of + 20-22 degrees.  Although the locals no longer risk swimming at this time, they clean their swimsuits as far back as October.

    <h2>  Food on the island </h2><p>  The food here is quite varied.  When buying a ticket to Malta, it is better to take only breakfast.  The hotel feeds eggs, ham, bread and other items typical of the buffet, while in the family it is always cereal with milk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="malta november reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/561838.jpg" width="600"></div>  On the coast of any town there is a wide promenade with restaurants for every taste: fast food (‚ÄúBurger King‚Äù is the most common chain), an ice cream parlor (worth a try, since this is not the case in Russia) and, of course, local restaurants with specialties and traditional dishes <span>(fried octopus</span> in garlic sauce or grilled rabbits are delicious).  By the way, many cafes in tourist areas have Russian owners who accept their own with great joy.  Rainy weather in November in Malta even contributes to the establishment of pleasant communication.

    <h2>  Travel Tips </h2><ul><li>  In Malta, you should drink water very carefully.  Not because it can be of poor quality, but because it is easy to get a cold (especially in high season).  Water should be drunk only warm, in no case cold. </li><li>  In every city there are many souvenir shops where you can buy memorabilia for every taste: from unusual but familiar magnets to incredibly beautiful branded handmade vases. </li><li>  You should not buy things in Sliema (this town is the most popular tourist area, so the prices are high).  There are others, for example, Bugibba - the city is no less cheerful, but with prices more affordable. </li></ul><p>  Have a nice trip!  Holidays in Malta in November, August and any other month will be unforgettable! </p>
