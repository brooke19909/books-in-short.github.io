    <p>  The first <span>type of headphones</span> - "simple".  These are the so-called liners or tablets.  Usually found in phones and players.  Their main feature is the convenience of storage and use.  When folded, such a headset does not take up much space, and you can even wear it under a hat.  The appearance is not affected.  True, they are hardly suitable for a computer - the "tablets" lack sound insulation, which does not allow you to fully enjoy the sound.  Like wireless headphones with a microphone, ‚Äútablets‚Äù are not found in stores.  The so-called "plugs" can also be attributed to this type.  These are the most ‚Äúsimple headphones‚Äù, which, unlike the first option, are inserted deep into the ear. </p><p>  The second type is an overhead headset.  They have a large membrane, put on the ears on top and cover them.  Such headphones have good sound insulation, however, they can‚Äôt be put on under the heading.  They can be found as <span>Bluetooth wireless headphones</span> with a microphone.  The overhead headset is more complex than the earbuds or plugs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last kind of headphones is the monitor.  The best and most successful variation.  Their membrane covers the ears completely.  This headset has excellent sound insulation.  These are good wireless gaming headphones with a microphone (and with the wire options are also convenient).  True, they have one significant minus - the price.  For the most "simple" options, you can give 5000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  A fairly popular manufacturer of computer components is Sven.  This company is famous for its gadgets, especially gaming.  All of their products are successful, including wireless headphones with a microphone.  The price of Sven products, despite the quality, is quite affordable to all users.  Unfortunately, there are not many monitor headphones in this manufacturer.  So you can completely trust the overhead headset. </p><p>  Thanks to affordable prices and quality, Sven gives its preferences to most computer cafes and gaming clubs.  Probably, it‚Äôs hard now to find a similar institution where the monitor headset of this manufacturer would not be installed.  Even the fact that there are not so many varieties of this category does not stop the administration of enterprises and visitors.  Excellent noise isolation and noise reduction sensors - this is what helps a lot when working in the computer room.  Of course, Sven gives all the guarantees that you will not remain indifferent from the purchased headset. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Defender </h2><p>  Another popular manufacturer of computer lotions - Defender.  Headphones with a microphone wireless at this company - this is one of the main areas of production.  Actually, there is a huge variety of all types of headsets.  Most wireless products have control buttons.  Range of use usually reaches 20 meters.  As for the wireless headset, it is able to work without recharging for about a day.  Prices are significantly higher than Sven's. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="defender headphones with microphone wireless" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/617983.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Logitech </h2><p>  Another company that produces a variety of computer gadgets.

Having bought such a headset, you will forever forget about the annoying excess noise from the outside.  Such a product will be to the taste of gamers, and ordinary PC users, and business people.  Different models can also be found for every taste - and with fastening through the neck, and over the head, and in one ear. </p>

    <h2>  A4Tech </h2><p>  Do not forget about the manufacturer, which gave many users a chic choice of webcams and computer mice - A4Tech.  Like many products, wireless headphones with a microphone is another successful solution.  Especially for those who are a dedicated A4Tech user. </p><p>  You can find any headset to your taste - with and without wires.  There is no doubt about quality when you see the price - those who have already used A4Tech products already know that the manufacturer was worried about the quality and availability of their products at the same time.  You will no longer need to go shopping to find a new headset if your current one breaks - A4Tech guarantees a long service life for any of its products. </p><h2>  How do people choose? </h2><p>  However, in order to fully understand how to choose good wireless headphones with a microphone, you should interview some users and understand what they focus on when choosing.  So, after long polls, we came to the following conclusions. </p><p>  The most important point when choosing a headset, as in any purchase, is price.  Of course, no one is ready to give 5 thousand rubles for headphones that will break in a few months.  The situation is different with cheap options - users can buy a cheap headset, thinking that it can be replaced at any time with a new one. </p>

    <p>  Another criterion that quite often plays a decisive role is quality.  It's about the life of a particular technique.  As has just been said, if a headset is chosen cheap, then you can make a small "discount" for the duration of the equipment.  More expensive models do not do such indulgences.  Unfortunately, in fact, quite often it turns out that affordable and even cheap headphones serve much more than expensive "tricked out" ones.  Apparently, in the ‚Äúunpretentious‚Äù models, they just made sure that they were ‚Äúunkillable‚Äù. </p><p>  Quite often, the appearance of your headset plays a huge role.  Humanity is so arranged that no one will "lay eyes on" a bad and ugly design.  Therefore, you can find so many design options for headphones that it becomes ill.  As a rule, people are used to choosing all the computer components of the same color palette: the color of the system unit or laptop.  Quite often, preference is given to silver, white or black colors.  So, many manufacturers combine these shades so that all customers like them. </p>

    <p>  Naturally, the most important component when choosing is convenience.  If you choose wired headphones, then it is important that the wire is quite long, but within reason.  For wireless options, the role is played by recharging and range.  For example, if the average range is 20 meters, then you can safely lie on the sofa and listen to music ‚Äúbehind the laptop‚Äù, which is on the table, away from upholstered furniture. </p><p>  As you can see, the question of choosing wireless headphones, especially with a microphone, is an important and not so simple question as it seems at first glance.  In order not to miscalculate what is best for you, buy on-ear headphones of any company you wish.  See what you can afford.  The main thing is to follow the rules of operation and you can be sure that the wireless headphones with a microphone will last a long time. </p>
