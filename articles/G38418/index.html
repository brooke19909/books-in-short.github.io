Cities of Manchuria</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The name of the place about which this article is presented has different meanings.  This concept is perceived by many people who are not particularly keen on history. </p><p>  China is one of the <span>states bordering Russia,</span> and has the largest length of borders with it.  We are connected with this great eastern neighbor not only by economic and cultural relations, but also by a long common history and friendship.  In addition, due to its close proximity to Siberia, this country is very attractive for travelers and tourists. </p><h2>  What is Manchuria? </h2><p>  In fact, Manchuria (obsolete - Manzuria or Manjuria) is a historical region located in the north-east of China (east of Inner Mongolia, Dongbei region).  Until the 58-60s of the 19th century, the concept of "Manchuria" also included territories that belonged to Russia.  These are Primorye, the Khabarovsk Territory and the Amur Region, which were transferred to it under the Treaty of Aigunsky in 1858 and the Beijing Treaty of 1860.  And today, these places are sometimes called "Outer Manchuria." </p><p>  These territories have long been disputed by the Qing Empire (the last imperial dynasty of China).  And Sakhalin on Chinese maps is often portrayed as part of historical Manchuria, although this was not mentioned in the Nerchinsk Treaty.  The map shows its territory in 1941. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cities of Manchuria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2071586.jpg"></div>

The Greater Khingan Range (Sin-en-Lin in Chinese) is located in the territory of Inner Mongolia (autonomous region), it stretches from north to south.  The highest mountains (see photo below) in the southeast are Changbai Mountain (average height is 1500-1800 meters, maximum - 2745 m). </p><p>  In addition to the Amur River, which forms the border of China with Russia, the Sungari flows here, merging with Nonni Chiang, as well as the Liaohe River with numerous tributaries and Yalu. </p><p>  The climate here is quite severe.  The territory is inhabited mainly by the Chinese (mostly in the south), the Manchus, Tungus, Mongols, Japanese and Koreans.  Their main occupations are cattle breeding, agriculture and mining. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manchuria City Photos" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2071527.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Briefly about Ancient Manchuria </h2><p>  In antiquity, this area was divided into a large number of separate possessions, periodically united into a single state under the leadership of any one conquering leader and again disintegrating. </p><p>  Once the warlike tribes of the Tungus were dominant in these places, and in the south the rudiments of the Han culture arose (thanks to Chinese colonization).  Manchuria was conquered by the Khitan in the X century.  The Jurchen began to dominate here since 1115, and they created the Jin Dynasty here, which controlled not only this territory, but also almost all of northern China. </p><p>  She was conquered by the Mongols in 1234.  In 1368, after the overthrow of Mongol rule in China, the new Ming Empire (the beginning of the 15th century) tried to conquer all of Manchuria. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  And yet, over the vast period of the Minsk era, the regions of the extreme south (formerly the Liaodong Peninsula, Liaoning - modern) remained stable under Beijing rule. </p><h2>  Manchuria City </h2><p>  China in the territory described in the article, as noted above, has several cities, including Manchuria.  This is Hulun-Buir County (urban district), located administratively in an autonomous region called Inner Mongolia.  It is 4 kilometers from the border with Russia, and 6 kilometers from Zabaikalsk.  The city is the largest border land point on the border and the starting point on the Chinese national highway.  The area occupied by the city is 732 square meters.  km  It is inhabited by 170 thousand people. </p><p>  Manchuria - a city about which (and not only about it) a story is presented, is not only an important and largest land transport artery for China.  For Russian citizens, he represents one of the centers of shopping tourism. </p><p>  Not far from it is one of the largest cities and airports in China - Hailar (184 km to the city of Manchuria). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manchuria" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2071630.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  One of the most memorable places in Manchuria is the park of the fallen heroes of the Red Army, who liberated China from the Japanese.  It is visited by delegations of many countries, and candles are always burning here and there are many fresh flowers.  The trees below are beautifully highlighted in green.  The people of this country sacredly honor the heroism of the dead.  Each grave has wreaths with a thankful inscription from the <span>people of China.</span> </p><p>  The park was founded in 1915 and it was called Manchurian until 1945.  After the establishment of a giant monument in it (19 meters high) with the names of all the dead soldiers, its name was changed to "Park of the Fallen Heroes of the Red Army." </p><p>  Most visited attractions: </p><ul><li>  City Hall Square; </li><li>  state gate; </li><li>  Museum of Russian Art; </li><li>  magnificent singing fountains; </li><li>  area of ‚Äã‚Äãnesting dolls; </li><li>  miniature park. </li></ul><p>  Visiting sights can be perfectly combined with shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Manchuria City China" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2071544.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Church </h2><p>  One amazing historical and architectural monument has the city of Manchuria.  The St. Seraphim Church is an inactive temple built today in the name of St.  Seraphim, about which there is not so much information. </p><p>  It was built in 1903 by the administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway specifically for the Russian military unit.  The church at that time was equipped with the most valuable artistic icons (they were executed in Moscow and other Russian cities) and regimental shrines.  The rector of the church on October 1, 1939 was Archpriest T. Elisen, and the elder (clerk) - I. Ya. Butin. </p><h2>  Economy </h2><p>  This city of Manchuria has a rather fascinating history of development.  Just a little over twenty years ago, there was a poor village.  Today, the economy is mainly based on outbound tourism and shopping tours.  A huge number of shops, private boutiques, large shopping centers, hotels, restaurants and entertainment complexes are concentrated here. </p><p>  Manchuria began to develop actively since 1992, when it was transformed into a city of open trade.  Huge investments have been made here.  And today it is a modern city, with a predominance of European architecture. </p><p>  Among all the cities of Manchuria, this is the main one in terms of trade between China and Russia.  Shopaholics from almost all of Siberia and the surrounding regions make their purchases here.  Cunning Chinese merchants quickly organized their warehouses and outlets in Manchuria with a wide variety of products popular among traders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holy Seraphim Church Manchuria City" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2071491.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  A bit about Russians in China </h2><p>  The first clashes with the Russians began in 1658 (the Russo-Chinese war) on the border with northern Manchuria.  During the same war, they met with the Koreans.  The result of the war was the signing of the Nerchinsk Treaty in 1689, thanks to which the Gorbitsa, Amur and Argun rivers began to represent the Russian-Chinese border. </p><p>  This city located near the Siberian border with Manchuria has long become one of the favorite places of Russian citizens.  The millionth Russian diaspora in China is based on the builders of the famous East China Railway, which connected the Far East and Siberia with Manchuria.  And the Great October Socialist Revolution forced many Russians to emigrate from the country.  The regiments of General Semenov fled to Manchuria, fleeing the Red Army.  Also here many noblemen found their refuge with their families. </p><p>  Russian churches and schools began to be built in the emigrant settlements, several committees of Cossack elders were created.  Russian at the beginning of the last century became very common in Manchuria.  The Russians have developed friendly, warm relations with the local population. </p><p>  Great damage to the Russian diaspora was inflicted during the civil war and the "cultural revolution" in China.  Today, the diaspora in Manchuria consists of 13 thousand people. </p>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The amazing city, located near the very border of Russia with China, is often called "the most Russian city in the Middle Kingdom" or, even more interestingly, the "central Russian-Chinese department store." </p><p>  The city is well known in the field of online commerce.  Every third Aliexpress store has its own warehouse here. </p>
