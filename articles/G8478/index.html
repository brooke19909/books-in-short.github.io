    <h2>  A trip to China: vacation in November </h2><p>  At that time, in mainland China, it is wintering, which means that, compared to the previous hot months, the land is cooling down.  Tourists who can hardly stand the stuffiness or the exhausting heat will call the weather reigning in the Middle Kingdom this month magnificent.  There is no need to talk about significant cold weather (except for the northern regions, however, for vacationers). </p><p>  You need to start a walk along the wide avenue of the metropolis with equipment in the form of a quilted coat and sweater.  After warming properly, you can go to study China.  In October-November, it is especially beautiful here: colorful leaves are circling in the air, outstanding monuments and architectural structures stand majestically, sports are held in the parks, and somewhere in the mountains there is another ascent of extreme tourists. </p><p>  Rains in these months will rarely disturb.  Therefore, taking an umbrella on a trip is not necessary. </p>

    <p>  As a rule, any visit to the Celestial Empire is not complete without acquaintance with the capital.  The climatic norm for Beijing surprises all tourists: from 0 to 10 ¬∞ C. The daily temperature difference is a characteristic feature.  Most often, it manifests itself in the summer.  Meanwhile, while you are considering whether to go to China in November, real winter has come in Heilongjiang. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Considering options for beach activities and a trip to China as a whole in November, the sea has cooled down for a long time (we are talking about Yellow), and the dead season reigns in this resort.  In <span>Hong Kong, the coast</span> will be only half full.  After all, not everyone will decide to swim in water with a temperature of +23 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The best option for a beach holiday are considered to be the resorts of Hainan.  But the main habitat of local residents is the city of Sanya.  Fans of fine sand should pay attention to Pui O, for families with children it is better to choose Repulse Bay, and avid surfers should definitely try the waves of Cheung Sha and enjoy the resort's steady winds. </p><p>  Most of the beach tours involve a visit to the city of Sanya, namely, its bays and bays.  Weather conditions here are very rosy: the water temperature is +25 <sup>o</sup> C and a large number of clear, sunny days. </p><p>  There are no hot midday hours during this period, so the task of finding a rescue shadow is no longer needed.  However, it is not recommended to leave your skin without a protective cream from the sun.  Despite the low level of insolation, it is not safe. </p><p>  In addition to swimming, sunbathing and lazy lying on the white sand, Hainan is interesting in terms of diving.  The marine ecosystem, preserved in its original form, will please with an abundance of coral thickets and a diverse underwater flora. </p><h2>  Air temperature </h2><p>  In November, the first snow always falls in the administrative center of Harbin.  During the day, the temperature is fixed at +1 <sup>o</sup> C, but at night it drops to -12 <sup>o</sup> C. Although, according to tourists, due to the lack of wind, frosty weather is not noticeable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Relatively warm in November in Tibet.  In the afternoon, the temperature reaches +11 ¬∞ C, but with the onset of the evening you can not do without a down jacket: the degree drops to -5 Celsius.  The weather is dry and incredibly sunny. </p><p>  If you do not want to take a large amount of sunshine on a trip, go to "Chinese New York", that is, to Shanghai.  The absolute maximum in autumn is +17 <sup></sup> , and the minimum +9 <sup></sup> . The only minus of the city is dampness.  Precipitation here is almost 1/3 of the month. </p><p>  Tourists who come to the central regions often complain of excessive dryness.  And this is not surprising, because here it is much cooler 3-9 <sup>about</sup> C. </p>

    <p>  Hong Kong, Guangdong and Hainan Island are considered to be a comfort zone in the fall.  During the day there is +25 ¬∞ C, and in the evening at least +19 ¬∞ C. </p><h2>  What to do in the Middle Kingdom in the fall </h2><p>  <span>A trip to China</span> in November is a unique opportunity to combine seemingly incompatible activities.

    <h2>  Tours and activities </h2><p>  At any time of the year, China is a combination of modernity and antiquity, which is found literally everywhere: in traditions, the appearance of cities, in cultures and even in the habits of the population.  The country is so rich that any tourist will find something to their liking.  And it is November weather that will help to ensure that every guest of the Celestial Empire leaves here with a lot of impressions and a desire to return here again. </p><p>  Many educational programs are designed specifically for anyone who wants to see and enjoy exotic beauty with their own eyes and touch the origins of wisdom.  It remains only to calculate your finances and choose a tour that meets all the needs of your preferences. </p><p>  In China, there are more than 750 monuments that are included in the list of objects of great value in the world.  And the most outstanding of them, of course, is the Great Wall of China, where every tourist is obliged to visit. </p>

    <p>  In order not to spoil your trip with annoying souvenir merchants, experienced travelers offer to go to the region of Gubeikou or Symatai.  Arriving in Beijing, be sure to set aside several hours to visit local attractions.  Literally at every step you can meet unusual palaces and Buddhist temples.  The evening can be completed by visiting the opera. </p><p>  Shanghai and Hong Kong, the so-called skyscraper cities, deserve special attention.  In addition to night lights, they attract tourists with a wide range of entertainment and interesting architecture. </p><h2>  The cost of the autumn tour to China </h2><p>  Prices for trips to the Celestial Empire in the period from October to November are diverse.  But in general, their cost is much lower than summer.  Catch a good offer can tourists interested in the resort of Hainan. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the tourist flow in the autumn is not so great, so it is likely that the trip will take place calmly and without fuss. </p>

    <h2>  Festivals and Holidays </h2><p>  Arriving in China in November, be sure to visit Shanghai.  This month, the city hosts the International Festival of Arts and student performances. </p><p>  On November 8, a relatively recent young holiday, Journalist's Day, is celebrated.  In Beijing, on this occasion, a festive concert is held annually at the House of National Assemblies. </p><p>  In order to get acquainted with the culture and traditions of the Celestial Empire, in November, the Guilin City hosts the Tourism Festival. </p><h2>  <span>Sanya</span> City <span>(China)</span> in November </h2><p>  The weather this month, though cool, but comfortable.  The average air temperature ranges from +22 <sup>o</sup> C to +28 <sup>o</sup> C. It is believed that the end of autumn is the best time to travel to Sanya, as there is a slowdown in the tourist season. </p><p>  Keep in mind that visiting the beach without sunscreen is unacceptable.  From clothes for daytime walks, you can take t-shirts, jeans and shorts with you.  But early in the morning and evening, it gets a little cool here.  Therefore, a sweater or a warm jacket with long sleeves will not be superfluous in your suitcase. </p><p>  In general, autumn is no reason to abandon an exciting and eventful trip to China. </p>
