  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to Choose a Digital Camera</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When buying a <span>camera, the choice,</span> as for any other equipment, should be made on the basis of technical specifications.  However, it will not be superfluous to find out the reviews of those who already own such a camera and compare the pictures taken with different cameras.  You can ask friends and acquaintances for their opinions.  But now we‚Äôll talk about <span>how to choose a</span> digital <span>camera</span> based on a comparison of technical specifications. </p><p>  When choosing a digital camera, the first characteristic that you need to pay attention to is the number of megapixels.  This characteristic shows the possibility of obtaining the maximum resolution of photographs taken with this camera without loss of quality.  To get good pictures, to store them in your home album, just 2-3 megapixels is enough.  For simple amateur shooting, 3-5 megapixels are enough, such cameras already make it possible to use optical zoom, choose shooting modes and have a ton of other options.  There are also cameras with a resolution of more than 10 megapixels, in recent years their number has expanded significantly, but for ordinary amateur shooting this is already quite a big figure. </p><p>  When thinking about how to choose the right camera, you need to consider that the <span>matrix of the camera</span> has the main influence on the quality of the image <span>.</span>  She is responsible for the noise in the image, color reproduction and the depth of drawing small details.  To get high-quality images, the camera must be able to adjust the sensitivity in manual mode.  Then it will be possible to get high-quality photos even in low light.  Before choosing a digital camera, pay attention to the capabilities of its optics.  A parameter such as zoom is optical or digital.  High-quality cameras have both, and cheap cameras usually have only digital. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The quality of the resulting images will greatly depend on the capabilities of the camera electronics.  Most of them write data in <span>JPEG format,</span> since it requires less memory space.  If the TIFF and RAW formats are supported, then this already speaks of a higher level of the camera and the quality of the electronics.  Before choosing a digital camera, pay attention to what kind of power source it has.  It does not affect the quality of the resulting images, but it is very important for ease of use.  Often cameras use finger batteries, which are enough for a small number of shots.  It is much more convenient if the camera is equipped with batteries, but if there is no power outlet nearby, it is advisable to have a spare battery. </p><p>  Most often, the image in the camera is saved in an external <span>memory card.</span>  The speed of the camera does not depend on the type of memory card used.  Memory cards differ only in format, volume and price, the most common today are SD cards.  Many people thinking about how to choose a digital camera, pay great attention to its display.  Using the displays of modern cameras is very convenient, you can immediately view the captured frame and, if necessary, make a new one.  The display replaces the viewfinder, making it possible to shoot from an uncomfortable position.  It displays all the camera settings and it is extremely convenient to use.  It is important that the display has a resolution as large as possible so that the picture on it is clear enough.  Another factor in solving the problem of which camera to choose is the presence of a flash.  A camera without a flash practically does not allow shooting in low light.  The built-in flashes in cheap models help to some extent, but often they only illuminate the picture and create a red-eye effect.  In good devices, the flash is usually synchronized when taking pictures, this makes it possible to get good photos in low light.  In any case, for the final choice of the camera you need to decide for what purpose you need it. </p>
