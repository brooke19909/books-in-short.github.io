Why is this happening?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Household appliances often fail, but if you know the cause of the breakdown, you can quickly return it to its previous mode of operation.  This also applies to washing machines.  That something went wrong may indicate error codes on the device‚Äôs display.  If you have an Indesit washing machine and all the indicators flash at the same time, you need to find out what caused the breakdown.  In most cases, diagnostics can be carried out independently.  This also applies to repair work. </p><h2>  What could it be? </h2><p>  The flashing of all indicators on the Indesit washing machine is one of the common problems that owners of this brand's equipment are facing.  If all the lights started to glow, then most likely this indicates a board malfunction.  In this case, it may be necessary to replace certain of its elements. </p>

    <p>  In most cases <span>, the Indesit washing machine does not turn on</span> and all indicators flash when the contacts burn out due to water getting on the circuit board.  You can cope with such work yourself, especially if you have the skills to use a soldering iron.  Sometimes the breakdown can be more serious, and the board will have to be completely changed, which involves large financial costs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to find and fix a malfunction? </h2><p>  So, if all the indicators on the Indesit washing machine are blinking, you will first have to check the condition of the electronic board.  To remove it, the machine will have to be disassembled. </p><p>  Before starting repair work, the equipment must be de-energized.  The case is disassembled very easily.  First, the control panel is unscrewed, which is fixed on two bolts on the back of the case.  After removing it, you need to unscrew the hexagonal screws on which the board rests, and then carefully disconnect all wires from the board. </p>

    <p>  Now you can begin to inspect the seized part - the board.  Particular attention should be paid to capacitors C17, C16, C20.  If one of them fails, then its upper part may turn out to be swollen.  A failed capacitor must be removed and look at its marking.  The part must be replaced with an identical one by soldering.  After that, the washing machine can be assembled. </p><h2>  Rare causes of flashing indicators </h2><p>  If all the indicators on the Indesit washing machine blink, then not only the board breakdown may be to blame.  There are a number of reasons why this kind of problem happens.  These include: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  self draining water; </li><li>  breakdown of the heating element for heating water or drying; </li><li>  motor breakdown; </li><li>  failure of the drain pump; </li><li>  failure of the command device. </li></ul><p>  The heating elements of the unit are subject to wear, which leads to their failure.  In this regard, the operation of the equipment itself may be disrupted.  That is why all the indicators blink on the Indesit washing machine. </p><p>  To find out why all the lights are on, you can use a multimeter and check what condition the heater is in.  If it was discovered that he had failed, he would need to be replaced. </p>

    <p>  As for the breakdown of the electric motor, this part breaks down quite rarely.  However, if this trouble nevertheless happened, then, most likely, the wear of the brushes contributed to this.  After replacing them, you can resume the work of the part. </p><p>  Another common cause of <span>malfunction of the washing machine</span> is the failure of the drain pump.  Sometimes it becomes clogged, which also leads to malfunctions.  In this case, the problem is easily solved - you just need to clean it from debris.  When the breakdown is more serious, you will need to install a new pump. </p><p>  The failure of a mechanical command device is a rare phenomenon, since this part of the machine is considered one of the most durable.  But it happens that the contacts burn out in it, which is why all the indicators blink on the Indesit washing machine.  To fix the problem, it is enough to clean the contacts and reconnect them.  Sometimes in KSMA the gear breaks down.  In this situation, it all depends on the model of technology, since in some of them it is necessary to change this part to a new one. </p><h2>  The flashing lock: what to do? </h2><p>  This type of breakdown of the washing machine does not end there.  If the lock indicator flashes on the Indesit washing machine, there may be several reasons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="indesit washing machine flashing lock indicator" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44149/1963997.jpg" width="549"></div>  The lock indicator may flash, but the machine does not start to erase.  Moreover, if you disconnect the equipment from the network and turn it on again, the problem may not be resolved.  It also happens that the light is on, the device erases, but there is a program failure.

    <h2>  Hatch lock indicator flashes </h2><p>  When the lock indicator of the hatch on the Indesit washing machine flashes, it may seem that the lock device is out of order.  However, this is not a natural phenomenon.  The thing is that outdated models of ‚Äúwashing machines‚Äù had a simplified design.  This can be attributed to both advantages and disadvantages.  The plus is that models of such a plan are more reliable.  But as for the minus, it lies in the inability to establish the exact cause of the breakdown, since the error detection system in such machines does not always give accurate information. </p>

    <p>  So, if the lock indicator is lit on the panel, then such breakdowns could lead to this: </p><ul><li>  Failure of the lock itself on the door.  If the hatch lock indicator is blinking, this particular part of the washing machine is the first to be checked.  Sometimes the lock hole may become clogged, which is easily resolved by cleaning.  In some cases, it will be necessary to replace the old part with a new one. </li><li>  Malfunction of the heater.  Failure of the lock indicator may result in failure of the tubular heater.  In most cases, with such a breakdown, the machine erases in the previous mode, but the light continues to glow.  But it also happens that the technique fails, freezes or confuses programs. </li><li>  Damage to the water pressure sensor in the tank.  Its purpose is to determine the required amount of water for washing.  Over time, it can work intermittently, which will cause such an error.  As a rule, this part cannot be repaired, so you will have to replace it with a new one. </li><li>  Board breakage.  This part may burn out due to power surges, water ingress. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Indesit washing machines cannot be called unreliable, despite the fact that breakdowns can occur with them.  If malfunctions were detected in the Indesit washing machine and all indicators blink, then the problem can be easily resolved by replacing the worn part with a new one.  This, as a rule, does not imply a large financial investment, so it is soon possible to exploit your housework in the same mode. </p>
