    <p>  Being in the sixth grade, Konstantin discovers outstanding abilities and takes first place in the regional physics Olympiad, and a little later, at the All-Union Olympiad, he repeats the success, entering the top ten.  In 1991 he graduated from the additional Correspondence School of Physics and Technology and in the same year became a student at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  He is studying in the specialty "Nanotechnology" at the Faculty of Physical and Quantum Electronics, and graduates with honors from the institute, after which he is hired at the Institute of Microelectronics Technology Problems RAS, Chernogolovka.  There he graduated from graduate school under the leadership of Yuri Dubrovsky. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Konstantin Sergeevich Novoselov Nobel Prize" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45314/1590753.jpg" width="515"></div>

There, at the University of Nijmegen, he works with Andrei Game.  Since 2001, scientists have been working together at the University of Manchester.  In 2004 he received a Ph.D. (supervisor Jan-Kees Maan). </p><p>  At the moment, Konstantin Sergeevich Novoselov is a professor at the Royal Society and professor of physical and mathematical sciences at the University of Manchester and has dual citizenship (Russia and the United Kingdom).  Now lives in Manchester. </p><h2>  Research </h2><p>  What is Konstantin Sergeevich Novoselov known for?  According to the analytical agency Thomson Reuters, the Russian-British physicist is one of the often cited scientists.  190 scientific articles came out from under his pen.  However, his most significant study is, of course, graphene.  Many have heard this word that seems simple and familiar.  The technology is really concise and elegant, like all ingenious.  Further study of <span>graphene and its application will</span> probably introduce humanity into the era of ultrafast and ultra-thin mobile and computer devices, electric cars and durable, but very lightweight structures. </p>

    <h2>  Awards </h2><p>  When Konstantin Sergeyevich Novoselov began working at the University of Manchester, his head was a senior colleague from Russia, <span>Andrei Geim.</span>  By that time, he had long been engaged in research in this area and was able to reproduce the mechanism of adhesion of the gecko's paws, and on the basis of it he created an adhesive tape, which physicists later used to work with graphene.  Prior to this, a certain Chinese student helped the Game, but, according to the physicist himself, the work began to advance only after Novoselov Konstantin Sergeyevich got down to business.  The Nobel Prize was awarded to them in October 2010.  Novoselov is now known as the youngest Nobel laureate in physics (over the past 37 years), moreover, at the moment he is the only scientist among Nobel prizes born later than 1970. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the same 2010, Novoselov received the rank of commander of the Order of the Netherlands Lion for his significant contribution to the science of the Netherlands, and a little later, in 2011, the decree of Queen Elizabeth ll makes him a bachelor knight, already for his contribution to the science of Great Britain.  The knighting ceremony took place a little later, in the spring of 2012, as expected, in Buckingham Palace.  Led her queen's daughter, Princess Anne. </p><p>  I must say that Konstantin Sergeevich Novoselov, whose scientific and social activities are very extensive, received another prestigious award for research on graphene, becoming the winner of the 2008 Europhysics Prize.  She is awarded once every two years, there were only thirteen Nobel laureates among her prize-winners.  The bonus is a cash reward and a corresponding certificate.  He also received the Kurti Prize, but not for graphene, but for the list of achievements in working with the field of low temperatures and magnetic fields. </p>

    <h2>  About family and life </h2><p>  Konstantin Novoselov is happy in marriage with his wife Irina.  Although she is also Russian, scientists met abroad, in the Netherlands.  Irina comes from Vologda, is engaged in research in the field of microbiology, <span>Ph.D.</span> (defended her thesis in St. Petersburg).  The couple has two daughters, twins Sofya and Vika were born in 2009. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Konstantin Sergeyevich, in his own words, is not the father who spent weeks in the laboratory missing the childhood of his own children.  For him to invent the smallest transistor in the world and teach his daughter to count to twenty-seven - something that is in the same row.  ‚ÄúNo one has ever done this before you,‚Äù he says. </p><p>  In turn, his parents never tried to limit his son in the interests.  They were always sure that their son was very gifted, and, as the physicist himself says, they were not surprised when he received the Nobel Prize. </p><p>  In an interview with Esquire magazine, he admitted that he wanted to learn how to play the piano.  He is trained, however, by his own admission, the results are still mediocre. </p><h2>  About the USSR </h2><p>  Konstantin Sergeyevich was born in the USSR and received an excellent education.  He himself admits that such deep knowledge is not enough where to get.  But she‚Äôs not going to return to Russia.  Perhaps, precisely because of this, some journalists involuntarily blame him for the lack of patriotism.  To this, the scientist replies that it is not about money, it's just that working in Britain is calmer, because no one intervenes in your affairs. </p><p>  Novoselov takes life lightly, does not focus on failures - this is one of his basic rules.  If difficulties arise in relations with people, he tries not to bring to a break, but, if it is inevitable, leaves the last word to another person.  A famous physicist has many ordinary life problems, for example, he would be ready to spend any money just to get some free time. </p><p>  But he does not divide his life into work and rest, perhaps this is the key to the scientist‚Äôs productivity.  At home, he thinks about physics, but at work - he just relaxes with his soul. </p>

    <h2>  What is graphene </h2><p>  Despite, of course, all the advances in physics, Novoselov‚Äôs main work was and remains graphene for now.  This structure, which was first obtained by our compatriots for the first time in laboratory conditions, is a two-dimensional "network" of carbon atoms with a thickness of only one atom.  Novoselov himself claims that the technology is not complicated and anyone can create graphene, almost from improvised means.  He says that it‚Äôs enough to start with buying good graphite, although you can even use pencils, as well as spend a little on silicon substrates and scotch tape.  Everything, the set for creating graphene is ready!  Thus, the material will not become the property of exclusively large corporations, Novoselov and Game literally gave it to the whole world. </p><h2>  Amazing properties </h2><p>  The physicist is also surprised at the electronic properties of this material.  According to him, graphene can be used in transistors, which some companies are trying to do now, replacing the usual parts in mobile devices. </p><p>  According to Novoselov, graphene will revolutionize technology.  An integral part of any science fiction film is incredible gadgets, transparent, thin, non-breakable and with great functionality.  If graphene gradually replaces obsolete silicon, cinema technologies will come to life. </p><p>  What else is noteworthy research Novoselova and Game?  The fact that they almost instantly migrated from laboratories to conveyors, and even more - were very useful in the early years. </p>

    <h2>  Technologies of the future </h2><p>  Where is graphene used now?  It would seem that so recently discovered material could not yet be widely disseminated, and in part this is indeed so.  Almost all the developments are experimental so far and have not been mass-produced.  However, they are trying to apply this material literally in all areas, which, perhaps, can be called a real "graphene fever." </p><p>  Graphene itself, despite its low weight and almost complete transparency (it absorbs 2% of the transmitted light, is exactly the same as ordinary window glass), the material is very durable.  Recent studies by American scientists have shown that graphene mixes well with plastic.  This results in super-strong material that can be used in all areas, from furniture and mobile phones to rocket science. </p><p>  From graphene, prototypes of batteries for electric cars have already been created.  They are distinguished by high capacity and short charging time.  Perhaps this is how the problem with electric cars will be solved, and transport will become cheap and environmentally friendly. </p><p>  Graphene is used in the development of new touch panels for phones.  If classic sensors can only work on a flat surface, graphene is free from this drawback, because it can be bent as you like.  In addition, high electrical conductivity will make the response minimal. </p>

    <h2>  In aviation </h2><p>  The shells of rockets and aircraft made using graphene will be several times lighter, which will greatly reduce fuel costs.  Flights will become so cheap that everyone can afford to travel to the other side of the earth.  But, in addition to passenger traffic, this will, of course, affect freight.  The supply of remote corners of the planet will become much better, which means that more people will live and work there. </p>
