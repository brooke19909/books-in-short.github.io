He bears his name.  Raoul‚Äôs law is based on certain bonds that reduce vapor pressure over diluted solutions of non-electrolytes.  A comparative decrease in the pressure of the impregnated steam is the same as the molar fraction of the diluted substance.  The French scientist deduced this law by studying diverse solutions of liquids (non-volatile) and <span>substances (solid).</span> </p><p>  From Raoul‚Äôs law one can learn that an increase in the boiling point or a decrease in the freezing point of a diluted solution in relation to undiluted in proportion to the molar accumulation of a substance is used to find its <span>molecular weight.</span> </p><p>  <span>An ideal solution</span> is called one that, with all its characteristics, fits the relevant requirements of Raoult's law.  More approximate solutions can be considered only those that relate to non-polar gases and liquids.  That is, their constituent molecules should not change their direction in an existing electric field.  Consequently, the heat of their disclosure will be zero.  And then the properties of the solutions will not be difficult to find out, since it is only necessary to take into account their initial property of the component and proportionality, in which mixing occurs in a chaotic manner. </p><p>  With real solutions, such a calculation is practically impossible.  Because during the formation of solutions, as a rule, heat is generated or the opposite situation occurs - the solution absorbs this heat into itself. </p><p>  An exothermic process is the process in which heat is generated, and an endothermic process is the one where it is absorbed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The colligative characteristics of the solution are those that are mainly dependent on the <span>concentration of the solution,</span> and not on the naturally occurring diluted substance.  Significant collective dimensions are pressure, freezing point of the solution, and the proportional pressure of the solvent vapor itself. </p><p>  Raoul‚Äôs first law combines the pressure of concentrated vapor over a solution with its composition.  The definition of this law is written as follows: Pi = Pio * Xi. </p><p>  The proportional pressure of the accumulated vapor in the components of the solutions is directly proportional to its molar fractions in this solution.  In this case, the proportionality coefficient will be equal to the pressure of the concentrated vapor over the insoluble component. </p><p>  Since the total total result of the <span>molar fractions of the</span> whole components of the solutions is 1, then for a binary solution consisting of such components as A and B, we can derive the following relationship, which also coincides with the expression of the first Raoult law: (P0A-PA) / P0A = XB. </p><p>  The second law of Raoul - this is a consequence of the first law, named after the scientist from France.  This law is valid only for some diluted solutions. </p><p>  The decrease in the freezing point of carefully diluted solutions of non-volatile substances is directly proportional to the molar accumulation of solutions, and they do not have any dependence on the natural diluted substance: T0fr-Tfr = Tfr = Km. </p><p>  The increase <span>in the boiling point of</span> some diluted solutions of non-volatile substances does not depend on the very nature of the diluted substance, and it is directly proportional to the molar component of the solutions: T0b-Tb = Tb = Em. </p><p>  The ebullioscopic constant, that is, the coefficient E, is the difference between the direct boiling point of the solution and the temperature of the completely undiluted solution. </p><p>  The cryoscopic constant, that is, the coefficient K, is the difference between the freezing temperature of a solution and the temperature of a completely undiluted solution. </p>
