Due to the fact that the depth begins to increase only from about 20 meters from the beach, this place is considered a paradise for families with children.  The only moment that may upset tourists who arrived in August is the flowering of water.

The swimming season opens in early June, and sometimes in May.  In the middle of summer, the water warms up to +28 ° .  Salinity in the bay is lower than in the sea itself.  This is explained by many large rivers that flow into the water area.  This is Don, Kalmius and others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="growths on the Don Sea of ​​Azov" class="if" height="496" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1318444.jpg" width="600"></div>
