Mersin is an excellent Turkish resort, where history and nature have merged.  This city can be called the most modern metropolis of the Mediterranean.  The resort is famous for its skyscrapers, picturesque parks, ultra-modern hotels, shopping centers and a free trade area.  In the days of the Roman Empire, modern Mersin was called Zephyrion, it was still considered a major port.  It was in these places that <span>Marc Anthony</span> met with the beautiful Cleopatra. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Mersin" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/440927.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A bit about the past </h2><p>  This region has been populated since the 7th millennium BC.  e.  During archaeological excavations on the Yumyuk-Tepe hill, an archaeologist from England John Garstang found as many as 23 cultural layers, of which the earliest dates from 6300 BC.  e.  In 4500 BC  e.  city ‚Äã‚Äãfortifications were erected, and their construction began was approximately between 3200-1200 year.  The city of Mersin (Turkey) was mentioned by many authors.  The ancient Greeks called this city Zephyrion.  The ancient Greek geographer Strabo mentions this area as Cilicia with the capital Tartus, and he calls Mersin the main gate of Cilicia.  True, after the heyday of Constantinople, all trade was transferred there, and Mersin lost its significance.  Later, in honor of the emperor Hadrian, the city was renamed Andrianopolis.  Now the metropolis is divided into four districts: Toroslar, Mezitli, Yenishehir and Akdeniz. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport </h2><p>  If you look at Mersin (Turkey) on the map, you can see that it is located in the southeast of the country.  The closest airport to the city is considered international - Adana, which is 69 km away.  A little east of the city of Tarsus (45 km from Mersin) there is a new Chukurov airport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey Mr. Mersin" class="if" height="289" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/440928.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  Between the resort and the surrounding provinces, road and rail links are well developed.  By the way, the railway was built here in 1866, with the help of it cotton was delivered to the port.  During the civil war between the northern and southern states of the United States, as well as during the blockade of the South, Mersin was of significant strategic importance due to the ability to supply cotton.  <span>Highways</span> connect the resort with all Turkish provinces. </p><h2>  The most important port </h2><p>  What Turkey doesn‚Äôt surprise!  Mersin is not only a luxury resort, but also one of the most important ports in the country.  There are more than 23 docks and piers, which generally form an area of ‚Äã‚Äã786,000 m¬≤.  <span>The</span> port's <span>capacity</span> is more than 3800 vessels per year, it also has sea links with more than a hundred international ports. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mersin city Turkey photo" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/440932.jpg" width="360"></div>

As a rule, only local and visiting Turks from all over the country rested in this region.  It is worth noting that there are really enough beautiful places in Turkey, but only in Mersin can you feel an extraordinary sense of peace and unity with the natural environment.  Over time, overseas travelers who came here just on an excursion also felt this.  The city of Mersin, Turkey (photos of the city clearly demonstrate that the metropolis is developing very rapidly), it only benefited from the influx of holidaymakers.  Now it is a large beautiful seaport, where passenger and merchant ships, pleasure yachts, boats, ferries, boats, etc., moored between Cyprus and Turkey.  It was the port that created excellent conditions for ensuring the rapid flowering of the city.  Thus, Mersin became famous not only within the borders of his native country, but throughout the Mediterranean region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mersin Turkey on the map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/440925.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Rest in Mersin (Turkey) </h2><p>  Mersin attracts tourists with its aroma of palm alleys, cozy restaurants, beautiful beaches and beautiful parks.  The appearance of the city is modern, comfortable, multi-story hotels with well-maintained beaches that harmoniously coexist with amazing historical sites.  There really is a lot to see here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Not far from Mersin are the remains of the ancient settlement of Sola, previously called Pompeipol.  It was built during the Neolithic period, but, unfortunately, it was destroyed due to the earthquake of 525.  Fortunately, the remains of an arcade, temple, necropolis and termia have been preserved here to this day.  On the western edge of the metropolis you can see the ruins of the Hittite fortress, dated 13-15 century BC.  e. </p><p>  In the city of Tarsus, which is located in the province of Mersin, tourists are attracted by the well of St. Paul, a waterfall, the Ulu Mosque (1st century BC.) And the gate of Cleopatra.  On the coastline of Mersin-Silifke are the ancient ancient cities of Korikos, Viranshehir, Pompeipolis, Kanlydivan, Kyz Kalesi.  The view from the Maiden Fortress (Kyz Kalesi) is especially impressive; it is located on a tiny island 200 meters from the coast.  In the northwest of this fortress, in the village of Narly Kuyu, you can see the caves of Ada and Paradise with <span>stalagmites and stalactites.</span> </p><p>  It is worth noting that Turkey is not one of the monuments of antiquity.  Mersin is the city where one of the tallest buildings in the country is located - a 52-story building with a height of 177 meters under the name "Metrim-Tower" was built here back in 1987. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mersin city Turkey" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/440930.jpg" width="513"></div>

    <p>  In Mersin, you should see the Eski Mosque, which is considered the most important architectural monument of the Ottoman era.  It was built in 1870 and succumbed to restoration at different times.  A landmark of Mersin are Roman baths engraved with exquisite mosaics.  The Mersin province is also known worldwide for the fact that Marc Anthony presented Cleopatra with land between Alanya and Mersin as a <span>"modest" wedding</span> gift. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  The gastronomic delights of the region are a separate matter.  What goodies generous Turkey does not offer you!  Mersin is a truly gastronomic capital of the country.  A very delicious dish is a tortilla called bieber emek.  For those who are not dedicated to the mysteries of <span>Turkish cuisine, the</span> bieber emek may seem like pizza, but in fact the tortilla is saturated with a special sauce, due to which it has a rather piquant taste that significantly distinguishes it from the national Italian bread with toppings.  Fans of sweets will be interested to try the unusual oriental sweet jeserie.  Despite the fact that it is prepared from ordinary walnuts and carrots, nobody can leave indifferent this delicacy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Mersin Turkey" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/440929.jpg" width="600"></div>
