It is being built on the territory of Pavlovskaya Sloboda, near the Istra River.  A characteristic feature of the LCD is that it is a combination of suburban housing and a city apartment in a fabulous place. </p><h2>  Concept </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ndv.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD fairy tale layout" class="if uuid-2972765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972765.jpg"></div><p>  The entire project was developed by the developer himself, so he is personally interested in its high-quality implementation.  The residential complex was conceived as a family housing.  The history of the facility impresses with its non-standard approach.  For example, landscape and architectural forms were painted based on a fairy tale.  She became the main reference point for contractors.  At the entrance to the residential complex there is even a fabulous signpost. </p><p>  The task of the developer was to combine the advantages of a rustic lifestyle with the dignity of an apartment building.  At the same time, the developer moved away from accepted housing standards, but he followed all the technical requirements. </p><p>  The new building of the residential complex "Fairy Tale" is located in the prestigious Istra district.  This area has a rather rich history.  It would seem more logical here was the construction of a closed cottage village.  However, according to representatives of the developer, they wanted to build not just a residential complex, but a real place for communication.  Cottage building with its buildings isolated from each other was completely unsuitable for this purpose.  And so the project of the Skazka residential complex appeared with unusual courtyards and non-trivial infrastructure.  The project is more focused on active creative family people who, even in adulthood, retain a craving for adventure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  So what do you need to know about this?  LCD "Fairy Tale" in Moscow is located 24 km along the Novorizhskoe highway from the Moscow Ring Road.  Travel time without traffic jams is approximately half an hour.  You can get to the place through the villages of Leshkovo and Velednikov, but it will be faster to make a small detour on Lenin Street along Novorizhskoye Shosse. </p><p>  Where is the Tale LCD?  The address of the houses of the <span>residential complex is</span> assigned within the boundaries of the village of Pavlovskaya Sloboda.  Even during rush hours, the track remains not too busy.  The road to the complex runs through small towns.  The nearest major cities, such as Krasnogorsk and Nakhabino, are located to the north.  Mostly traffic jams on Novorizhskoye highway occur in the vicinity of the village of Stepanovskoye and the village of Golevo.  Traffic increases many times at the end of the week, regardless of the season. </p><p>  Even though the highway has good throughput, the transport accessibility of the Skazka residential complex remains complicated due to traffic in Pavlovskaya Sloboda itself.  The streets themselves are rather narrow, and the population density is high.  Therefore, during peak hours, severe traffic jams occur.  In the future, it is planned to reconstruct the road adjacent to the residential complex, but this will only slightly improve the transport situation. </p><h2>  Public transport </h2><div class="photo" data-original="nd-groups.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the complex" class="if uuid-2972777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972777.jpg"></div><p>  How to get to the city from the LCD "Fairy Tale"?  Reviews confirm that the journey takes a lot of time.  By land transport you can get to the Nakhabino station.  Here trains and express trains stop.  It takes approximately 50 minutes to get to the Riga Station, and 22 minutes to the Tushino Station.  So you can easily and without traffic jams get to the following metro stations: "Tushinskaya", "Riga", "Voikovskaya", "Dmitrovskaya", "Kurskaya", "Komsomolskaya". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Getting to the railway platform itself is not very convenient.  From the residential complex to the stop you need to walk more than a kilometer, and then another 20 minutes by bus or bus (20, 21, 22).  Thus, the journey time to the nearest metro station takes more than an hour. </p><p>  You can get from Moscow to the residential complex on the minibus 480. She walks from the metro stations "Strogino" and "Schukinskaya".  Without traffic jams, the travel time will be 50 minutes.  Transport runs every 40-60 minutes.  While the transport accessibility of the residential complex can hardly be called comfortable due to the remoteness and traffic jams.  The developer plans to launch several minibuses from the residential complex directly to metro stations. </p><h2>  Environmental friendliness </h2><p>  The residential complex has its own advantages.  One of them is environmental friendliness and amazing nature.  "Fairy Tale" is located in a very picturesque area - on a peninsula enveloped by Istra.  On the opposite bank is a small cottage village and forest.  There are no harmful industries near the residential complex.  In itself, the Novorizhskoe direction is considered premium.  There is no dense housing development. </p><p>  Local residents surrendering LCD "Fairy Tale" caused discontent.  This was due to the closure of access to water.  Potential buyers are also scared by the risk of a river spill with subsequent flooding of houses.  In fact, the developer complies with all the technical requirements for construction near water bodies.  In the future, the embankment will be equipped here. </p><h2>  LCD structure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="novostroyki.realt.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="complex feature" class="if uuid-2972832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972832.jpg"></div><p>  54,000 square meters of housing - this is the total area provided for by the project "Fairy Tale".  The developer plans to build 35 buildings here using the technology of monolithic construction of houses.  The buildings will be of small number of storeys - 2-, 3-, 4-storey.  Each building has only 2 entrances. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Construction began back in 2014 and is ongoing in two phases.  The first consists of 17 houses.  Two buildings were commissioned in 2016, and the rest in the second quarter of 2017.  The construction of the second stage was completed at the end of 2017.  The land is owned by the developer. </p><p>  In the residential complex created 7 courtyards with a unique design.  Sports and playgrounds are located on the outer perimeter of the residential complex.  "Fairy Tale" is equipped with its own boiler room, two artesian wells and storm constructions.  The complex is connected to the city sewage system.  The gas used in homes is used only for heating. </p><h2>  Characteristics of houses </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this in more detail.  During the construction of the LCD "Fairy Tale" monolithic technology is used.  However, due to the architecture of the buildings and the ventilated facades, it seems that the houses are made of stone and wood.  Finishing materials are a special pride of the developer.  It uses stone from the company White Hills, made by special order.  The uniqueness of this material lies in the fact that it is assembled as a designer on the facade rails.  This simplifies the operation of houses in the future.  In its external characteristics, the material is completely identical to natural stone. </p><p>  The builder uses Japanese panels to simulate natural wood.  This material is perfectly cleaned from dust and dirt with a large amount of precipitation. </p><p>  The style for creating a residential complex was chosen quite unusual - a chalet.  This design is associated with medieval cities.  The selected architecture quite successfully fits into the general concept of the project and creates the image of a fabulous quiet village. </p><p>  Perfection is given to houses by details.  Plain brown facades would look rather boring if they were not decorated with vintage elements and tiled roofs.  For the installation of air conditioners, special hidden boxes are provided here, so that subsequently this will not spoil the facade of the houses. </p><h2>  Entrance Interior </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kvartirazamkad.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="architecture lcd tale" class="if uuid-2972798" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972798.jpg"></div><p>  So what is its feature?  Even the entrances are decorated in a special way in the LCD "Fairy Tale".  Residents' reviews confirm that the magical theme continues here.  Wrought iron railings, antique furniture, original lamps and other decorative elements - all this creates the feeling of a fairy tale.  The walls are lined with decorative bricks in the loft style, and the floors are decorated with intricate patterns of small tiles.  Even the intercom is decorated unusually.  Each staircase also has an elevator. </p><p>  What else of the advantages can be distinguished?  The entrances are equipped with everything necessary for people with disabilities.  Wheelchair ramps are available.  Each section has two inputs - main and service.  There is also a storage room for inventory.  It also has a shower with which you can wash the stroller after a walk or rinse the dog's paws. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Let's dwell on this aspect in more detail.  An important issue that worries all potential buyers of apartments in the LCD "Fairy Tale" - planning.  There are only 800 apartments.  Various options are presented - from 1 to 3 rooms, ranging from 43 to 130 square meters.  Most of the layouts in the houses are non-standard and not quite similar to the usual apartment buildings. </p><p>  The apartments in the Fairy Tale residential complex on the first floors are more like townhouses.  Residents have a private entrance, terrace.  In addition, they own a local area.  As conceived by the developer, such a decision will give the houses individuality and will encourage residents to contribute to the development of the residential complex. </p><p>  On the intermediate floors of the LCD "Fairy Tale" layouts are more classic.  Here, residential and public spaces are optimally combined.  The kitchen in each apartment is quite spacious and, if desired, can easily be combined with the living room.  In the bathroom, if desired, accommodate both a bathtub and a shower.  There is in the apartment and a specially allocated space for the dressing room.  The ceilings in each apartment are high - 3.10 meters.  If necessary, you can connect the system of "smart home". </p><h2>  Finish </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in a fairy tale" class="if uuid-2972752" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972752.jpg"></div><p>  Apartments in the residential complex "Fairy Tale" are rented without interior partitions.  This allows the owners to independently make the layout to their taste.  There is also the possibility of combining several apartments on the same floor, and vertically.  Some buildings have duplex apartments.  The height of the ceilings here reaches 7.5 meters, which gives great scope for creating a unique interior. </p><p>  Apartments in a residential complex are sold without finishing, but the buyer can order a rough or fine finish from the developer at the construction stage.  Depending on the complexity of the work and their volume, the cost varies from 10 to 18 thousand for rough finishing, and from 15 thousand for finishing.  The developer does not offer typical design projects.  Everything is negotiated individually with each client. </p><p>  All apartments offer a wonderful outlook from the windows.  Of course, the best view from the houses on the first line, located directly by the river.  But residents of apartments with windows to the courtyard will also not be disappointed.  The developer plans to plant mature trees between the houses.  This will favorably affect the environmental situation in the complex, as well as solve the problem of the view of the neighboring windows. </p><p>  Thanks to a huge selection of layouts, each buyer will be able to choose the right option for himself and his family. </p><h2>  Parking </h2><p>  Is it provided?  A sore point for most Muscovites is the number of parking spaces.  In LCD "Tale" interest holders may not worry about this.  The project provides ground parking on the outer perimeter of the complex.  The developer calculated the number of seats for vehicles, taking into account that the family may have more than one car.  Separately equipped with several guest parking.  Places for residents of the complex are provided free of charge.  The territory of the complex itself will be closed to strangers and guarded.  So residents can not worry about the entry of strangers into the territory.  The residential complex also has a helipad. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ub.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="new building LCD fairy tale" class="if uuid-2972801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972801.jpg"></div><p>  What is its feature?  LCD "Fairy Tale" (reviews hereinafter) is a modern residential complex equipped with all necessary social and household infrastructure.  It is designed for 2500 people.  The emphasis here is primarily on programs for the development of children.  It is planned to open a private kindergarten on the territory of the residential complex, as well as an elementary school with a capacity of 120 places.  A general education school is also being built in Pavlovskaya Sloboda.  Several private schools are already operating in the vicinity, including the famous Pavlovsk Gymnasium.  It is worth noting that in the municipal educational institutions there are lines. </p><p>  The developer also plans to build a full-fledged developing children's complex, as well as venues for creative workshops for adults.  There are even plans to arrange a mini-zoo where children can get to know animals better and take care of them. </p><p>  It is also planned to open a family medical office, as well as enterprises providing household services: fitness centers, supermarkets, restaurants, banks and so on.  Most of these projects are owned by the residents of "Tales". </p><p>  Many areas of the complex will remain undeveloped.  There will be a park area with a barbecue area, as well as dog walking areas and playgrounds.  The developer also plans to equip the embankment.  It should become an attractive place for walking and leisure. </p><p>  Of particular note are the yards of the Fairy Tale.  Residents' reviews confirm that each of them is unique in its own way.  There are no similar playgrounds and lawns.  Each yard is a work of art.  The wildest fantasies of designers are realized here. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the residential complex is quite developed infrastructure.  In the village of Pavlovskaya Sloboda there are all the necessary institutions and shops.  Of course, the assortment here is not as wide as in the nearest cities near Moscow.  Within a radius of 1.5 km from the complex are a pharmacy, hospital, church, several shops, a bar and a cafe.  If in the near future the developer realizes all his promises regarding the equipment of the infrastructure of the complex, the distance from the settlements will not cause inconvenience. </p><p>  The company "NDV-Real Estate" is engaged in the sale of apartments in the residential complex "Fairy Tale".  The progress of construction, planning, the cost of apartments - the company‚Äôs specialists are ready to advise you on any matters of interest at any time. </p><h2>  Developer reviews </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pro-strojki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Infrastructure LCD Fairy Tale" class="if uuid-2972818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2972818.jpg"></div><p>  GC "Commonwealth" during its existence has earned a reputation as a reliable and honest builder.  To verify this, just visit the sales office located directly on the construction site.  So you can get acquainted with all the advantages of the LCD "Fairy Tale".  Photos do not convey the entire atmosphere of the residential complex.  The necessary information about planning, prices and special promotions can also be obtained on the website of the developer. </p>
