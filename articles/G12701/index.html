Although many experts to this day predict the complete disappearance of the button system, the example of the Finnish device demonstrates its survivability and, most importantly, the demand on the market.  The model is in demand among users who, for one reason or another, do not want to switch to smartphones.  For some, the touch principle of typing as such is uncomfortable, while others simply do not require wide functionality.  <span>True, this</span> does not at all indicate the meager capabilities of the Nokia 515.  Characteristics, user reviews and expert opinions confirm the device‚Äôs ability to effectively cope with more than just basic tasks.  For example, a 5 megapixel camera provides images that match the quality received on smartphones of the same price category.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Phone Overview </h2>

    <p>  The device is implemented according to the scheme developed in Nokia, but taking into account the modern needs of users.  A feature of the model is its positioning between budget push-button mobile phones and modern smartphones.  With the first category, the device combines the traditional keyboard configuration and overall performance form factor, and with ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phones there is still a hint of expanding options and communication capabilities.  At the same time, there are quite a few stand-alone advantages with the Nokia 515 mobile phone.  Reviews in this regard especially highlight the <span>presentable appearance</span> and compact size.  If in terms of functionality the model has plenty of competitors, then it is very difficult to find a button model with the same nice design. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Device Specifications </h2>

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs worth turning to the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of the device, which hides an attractive shell.  The manufacturer associates a Russian user with reliability and ease of use.  Does Nokia 515 live up to these expectations?  Reviews give a positive answer to this question, noting the reliability of its assembly and ergonomics.  To understand the actual data of the model, its characteristics will help: </p><ul><li>  Dimensions - 114 mm in height, 48 mm in width and 11 mm in thickness. </li><li>  Mass - 101 g. </li><li>  Platform - Nokia S40. </li><li>  The screen size is 2.4 inches. </li><li>  Resolution - 320x240. </li><li>  Number of colors - 16 million. </li><li>  Display Features - Gorilla Glass 2 coating applied. </li><li>  The amount of memory is 256 MB. </li><li>  The camera is represented by a 5 megapixel module with the option of LED flash. </li><li>  Communication features - FM-radio, Bluetooth 3, mini-jack. </li><li>  The battery capacity is 1,200 mAh. </li></ul><h2>  Housing and design reviews </h2>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The creators skillfully used the advantages of the classic tube form factor, complementing it with quality materials.  Actually, the latter feature determined the attractiveness of the phone in the eyes of buyers.  The case is completely made of <span>anodized aluminum.</span>  The owners, however, do not so much note its strength characteristics as an exquisite appearance, especially in white. </p><p>  There are a lot of similarities in the model with the popular 6700 series, which is confirmed by the reviews.  The Nokia 515 cell phone, however, has a minimal plastic content in the finish.  As for the external ergonomics of the device, here everything is at its best.  The model is praised for the lack of prints on a metal surface, ease of handling due to its small size and modest weight of 101 g. </p><h2>  Display Reviews </h2><p>  Again, many turn to the modifications of the 6700 family. But if the predecessor for its time showed quite tolerable screen qualities, then the Nokia 515 loses noticeably against the backdrop of technologically advanced competitors.  Of course, the display is criticized for its small size, although they are due to the very concept of the form factor.  If you come to terms with this nuance, you will find many of the advantages of the screen that the Nokia 515 mobile phone has. </p><p>  Reviews, for example, note a pleasant-looking image, good viewing angles and the absence of a fading effect.  That is, with a modest <span>size, the screen</span> provides an acceptable picture.  This is largely due to the fact that not a traditional QVGA-matrix from the budget segment was used, but a more technological modern module.  However, comparison with offers in the class of smartphones is also out of the question.  With such screens, the Finnish phone‚Äôs device is related only to <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 2, whose protective function, by the way, also has a lot of praise. </p>

    <h2>  Functionality Reviews </h2><p>  This is not to say that functionality and performance are the weak points of the device.  As a rule, users of the model do not need a wide range of features.  Nevertheless, certain advantages in the functionality of the device will still please. </p><p>  To begin with, I must say about the modification of the Nokia 515 Dual Sim model.  Reviews indicate convenience when working with two SIM cards, one of which can be assigned as the main one.  As for multimedia, the device is equipped with an FM radio and a music player.  By the way, owners who compared the sound quality of the phone with other push-button models leave high marks.  However, it does not reach the Dolby Mobile level in Nokia smartphones. </p><p>  But in terms of working with applications, the model made a major breakthrough compared to budget handsets.  In particular, Facebook and Twitter clients became available to users.  But in working with them through a small screen with button control, many feel discomfort.  On the other hand, this same drawback turns into a plus.  According to users, Nokia‚Äôs own browser can significantly <span>save traffic</span> compared to the same smartphones. </p>

    <h2>  Camera Reviews </h2><p>  If in evaluations of functionality you can find different opinions, then the characteristics of the camera are more likely to be attributed to the merits.  The creators used a 5-megapixel module, devoid of autofocus, but supplemented with backlight.  If we compare the results of long-range photography with the similar capabilities of other push-button devices, the Nokia 515 device will be preferred.  Reviews about the quality of macro shooting up to 50 cm are not so optimistic, but you can‚Äôt expect more from a mobile camera.  Users also note a variety of functions for shooting.  For example, you can take continuous shots, use portrait mode, and center focus through voice prompts. </p><h2>  How much is? </h2><p>  Today, the device is not easy to find in the salons, as other models come in its place.  Nevertheless, the offers on the market are estimated at 7-8 thousand rubles.  We can say that for such an amount it is easy to find a smartphone with a more advanced "stuffing" and communication capabilities than the Nokia 515.  Reviews, for example, often compare the model with the sensory representatives of Lumia.  However, the high cost in a considerable part justifies itself by its unique design and metal case. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  Unfortunately, the phone does not have many direct competitors for a more approximate comparison.  The developers of button devices for the most part are guided by the budget segment, not wanting to improve the technical "stuffing".  Perhaps it is precisely thanks to an empty niche in the market that the Nokia 515 phone is still in demand.  Reviews, the price of 7-8 thousand and the very belonging of the device to a rare segment - all this speaks in its favor. </p><p>  Another thing is that market trends inexorably require technological advancement.  The characteristics of the Finnish model in terms of functionality and performance can not be called advanced.  Smartphones of 5 years ago possessed similar capabilities, but for a modern user they have not been relevant for a long time.  On the other hand, such models should also be presented as a standard of practicality, versatility and stylish design. </p>
