This is noticeable not only in the technical direction, but also in the service sector, hotel business and other industries.  More and more accustomed to comfort, <span>modern travelers</span> are trying to find for themselves the most comfortable places to spend time between flights.  Everyone will agree that it is better to pass the hours of connecting the aircraft not in a noisy waiting room, but in a specially equipped place where you can not only sit with a book in your hands, but also have a good night's sleep.  Thanks to the excellent project that was developed in Japan, some particularly large hub stations are equipped with capsule-type hotels.  Now in Russia there is a capsule hotel.  Sheremetyevo provides its passengers with all the amenities in a minimal space. </p>

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  <span>Capsule hotels were</span> born in Japan at the end of the 70s.  They are built on the principle of honeycombs.  Small rooms, equipped with everything necessary, are intended only so that people can get a good rest between flights.  However, if in Japan they gained great popularity due to the large tourist flow, then in Russia such a miracle is almost impossible to meet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Japan is a country with its principles and rules.  Capsule hotels, which can be found both in small cities and in megacities, differ from those in Europe, one small feature - almost all of them are male.  Of course, in some of them one floor is allocated to accommodate women, but in this case, the beautiful half of humanity is strictly prohibited from entering male territory. </p><p>  At the most modern level, Sheremetyevo Airport is equipped.  The capsule hotel here has gained immense popularity. </p>

    <p>  It is located on the fifth floor of the terminal.  There are more than 65 rooms of very compact sizes.  The smallest area does not exceed 8 square meters.  The most spacious room has a size of 22 square meters.  For a moderate fee (about 2700 rubles for single occupancy), you can spend four hours here.  If you intend to spend a longer period of time in the room, then payment will be made hourly.  For the most demanding customers, the hotel has VIP rooms.

    <p>  At the entrance, you need to remove your shoes and put them in a specially designed locker for this purpose.  It locks with a key.  All things can be taken to the left-luggage office, the key to which will also be kindly provided to you.  As a result, we have three keys that open different doors.  The third unlocks your number.  After passing the first two stages, you can safely settle in your small but comfortable room, curtain the windows and immerse yourself in a measured rest. </p><h2>  European capsule hotels </h2><p>  What is characteristic of Japanese culture is practically not suitable for European countries, and even more so for tourists, which is why pragmatic Europeans have transformed minimalistic capsule hotels.  If in Japan the numbers are made very modestly, in calm and discreet tones that can pacify, then everything is exactly the opposite.  Modern European capsules are very beautiful, with a thoughtful interior and a design line.  You can find those that literally repeat the cabins of luxury cruise liners.  The guests of these rooms completely disappear the feeling that they are waiting for a transfer.  You can even feel like a captain of a ship.  Now, the inhabitants of Russia have a chance to visit the capsule hotel.  Sheremetyevo gives all travelers the opportunity to conveniently take a break between flights. </p><h2>  "Air Express" </h2><p>  Taking into account all the latest technologies and modern trends in modifying capsule hotels, a project of an operating hotel at the Moscow airport was developed and successfully implemented.  The capsule hotel "Air Express" (Sheremetyevo) is fundamentally different from its Japanese "brothers." </p>

    <p>  There is some part of the rooms, which is located in the middle.  They are located inside the corridors and have no windows.  But do not immediately abandon such a room, because the designers worked wonderfully and thought through everything to the smallest detail.  Correctly placed lighting and directional spotlight made it possible to completely compensate for the absence of direct <span>sunlight.</span>  Even with the compactness of each room, all of them are equipped with a bathroom, telephone and hot shower.  Almost everyone will like the capsule hotel (Sheremetyevo).  You can see the photo in this article. </p><p>  Knowing what role access to the Internet plays for a <span>modern person, the</span> developers of the project realized the possibility of connecting each client to the <span>World Wide Web</span> .  The very location of the hotel allows customers to use the entire infrastructure of the airport, such as: </p><ul><li>  The shops. </li><li>  Restaurants </li><li>  Terminals </li><li>  Banks </li></ul><p>  The hotel in Sheremetyevo (capsule hotel) can easily replace hostels and make a difference in the life of a traveler. </p>
