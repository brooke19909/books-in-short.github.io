  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exotic holiday in Bali</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Some tourists regard the rest in Bali as a usual beach idleness.  In fact, this is not so, since the influence of the islanders culture, its customs and traditions is very strong here.  Over the past few decades, this tourist destination has received tremendous development.  Thanks to the equatorial - monsoon climate, the temperature fluctuates around 26 - 28  almost all year.  The best time to relax is from May to October, because in January it rains tropically.  Almost all the inhabitants of the island profess a variety of Hinduism, which is called "Agama Hindu Dharma", which affects their worldview. </p><p>  Holidays in Bali is a whole philosophy.  In addition to a daily stay on the impeccable beaches and bathing in the Indian Ocean, you should definitely visit the cultural monuments of this people.  On Mount Gunung Anung is Besakih Temple, the climb to which lies through many steps.  Throughout the ascent to it on the sides of the stairs there are small souvenir shops.  It is a whole complex consisting of 30 temples, which are located on the terraces of the sacred stone.  Having risen to the very top, the tourist will open the main temple, the peak of which is crowned with a statue of the goddess Garuda, under which stands the throne of the supreme deity Trimurti.  The second most important <span>Uluwatu Temple</span> is located in the southwestern part of the island, on top of a cliff.  It is built of whitish-gray coral and extols the spirits of the sea.  Monkeys live on its territory, which are fed by temple attendants and tourists.  In the evenings, performances of the Kechak dance are arranged at the venue in front of the entrance.  This is not just a choreographic production, but a whole performance performed by 150 dancers who tell the eternal story of the struggle between good and evil.  If you approach the cliff in the evening, you can see the abyss illuminated by lights.  This is an incomparable sight. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Those who want to spend their holidays in Bali not only informatively, but also have fun, should visit the water park, which more closely resembles a flowering garden.  It is located in one of the most beautiful resort places of the city, in the Kuta region, near Nusa Dua.  Its area is 4 ha.  It includes several attractions for adults, a children's area, spas, cafes, bars and relaxation areas.  This is a great place to spend a family holiday in Bali, which will bring everyone a lot of pleasure.  The island has a crocodile farm, bird park, monkey forest, rice terraces.  They will not leave indifferent to themselves, both children and adults. </p><p>  In addition to the classic beach holiday and sightseeing, weddings have become very popular on the island.  They can go in accordance with European standards, but I can fully comply with Balinese customs.  Since the islanders are very sensitive to all the rituals, and the wedding procession is especially beautiful, many young couples want to marry in Bali.  Only a few premium hotels provide this service. </p><p>  If you managed to get last minute packages to Bali, then this can be considered a great success.  Demand for this direction is growing every year, which affects prices.  Such interest from travelers is not accidental, since the island can satisfy the needs of all groups of citizens.  On the one hand, there is the possibility of seclusion, an excellent cultural base for further rethinking your actions or simply mastering a different culture, and on the other hand, fashionable hotels ready to provide a full range of entertainment, interesting <span>show programs,</span> restaurants, clubs.  If it becomes possible to buy last-minute tours to Bali, then, without a second's doubt, this must be done. </p>
