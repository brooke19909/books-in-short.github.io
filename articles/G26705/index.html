More and more vacationers to the question ‚ÄúWhere to go?‚Äù, Answer: ‚ÄúTo Greece!‚Äù  This article is devoted to one of the options for such a holiday. </p><h2>  Briefly about rest in Paphos </h2><p>  The city of Paphos is the ancient capital of the Greek <span>island of Cyprus</span> (now this status is assigned to the only major city of the island, Nicossia).  This island, since the XVIII century, is one of the classic European resorts.  The status of the resort is associated with ancient legend and history.  (Cyprus is famous for the legend of the birth of the beauty goddess Aphrodite, the apostle Paul preached here and the famous philosopher Cicero lived.) And, perhaps, that is why the name of the adjective ‚Äúpathos‚Äù appeared in many languages.  If we add to the above the enchanting beauty of some of the most picturesque beaches in the world and the European level of resort business, we will get a brief description of the charms of Paphos. </p>

    <p>  Here, on the enchanting beauty of the Mediterranean coast, are built not only marble villas of millionaires, reminiscent of the estates of the Roman patricians, but also a chain of hotels.  Among the latter, there are also quite budget ones, providing a decent and comfortable stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The aparthotel considered by us was built in 2001 in the second line of the coast of the city of <span>Paphos.</span>  <span>Paphos</span> Princessa Vera Hotel Apts 3 *, at the Royal Tombs Highway 17. A complete reconstruction of the hotel complex was made in 2013.  Most vacationers arrive here from an airport located nearby, at a distance of 8 km.  Transfer from there to the hotel will take some 8 - 10 minutes by car or 15 - 20 - by bus. </p><p>  The location of the hotel is very good.  Around it are many small restaurants, bars, closer to the promenade are youth clubs, discos.  At 300 meters from the hotel complex there is a comfortable Kefalos beach, at the same distance - a city park, 400 meters - a church near the Column of St. Paul. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel complex is a convenient platform for various excursions, beach holidays.  Paphos is a city interesting for tourists not only as a resort.  The area where the hotel under consideration was built in the city has been called the "lower city" (Kato - Paphos) for centuries.  Kato Paphos is attractive for tourists to the picturesque promenade, as well as the archaeological park located in it (several dozen ruins of ancient and medieval buildings are located in a relatively small area). </p><h2>  About the hotel and its infrastructure </h2><p>  The hotel complex Paphos Princessa Vera Hotel Apts 3 * is remembered by its guests for its thoughtful design and comfort.
