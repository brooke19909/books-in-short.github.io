It is located on the shores of the Baltic Sea, which makes it attractive for tourism.  What is interesting Zelenogradsk?  Sights and features of the city are described below. </p><h2>  From Kranets to Zelenogradsk </h2><p>  Zelenogradsk is considered one of the oldest cities in the region.  It was founded three years earlier than the regional center of Kaliningrad.  As far back as 1252, the Krantakrug roadside tavern was located in its place, into which knights of the Teutonic Order dropped in on the road to the Curonian Spit.  Later, the small fishing village of Krantz appeared (from ‚ÄúKrantas‚Äù - ‚Äústeep coast‚Äù). </p><p>  At the beginning of the XIX century, these places are gaining popularity among tourists.  This happens after the well-known doctor Franz Kessel proved that the methods of traditional medicine are too immersed in taking medication and bloodletting instead of sunbathing and spending time in the sea air.  Such a statement caused a stir in Europe. </p><p>  Vacationers gather in coastal cities.  Kranz‚Äôs infrastructure begins to grow.  There are new recreation areas, baths, <span>pensions, motels.</span>  Every year the number of guests increased, and thanks to high-quality services, the city received the title of Royal Resort in 1844.  The following year, the first railway line between Kranz and Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) appeared. </p><p>  In 1945, during the war, the city was conquered by the Red Army.  Battles were fought around, but most of the city survived.  During the Potsdam agreement, after the victory, the city, together with the region, passes to Soviet Russia.  In 1946 it was renamed Zelenogradsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Zelenogradsk Attractions </h2><p>  The streets of the city breathe history.  Many centuries have passed since Kranz, or Zelenogradsk, was founded.  Sights of architecture of the "Prussian times" have survived to this day.  In the city you can find many old German buildings, on some you can even find symbols of Prussian culture. </p><p>  The modern Hotel East Prussia is located in a building dating back to 1906.  A high relief depicting the face of a man and a high relief with the initials of the former owner is perfectly preserved here.  The buildings of the post office, water and mud baths, railway station, and Villa Krell, which were built in the 20th century, are also well preserved.  These structures are considered objects of cultural heritage of local importance. </p><p>  Not far from the station is a beautiful old red brick building.  It used to be a private villa, which now houses the Zelenograd City Museum of Local Lore.  The museum‚Äôs exposition is small, so it‚Äôs best to walk around the museum with a guide.  Here they will tell a lot about the East Prussian region, about the foundation and development of Zelenogradsk. </p>

    <h2>  Sculptures and monuments </h2><p>  The former city of Kranz developed as a resort city, so there are many walkways in it.  An alley near the water (a kilometer long) was built after the First World War.  It used to be wooden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Now there are modern bronze sculptures.  The sculptures on the embankment of Zelenogradsk are very realistic.  Some depict children with pigeons, others children on a swing or children watering a tree, another sculpture depicts a young girl. </p><p>  On Pogranichnaya Street there is a <span>monument to Zelenograd</span> cats.  This is a modern forged monument that depicts a cat sitting on a window.  The cat sits with a rather friendly look, with a butterfly on his neck.  The highlight of the monument is that it can be rotated and skated like on a carousel.  At the base of the monument is a flounder - a symbol of Zelenogradsk. </p>

    <h2>  Unusual places </h2><p>  Not only the historical past is rich in Zelenogradsk.  Sights of this city are growing now.  More recently, the Museum of Skulls and Skeletons, or the Ministry of Emergencies, was opened in the city. </p><p>  More than 200 exhibits from around the world present an amazing collection.  Near the exhibits are small messages and comments of either a humorous or educational nature.  The task of the creators of the museum is not only to surprise visitors, but also to talk about the structure of the human body and its capabilities. </p><p>  In the Ministry of Emergencies there is a labyrinth in which the feeling of space changes.  The walls of the maze form multi-colored ribbons hanging vertically.  The colors of the ‚Äúwalls‚Äù were selected thanks to the advice of psychotherapists and are designed to evoke a sense of calm and serenity among visitors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Zelenogradsk of the Kaliningrad region is full of places for entertainment, such as Quest West.  In this quest room, anyone can try their hand at solving complex problems in order to save the world from a pandemic threatening him or to find the hidden ‚ÄúTreasures of the Prussian cat‚Äù.  Quests are held in the entertainment center "Paradox", which is now considered one of the most interesting sights of the city. </p>

    <h2>  cat house </h2><p>  The Murarium Cat Museum is an exhibition of a private collection and a real celebration for cat lovers.  The history of the original museum began in 1985 with a donated cat figurine.  The owner of the gift began to collect all sorts of images of cats and in the end collected so much that was enough to open the museum. </p><p>  In the Murarium there are many figurines, caskets, magnets, key rings, cat ring holders.  Here you can even find books about cats and listen to lectures about them.  In the museum everything is thought out and originally decorated, and on the walls you will find many interesting and funny inscriptions.  If you can‚Äôt come personally, the museum has a website where you can visit the tour virtually. </p><p>  Murarium is located in the water tower, which was built in 1905.  A tower 40 meters high was considered a symbol of Kranz.  In 2012, it was restored, but retained its former features and partially masonry.  On its upper floor is an observation deck. </p>

    <h2>  Royal square </h2><p>  The legend of Frederick William IV is associated with Kranz.  The legend tells of the times when Kranz was part of Prussia.  In 1843, King of Prussia Wilhelm visited Krantz and planted a tree in honor of his mother Louise.  The tree, they say, is growing now, but in order to remember this event, Queen Louise's square was decorated with a stone with a memorial plaque. </p><p>  Queen Louise is a symbol of Prussia.  She was the wife of Tsar Nicholas I and the grandmother of Emperor Alexander II.  In 2007, Germany presented Zelenogradsk with a copy of the Queen Louise sculpture from the National Gallery in Berlin. </p><p>  Now a bronze bust is in the Queen's Square.  It is mounted on a column, and next to a memorial plaque there is an inscription: "My kingdom in another world." </p><h2>  Cathedrals </h2><p>  Not far from the city park is the Transfiguration Cathedral.  The building was built in 1897.  It belonged to the Lutheran community of Kranza, which was formed in the city back in 1877. </p><p>  The temple is 40 meters high and is made in red brick.  On the altar in the southern part of the cathedral was a picture with a plot from the life of Christ.  There used to be an organ in the temple.  During the First World Bell, they were sent for remelting to the front, and upon its completion, the residents of Kranz made new ones, but they did not survive.  At the same time, stained-glass windows were installed in the church. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the church building served as a sports hall, and in 2007 it was transferred to the administration of the Orthodox Church. </p><p>  In 1904, a Gothic church was built.  Initially, the church was a Catholic church, and now it is the Orthodox Church of St. Andrew the First-Called.  The author of the church was a carpenter named Laufer. </p>

    <h2>  Neighborhood </h2><p>  In the village of Roshchino, not far from Zelenogradsk, is the Gr√ºnhof Palace.  It was built in 1701 by the Potsdam architect Christian Eleetester by order of Frederick William I. One hundred years later, in 1814, the palace was donated to Count Dennetsky for special services to the country. </p><p>  Initially, the palace was made in the Baroque style.  Later, renaissance-style extensions were added to it.  In Soviet times, the building was used as a dispensary, a store and a first-aid post. </p><p>  The <span>Curonian Spit</span> is located on the Baltic Sea coast <span>,</span> which connects Zelenogradsk with the Lithuanian city of Klaipeda.  The length of the spit is almost 100 kilometers, and its width is 400 meters.  There is a place on the spit that attracts tourists - this is the Dancing Forest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Queen Louise Square" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24207/1261674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Only pine trees grow in the forest.  They were planted in 1961 to strengthen the sands of the spit.  A few years after planting, the trees began to take twisted forms.  It is not known why this happens, but the further you go deeper into the forest, the more trees are of anomalous and unnatural shape.  Curving in spirals and twisting into rings, they seemed to dance. </p>
