    <h2>  Developer </h2><p>  This is one of the most reliable developers in the region - SDS-Finance LLC.  In neighboring Kemerovo, this developer is the leader in terms of investment in housing construction. </p><p>  To date, SDS-Finance LLC has commissioned nearly 700 thousand m <sup>2 of</sup> housing.  And this is more than 12,000 apartments and 100 high-rise buildings. </p><h2>  Construction technology </h2><p>  On this project, she is the most modern.  Houses are built from innovative prefabricated monolithic slabs.  European standard panels are produced by the local Kemerovo house-building plant.  The ‚Äústep‚Äù between the panels is 6.60 m, which gives a guarantee of the quality of the building and provides almost complete freedom of layout.  And also, importantly, the attractive cost of new housing. </p><p>  The advantages of these panels include: </p><ul><li>  the full readiness of the walls for wallpapering or painting (the step of plastering, filling and priming is skipped); </li><li>  high ceilings; </li><li>  almost perfect vertical surface (curvature is minimal); </li><li>  parameters of heat and sound insulation at a high level; </li><li>  high seismic stability. </li></ul><p>  Outside, the walls are insulated with a wet facade system.  Thanks to the well-chosen size of the plates, the ceiling height in the apartments is 2.8 m. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  And the most interesting, according to the developer, it can be taken without a down payment! </p><p>  An application is considered no more than five business days. </p><p>  The package of documents for an application for a mortgage in each bank varies, but the following will definitely be needed: </p><ul><li>  application (drawn up at the bank); </li><li>  passport and its full copy; </li><li>  employment record and its copy (certified in the personnel department); </li><li>  income statement either in the form of 2-personal income tax or in the form of the borrowing bank. </li></ul><p>  No less interesting option for buying a home in the LCD "Venice" in Novosibirsk, according to residents, is the exchange of an old apartment for a new one.  The program is called Trade in (or an apartment in offset) and is valid on individual conditions. </p><h2>  Start of sales </h2><p>  From this moment, the developer offers several attractive shares. </p><p>  One of them is ‚ÄúWe give repair as a gift‚Äù. </p><p>  Houses 1 and 2 offer a fine finish as a gift.  That is, the apartment will be completely renovated. </p><p>  In house 1a, at the price of a draft apartment with a rough finish, the apartment ‚ÄúRough + bathroom‚Äù is for sale.  Or at the price of an apartment with a fine finish - ‚ÄúFinish + bathroom‚Äù. </p><p>  Also, for one part of the apartments there is a promotion ‚ÄúMortgage as a gift‚Äù, for the other - a discount of 1,000 rubles per square meter for repairs. </p><p>  Shares are not cumulative. </p><h2>  Reviews about LCD "Venice" in Novosibirsk </h2><p>  There are already quite a lot of them.  There are estimates of the first tenants who moved from other areas.  They are more than satisfied with the price and quality of the purchased housing. </p><p>  Families with children are happy with a good investment.  Both adults and children were pleasantly surprised by the grounds on the inside of the house.  But most of all, children are happy about the proximity of the water park. </p><p>  In one of the reviews about the residential complex "Venice" in Novosibirsk, an equal number of two- and three-room apartments was assigned to the advantages.  This means that the neighbors will be permanent, and, therefore, a careful attitude to their home is ensured. </p>

    <p>  The advantage is considered by equity holders and various stocks from the developer. </p><p>  The rooms are huge, and the loggias are glazed from floor to ceiling - the view is amazingly beautiful, which residents admire.  Plus two bathrooms! </p><p>  The location of the complex is also good.  The porches, staircases and elevator halls are large and comfortable. </p><p>  In several reviews, there are reports of the imminent start of a fixed-route taxi to this area, as well as the start of the construction of a kindergarten for one hundred places. </p><p>  Parking spaces, and there are more than a thousand, are planned to be taken out of the yard, which will allow parents not to worry about walking children, and save the residents of lower floors from exhaust gases. </p><p>  For each turn of the complex, two entrances will be made. </p><p>  The disadvantages of LCD "Venice" in Novosibirsk in the reviews include a certain distance from the city center.  And this suggests that the infrastructure has yet to develop. </p><p>  Buyers still have doubts about the land on which the house stands.  They say that earlier there were swamps, but the construction company claims that this problem is solved. </p>
