    <p>  Recently, having satiated with impressions of palm trees and an all-inclusive food system, many travelers pay attention to the vastness of our vast Motherland, where there is something to see.  For example, in the Lipetsk region is the city of Yelets.  The sights of this settlement begin with its history.  In 2016, he will be 870 years old. </p><p>  Of course, the buildings from the time of the foundation of Yelets were not preserved.  But the Russian towns are of interest to them because they cherish what was built by their ancestors.  Therefore, here you can look at the architecture of the eighteenth century.  In particular, here is the "Governor's House", as well as residential buildings on Profsoyuznaya Street, in Detskiy Lane, on Ostrovsky Street, which have been standing since the mid-eighteenth century. </p><p>  What else is interesting in Yelets?  Its sights include the Znamensky Cathedral, known not only for sacred relics (the grave of the Monk Melania), but also for its remarkable collection of flowers grown in summer, as well as for peacocks kept in the temple farm.  Many visitors appreciated the magnificent view coming off the ancient walls, as well as the clean and very tasty water in the cathedral source. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Yelets, whose sights are quite diverse, boasts a prison museum, where you can get acquainted with the life of prisoners throughout the XIX-XX centuries.  The facility is located on the territory of the existing colony, and is allowed there only by agreement with the prison authorities.  In addition, in the vicinity of the city is the reserve "Galichya Gora", which presents bizarre limestone objects.  Fans of outdoor activities can try to go to the ruins of an old mill of the XIX century, if they get permission from the owners of the private territory where it is located. </p><p>  And without permission, but during office hours you can visit the Bunin Museum on Gorky Street.  Here you can find the writer's personal belongings collected by this institution around the world, look through the windows of a small cozy house, and perhaps understand what inspired the future Nobel Prize winner, whose hometown is just Yelets.  The sights of this region, of course, are complemented by the magnificent South Russian nature, which gave rise to many picturesque images among the outstanding minds of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dace attractions photo" class="if" height="285" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9009/207826.jpg" width="240"></div>

    <p>  Interesting places in this region are not limited only to the territory where the city of Yelets is located.  The sights of the region are represented by the village of Lugovoi, where the founder of the shock <span>movements Stakhanov</span> was born <span>.</span>  You can also wander through the ruins of the estate "Khrushchevo - Levshino", where Mikhail Prishvin grew up.  Here you can still find the famous oak of several meters in girth, which was mentioned in the writer's work. </p><p>  Yelets, sights, photographs and the kindness of the inhabitants of which rarely leave anyone indifferent, is a city that is worth visiting especially for residents of large megacities, even if you feel the measured and unhurriedness of life, look at ancient objects and appreciate the enduring beauty of nature. </p>
