    <p>  In order to keep fit during the holidays, guests of the hotel can visit a small fitness center equipped with modern sports equipment. </p><h2>  Who is the hotel targeted at? </h2><p>  The hotel is located in a separate tall, but narrow building, consisting of 18 floors.  He does not have his own territory.  Infrastructure and service at the hotel are more focused on adult guests, and to a lesser extent on children. </p><p>  When staying with a child at Begonia Nha Trang Hotel 3 * an extra bed is not offered.  Children under 10 years old are free of charge, but at the same time they should use the facilities offered.  There is no children's menu in the restaurant, a games room and highchairs, as well as a special shallow-water compartment in the pool. </p><p>  The national composition of holidaymakers at the hotel is mixed.  Recommendations for choosing this hotel: it is most suitable for couples, companies without children and single tourists who want to combine a beach holiday with a rich excursion program. </p><h2>  Municipal (public) beach </h2><p>  The hotel is small by resort standards, with only 120 rooms.  He has no own territory.  However, one of the main advantages of the hotel is its location only a few minutes walk from the city beach.  It is the most popular place both among tourists and among local residents. </p><p>  The central <span>beach of Nha Trang</span> is spread along the coast for 7 km, but even taking into account this fact, at the height of the season it can be very crowded.  You can get to it from anywhere in the city without any problems.  Entrance to the beach is free, sun loungers and umbrellas are available for hire.  The territory is quite clean (shore cleaning is carried out daily in the early morning hours).  The beach is sandy with a flat bottom, the depth is increasing gradually.  The sand is very light, almost white, but with a yellowish tinge. </p>
