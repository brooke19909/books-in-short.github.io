We can say that the hotel combines all the advantages that are so appreciated by tourists.  It stands right on the beach and at the same time is surrounded by a beautiful shady garden.  The trees in it are constantly watered, and the greens are looked after.  The hotel has several buildings of two, four and five floors.  Some are closer to the sea, while others are closer to the road.  There are elevators, and on the roof of a five-story building there is an observation deck.  Tourists do not even complain that the hotel is far from the center of the resort village.  Indeed, because of this, it is not so noisy here, and the prices are lower.  However, all the shops and good restaurants are located at some distance from the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  If we are looking for a Canary Beach Resort 3 * hotel on a map of Vietnam, then we need to explore the south of the country.  The complex is located in the province of Binh Thuan, in the Gulf of Mui Ne.  This is one of the areas of the resort area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPhan Thiet.  Getting here for quite some time - the nearest airport to it is in Nha Trang.  And the road from there takes about five hours by bus (this is due to speed limits).  Therefore, experienced travelers are advised to travel by night bus to Nha Trang, stop there for a couple of days, and then get to the airport in about half an hour.  This makes departure a lot easier.  From hotels to the promenade of Bo Ke with its entertainment - about three and a half kilometers.  Take a taxi about five to ten minutes.  You can still get on any local bus.  And there are only two of them - the first and ninth numbers.  Stop very close to the Canary Beach Resort 3 * hotel (Vietnam). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and shopping </h2><p>  It is better to buy trips not from hotel guides at the Canary Beach Resort 3 * hotel (Vietnam), but from travel companies on the street.  It is both better and cheaper.  There are several interesting natural attractions right next to the hotel.  One of them is the Fairy Creek, which can be reached on foot directly by water.  Even small children go there, especially since there are snack bars and a mini zoo near this beautiful reservoir.  You can negotiate with local taxi drivers, and for fifty dollars a day you will be driven to all the local attractions.  You will see the Ke Ga lighthouse, and pink dunes, and <span>Chama towers.</span>  If you are ready to tear off two or more days from a beach holiday, you can ride in Dalat, Ho Chi Minh and even Cambodia.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel you can buy good and cheap fruits.  At the same time, you will spend less money than in other Vietnamese resorts, and <span>shopping stalls</span> are very close to the hotel.  But for souvenirs it is better to go to Phan Thiet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Canary beach resort 3 on the map" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1090472.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel Canary Beach Resort 3 *: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists believe that this hotel has a beautiful and compact area, good location relative to the beach, excellent Wi-Fi signal, clean pool, where you can swim without restrictions, at any time of the day.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is popular with both Russian tourists and foreigners.  On the one hand, you can enjoy a calm and measured, so to speak, ‚Äúvillage‚Äù vacation, and on the other hand, just a few minutes drive to the fun and noise, entertainment and temptations of Bo Ke.  You can calculate your day, because all year round the sun rises in these places at six in the morning, and sets at eighteen exactly.  This is a nice cozy treshka without any complaints.  But after it there are only pleasant impressions. </p>
