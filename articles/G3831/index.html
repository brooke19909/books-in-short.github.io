You don‚Äôt have to go far for examples.  Even 15 years ago, few could boast of having a computer.  Today, things are different.  Literally in every house there is a full-fledged PC, or even two.  Moreover, the functions of a computer are partly performed by a smartphone, which probably lies in the pocket of every second inhabitant of the Earth. </p><p>  Progress has not bypassed the scope of entertainment.  New game consoles, high-quality players, etc. began to appear. However, one of the main technical advances in the entertainment field is the appearance of new widescreen 4K TVs.

    <p>  4K TVs have appeared relatively recently.  Nevertheless, they are rapidly gaining popularity.  Initially, Ultra HD 4K TVs did not sell very well.  Many simply did not understand all the advantages of this device.  Yes, and clearly overpriced scared potential buyers.  However, things are much better now.  Manufacturers have fully mastered the production process, making the manufacture of TVs much easier, and, accordingly, the final cost of the goods has significantly decreased.  For example, relative to 2014 in 2015, the price of 4K models fell by as much as 35 percent, which simply cannot but rejoice.  In addition, many people, thanks in large part to the commercials, have become more knowledgeable about 4K TVs.  This, in turn, led to previously unprecedented excitement.  Despite the sharp rise in the dollar, more and more people are buying 4K TVs.  What is so special about them? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is 4K? </h2>

    <p>  4K, or Ultra HD, is a new technology that is the next step in image transmission.  Generally speaking, 4K-TVs are devices that can display at least 8 million pixels on the screen.  This is four times more than 1080 TVs.  4K TVs allow you to view content in a wide format (from 3840 x 2160 to 4096 x 3112).  In theory, all this sounds pretty good.  However, how are things in practice?  What is so special about Ultra HD TVs?  You can find the answers to these questions below. </p><h2>  What is the advantage of Ultra HD? </h2><p>  Perhaps the first advantage is a high level of detail.  While watching a movie, you can see the smallest details that simply will not be noticeable when viewed in regular HD format.  It only contributes to immersion in the world of films, gives everything that happens on the screen realism.  All pixels clearly form a complete picture, which makes the image very saturated and bright.  For all that, the pixels are so tiny that the human eye simply cannot see them.  This, in turn, provides a better picture. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In addition to increasing the number of pixels, the refresh rate also increases.  Due to this, the viewer's eyes get tired much less during long film sessions.  For example, the progressive scan frequency is about 120 frames per second.  This greatly improves the final image quality.  <span>The color depth</span> remains at a decent level of 10-12 bits.  In addition, the LED 4K TV is capable of displaying an incredible number of color shades. </p><p>  Another advantage of modern television monitors is the expansion of the color range.  Even in the darkest and brightest areas of the image, you can see every detail.  Ultra HD TVs are much brighter and richer.  It is also worth noting that the new generation TVs have an amazing sound.  All 4K TVs support multi-channel playback, which includes as many as 24 audio channels. </p><p>  Well, one cannot fail to note one of the main features - the ability to create full three-dimensional images without any 3D glasses.  Do you think this is possible only in science fiction and Robert Zemeckis films?  No matter how.  Large companies are already presenting three-dimensional videos on Ultra HD-TVs, which can be enjoyed without the use of any additional devices.  What is noteworthy, a 3D picture will be visible to the viewer even when changing his position. </p><h2>  Do I need a 4K TV? </h2><p>  Of course, 4K-TVs have a lot of advantages.  But is it worth throwing your Full HD and running to the store for a novelty?  Unlikely.  If you are an ordinary viewer and you are quite happy with the image in 1080 format, do not chase the pixels.  However, if you are a sophisticated esthete and a noble film lover who wants to savor every shot of your favorite movie, then there is a point in acquiring a modern 4K TV. </p>

    <p>  Also, Ultra HD TV monitors offer huge opportunities for video game lovers.  Such TVs reproduce the image very realistically, so that the gamer can completely immerse himself in the game.  At the moment, a couple of large titles have already been released that support the new Ultra HD format.  Not only that, 4K-enabled games continue to be released.  Surely in the next few years, all major gaming companies will introduce support for the new-fangled format in their projects. </p><h2>  Best Ultra HD 4K TVs </h2><p>  The modern market is full of various widescreen TVs.  What to stop your gaze at?  Which company products to prefer?  You can find answers to these and many other questions in this article. </p><p>  Perhaps the most impressive line of modern television monitors has the well-known company LG.  Here and the top-end 70-inch 70UF771V, and more budget 40UB800V.  Everyone can find a 4K Ultra HD LED TV to their taste and wallet. </p>

    <p>  I would especially like to focus on the LG 84LA980V.  This LG 4K TV is one of the best modern video monitors.  The device boasts a lot of entertaining and innovative technologies, which include voice control, support for Wi-Fi, MHL, Ethernet, RGB, Miracast and more.  What is there, the diagonal of this "monster" is as much as 84 inches. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In the end, we can say that 4K is a rather promising technology that is very successful.  It is still difficult to say about its further development and fate (rumors about the release of 8K-TVs are already actively circulating), but it is very likely to predict that the future of the television industry lies with the new Ultra HD format. </p>
