  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of Apple. From the very beginning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  XXI Century.  Start.  Any teenager knows about the existence of Apple and its founder Steve Jobs.  Almost all of us have seen what the latest iPhone or iPad looks like.  For some time now, Apple, whose history spans more than a dozen years, has become not just a brand under the name of which computers and their components are manufactured.  Now Apple is a multi-brand, the guarantor of style and quality. </p><p>  If you plunge into the past, then the history of Apple originates in the distant 1976.  On April 1, <span>Steve Jobs</span> decided to establish a new IT technology firm.  In 1976, the <span>first computer</span> from Apple was created, which laid the first brick in a skyscraper of an entire industry, known today around the world. </p><p>  Everyone knows who Steve Jobs is, what he did and how he looked, but, unfortunately, not everyone remembers the second Steve - Wozniak.  It is thanks to the union of two Steves that a multibrand corporation was created.  The guys on the team also had a third - Ron Wayne, who dealt with legal issues.  <span>Steve Wozniak</span> was responsible for the technical side of the issue, while Jobs was engaged in marketing.  The goal of the two young guys was not to earn millions and become famous, they just wanted to create something that would be convenient to use and understandable to any housewife.  By creating the first Apple 1 personal computer, the Allies received a $ 50,000 fee. </p><p>  Apple's story is also stunning with the large number of legends that have arisen around it.  For example, disputes about how the idea of <span>creating a logo</span> in the form of a <span>bitten apple</span> has still not ceased <span>.</span>  Initially, the form itself was by no means "apple", but soon (also in 1976) a rebranding was carried out and the logo took on its modern appearance. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A year after the opening of the company was released Apple2.  The company produced the computer in series.  It has become popular both in the US and abroad.  And so began the world history of Apple. </p><p>  In the 80s, Steve Jobs leaves the corporation.  These years were not the most successful for the company, but nevertheless, it brought a steady profit and was heard by regular customers. </p><p>  2000s  It is the 21st century that has become a landmark for the company.  Since then, the history of Apple has begun a new round.  The launch of the iPod, PowerBook, iMac, IBook, PowerMac.  The concept of the company has not changed since the opening.  The basis of the basics remains ease of use and convenience for the layman.  Computers from Jobs began to enjoy amazing popularity around the world.  People wanted to get not only smart, but also a convenient personal computer. </p><p>  Dizzying success did not stop Steve and his team.  In 2006, the most striking event was the appearance of the iPhone - an absolutely exclusive mobile phone that has no analogues in the world.  Thanks to the iPhone, such veterans of the mobile market as Nokia, Samsung and Motorola began to release touch smartphones among the people, copying functionality from Apple. </p><p>  Continuing to take over the world, Jobs launched a new operating system.  Soon after, the latest iPod and iPad were released.  The iPad tablet, which went on sale in 2010, was truly a revolution, a sensation.  Like all other gadgets of the last decade, iPad was invented solely for convenience.  It is convenient to take with you to work and on the road.  Also, its great advantage is the lack of a keyboard, low weight, free access to the Internet.  The corporation has regained its first place in the ranking of the computer market, has become a leader in the industry of mobile gadgets.  IPad4 was launched in 2012, and iPhone5 is expected to be launched soon.  The public is seriously hooked on gadgets from Apple, because for some time owning products from a world famous brand makes you not only fashionable, but also successful in certain circles. </p><p>  Everyone understands that Apple‚Äôs story does not end there, but only begins.  One can only guess what new products we will see on the mobile electronics market in a few years ... </p>
