And, of course, everyone is eager to throw off bored office suits, pumps, push work obligations away into the drawer, turn off the phone, the Internet, find a crazy panama hat or a bright hat - and go, swim, fly, and at least run to where you can relax body and soul.  At this time, everything seems to be shouting: "I want to go south, to the sea!"  And we succumb to the persuasion of commercials, summer songs, air dresses and run for tickets for the next flight.  Rarely come across vacationers who do not want the sea.  However, such people will also find something to do - they spend their time on mountaineering tours, hikes, excursions, reviews ... As you can see, the range of interests varies widely, but one thing remains the same - an interesting pastime and a lot of impressions from two weeks of freedom!  Nevertheless, favorite routes lead to water - to the majestic oceans, azure seas, the mystery of lakes and the simplicity of rivers. </p>

    <h2>  City of children's leisure </h2><p>  However, you may not be attracted to the charm of a large resort town.  And if you run away from dust, noise, car beeps, crush, sky-high prices, then Yeisk will be the best choice.  Not as popular as Sochi or Anapa, but, nevertheless, having its own charms.  A small Kuban town, which attracts mainly for spa treatment.  The beaches here are sandy, and the sea is shallow.  There are many other attractions for the whole family: Crocodile Canyon, Dolphinarium, water park, children's center, city park with attractions.  You can come here even with small children, and the baby will not get bored.  Yes, one of the best places to spend a family vacation is Yeisk. </p>

    <h2>  Village Dolzhanskaya </h2><p>  But if you are of little interest, then choose a vacation somewhere at a safe distance from civilization.  However, remember: the quieter the place, the faster it can get bored with the true citizens who are not used to seeing the starry sky.  But you can admire nature, absorb the vibes of the sun here as much as you like.  Such a place is the village of Dolzhanskaya.  Rest here relaxes the body and allows thoughts to slowly flow.  So this is the best route for philosophers.  And if you are displeased with the noisy and resort-like cheeky Krasnodar Territory, the village of Dolzhanskaya will gladly open its cozy, quiet embrace.  Dolzhanka, as the village is also called, is located in a wonderful place - at the very base of the sandy Spit Spit in Azov, where the Yeisk peninsula juts out into the sea.  On the one hand - the Sea of ​​Azov, on the other - <span>Taganrog Bay.</span>  There are exceptionally clean beaches and unique vegetation that will cure all ailments.  Once Dolzhanka was chosen by the Cossacks of the Kuban.  And now this piece of the Krasnodar Territory inhabits their descendants - this is a fairly large rural settlement with about eight thousand inhabitants.  It will be useful for all travelers to find out what weather the Dolzhanskaya village is preparing.  After all, it is known that the wind often blows there.  However, on the spit, according to tourists, this is even good.  Near the spit there is a group of small islands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The village of Dolzhanskaya is located four dozen kilometers from the city of Yeysk.  You can get there by car on the highway.  Autobuy "Yeisk-Dolzhanka" runs every 2 hours.  The road is of normal quality; posts are rarely found. </p><h2>  Village Dolzhanskaya.  Holidays for every taste </h2><p>  As you probably already guessed, Dolzhanka is not a place where you could spend the summer on a grand scale: it is intended for a quiet, measured rest.  Many kilometers of beaches and a welcoming sea - that, perhaps, is all that the village of Dolzhanskaya is rich in.  <span>The recreation center</span> - and not one - is located away from the settlement itself.  However, outdoor activities are also practiced here: you can go windsurfing.  There is also a campsite where you can live like real savages.  It is convenient to travel around these parts by car: you may save on housing, and you won’t be tied to a specific place. </p>

And the price will be more affordable - from three hundred rubles a day.  You can save on housing too - after all, you don’t plan to stay in your room all day? </p>

    <h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  For many years, the village Dolzhanskaya has been very popular with savage tourists.  Reviews about the vacation spent here are, in principle, positive, although there was some negative.  But after all, this happens all the time, even in the ultra-modern resorts.  After all, how many people - so many opinions, and that one is good - the other is bored.  So what do tourists say?  Judging by the comments, even a budget vacation can be quite comfortable.  Of the pluses, the beauty of nature, excellent sandy beaches, various depths of the sea, tranquility, reasonable prices are noted (although sometimes they make reviews sometimes negative, they say, not too adequate - this is what kind of accommodation you will find).  The disadvantages include underdeveloped infrastructure and muddy water from shell rock. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Of course, rest to rest is discord ... Someone prefers fashionable resorts with their discos, nightclubs and other entertainments, and someone gets indescribable pleasure from the quiet contemplation of the surrounding beauty and unity with nature.  If you belong to the second category, then you are right here - to Dolzhanka!  Yes, there is almost no entertainment for noisy youth.  But there is a cafe, sports grounds, tennis courts and a museum of the Cossacks.  The scythe itself is a nature reserve.  In August, the festival of driving music and extreme sports - A-ZOV. </p>

    <h2>  To any wallet </h2><p>  And, of course, do not forget about the cost of rest.  Is the village Dolzhanskaya a road?  Traveler reviews claim that it all depends on the season.  The greatest rise in prices is felt in the summer, so if you want to save as much as possible, go to the village for the velvet season.  When the peak of attendance passes, prices drop by more than a third. </p>
