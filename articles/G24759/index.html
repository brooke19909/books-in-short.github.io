  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will a pet tax be introduced in Russia?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the autumn of last 2017, the Russian owners of tailed-fluffy-whiskered had serious reasons for concern.  Both entertaining and official news sources reported "unpleasant news": the State Duma of the Russian Federation plans to discuss the introduction of a tax on pets.  Now, in the symbolic year of the Dog, it's time to figure out what it is, whom it touches, how real it is. </p><h2>  The reason for the bill </h2><p>  What was the reason for the discussion of the tax on pets in Russia?  It turned out to have already passed the bill "On Veterinary Medicine".  He talks about the mandatory introduction of this rule.  However, for two years this was not discussed. </p><p>  A pet tax law, on closer inspection, seems like a good thing.  Everything, according to the intentions of the deputies, should begin with the registration of their pets (dogs and cats).  This measure should protect the beast itself from being expelled by the owners to the street, help to find the ‚Äúlittle girl‚Äù house faster, ensure the safety of passers-by, if, for example, a dog attacks you, you can calculate its negligent owner in two ways. </p><div class="photo" data-original="qns.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://qns.com/tag/councilwoman-julissa-ferreras/"><img itemprop="image" alt="fluffy pets" class="if uuid-2239575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2239575.jpg"></div><h2>  The essence of the discussion </h2><p>  Registration of their pets want to make mandatory for all citizens of the Russian Federation.  However, the administrative or other responsibility of the deputies was not discussed.  Also, nothing is known about the amount of fees and the procedure for collecting tax on pets.  However, lawmakers assure us that they will act in the interests of the owners of the tailed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Registration of the animal itself will be absolutely free.  It‚Äôs just a registry entry that exactly you have such a cat or dog.  But registration, however, requires marking the beast - releasing a collar with a special number, chipping.  This is what the owner will have to spend on, in addition to the future payment of pet tax.  However, such waste, unlike taxation, will still be one-off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cuteness.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pet tax in Russia" class="if uuid-2239687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43230/2239687.jpg"></div><h2>  What will the introduction of the tax lead to? </h2><p>  The advocates of the zoom world were enthusiastic about the discussion.  They believe that real punishment of citizens accused of cruelty to animals will only be possible after the compulsory registration of pets and their owners. </p><p>  However, the tax on pets must be expressed in such an amount that any owner can afford to pay.  Otherwise, the bill will lead to the opposite effect - people will expel pets on the street, not having the opportunity to pay fees after registration. </p><h2>  Is the law passed? </h2><p>  All the news about the introduction of a pet tax is nothing more than a newspaper duck.  The bill for today has not advanced further discussion. </p><p>  The only region of the Russian Federation where paid registration of animals is conducted is Crimea.  The event has been held as part of a special regional project since the beginning of 2017.  Registration includes the issuance of a veterinary passport, token or chip implantation, free rabies vaccination.  The name of the owner, his address, phone number, as well as information about the pet - type, breed, nickname, age and gender are entered into the register.  Passport costs 100 rubles, chipping costs 700. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thoughtco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pet Tax Act" class="if uuid-2239609" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47188/2239609.jpg"></div><p>  We summarize: all the news about the introduction of the tax on pets is a myth.  By such a measure, information sources had in mind paid registration of pets in veterinary institutions.  The measure is already in force in Crimea, but not adopted in the rest of Russia.  Today, the State Duma is discussing another necessary bill - "On the responsible treatment of animals." </p>
