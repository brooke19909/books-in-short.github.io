    <h2>  The story of the appearance of the "deadly" exposure </h2><p>  New Arbat is one of the most magical and strange places.  It is here that you can visit the exposition dedicated to medieval <span>torture (Museum of</span> corporal punishment), or the Museum "Point G" (this is an erotic exhibition).  Not so long ago, another unusual institution appeared here.  This is a <span>museum of death</span> on the Arbat.  In its exhibition halls you can see the attributes of funeral rites from different countries, find out how one or another people relates to the end of earthly existence, as well as admire the models of the deceased from popular films, see a copy of the body of V.I. Lenin.  In addition, here you can take pictures with your favorite exhibits or read scientific articles posted on special stands.  The unusual museum was opened <span>on February 7,</span> 2014, and today without it it is already difficult to imagine Arbat.  Moscow is a city in which it is easy not only to go on classic excursions, but also to see something unique. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Unconventional funeral in the Gulf of Guinea </h2><p>  The real pride of the museum is a collection of unusual coffins.  Here you can see the sarcophagus in the form of a mobile phone, a giant carrot, a pack of money, nesting dolls or rockets.  And all this is not a figment of the imagination of the creators of the exposition, but copies of real coffins from Ghana.  Residents of the coast of the Gulf of Guinea have long been making original sarcophagi and bury their loved ones in them.  It is considered good form in this area to order an unusual coffin during life and put it at home in the form of an original interior item.  It is possible that the museum of death on the Arbat would not have appeared at all if this tradition had not inspired its curator, Alexander Donskoy.  He admits that he himself has already chosen for himself a coffin in the form of a huge fish.  Relatives and friends do not always understand this decision, but he remains adamant and answers them: ‚ÄúCan't I be buried the way I want?‚Äù </p>

    <h2>  Why was the museum of death created? </h2><p>  The main advertising slogan of this institution: ‚ÄúCome to us - to be scared or laugh!‚Äù  Indeed, it is impossible to call the museum an exceptionally gloomy and terrible place.  From some of the exhibits presented chills.  But still, the main goal of the creators of the exposition is not to scare the guests, but to surprise them.  Most of the collection hints at the inevitability of the end, but calls for treating him calmly, with some irony.  What is the most informal and creative place in the capital?  This, of course, is Arbat.  Moscow is a city in which there are many different museums, but it is the exposition dedicated to death that can please an informal atmosphere.  In this place, each guest feels calm and relaxed.  But at the same time, the exposition cannot be called exclusively entertaining.  In addition to exhibits, there are <span>information stands</span> in the halls <span>.</span>  After studying them, you can find out many interesting facts about the funeral rituals of different countries and the attitude to death in different cultures as a whole. </p><h2>  Address, mode of operation and cost </h2><p>  Anyone over 18 years old can visit the museum.  For ethical reasons, minors, even accompanied by adults, are not allowed to view the exhibition.  The cost of admission is 200 rubles.  Exact address: Novy Arbat, 15, the death museum has a noticeable sign that cannot be passed by.  The exposition is open daily from 12.00 to 0.00 hours, without days off and holidays.  Attention: there is no organized excursion service in the museum, however, employees are happy to walk around the halls with visitors and tell interesting facts and stories about the exhibits. </p>

    <h2>  Visitors reviews </h2><p>  What do people who have already managed to visit this unusual place say?  The museum of death attracts many, mainly due to its unusualness and originality.  There are also dissatisfied visitors claiming that there are very few exhibits and information in this institution, and the ticket is disproportionately expensive.  Often disappointed are those visitors who go to the death museum with a desire to see something dark and mystical.  However, for a single trip, this place is in any case ideal.  Inspecting the four halls will not take too much time, and the cost of entry is two times lower than the average movie ticket.  So why not please yourself with new experiences and go to the museum of death?  The exhibits here are very different, and you will definitely like at least some of them.  Do not forget to bring a camera with you - shooting is free and is encouraged by museum management. </p>
