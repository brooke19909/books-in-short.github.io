Of course, this is the price of the device, the reputation of the manufacturer, the positioning of the model, its technical characteristics.  Given that there are a huge number of smartphones today, choosing a really worthwhile one (even using the mentioned criteria) is not so simple.  Therefore, it is necessary to select a device that could satisfy your needs. </p><p>  One of the most important criteria, as recognized by ordinary users, is the time of the phone.  This parameter determines whether you can use your device, say, on the road, in nature or somewhere else where there are restrictions regarding the ability to charge the phone. </p><p>  Therefore, in this article we will talk about mobile phones, which are industry leaders in terms of battery capacity.  It's about Phillips.  However, first we will reveal a little bit about how the battery supply affects the device‚Äôs operating time, and how the charge is used in practice. </p><h2>  What determines the lifetime of the phone </h2>

    <p>  So, let's start with how the determination of the operating time of a device generally occurs - what it depends on, how it can be extended, and how the battery affects it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each battery is the only default power source for the phone (unless you resort to power banks and various special battery cases).  Accordingly, it determines how long the phone will work. </p><p>  In addition to the battery, of course, the degree of charge consumption of various services and services available on the phone also affects the duration of the ‚Äúlife‚Äù of a smartphone. </p><p>  For example, a Philips phone with the most powerful battery lasts a long time, not only because of its capacitive battery, but also because of the high level of optimization of electric energy consumption in the device.  This is extremely important, given that there are smartphones that have small batteries, but work for a long time.  To describe this in more detail, we suggest referring to the definition of the main characteristics of the phone‚Äôs battery. </p><h2>  What is battery capacity? </h2><p>  Surely, while reading the characteristics of this or that gadget, you noticed such a parameter as ‚Äúbattery capacity‚Äù.  Maybe you even saw that it is measured in mAh (milliampere-hours).  You also most likely saw the Philips phone with the most powerful battery - a smartphone that has this indicator higher than in other models. </p>

    <p>  In fact, capacity reflects the battery‚Äôs ability to accumulate charge.  The logic here is extremely simple: the larger the capacity, the more the device will be able to accumulate during charging and, accordingly, the longer will be its working time. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The more mAh the battery has, the longer it will be able to work.  For example, the Philips phone with the most powerful battery (5500th model) has a battery with a capacity of 2800 mAh.  For comparison: the average Chinese tablet computer has a battery with 3500 mAh, and the 6th generation iPhone has about 1900 mAh.  To understand how durable the Phillips battery is, just look at the characteristics of the device: it is a phone that consumes many times less charge than the same tablet or iPhone.  At the same time, it is equipped with a powerful battery, the charge of which can extend the operating time of the smartphone up to 2-3 weeks without an outlet.  Great, isn't it?  A tablet or an average smartphone has never dreamed of such a period. </p><h2>  How to find out the capacity? </h2><p>  So, imagine that you want to buy a Philips phone with the most powerful battery, but don‚Äôt know how to make a choice.  You do not understand the batteries, because of which you can not find out its capacity and compare the data obtained, say, with batteries of other models.  What to do in this case? </p>

    <p>  We tell you <span>how to determine the battery capacity.</span>  There are two simple ways.  The first is to find out directly in the specifications for the model, published on a store shelf, on an online storefront, or in the device overview.  The second is suitable for those who are not "friends" with the online rather closely.  The method is to remove the back cover of the phone and find out the capacity yourself.  It must be indicated on the battery label. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What is the charge used for? </h2><p>  To understand more clearly how the data on the battery charge and the phone model are related, we give a clear example.  Take the Philips phone with the most powerful battery (on the buttons) and any other smartphone with a touch screen. </p><p>  Firstly, the battery charge is spent many times more on the backlight of a display that recognizes user touch than on the backlight of a ‚Äúpixel‚Äù screen. </p><p>  Secondly, the operating system plays a role.  Agree that a phone running on Android will consume more charge than a similar device that runs without an OS and performs basic functions. </p><p>  Thirdly, we should mention the basic needs of the user with a smartphone (3G or 4G mobile Internet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi connection) and the owner of a simple phone with buttons - calls and SMS. </p><p>  If we compare these factors, we get a clear picture: not only the battery capacity determines the <span>life of the</span> device without recharging.  Important is the mode of operation of the phone.  That is why in order to save power on Samsung or iPhone, it is recommended to turn on ‚ÄúAirplane mode‚Äù, which disconnects all networks. </p><h2>  The ratio of device parameters and battery capacity </h2><p>  Just if you take into account the Philips phone with the most powerful battery for two SIM-cards (push-button), then it has a fairly impressive margin (2800 mAh, as already noted).  At the same time, some smartphones have even smaller batteries, despite the fact that they are designed to perform more capacitive (in terms of charge consumption) tasks. </p><p>  Therefore, in any case, the characteristics of Phillips devices can be called winning, both in the absolute sense and in comparison with other models (competitors).  This applies not only to the button, but also to the touch gadget.  By the way, it can also rightfully be called a Philips phone with the most powerful battery, but in the world of smartphones. </p><h2>  Best Touch Philips </h2><p>  If you haven‚Äôt guessed yet, this is the Xenium W6610.  This phone, however, is not much different from its competitors in its price segment.  The phone is equipped with a 5-inch screen capable of transmitting Full HD images;  a processor consisting of 4 cores;  slot for a memory card (in addition to the provided built-in 4 GB) and other functionalities. </p>

    <p>  But the main ‚Äútrump card‚Äù of the device is its battery.  Its capacity is 5300 mAh, which, when compared, is overpriced even for an average tablet.  True, a tablet computer consumes a charge much faster than this phone, which indicates the long life of the latter (in practice, this is about 18 hours of active use of all services). </p>

    <h2>  The best push-button Philips </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the Philips phone with the most powerful battery (push-button, 5500th model) is the best.  The fact that it has a battery with a capacity of 2900 mAh in the absence of a touch display makes it the undisputed leader in the industry.  At the same time, you should not think that the device is a ‚Äúbrick‚Äù or ‚Äúgrandmother‚Äù.  No, the Phillips 5500 has the ability to access the mobile Internet, there is a good 5-megapixel camera and a slot for a memory card. </p>

    <h2>  Other advantages of models </h2><p>  The undoubted advantages of both phones are their build quality and price.  Phillips, despite its small (relatively) hype in the market for mobile devices, is able to produce high-quality devices at an affordable price.  This can be understood if we compare both the Philips phone with the most powerful battery (5300 mAh capacity) and the ‚Äúpush-button‚Äù device of the 5500 model. This allows them to be present on the market and, in addition, also outperform competitors. </p>
