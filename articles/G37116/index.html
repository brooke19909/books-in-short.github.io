    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  If you have never been to Thailand, Pattaya Park Hotel is sure to appeal to you.  This is often said by tourists who have visited this country more than once and managed to explore most of its resorts and hotels.  Despite the fact that this complex is far from new, it is still very popular among travelers from all over the world.  The mid-eighties of the last century is considered to be the year of construction of the hotel. Over the entire period of its existence, its building and territory have undergone reconstruction more than once.  Therefore, many guests note in the reviews about the Pattaya Park Hotel (Thailand) that it looks very well-groomed and modern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory of the hotel complex is unusually huge for Asia.  It housed not only residential buildings, the necessary infrastructure, gardens, but also a full-fledged amusement park with a wide range of water and land attractions.  Hotel guests can visit it in free mode, while other tourists often come here to spend the next day of vacation with their children. </p><p>  Hotel "Pattaya Park 3 *" (Thailand) has two residential buildings.  The first consists of fifteen floors and can accommodate guests in two hundred and forty rooms of various categories.  The second is a high tower, from which you can slide down the cable as an entertainment.  The twenty-five-story tower is considered the highest residential block in Asia; four hundred and sixty rooms are equipped here. </p><p>  The hotel complex belongs to the urban type.  In tourist catalogs it is indicated that the road separates it from the sea.  However, in reality, it looks more like a pedestrian promenade, which does not cause inconvenience to vacationers. </p><p>  I would also like to add that the hotel treats tourists from Russia very well.  Even many tablets on the territory are written in our native language, so it will be not only pleasant to relax here, but also comfortable. </p><h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Pattaya Park Beach Resort Hotel (Thailand) is located in a very convenient place for tourists.  From here, they can easily get to shops, markets, shopping centers and nightlife.  This fact makes the hotel complex even more attractive for vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not be upset that the hotel is located quite far from the international airport.  This information primarily applies to inexperienced travelers who are traveling to Thailand for the first time.  Remember that Pattaya is located from Bangkok at a distance exceeding one hundred and sixty kilometers.  It can be overcome on a flat highway in about two hours. </p><p>  The hotel complex is located in the northern part of Jomtien Beach.  Guests can walk to major shopping centers in ten minutes, the famous Volkin Street is located at about the same distance, and the huge Teprazit market opens almost next to the hotel on weekends.  It is very profitable to buy souvenirs, cosmetics, clothes and products. </p><p>  If you need a tuk-tuk stop, then know that it is opposite the hotel.  Such a convenient location of the Pattaya Park Hotel in Thailand makes it extremely popular and in demand.  Tourists in the reviews mention that it is almost always completely populated. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The beach area is not a strong point of Pattaya.  Despite the fact that the entire resort stretches along the sea, it is not always comfortable to swim here.  First of all, it is worth remembering that all the beaches in the city are municipal.  Therefore, do not be surprised that the huge Pattaya Park Hotel does not have its own private beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Guests go to the city, where you have to pay for sunbeds and umbrellas.  Some of our compatriots preferred to save on rent, coming to the beach only to plunge into the sea.  Once after that, they returned back to the hotel grounds to free sun loungers. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of Pattaya Park, in Thailand it is best to choose islands for sea bathing.  There is very clear water and amazingly beautiful beaches.  But in Pattaya, the sea is quite muddy, and on the coast you can find a lot of garbage.  Therefore, vacationers are advised to come to the beach early in the morning, when the water is still relatively clean.  By lunchtime, the wind begins and the impression of rest spoils significantly. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  It is difficult to describe in a few words all that is located on the territory of the Pattaya Park Hotel.  In Pattaya, perhaps, there is no other such complex where tourists would be so comfortable. </p><p>  The hotel has two pools, one located on the roof of a high tower.  Tourists write that visitors from China are very fond of resting here.  The second pool is located in the shade of palm trees and is surrounded by a host of other plants. Our compatriots have chosen this recreation area. </p><p>  Guests often visit the spa and gym equipped at the hotel.  The wellness center offers guests a variety of treatments that will help you to completely relax and even become more beautiful.  The gym is equipped with a large number of modern simulators, which cannot but please those who carefully monitor their figure. </p><p>  Pattaya Park Hotel has seven restaurants and several bars.  Each of the establishments can please and surprise its guests with unusual dishes of national and European cuisine. </p><p>  Reception is open 24 hours a day.  Sometimes guests complain that the staff does not speak Russian, but in fact, almost every employee understands our compatriots without any problems. </p><p>  At the reception you can hand over things to the left-luggage office and exchange currency.  Moreover, as guests of the hotel say, it is quite profitable to change money here.  In some banks, the rate is much lower than in a hotel. </p><p>  Hotel "Pattaya Park 3 *" has a roomy conference room.  It hosts business meetings and special occasions.  This service is paid separately, you can also use office equipment. </p><p>  If you want to go shopping, you can not even go outside the hotel.  On its territory there are numerous shops that sell almost everything from souvenirs to exclusive jewelry. </p>

    <h2>  Talk about services </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the Pattaya Park Hotel (Thailand) has three stars, it boasts a rather high level of service.  This is noted by almost all of his guests. </p><p>  They enthusiastically talk about the free Internet, which perfectly catches in all parts of the hotel.  It is noteworthy that in Thailand, problems with the Internet are quite common.  Therefore, a good signal is very pleasing to vacationers. </p><p>  In Pattaya, many tourists rent bikes in order to move freely around the resort.  They need a guarded parking lot, where you can leave your transport.  The hotel provides such a service for free. </p><p>  Having settled in a hotel complex, you can not worry about your things.  Laundry, dry cleaning and ironing facilities are available.  Therefore, guests take their clothes to the laundry room absolutely calmly and then enjoy clean and perfectly ironed clothes. </p><p>  24-hour room service greatly facilitates the lives of vacationers who wish to be alone.  At any time, day or night, the staff will bring food to the apartment or fulfill another whim of the guests. </p>

    <h2>  Briefly about the rules </h2><p>  Reviews about the Pattaya Park Hotel in Thailand practically do not contain information about the rules and features of living in it.  Therefore, we could not ignore this topic. </p><p>  Check-in at the hotel is after 1 pm.  In some cases, the settlement process may drag on until the evening, however, such cases are still a rarity.  To leave the room, guests are allocated a time interval from eleven o'clock in the morning to noon. </p><p>  If you will book apartments via the Internet, be sure to study the cancellation policy.  For some categories of rooms it is impossible to return money. </p><p>  Do not forget that you can‚Äôt move into a room with pets.  Therefore, leave your pets at home with loved ones or relatives. </p>

    <h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  The hotel positions itself as a family.  People come here very often with children of any age, which makes potential tourists look for information about possible accommodation options with a child. </p><p>  The hotel provides check-in for children in extra beds.  For this, parents should pay about seven hundred baht per day.  The cost of living in a third adult apartment is the same. </p>

    <h2>  Room characteristics </h2><p>  The hotel complex is characterized in that it offers many accommodation options.  In the main building there are two hundred and forty rooms: </p><ul><li>  Standards  Most of these apartments in the block are two hundred and sixteen.  Room size does not exceed twenty eight squares, on which it is permissible to place three people. </li><li>  Two-bedroom suites.  Twenty-four rooms are comfortable for families.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äãsixty-five square meters there are two bedrooms, a living room and a bathroom.  All rooms are separated by doors.  Usually these rooms are comfortable even for five guests. </li></ul><p>  Four hundred and sixty apartments are equipped in the residential building-tower: </p><ul><li>  Standards  Four hundred and twenty rooms are identical to the previous description of apartments of this category, but differ slightly in technical equipment. </li><li>  One bedroom suites.  Forty rooms with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãforty-five squares are designed for couples with a child.  The bedroom has a double bed for parents.  The child is placed on the sofa in the living room. </li></ul><p>  All rooms are well equipped and have balconies.  However, in the reviews of guests it is often mentioned that the furniture in the rooms still needs to be updated.  But this does not spoil the impression of rest too much and corresponds to the "three rubles". </p><h2>  Food concept </h2><p>  Thai hotels rarely operate on an all-inclusive basis, so don‚Äôt expect that you will have access to food in the restaurant at any time of the day.  Guests can book a room with included breakfast, half board or guest house.  However, finding a good cafe outside the hotel is easy.  Every experienced traveler knows that street <span>food in Pattaya is</span> very tasty and affordable, so it‚Äôs usually enough to pay for breakfast at the hotel. </p><p>  There are a lot of restaurants in the complex.  For example, an institution in the main building is waiting for guests around the clock.  On the fifty-second floor of the tower there is a luxurious panoramic restaurant, a similar establishment is also located on the floor above.  There are two more restaurants on the top floors of the tower.  Also on site you can visit establishments serving Thai national cuisine, or a cafe in which you will be offered a wide selection of snacks for every taste. </p><p>  Hotel guests usually speak well of the quality of the dishes in the restaurant.  However, many notice that breakfasts are pretty monotonous and are repeated every day.  Of the fruits on the table, there are only pineapple and watermelon.  Despite the fact that breakfasts are served according to the "buffet" system, it is extremely difficult for guests to choose something truly delicious.  In addition, the monotony begins to bother on the fourth day of presence in the hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  A bit about the amusement park </h2><p>  In today's article, we could not fail to mention the amusement park, which attracts the attention of almost every tourist who first arrived in Pattaya.  We will not describe all the attractions that are located here, but we will give a brief description of the park. </p><p>  First of all, vacationers come here for water activities.  Of course, their choice is not so wide, but this is quite enough for the park to be completely filled every day.  Some guests enjoy riding the slides, others lazily floating along the huge river that goes around the park, and still others just frolic in the numerous pools. </p><p>  If you want to explore the area from a height, then you can ride the <span>cable car.</span>  You will be put in a trailer with panoramic windows, and you will enjoy the magnificent view of the bustling Pattaya. </p><p>  Thrill lovers will also find <span>something to please themselves.</span>  Many enthusiastically respond to the ride, based on freefall, while others liked the roller coaster.  It is nice that both adults and children always find something special here. </p><p>  Those who are hungry will not have to go outside the park to eat.  On its territory there are cafes where you will be offered almost any dish to choose from.  Children especially love local ice cream with a wide variety of toppings. </p><p>  We hope that in our article we managed to at least slightly convey the atmosphere of this amazing place in Thailand.  The photos of Pattaya Park Hotel will complement the picture and give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rest that you will have if you get a tour to this famous hotel complex. </p>
