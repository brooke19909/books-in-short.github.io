This is due to the rejection of the monthly fee, the introduction of free calls within the network, as well as due to various marketing tricks, aimed primarily at convincing the user of the profitability of the tariff and its exclusive conditions. </p><h2>  Kyivstar is the leader of the Ukrainian communications market </h2><p>  The leader of the telecom services sector of Ukraine, Kyivstar, is no exception.  This is the second oldest operator, which today provides communication services to more than 20 million subscribers (and this figure is constantly growing).  By constantly updating its product line, improving communication quality, as well as reducing the cost of services, the company manages to constantly maintain leadership positions in such a busy market. </p>

    <p>  She also succeeds at the expense of interesting <span>tariff plans,</span> which quite quickly attract subscribers with some of their features.  For example, the tariff ‚ÄúHello, a quarter!  My region ‚Äù, which will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Kyivstar tariffs </h2><p>  To date, the company has about 7 new tariffs in the services basket, their number is constantly changing.

My region ‚Äù(Kharkov is one of the cities where it can be activated) is also archived, as it is no longer offered to new subscribers.  However, it continues to operate in normal mode if the user switched to it earlier. </p>

    <h2>  Priorities </h2><p>  Today, the tariff plan that was offered in the product network from Kyivstar, the operator of Digus, is Hello, Quarter!  My region, ‚Äùwould be irrelevant due to incorrectly prioritized.  In particular, the plan excludes access to mobile Internet for the reason that it provides for the use of a GPRS connection.  Of course, this can be done now, but it is unlikely that anyone would think of going into the network in this format. </p><p>  Still here, of course, there is no way to work with a 3G connection - this network has recently been launched in Ukraine.  And all the operators began to instantly conduct large-scale advertising campaigns to attract people. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Tariff "Hello, quarter!  My region </h2><p>  What does this plan provide?  It is designed for the subscriber to make "home" calls within the network.  This is indicated at least by the fact that the operator Kyivstar has ‚ÄúHello, a quarter!‚Äù  My region ‚Äùare not charged minutes of calls to subscribers of their network, as well as‚Äú Didzus ‚Äù.  According to this scheme, the user is offered 200 minutes every day for calls on his network.  In this case, the connection fee is not charged. </p><p>  The tariff is really very beneficial for long conversations with Kyivstar subscribers like you.  Plus, it‚Äôs important where the subscriber is calling (in geographical terms).  If, for example, the user has selected ‚ÄúHello, quarter!  My region is Kharkov, then completely different tariffs will apply to calls to Odessa.  Read more about this below. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of services </h2><p>  How much does it cost to use the package, you can find out on the tariff page.  First of all, there is a lack of connection fees.  It is further indicated that within the territory where the tariff was activated (referring to the subscriber‚Äôs location area), the cost of minutes for Kyivstar calls is 25 kopecks.  At the same time, there is a note below: for calls within the network with a subscriber from another region, you will have to pay 74 kopecks per minute. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As for conversations with other networks, they are charged at 70 kopecks per minute.  At the same time, conversations with other <span>landline phones</span> in Ukraine will cost 1.25 hryvnia.  Other services, in particular SMS messages, will cost 75 kopecks, and MMS will cost 1.45 UAH / unit.  On a regular basis nothing is said about the <span>monthly fee</span> , there is information only about the need to make 2.35 UAH.  per day, which go to the account of using GPRS Internet services.  As far as is known, in relation to the tariff ‚ÄúHello, quarter!  My region ‚Äù, no changes were made, therefore, all these prices were valid at the time the tariff was connected. </p>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Regarding what online access services are provided under this plan, I would like to write separately.  As already noted, we are talking about GPRS access for 2.35 hryvnia per day.  For this price, the subscriber receives 50 megabytes of traffic at a higher speed (which, unfortunately, is not specified), after which it drops to 32 kbit / s.  Thus, Kyivstar and Didus have Hello, Quarter!  My region ‚Äùassumes the availability of unlimited Internet in the old and slow data transfer format.  We talked about this earlier - at least due to this, this plan cannot be called modern and relevant.  Perhaps, earlier, subscribers switched to ‚ÄúHello quarter!‚Äù  My region. "  Tariff plans in force today have much more opportunities, offering 3G connection services. </p>

    <h2>  What is the benefit? </h2><p>  However, it cannot be said that the plan in question was not in demand.  At the time the service entered the market, it offered rather interesting conditions.  In particular, a clear plus was the lack of a fee for calls within the network and for the connection.  For users who often talk on the phone, this clearly appealed to them.  Also, the tariff did not provide for a mandatory monthly fee, so you can use it for calls, in fact, for free - if only we will talk about conversations with subscribers from your region. </p><p>  In a sense, for Kyivstar, ‚ÄúHello, quarter!‚Äù  My Region ‚Äùwas an excellent <span>marketing move,</span> allowing you to attract new people to your network.  If you change the conditions regarding the Internet connection (in particular, provide 3G instead of GPRS), he would surely be in high demand. </p><h2>  How to go? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, ‚ÄúHello, quarter!  My region ‚Äùis the tariff plan, which has been moved to the‚Äú Archive ‚Äùsection of the Kyivstar website.  This means that the tariff no longer registers new members.  Yes, on this plan those who switched earlier (as already noted) can be served, however, it is impossible to switch to the tariff again.  The operator‚Äôs portfolio has many other interesting plans.  Compared to ‚ÄúHello quarter!‚Äù  My region ‚Äù, the changes in them are simply colossal. </p>

    <h2>  Other profitable plans </h2><p>  The first thing that distinguishes them from the one that we characterized throughout the article is the Internet.  The company has a clear distribution for what purpose the package is used.  Even tariff plans designed for calls have the ability to receive a small amount of traffic from the operator - 50 megabytes per day - to work with mail, social networks and news sites.  As for a separate category of plans - ‚ÄúFor the Internet‚Äù, here you can find options that allow you to watch movies online.  ‚ÄúHello quarter!  My region ‚Äù, of course, far from this. </p><p>  You can also note a slight decrease in the cost of services.  For example, two tariffs ‚ÄúFor calls‚Äù cost only 15 and 20 hryvnias per month.  Under these plans, the subscriber is given an unlimited number of minutes to talk on the network, as well as 50 Mb of Internet.  The tariff ‚ÄúFor calls to all networks‚Äù also provides the opportunity to get 60 minutes per month to communicate with numbers of other networks. </p><p>  There are also tariffs ‚ÄúFor smartphone‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor smartphone +‚Äù, providing for a monthly fee of 25 and 40 hryvnia.  The first offers a price of 60 kopecks per minute of conversation with other networks and 500 MB of traffic.  The second package receives 60 minutes for talking with other networks and 1,500 megabytes for using the Internet.  There is also a tariff ‚ÄúFor an extra smartphone‚Äù, within which the subscriber is offered unlimited calls on the network, 200 minutes to other networks per month, 2.5 GB of traffic at a price of 120 hryvnias. </p><p>  Kyivstar also has two premium tariffs at 500 and 800 hryvnia per month.  They offer unlimited calls on the network, for 1,500 and 2,500 minutes to other people's networks, as well as 5 and 7 GB of traffic, respectively.  Compare them with ‚ÄúHello quarter!‚Äù  My region ‚Äù, of course, it makes no sense, but it would be advisable to clarify that the choice of tariff plans is quite large here.  You need to understand that the company does not stand still, therefore in its package there are still tariffs, from which you can choose based on your wishes and preferences. </p><p>  But ‚ÄúHello quarter!  My region ‚Äùis closed to new transitions, so we could only get acquainted with it for general information. </p>
