In 1676, there was a mention of the pond on a map compiled from special Swedish materials.  Then its name was somewhat different - ‚ÄúSwede‚Äù. </p><p>  The bay, which is located not far from the reservoir, has a maximum depth of 4 m. Lake Horovaldayskoye is an area whose bottom does not overgrow because it has a sandy structure. </p><p>  The pond itself is small, rich in fish.  In some areas, the bottom moves away from the surface by a distance of 10 m. The water is not flowing, and streams flow from the south side (which periodically dry up).  Thanks to birds developing on the surface, new species of fish are brought.  This is due to the transfer of eggs from the waters of the Gulf of Finland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gorovaldaysky lake" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Geographical coordinates and natural features </h2><p>  In the Lomonosov district of the Leningrad region, the Gorovalday lake is spread.  It was formed as a result of the separation of the Gulf of Finland by land, a narrow sandy hill. </p><p>  The pond is small, about four and a half kilometers long and one kilometer wide.  It has an oblong shape from east to west and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã2.8 square meters.  km  Depth is not precisely defined.  According to one option, it is 5.5 m, in another - presumably up to 15 m. Most likely, the deep reference depends on the time of year and natural factors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the south, the coastal zone is covered with <span>forest (pine</span> and mixed), in the east, the village of Gora-Valdai adjoins the lake.  On the north side is a highway. </p><p>  Lake Horowaldai is a pond that is fed by several large streams flowing in from the forest and drying out in hot weather, and a narrow canal connects it to the Gulf of Finland.  The water surface is clean, transparent, not overgrown with plants.  Due to the content of peat in the bottom soil, the color of the water sometimes becomes a reddish or yellowish hue.  The bottom on almost all sides is sandy, only from the west and east it is rocky, at a depth it passes into silt. </p><h2>  Meaning of the name </h2><p>  Lake Horowaldai got its special name because of its close proximity to the <span>village of Gora-Valdai,</span> whose name is translated from Finnish as "elevated area".  In addition, you can hear the second name - Shepelevsky Lake, which is also associated with the name of the nearby village of the same name.  The latter was awarded as a reward to General S. A. Shepelev. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Horowaldai lake reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The forest belt adjacent to the lake on the south side involves a pine forest where a large number of mammals live: wolf, elk, wild boar, fox, bear, hare.  The bird population is also diverse: geese, swans, capercaillie, ducks.  The territory of the Gorovalday reservoir is rich in mushrooms, herbs, berries (lingonberries, raspberries).  In the depths of the lake live ruff, pikeperch, bleak, pike, perch, roach, eel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Horowaldai Lake: how to get there? </h2><p>  Consider several options for how to get to the reservoir: </p><ul><li>  By rail to the station Krasnoflotsk, which is located in the village of <span>Fort Krasnaya Gorka.</span>  Then 6 kilometers by bus or taxi. </li><li>  By bus or autoline, following the route St. Petersburg - Sosnovy Bor. </li><li>  By car on the highway 41A 007. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Adventure lovers </h2><p>  The picturesque area, clean air and the convenient location of the reservoir make it an attractive destination for tourists.  In nearby settlements (Pulkovo, Shepelevo) you can always get inexpensive housing, and in the village of Gora-Valdai on the coast for travelers built wooden Finnish houses, from whose windows a breathtaking view of the lake or slender rows of pine trees opens. </p><p>  Many convenient places with sandy slopes to the water are suitable for tourists with tents. </p><p>  Vacationers can hunt, rent a boat and ride on the lake surface, take a swim in the clear waters, go hiking for mushrooms or berries, take a steam bath in the bathhouse or lie on the beach, arrange a ‚Äúphoto walk‚Äù, since the local surroundings have it.  Lake Horovaldayskoye (always positive reviews) has a bike path that adjoins the Shepelevsky lighthouse, the ‚ÄúGray Horse‚Äù battery in the village of Chernaya Lakhta or the fortress, which is located 30 kilometers from the lake in the village of Koporye.  For those who wish, sightseeing trips to the Gulf of Finland are organized. </p><p>  In recent years, the lake began to attract fans of Russian freediving - scuba diving with a breath hold.  True, so far in small quantities. </p><p>  In winter, vacationers can go to Tuutari Park, a ski resort located 100 kilometers from Lake Horowaldai, where you can ride a cheesecake, ski, skate or ride a horse. </p><h2>  Horowaldai Lake: fishing </h2><p>  The feedback from the fishermen is shared: someone claims that you should not wait for a rich catch now, there were a lot of fish forty years ago.  Others say you need to catch skillfully.  Because of the clear water, the fish is careful, and you should get close to it carefully. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gorovaldaysky lake how to get there" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1150290.jpg" width="510"></div>
