Its economic and military importance was due to the convenient location of the city, because of which, over the centuries, there was a struggle between the princes, whose possessions were adjacent to the city, as well as between Lithuania and Moscow.  At the end of the XV century, Rzhev, according to the decree of Vasily II, passed to Boris Tversky, after which he was divided by his sons.  Consequently, part of the city on the banks of the Volga was called the Prince-Dmitry side, on the second - the Prince-Fedorov side. </p>

One suggestion is directly related to the word rye.  It is supported by the fact that the local residents of today's Rzhev were called "rozhevichs".  The remaining hypotheses are sent to the word "rzhava" and the name of the river Java.

    <p>  By the beginning of the eighteenth century, Rzhev became a large commercial and industrial center, where 25 different factories, manufactories operate, regional fairs are held, and warehouses and marinas are being built. </p><p>  The city of those years is a city of Old Believers.  Of the 8,000 Old Believers throughout the Tver region, 2/3 lived here.  But today, little resembles that Rzhev.  Most of the sights were destroyed during various wars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Residents of the city took part in the war of 1812, and then the bold and brave scout A.N. Selivanov, who almost once captured Napoleon, was especially famous. </p><p>  The bloody and tragic page in the history of Rzhev was the years of World War II, as the city survived the 17-month occupation, which turned into the massacre of prisoners of war and residents, the destruction of all institutions, enterprises to the foundation, the burning of forests and city parks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rzhev sights" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/221018.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1978, Rzhev received the <span>Order of the Patriotic War</span> of the 1st degree.  In 2007, he was proclaimed the "City of Military Glory."  Everlasting <span>fire</span> near the Old Bridge, the <span>Alley of Heroes of the</span> USSR in Grazinsky Park, as well as mass graves will always remind the Rzhevitans of the courage of their grandfathers and fathers. </p><p>  <strong>Sights of Rzhev: Smolensk cemetery church</strong> </p><p>  This monument was among 4 historical Rzhev churches that could survive during the war.  However, the cemetery church is the only structure in this series that has not been restored.  Now it is a picturesque ruin, which, nevertheless, is of interest as an object of inspection. </p><p>  <strong>Sights of Rzhev: Manor of Akim Nemilov</strong> </p><p>  The estate is one of the most iconic empire monuments of Rzhev.  It was built in 1837 according to the project of an architect from Moscow in a rather distinctive style and is part of the development of Okovetskaya Street. </p><p>  <strong>Sights of Rzhev: Okovets Church</strong> </p>

Thanks to the clearing sheets, we know that the construction of the shrine was completed by 1821.

    <p>  <strong>Sights of Rzhev: Museum of Local Lore</strong> </p><p>  This museum appeared in 1916, while before the revolution it was called the Natural History Museum, and then it was renamed the Historical and Archaeological Museum. </p><p>  Considering the sights of Rzhev (photos of some of them are given above), everyone has a desire to be in this amazing city at least once, the history of which combines many tragic and joyful events. </p>
