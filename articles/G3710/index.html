The bulk of people do not know the answer to it.  How to get rid of this bitterness also remains a mystery. </p><p>  Bitterness, as a rule, brings unpleasant taste sensations.  Since ancient times, a bitter taste has been associated with something poisonous, and many plant poisons have just that taste.  Bitter cucumbers fell out of favor not at all because of this.  Cucumber itself is a rather capricious plant and very tender.  Large night and day temperature fluctuations are unacceptable to him.  Cucumber does not welcome both cold and excessive heat.  Such conditions are somewhat stressful for him, and therefore he produces a protective anti-stress substance called cucurbitacin.  That is why cucumbers are bitter, and their variety affects this to a lesser extent.  The more this substance, the more bitter the fetus will be.  The main part of cucurbitacin is concentrated in the peduncle.  As they mature, bitterness decreases markedly. </p><p>  When it became clear why the cucumbers are bitter, many breeders were obsessed with the dream of developing a variety that would not respond to any temperature fluctuations.  For decades, sweet varieties were bred by the selection of plants containing a small amount of cucurbitacin.  During the selection process, it was not the fruits themselves that were tasted, but their cotyledon leaves.  Based on this, it was concluded that if these seedlings do not have a bitter taste, then the fruits will also not be bitter. </p><p>  In the study of fruits, scientists discovered genes that were responsible for the presence of bitterness.  They tried to develop hybrids in which bitterness would be minimized.  Such selection selection yielded positive results.  But recently, these hybrids have also begun to be bitter.  The explanation for this phenomenon, according to experts, lies in the impact on the genomes of plants of <span>solar radiation.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What growing conditions can affect the taste of cucumbers?  They should be known to everyone who wants to have sweet fruits in their garden.  One of the reasons that cucumbers are bitter is the effect of direct sunlight on them.  Five to seven hot days in a row are enough for the bitterness of the fruit to increase significantly. </p><p>  In addition, these plants need moderate watering, but not very cold water.  In extreme heat, they should be watered in small doses, morning and evening.  The soil needs to be moistened no less than ten to fifteen centimeters in depth.  The taste of cucumbers is affected by very cold weather or, conversely, too hot.  Bitterness appears in them also due to the strong temperature difference.  Negatively affects the taste of the fruit, top dressing them with fresh manure.  Periodically, the soil around the plants needs to be loosened, and the whips do not need to be turned over when collecting fruits, otherwise they will dry out. </p><p>  Ideal conditions for <span>growing cucumbers</span> are moisture, heat and partial shade.  However, if the <span>cucumber (varieties</span> do not matter) is still bitter, the trouble is small.  The tip of the fruit, on which the tail is located, is the most bitter.  It can be trimmed or cleaned with a knife, but do not forget that it is in the peel that contains the largest amount of nutrients.  When pickling or <span>pickling, cucumbers</span> completely lose their bitterness.  It should be noted that cucurbititacin is absolutely harmless to health, and may even be useful in the fight against some diseases.  A little bitterness gives some dishes a special piquancy. </p><p>  Therefore, do not be too puzzled by the problem of why cucumbers are bitter, and fight hard with this.  Indeed, according to the testimony of many studies, the substances contained in bitter fruits help in the fight against overweight, and also contribute to lowering blood sugar.  And many more secrets will have to be revealed to scientists in order to fully study the properties of this fruit. </p>
