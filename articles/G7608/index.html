    <h2>  First you need to come </h2><p>  In order to get to know the city better, first you need to get into it.  And there are several ways to do this.  So, if you decide to take the train, it is better to do it from Moscow, from the Kursk station.  Several trains depart from here.  All of them arrive directly to the Podolsk station.  In this case, the whole trip will take you a little more than an hour. </p><p>  How to get to Podolsk by bus?  Very simple - there are two buses from the Yuzhnaya metro station.  Such a journey will take from 65 to 72 minutes.  From the Teply Stan station, several flights also run. </p><p>  Well, the last option is a car.  This is the longest way, and it sometimes takes almost two hours, but you can admire all the beauties of Moscow and its environs. </p><h2>  Ancient information </h2><p>  Podolsk, the sights of which we will consider below, is located on the Pakhra River.  Previously, the shores of this reservoir were inhabited by Baltic and Finno-Ugric tribes.  Later Vyatichi migrated here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The first mention of local residents of Podil, who have chosen the territory of the current settlement, dates from 1627-1628.  Then the main areas of activity of the settlement were agriculture and trade. </p><p>  When the postal mill opened in the village, the economic development of Podil began.  In 1781, Empress Catherine II assigned him the status of a city, renamed it Podolsk, and at the same time construction of a wooden church of the Sign of the Blessed Virgin began. </p><p>  Today, the city of Podolsk is included in the list of the largest cultural and economically important centers of the Moscow Region.  Its population is approximately 200 thousand people. </p><h2>  Let's start the tour </h2><p>  Perhaps, acquaintance with the city is worth starting from the monument to Catherine the Second - a person whom Podolsk owes a lot.  The monument was opened in 2008, and it is located next to the railway station.  The sculptors captured the Empress at the moment when she signed the decree on conferring the status of the city on Podil.  <span>The bronze statue of the</span> empress weighs more than two tons. </p><p>  Podolsk, the sights of which we will explore, is also famous for the Trinity Cathedral, dedicated to the victory in World War II.  The temple is built of brick in the manner of classicism.  White stone details act as decorative elements of the structure. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The Vocational Education Museum is another attraction that deserves the attention of tourists.  You can find him in the estate Ivanovo.  In Soviet times, a strong educational system was created that trained workers at industrial enterprises.  Thanks to these shots, the estate acquired a second life as a museum.  Today, the institution is a multidisciplinary institution of a cultural, educational, scientific and methodological nature. </p><h2>  Manors of Podolsk </h2><p>  Podolsk, whose attractions are described in our review, is replete with various estates.  Let's visit some of them.  For example, Dubrovitsy is a one-of-a-kind manor architectural complex.  It was built in 1627.  On the estate there is the Church of the Sign, huge princely mansions with covered galleries, balconies and terraces.  There is also a magnificent fountain, a park in which linden trees grow, a restored horse yard with <span>gothic-style</span> gates <span>,</span> charming flower beds and alleys.  The last clan that owned the estate was the Golitsyn clan.  Within the walls of the modern estate of Dubrovitsy you can find <span>the Wedding Palace.</span> </p><p>  The Ivanovskoye estate, founded in the 18th century, is located on one of the banks of Pakhra.  Count Tolstoy himself became the developer of the project of this attraction.  The main manor house is a three-story building.  Next to the building is a park pavilion and a theater building on two floors.  The current state of affairs of the estate is as follows: part of the estate is half destroyed, and the main complex offers to visit the museums located within its walls. </p>

    <h2>  Sewing machine </h2><p>  Podolsk, whose sights are so diverse, has another interesting monument - it is a monument to the Singer brand sewing machine.  It was installed in the city in 2011.  The bronze sculpture was cast and hoisted on a pedestal made of red granite tiles.  The sculpture just fit perfectly into the overall architecture of the city.  The masterpiece itself is a machine that sews a historic city map in the form of a carpet.  On the map itself are images of the sights of Podolsk.  So, the sculpture of the empress, a monument to the first trolleybus, various temples and other interesting objects are visible.  In height, the Singer reaches 3.5 meters. </p>
