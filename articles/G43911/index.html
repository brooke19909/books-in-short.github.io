Reviews of tourists on this subject are extremely mixed.  Some argue that vacation on the largest island of Thailand in early autumn will be liked only by big rain lovers.  Others say that they found fine weather, and showers took place exclusively at night.  When they left the hotel room in the morning, there was no sign of puddles under the equatorial sun.  So who to believe? </p><p>  The weather, of course, is a capricious young lady.  But the climate is stable everywhere.  And the hydrometeocenter in Phuket does not reassure potential beach holidaymakers: August and September here are the two rainy months of the year.  But is it really so bad?  Is it possible to relax in Phuket in the first month of autumn?  Or is the term “off-season” always tragic or at least sad?  About rest in Phuket in September our article will tell you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket weather in September reviews of tourists" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1570755.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Thailand's annual climate cycle </h2><p>  The Kingdom of Smiles lies entirely in the subequatorial belt.  This arrangement also determines the climate.  In winter, the northern monsoon blows.  It brings dry and hot air masses from the tropical desert zone.  Clear, sunny weather with a gentle, quiet sea lasts until May.  But then the winds change.  The southwest monsoon comes.  It carries with it from the equatorial zone rains, showers, heavy winds, storms.  Typhoons are frequent in the summer months.  And what is the weather like in <span>Phuket in September?</span>  Southwest cyclone continues to be active.  Not only does it wash away all the dirt, but it also saturates the earth with the necessary amount of moisture.  Indeed, during the "dry season" only occasional small rains fall on the ground.  The sea from heavy winds becomes turbulent.  By November, the wind changes direction again.  The northern monsoon opens the tourist season in Thailand.  It lasts until April, and its peak falls on the winter months and March. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket weather september reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1570760.jpg" width="600"></div>

But this concept carries both negative and positive sides.  Let's start with the cons.  If you flew on vacation for just a week, you can become a hostage to the vagaries of the weather in Phuket in September.  Reviews of tourists complain not so much about the rain (it most often takes place in the evening and early morning), but about heavy <span>lead clouds.</span>  And while all can be burned.  After all, the equatorial sun easily gets through even overcast.  Clouds covering the sky and heavy rainfall lead to high relative humidity.  But the prices, as the reviews claim, are becoming just ridiculous.  And this applies to the entire tourism industry: hotels, tours, food in the cafe.  The stormy sea frightens swimmers unsure of their abilities, but attracts fans to "ride the wave."  It is not for nothing that in September Phuket hosts annual surfer competitions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="September Phuket Reviews Features" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1570771.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  "Off season" in Thailand - what is it? </h2><p>  Let us now describe in dry language the numbers what the weather is like in Phuket in September.  Reviews of tourists can be largely subjective.  But they all agree that the temperature in Phuket remains hot.  During the day, it reaches thirty degrees in the shade, and at night the thermometer rarely drops below twenty-four.  <span>The Andaman Sea</span> does not get cold either.  Despite frequent storms, the water temperature remains at around twenty-nine degrees.  It makes no sense to go to Phuket in September for a few days.  It is very likely that you will find not only night rains, but also day showers.  After all, meteorologists count twenty-one days with precipitation per month.  Rains, overcast and high temperatures lead to the fact that the relative humidity reaches eighty-five percent.  There is also a risk of flooding (the latter happened in the eleventh year). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What is the weather in Phuket in September" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1570772.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who should not go to Phuket in September-October? </h2><p>  First of all, those who organically cannot stand stuffiness.  Hypertensive patients and cores may feel unwell in the “steam room” into which Thailand turns into the rainy season.  But in fairness, it should be noted that the temperature in the early autumn is more comfortable for Europeans than in the winter months (about thirty degrees in the afternoon).  Also, do not visit Phuket in September for those tourists who are configured for a seal holiday.  To spend the whole vacation on the beach is unlikely to succeed.  But reviews of tourists often mention that the weather can be unbelievably lucky, and the sun will shine in a cloudless sky for a week, or even ten days.  Tropical showers often take place at night, but can fall without warning even during the day. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  If you are not a surfer, it is better not to climb into the stormy sea.  The waves reach two, and sometimes even three meters.  The main danger is strong ebb currents, which directly drag inexperienced swimmers into the sea.  Therefore, despite the weather in Phuket in September, reviews of tourists recommend reserving a hotel with a pool.  Since the southwest monsoon is constantly blowing, the largest storms are observed on this coast of the island.  If you want a safe swimming in the Andaman Sea, choose beaches on the eastern tip of Phuket - Cape Panwa, Nai Yang Beach, Nai Harn.  Because well-known on the whole island Karon and Kata turn at this time in the abode of surfers.  The beaches on the west bank take on the impact of the elements.  Be sure to stock up on a good reliable raincoat ... and sunscreen.  Europeans are often cruelly mistaken, believing that dense tanning clouds do not get.  The equatorial sun burns even because of clouds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Phuket in September October" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1570768.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to do in Phuket in September? </h2><p>  So to summarize.  What are the reasons for spending the beginning of autumn in Thailand?  Firstly, and for many, this argument will be decisive, in the "off season" prices fall to indecent.  To lure tourists, hoteliers, restaurateurs, travel agencies and even shops offer unprecedented discounts.  There are no crowds on beaches and attractions.  And if you are not afraid of the changeable weather in Phuket in September, reviews urge you to actively use this circumstance to travel around the island.  At the end of the first month of the calendar autumn in Thailand, the Vegetarian Festival is taking place on a grand scale.  Despite the name, it is a terrible and tickling nerves sight. </p>
