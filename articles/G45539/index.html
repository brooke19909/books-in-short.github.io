Vacation with a child in October: reviews, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many travelers, unable to relax in the summer, think that they will no longer have a normal vacation this year.  Very often the question of where to fly to rest in October, they consider unresolved.  How wrong they are!  This month is transitional in almost all world resorts.  Only at the end of it the Mediterranean vacation spots begin to give up their positions, but exotic destinations open.  And sightseeing tours in many cities become as comfortable as possible - there is no scorching sun above your head. </p><h2>  Sea vacation </h2><p>  Since most of those who go on vacation all year long dreamed of the gentle sun, white sand and warm sea water, we will first of all consider the question of how and <span>where to relax in October</span> at sea.  Well-known countries continue to hold leadership here.  These are Egypt, Greece, Spain, Cyprus and Malta. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to fly to relax in October" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515812.jpg" width="600"></div>  Until November, vacationers will find a magnificent velvet season on local beaches.  And only literally in the last days of the month in the Mediterranean region the autumn weather begins to gain strength.  For those who are interested in the warmest sea, the road to Egypt or the UAE is open.  The last option is the warmest sea, where the water temperature reaches +33 <sup>o</sup> C. A less budgetary option is the Dominican Republic, India, Mexico or Thailand, where the water warms up to 26-30 degrees.  If you want to save more, sacrificing some comfort, pay attention to Turkey and the Greek islands.  But here the guarantee of good weather is only until the middle of the month.  Very comfortable, but expensive holidays are offered by the Maldives - water + 28 ¬∞, air + 32 ¬∞, rest in Tunisia is much cheaper.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Vacation in visa-free countries </h2><p>  When deciding where to fly to rest in October, you need to remember the need to obtain permission to enter many states.  In this case, pay attention to those countries where you can go without applying for a visa.  These include Cuba, the Dominican Republic, <span>Bahamas,</span> Thailand, Maldives, Turkey, Tunisia, Montenegro.  In some countries, such as Egypt and Sri Lanka, a visa is issued at the airport.  And in Mexico or Cyprus, for example, permission to enter can be obtained by e-mail.  Fill out the form and send it to the migration services that verify the data.  If everything is fine, they will send you an entry visa, which you need to print and present to the border guard at the airport. </p><h2>  Vacation with a child in October: is it real or not? </h2><p>  At this time, there are already few who want to go on vacation with children.  Still, it takes a lot of time for acclimatization, and a change in climatic conditions may not affect the child‚Äôs health in the best way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation with baby in october" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515818.jpg" width="512"></div>  Therefore, with children it is recommended to go only to countries with a high level of service and a mild climate.  For example, to Spain, Greece, Cyprus, <span>Tunisia or Turkey.</span>  Choose hotels with the highest level of service.  If the children are older, then you can visit many interesting places in European cities or even away.  But with them it makes no sense to go to Malta, where they will be bored.  In principle, it is better to contact travel agencies that offer several special programs to choose from.  Especially if such a vacation falls on school holidays.  So, if you plan a vacation with your child in October, you can recommend the following options: in France - the Asterix park and the Poissy toy museum, Disneyland Paris, in Denmark - the Legoland and the Children's Science Center, in Sweden - the Liseberg amusement park and World Astrid Lingren.  There is a general recommendation: before buying tickets or booking a tour, you need to read the reviews of those who have already rested in the place you are interested in.  This will never be superfluous, especially in the case when you go to rest with children.

But in the fall, everything returns to its place again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax in October at sea" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515816.jpg" width="508"></div>  Those who want to relax abroad in October are more inclined to travel to various cities, to see local attractions and architectural monuments.  Moreover, the rains are still not particularly annoying travelers.  So, if you decide to conquer Prague, Rome or Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãyou will definitely not be mistaken.  In addition, a pleasant surprise will be the cost of air tickets to selected destinations and hotels.  If we consider the reviews, then the people who left them pay special attention to the fact that the rest in this case will be quite budgetary, especially for the Czech capital.  Therefore, if you are in Prague in the last days of October, take the time to visit Munich, where the Oktoberfest, a beer festival that lasts two weeks, closes on the first Sunday of November.  Prices for hotel accommodation at this time: Istanbul - from 1600 rubles per day, Prague - from 1100, Barcelona - from 3100, Vienna - from 2200, Rome - from 1800.

    <h2>  What can I see in Prague? </h2><p>  Let us dwell a little on the capital of the Czech Republic.  We‚Äôll tell you what it is advisable to pay attention to when you arrive in this wonderful city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="October where to relax at sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/517323.jpg" width="600"></div>  By the way, many people prefer to travel in the fall, and when the question arises of where to fly to rest in October, there is only one answer: to Prague, and there you can already go on tours to other states.  In the capital itself, sightseeing will have to be carried out mainly ‚Äúon foot‚Äù.  They are mostly located close to each other, so it makes no sense to use transport.  What must be seen and visited?  <span>Old Town Square,</span> Kampa Museum, <span>Wenceslas Square,</span> Kafka Museum, Strogovsky Monastery and Zlata Street.  If you have never visited the Charles Bridge, then be sure to visit.  Despite the coolness, you will enjoy a short walk along the Vltava River.

    <h2>  Wellness rest </h2><p>  At this time of the year, you can improve your health well by going to those countries whose specialization is the provision of such services. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="relax abroad in october" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515821.jpg" width="600"></div>  No other country here can be compared with Tunisia, it is the leader of the October health tourism.  He can offer both thalassotherapy and various spa services.  The whole month is guaranteed heat.  In the event that you need a more budget option and decide where to fly to rest in October for recovery, go to the hospitals and sanatoriums in Bulgaria.  But remember that the weather conditions in this country are not very different from ours at the height of autumn.  There is a demand for hospitals in Crimea, prices on the peninsula are less than abroad.

    <h2>  Exotic </h2><p>  There are travelers who prefer an exotic vacation to any other.  And when October comes, where to relax abroad is not a question for them.  Definitely - in the Maldives or Sri Lanka.  In these paradise places, the weather has almost completely stabilized, and so far the prices are kept at a low level.  It is time to buy airline tickets and fly.  The only drawback is that tickets are very expensive, but this is just the case when you need to pay if you want to get what you want.  Thailand is no less interesting, but a little later - by the end of the month.  All conditions fully meet your expectations. </p><h2>  Holidays in October in Russia </h2><p>  Since the beginning of October, it is still not too cold in most of Russia, and many Russians prefer to relax on the territory of their country.  At the same time, you need to carefully plan your vacation, since October has nevertheless come.  "Where to relax at sea in Russia?"  - The question is simple, but you can get on the so-called off-season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="October where to relax abroad" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12281/515814.jpg" width="600"></div>  The beach season is possible only in the first part of the month.  The sea has a water temperature of about 17-18 degrees, you can still swim, although not all.  But in any case, it is not worth abusing sea baths.  Prefer walking along the coast under the gentle sun or sunbathing.

    <p>  Where can I go in October?  Judging by the reviews of tourists, it is better to choose Gelendzhik, Tuapse, Anapa or Sochi.  Remember that at these, and at other, resorts, good spa treatment is offered - there is an option to relax with health benefits.  You can also go on a picnic in the forest or on the banks of the river. </p>
