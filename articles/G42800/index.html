    <p>  "Granel" always fully provides the necessary infrastructure for the erected residential neighborhoods, whether it is multi-storey large residential complexes or low-rise, for a comfortable stay - when the property is commissioned, there is already literally everything. </p><h2>  Projects of GK "Granel" </h2><p>  Like all its other projects, the ‚ÄúGranel‚Äù Theater Park controlled at all stages of development: from the development of the concept, then the project, then - construction.  The group of companies can also undertake the implementation and even management of the constructed facilities.  Over the years, huge positive experience has been accumulated, an active working team of professionals has formed, which is why the Theater Park (Granel) residential complex will also be a high-quality product at a very affordable price.  The company builds all the projects from the most modern high-quality materials, which is why they meet all the requirements of the construction of today, and in addition, they always differ in interesting architectural solutions.  And the LCD ‚ÄúTheater Park" "Granel" designed so that this object is likely to be called unique in terms of architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Already today, in the central office on Tverskaya Street in Moscow, the sales department answers questions of potential customers regarding this new building.  In the "Theater Park" (Korolev) "Granel" sells apartments.  The company has already passed the stage of formation, but continues to develop as an investment and industrial organization.  Its activities are carried out in various sectors of the economy, but urban development is determining, including everything else: investment, construction, management, development.  Financial partners - many leading and most successful banks, Sberbank, Raiffeisen Bank among them.  Despite the fact that the company has existed in the market of <span>new buildings in Moscow</span> and the region not very long ago, since 1993 it has accumulated experience in other regions where exclusively benign projects for the construction of shopping complexes have been implemented.  Now, performing such objects as Lesnoy Gorodok and eleven others, including the Theater Park (Korolev), Granel competes on equal terms with the best developers of both capitals. </p>

    <h2>  About company </h2><p>  There are actually two key companies in the group of companies: UK Astrum and Granel Development.

    <h2>  People </h2><p>  Group of companies "Granel" - an organization of very large, with an established team.  There is almost no staff turnover, judging by the announced vacancies.  Such a large enterprise requires very few new employees: only two specialists in accounting, management accounting and finance, three people in the administrative staff;  into a professional in leasing, investment and banks - only one, also one in sales.  In construction and real estate, nine employees and one lawyer are required.  All!  Probably, this certificate most of all can tell about the holding team.  Even the reviews about the developer of the ‚ÄúTheater Park‚Äù - ‚ÄúGranel‚Äù will not tell more. </p><p>  The head of the Group of Companies is Iligat Anvarovich Nigmatullin, chairman of the board of directors, who was born in rural Bashkiria but received two excellent higher educations.  The first was a degree in economics from the Novosibirsk Institute of National Economy, then the Bashkir Academy of Public Administration and Management with a degree in Management.  In addition to working at Granel, Ilshat Nigmatullin has been the head of the Bashkir Trade and Industrial Union since 2006.  He is still quite young - born in 1971.  Yuri Viktorovich Chistyakov, the head of the holding‚Äôs developers, is a little older. He is the general director of Granel Development.  He is from Mordovia, was born in Saransk, a retired military man.  After graduating from service in 1989, he began working in construction.  In 2005, he already became the general director of a company specializing in obtaining permits for construction and design in the Moscow region and the city of Moscow, and in 2010 he ended up at the place that he still occupies in Granel Development LLC. </p>

    <h2>  RC "Theater Park" ("Granel", Korolev) </h2><p>  Organization address (head office): Moscow, Tverskaya street, house 22, fraction 2, building 1. Here everyone who is going to become a client of this company or its employee is waiting here.  The corporate feature of the Granel Group holding is that a conference of all senior employees is held annually, and since the structure of this organization is extremely open, reports can be seen in the public domain on the Internet.  Moreover, even many documents of internal circulation can be found there, from where it will become clear that the organization has its own corporate code.  All project declarations and many other documentation are executed at Granel Development, that is, no extraneous specially created legal entities are observed in this chain, which fundamentally distinguishes this company from many others competing in particular. </p><p>  And the buyers of apartments of the <span>LCD ‚ÄúTheater Park‚Äù</span> ‚ÄúGranel‚Äù provides all the information that interests them, long before their house is put into operation.  Many were attracted by just this, which was already shown at the stage of the project: a cozy low-rise complex for the complete enjoyment of suburban life, in which all the advantages of Moscow's infrastructure are accessible and can easily be used.  Capital comfort in the isolated space of a small residential complex can be provided at any level.  And bribed by the fact that the city of Korolev is clean, cultural, picturesque, one of the best places in the Moscow region.  All this makes the purchase of an apartment even more attractive.  But initially, of course, everyone likes the price of housing that Granel offers in the Theater Park LCD. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The <span>residential complex was</span> built according to an individual project, and most of all it is distinguished by a single architectural style, a manor atmosphere, which allows you to plunge into it in full.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Teatralny Park (Korolev, Granel) residential complex is 26 hectares, where three-story buildings, forty-two residential buildings and more than two hundred thousand square meters of comfortable living area, are whimsically stretched.  The color scheme is calm, as was always customary in the nineteenth-century manor estates near Moscow.  But the buildings themselves inside do not at all resemble this archaic: in the Granel Theater Complex, the layout provided such that the entire architectural aesthetics of this complex would not give a greater sense of calm and comfort.  Panoramic views from the windows will enhance this action, since what could be better than the landscapes near Moscow?  Inspiration is provided every day. </p><p>  Probably, musicians, writers and scientists would willingly settle here.  Especially in the attics, where the ceiling height is about five meters and a lot of sun.  Any detail here is carefully thought out.  The ugly facades of the buildings are air-conditioned - and they are hidden in neat balconies, and therefore they do not violate the noble simplicity of the architecture of the buildings.  Very beautiful builds "Granel" "Theater Park"!  Photos from any angle can easily confirm this.  And there are many special apartments, including the attics mentioned above, where the most daring of design decisions are applicable.  Apartments - three, two, and one-room, from thirty to eighty square meters.  Prices are quite affordable - up to three million rubles.  I can‚Äôt even believe that the Moscow Ring Road is only seven kilometers from the place where the "Theater Park" is located.  Granel chose a very favorable location for this residential complex: this is in Korolev, the Bolshevo microdistrict. </p>

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  There is good transport accessibility, which will allow you to combine a quiet life in the area with clean ecology and work in Moscow.  Both personal and public transport will deliver there and there without problems: comfortable buses go to VDNH, and the Sputnik electric train goes to Yaroslavsky railway station.  Half an hour - and here it is, the center of the capital.  Another question is that the Yaroslavl highway is being rebuilt and expanding, but very soon the problem of traffic jams in this direction will be solved. </p><p>  The social infrastructure, as already mentioned, is ramified.  In the courtyards there are correctly and modernly designed playgrounds, and in addition to the construction of a fitness center, there will be enough sports grounds and places for recreation on the territory.  In walking distance - any shops, post offices, pharmacies, beauty salons, bank branches and many other infrastructure facilities to fully ensure the comfort of those living in the residential complex.  Well thought out security, video surveillance, concierge at each entrance, for which a special room is provided.  There will be parking for almost nine hundred cars. </p><h2>  Environment </h2><p>  Korolev is not just a city, he is ranked among Russian science cities, because it is here that there is a huge concentration of city-forming scientific and industrial enterprises that provide local residents with work.  There are also branches of the most famous universities - from <span>Bauman Moscow State Technical University</span> to Moscow <span>State University</span> and the Tsiolkovsky International Space University.  There are dozens of them!  Students can not travel far and live at home.  The quality of life here is not inferior to the capital.  But a huge plus - green areas from all sides, the picturesque Klyazma flows nearby.  The best place for walking at any time of the year, and in summer, for sure, residents of this residential complex will have beaches on the river bank.  Vlasov forest is mushrooms and berries.  Both those and others are the most diverse.  Everything is here, as in Greece, everything was provided by the Granel company! </p><p>  The date of delivery of the "Theater Park" (second stage) is already close.  The first was commissioned in the third quarter of 2017 (a little later than planned), and the second phase is scheduled for the end of 2017, but, apparently, the builders may not be able to meet the deadlines.  However, everything is being built and finished.  Many residential complexes are being implemented in stages, it is both reasonable and profitable.  First, the fourth and fifth buildings were built here, and in the second stage three more houses will be commissioned (the latter on an individual project).  The outer walls are made of concrete cellular blocks, the outside - Rockwool insulation and ceramic brick finish. </p><h2>  Planning and improvement </h2><p>  In individual projects, no interior partitions are provided and, accordingly, there will be no final finishing either.  Houses for rent with two-chamber plastic double-glazed windows, with glazed loggias and balconies (aluminum profile).  For surveying rooms, a number of blocks are provided, only bathrooms with walls to the entire height.  Wiring of vertical heating pipes is carried out, radiators are mounted.  Despite the fact that the houses are low-rise (three-story), elevators will be in every entrance.  Ground floor - concierge room and pantries. </p>

    <p>  On five hectares, the territory is already being improved: there will be lawns, flower beds, mini-squares for relaxation, decorative lanterns and small architectural forms.  In the yards - everything for physical education and everything that children need.  The plans include a large center for serving the population, a large shopping center, as well as medical and cultural centers, a school and a kindergarten.  While this is all under construction, the first residents to live are not experiencing too much inconvenience, since there are also a children's development center, large retail outlets (Zodiac, Vivat, Lunokhod) and a polyclinic very close to the residential complex.  Directly in Korolyov there are two concert halls, the Bravo music hall, several historical museums and much more. </p><h2>  How to buy an apartment </h2><p>  You can buy an apartment on a mortgage: on the Granel website there is a long list of partner banks that help those who wish to buy a home.  You can take advantage of the installment offer, which is the best option to pay in installments - without worries about commissions, interest and additional fees.  Here, the conditions are dictated by the developer, necessarily agreeing with the buyer both the amount of the initial payment, and the size of the further ones.  There is an installment plan from the developer, and since the contract is concluded directly, without intermediaries, the conditions and price are beneficial.  If installments are assumed for up to six months, there will be no interest. </p><p>  You can invest in new housing maternity capital as a down payment on a mortgage.  There are a lot of opportunities to use credit funds.  Granel Group of Companies gives all families participating in the state program a mortgage at preferential rates (10.9% per annum).  It will take only one visit to the office of the company "Granel" to solve all the problems of buying an apartment.  The client will be helped to choose it, then determine the best option for the mortgage program and draw up a payment schedule, complete a package of documents and send an application to the selected bank. </p>
