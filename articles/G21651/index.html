  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a tablet computer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you have already sufficiently accurately determined for yourself that you need a tablet, you may have a question: how to choose a tablet computer?  Most models can be conditionally divided into categories, depending on their size - with a diagonal of less than 7 inches, and more than 7 inches.  Small tablets are simply indispensable in everyday life.  Such a device can be taken without any problems on the road, if necessary, to work, to the country.  They allow you to listen to music, use mail, read books, chat, take photos, surf the Internet, play.  Larger models are much more expensive, but also look much more solid.  <span>The screen resolution of</span> small tablets is usually within 800 * 480 pixels, and large - 1024 * 640. </p><p>  How to choose a <span>tablet computer</span> depending on battery life </p><p>  An important criterion is the runtime of the device without recharging.  Here, almost everything depends on the battery capacity, as well as on the power consumption of the tablet.  It is important to reduce its power consumption, which will extend the work.  The runtime, which is usually indicated by the manufacturer, cannot be considered a reference, since it is usually measured under conditions that are far from those available during operation. </p><p>  How <span>to choose a tablet</span> based on weight </p><p>  This characteristic most often depends on the battery life.  There is a recommended weight, which in the case of a diagonal of seven inches is three hundred grams, and in the case of a ten-inch model - seven hundred grams.  It may seem that this is almost insignificant weight, however, by the end of the day, if you hold it in your hands all day, they will simply ‚Äúfall off‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>How to choose a tablet</span> : important software features </p><p>  It is important to pay attention to what software the tablet functions under.  In stores you can find devices with three types of software: Android, Apple and Windows.  The delivery of tablets is carried out with a pre-installed basic set of programs, and to build functionality it will be necessary to install a lot of additional applications.  To install additional applications on the iPad, you must visit the Apple Store.  If you have chosen a model with Android OS, then applications can be purchased on the Android Market, and there is an incredibly huge selection of programs for free.  If you download the installation file from a regular computer in a special format, you can also install it on a tablet.  If the device is running Windows, then everything is similar to working with a regular computer. </p><p>  How to choose a tablet: features you need to focus on </p><p>  You should look at the processor clock speed, it should be 800-1000 MHz.  For normal operation, RAM should be enough for efficient operation.  The size of the data storage device must be such that you fit everything you need. </p><p>  An important parameter is the external interfaces.  Typically, tablets are equipped with USB connectors, which are designed to connect a USB flash drive, keyboard and mouse.  The HDMI port is designed to connect the TV to the device, and using the microSD slot you can attach additional memory.  Almost all models are equipped with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless modules.  If you are looking for a model with complete autonomy and independence, then you can consider devices with a 3G module.  When <span>choosing a tablet,</span> do not forget about a special case for it. </p><p>  If you are interested in answering the question of which tablet computer to choose, then here you can recommend iRU Pad Master 10.1 3G or ViewSonic Viewpad 7. These two models have the necessary functionality at a fairly affordable price.  Be careful when choosing, and then the device will last you a very long time.  Have a nice shopping! </p>
