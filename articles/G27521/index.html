His mother was the <span>Byzantine princess</span> Anna, from her he also got the grandfather nickname - Monomakh.  Vladimir spent his childhood in Pereyaslavl, a border town that has long served as a cordon between Russians and nomads. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/599509.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  The historical portraits of the <span>princes of Kievan Rus</span> once again prove that in those days they grew up early.  From a young age, Prince Vladimir was put into teaching, was capable of science and had an extraordinary writing talent.  Already at the age of thirteen, the prince moved to Rostov, where he looked after his father's estate, at seventeen he was also trusted by the larger Smolensk principality.  In 1072, at the direction of his father, he took possession of the Vladimir-Volyn lands, and from 1078 he began reigning in Chernigov. </p><h2>  Talents strategist and politics </h2><p>  <span>Historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh</span> 1053 - 1125  would not be complete without a description of his military successes.  The reign of Vladimir was not peaceful and calm.  Many times he had to fight with both external and internal enemies.  The Chernihiv period reveals in Vladimir the features of a talented commander and strategist.  The first famous military campaign was undertaken in 1076, when the prince accepted the offer of the Polish king and participated in battles against the Germans and Czechs.  Vladimir Monomakh‚Äôs military talent was manifested not in a gross onslaught, but in dexterity, the desire to defeat the enemy with small victims, and sometimes even do without a fight.  The battle near Chernigov in 1095 was indicative, after which the combined efforts of the Russian squads forced the nomads to move far into the steppe.  For the first time the Russian army fought on the territory of the enemy.  Several Polovtsian camps were defeated, and rich booty was captured. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="historical portraits of the princes of Kievan Rus" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/600751.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1097, by the decision of the <span>Lubech Congress</span> , a ‚Äúladder‚Äù inheritance right was established, which enshrined the order of Yaroslav the Wise on the division of land between sons.  According to this right, Svyatoslav ascended the throne of Kiev.  Vladimir Monomakh had significant support among the boyars, but refused to reign Kiev and remove Svyatoslav voluntarily, not wanting to start a war.  This fact adds new touches to the historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh - not capture and coercion, but submission to the law.  Vladimir was deeply indignant at the blinding of the Prince of Rostov Vasyl Terebovlsky, called other rulers to correct the evil and punish the guilty.  He was not heard, and the perpetrator of the crime - Davyd Igorevich - was simply sent to reign in Buzhsk.  Vladimir initiated the convocations of the princes, urged his many relatives to stop civil strife and live in harmony.  Significant was the contribution of Vladimir in the unification of Russia, in increasing its defense capability and international prestige. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh 1053-1125" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/599482.jpg" width="250"></div></h2><h2>  Legislator Talents </h2><p>  The historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh shows his descendants as a legislator and a wise ruler.  In 1013, Prince of Kiev <span>Svyatopolk Izyaslavovich</span> died <span>.</span>  Pogroms of Jews began, robberies became more frequent.  The turmoil led to the fact that the inhabitants of Kiev twice suggested that Vladimir Monomakh accept the reign.  Despite the violation of the "ladder law", Vladimir agreed to rule Kiev. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The reign in Kiev was marked by a number of legislative acts.  For example, for the first time, all Jews with their good were to leave Kievan Rus in a short time.  The rights of usurers were limited, and the sale of free people for debts was prohibited.  These and other legislative amendments, later called the "Charter of Vladimir Monomakh", were introduced in the "Russian Truth" - the first set of Russian laws. </p><h2>  Writer Talents </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="historical portraits of the princes of Kievan Rus" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/600759.jpg" width="317"></div></h2><p>  The historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh as a writer and a well-educated person who made a huge contribution to the development of education in Russia is indicative.  With the direct support of the prince, hegumen Sylvester created his original annals, which included several oral traditions.  Books of church and secular content were translated into Russian.  At sunset, Vladimir Monomakh wrote his ‚ÄúInstruction‚Äù, in which he urged all people, regardless of their estates, to live in harmony and resolve disputes peacefully and fairly. </p><h2>  Board Results </h2><p>  The historical portrait of Vladimir Monomakh shows all the results of the reign of the prince.  This leader left his descendants a strong and prosperous power capable of defending himself on his own and having great political influence.  And it is unfortunate that such a great gift was not appreciated by his successors. </p>
