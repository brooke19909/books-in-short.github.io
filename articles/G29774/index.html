  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How a man appeared</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Throughout history, people have asked themselves how a person appeared.  There is still no answer to it.  There are only theories, each of which has its own advantages, but at the same time, significant shortcomings. </p><p>  The most ancient of them is theological.  This theory is based on the assumption of the divine creation of people.  The main sources for this are the Bible, the Qur'an, etc.  According to <span>theological theory,</span> man was created in the image and likeness of God.  In Christianity, the <span>first people</span> were Adam and Eve, from whom the rest came.  The main argument of the representatives of theological theory is the presence of the soul and mind, which distinguish people from the animal world.  And only God can endow them. </p><p>  There is no material evidence of the existence of the soul; everything is based on faith.  Reasonable <span>human activity is</span> expressed in adapting the environment for oneself (for one‚Äôs existence).  But this is not the only person.  Many animals and birds build holes and nests for themselves.  And termite mounds and anthills are real architectural masterpieces. </p><p>  Another theory (panspermia) explains how people appeared, explains it as an alien influence: settlement was accidentally or intentionally carried out by more developed civilizations.  G. Thomson and G. Helmholtz believed that life could also have arisen as a result of mutations that occurred due to extraterrestrial viruses or virions that got to Earth together with meteorites.  In the course of laboratory studies, it was found that living organisms are resistant to adverse effects.  So, with prolonged exposure to spores of seeds and plants in liquid oxygen and nitrogen, their viability was not violated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Representatives of the theory, who, answering the question of how a person appeared, explain that life arose in connection with the activities of an alien mind, cite the fact that many archaeological finds (written sources and drawings) indicate the presence of alien creatures on Earth and share certain knowledge.  However, these findings also indicate that a person already existed and subsequently used the information received for his own purposes.  The theory also does not take into account the fact that many laws of genetics are common for the entire organic world. </p><p>  The most reliable theory that answers the question of how a person appeared is evolutionary.  Its vivid representative is Charles Darwin, who suggested that people occurred as a result of the evolution of the animal world and their ancestors are anthropoids.  In support of his views, he cited scientific evidence in the field of comparative anatomy.  Representatives of animals and humans also existed in primitive times.  In particular, they were common among North American Indians, among <span>African tribes,</span> as well as among residents of the <span>far north.</span>  However, this theory has its drawbacks.  So, some scientists believe that people could not happen in the process of evolution, since the probability of the appearance of the human genome at random is negligible. </p><p>  The answer to the question of how a man appeared was also given by <span>Friedrich Engels,</span> who believed that people descended from a monkey and only thanks to work.  At the same time, it should be noted that not only people work, but also many animals, but they do not become rational. </p><p>  Man and history are closely interconnected.  They develop over a long time.  From generation to generation new inventions appear, people become more educated and progressive.  For this reason, despite the fact that evolutionary theory is criticized, it deserves attention to a greater extent than others that do not have evidence-based evidence. </p>
