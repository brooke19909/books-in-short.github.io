Specifications, setup and owner reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As part of this review, a 4G <span>YOTA router</span> will be reviewed.  This versatile network device allows you to create a Wi-Fi zone where you need it.  Also, the technical characteristics of this mobile solution are quite relevant.  But at the same time, the software environment is made so that such a network node can only work with the SIM card of the same mobile provider.  It is about this affordable device that is discussed in this review. </p><div class="photo" data-original="yota-store.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yota 4g router" class="if uuid-2290974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2290974.jpg"></div><h2>  Specialization.  Equipment </h2><p>  The YOTA mobile router considered within this material is a universal solution.  It is able to function not only in 4G mode, but also 3G / UMTS or 2G / GSM.  In the first case, the highest speed of this network portable solution is 150 Mbps.  If the solution goes into 3G mode, then this value will drop to 42 Mbps.  In the case of the presence of a 2G signal, the transmission speed will be limited to 500 kbit / s.  The technical characteristics of this solution indicate that the considered mobile router model is an ideal means of implementing mobile access networks to the global web. </p><p>  The list of equipment for this solution includes a router with a pre-installed SIM card, a disk with documentation and a complete list of necessary software, an interface wire, a brief user guide and a branded warranty card.  The validity of the latter is limited to 12 months from the date of sale of the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="yota-store.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yota 4g lte router" class="if uuid-2290975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2290975.jpg"></div><h2>  Key technical specifications </h2><p>  As noted earlier, nominally the main operating mode is declared for the YOTA - 4G router.  The main operating frequencies can be 1800, 2300 or 2600 MHz.  The maximum transfer rate is limited to 150 Mbps.  In reality, this value will be significantly lower for the reason that several devices will be connected to one mobile communication tower without fail and these 150 Mb / s will be divided between them. </p><p>  Also, the device can go into modes in 3G and even 2G.  In the first case, as noted earlier, the peak speed will be 42 Mbit / s, and in the second - 500 kbit / s. </p><p>  The YOTA router under consideration is equipped with a type A microUSB port. With its help, the integrated battery is charged.  Also, when connected to a personal computer using this universal interface, this device can be turned into a regular 4G modem. </p><p>  The battery life on one charge of the built-in battery is limited to 6 hours. </p><p>  The list of supported WiFi technologies for this portable device includes 802.11 n (up to 150 Mbps), 802.11 b (11 Mbps) and 802.11 g (up to 54 Mbps).  In operation, this wireless technology uses a frequency of 2.4 GHz.  But the most advanced by today's standards, the standard 802.11 ac this portable node does not support.  But at the same time, the backward compatibility of the latter with the standard 802.11 n allows you to organize the transfer of information of this router model. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Setting procedure </h2><p>  There are two possible ways to configure the YOTA 4G LTE mobile handheld router discussed in this review.  In one of them, the basic settings of the solution are used and there is no need to use the driver disk with the process of setting it.  In this case, when the battery is charged and the balance of the mobile account is positive, just turn it on and then press the WPS button.  Then you need to run the technology of the same name on the connected device.  After establishing a connection, you can launch a browser and watch Internet resources on the global web. </p><p>  The second option for using the solution in question is relevant only for personal computers.  In this case, using a bundled cord, the router connects to the PC.  Then the drivers are installed on the latter and the connection to the global web is configured.  And only after that it can be used for its intended purpose. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.raikinplaza.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wifi yota router" class="if uuid-2290976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2290976.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost.  Owner reviews </h2><p>  Today, such a portable Wi-Fi router YOTA can be purchased at a price of 2900 rubles in any official store of this mobile provider.  That is, this router model costs significantly less than any analogues.  But at the same time, such a device can only work with a YOTA cellular network.  It is currently impossible to unblock such a router and force it to work with the equipment of other operators. </p><p>  The list of benefits of this device includes the following: </p><ol><li>  Reliability. </li><li>  Availability. </li><li>  Simple setup procedure. </li><li>  Ability to work in any cellular networks. </li></ol><p>  The only drawback is the link to YOTA equipment.  It is currently impossible to eliminate it somehow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="geekynepal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="yota router" class="if uuid-2290977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/2290977.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion  Summary </h2><p>  The YOTA router considered in this review is a purely specialized mobile device that can only be used as part of the network of the same name operator.  In all other cases, it will not work.  On the one hand, this simplifies the setup and use process.  On the other hand, it limits the list of possible applications. </p>
