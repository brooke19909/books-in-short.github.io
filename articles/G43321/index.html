    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  It all depends on how you communicate.  The thing is that the ‚ÄúBlue‚Äù (‚ÄúTele2‚Äù) tariff, the description of which interests us, is the ability to make calls within the home network at competitive rates.  So, for travel this option is not entirely suitable. </p><p>  Nevertheless, most customers tend to look for a tariff plan that allows them to communicate favorably with the whole country or region where they live.  And "Tele2" tariff "Blue" reviews in this regard gets very good.  Perhaps this proposal is worthy of attention. </p><h2>  Calls by region </h2><p>  Now a little about the prices.  They play an important role.  After all, the more advantageous the offer, the more customers can be attracted to the operator.  As already mentioned, for calls within the home network, the "Blue" ("Tele2") tariff will be very beneficial.  The cost of city calls to the numbers of this operator is 0 rubles per minute.  In other words, they are free.  Of course, all this only pleases subscribers.  After all, now you can talk to your family and friends as much as you like if they are connected to Tele2.  The main feature of the tariff is the absence of a <span>monthly fee.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff blue tele2 description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128797.jpg"></div>

But as users note, not very much.  A minute of conversation in this situation will cost us 1 ruble 10 kopecks.  Perhaps it is very difficult to find more favorable conditions.  So, for the home network, the "Blue" tariff is very good. </p><h2>  In Russia </h2><p>  Now a little about calls all over the country.  Here, subscribers are also not very disappointed.  And therefore, in general, "Tele2" tariff "Blue" customer reviews receives a positive nature.  Yes, you‚Äôll have to pay for talking around the country, but not too much. </p><p>  If you decide to talk with Tele2 subscribers, a minute of conversation will cost 1 ruble 50 kopecks.  Otherwise, get ready to pay 8 rubles.  This condition applies to third-party telecom operators throughout Russia, as well as to <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãnumbers.</span>  It turns out that for communication with "Tele2" within the country, "Blue" is very suitable.  But in other cases - no.  But as practice shows, many operators put price tags on calls higher than Tele2 offers. </p><h2>  Roaming </h2><p>  Do not forget that travelers also need to somehow communicate.  And in our case, to be honest, sociable people will use the "Blue" ("Tele2") tariff.  Roaming in Russia and around the world with our operator is automatically connected.  And the terms of its provision are pleasant to subscribers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff blue tele2 cost" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128794.jpg"></div>

This applies to both incoming and outgoing calls.  SMS will cost 3.5 rubles if you write within the country.  And calls in roaming (but in Russia) cost: </p><ul><li>  CIS - 25 rubles; </li><li>  Europe - 45 rubles; </li><li>  other countries - 65 rubles. </li></ul><p>  If we are talking about international travel, you will have to find out information for each area separately.  This may be the official website of "Tele2".  But in general, all incoming calls in international roaming cost about 15 rubles.  And outgoing, if you call to Russia or the host country.  The same applies to the CIS countries and Europe.  This is all very pleasing to subscribers.  To Africa, Asia and Australia, calls often cost 35 rubles per minute, and to America - 65. These conditions are not only for the Blue tariff, but for any Tele2 plan.  After all, the proposed rates are standard roaming, which turns on and off automatically. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  At "Tele2" tariff "Blue" in terms of connection gets good.  Exactly the same as any other offer of the operator.  After all, even a novice user can implement all the actions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tariff blue tele2 roaming" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128795.jpg"></div>

    <p>  For example, you can buy a SIM card with this tariff plan.  With all this, keep in mind: the service is not free.  For a new number will have to pay from 150 rubles.  A very relevant offer for those who are not yet a Tele2 subscriber. </p><p>  Otherwise, there is always the possibility of using the most common USSD request.  On the mobile phone, dial * 116 * 52 #.  Are you done?  Click on the "Call" button and wait for a response from the system.  If you do not have a negative balance, then you will successfully change the tariff to "Blue".  Nothing complicated, right? </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt feel like dealing with the process yourself, you need to go to any Tele2 office with a phone.  And tell the employee that you want to change the tariff plan from yours to "Blue".  You will be offered to purchase a SIM card.  If you do not plan to change the phone number, refuse.  In this case, it is enough to transfer the smartphone to the employee so that he quickly resolves the task assigned to him.  Wait until you receive a notification about connecting a tariff plan called "Blue".  Only after that leave the Tele2 communication salon.  The service is completely free. </p><h2>  Shutdown </h2><p>  How to disable the "Blue" tariff?  Tele2 offers all its customers the only logical way out of the situation.  And he pleases many.  This is a change in tariff.  If you decide to connect a different offer, the existing plan will automatically disconnect when you reconnect.  Very comfortably.  Choose any suitable tariff and activate it.  "Blue" will turn off immediately. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to disable the blue tele2 tariff" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1128796.jpg"></div>
