    <h2>  Makadi </h2><p>  The former deserted desert has now flourished with an excellent tourist infrastructure.  And all thanks to the beautiful sea, huge beaches, colorful fish and unspoiled nature.  To develop this area began in the nineties of the last century, after Hurghada.  But since there were no settlements of their own, this district was administratively assigned to the central resort.  There are still not very many Russian-speaking tourists here, but Europeans like the resort.  It is good to relax with children here, quietly, calmly.  Very clean sea, along which you can walk for kilometers.  Connoisseurs of diving and snorkeling love Makadi.  There are coral reefs near almost every beach, and they are not very far from the coast.  If you make brief conclusions, we can say that the Makadi district is devoid of the fuss and noisy entertainment characteristic of central Hurghada.  But he has everything else, for which people come to Egypt.  Stella Makadi Garden Resort 5 is located in an area where only status hotels are being built.  It will provide you with a measured rest to the taste of tourists of any nationality and cultural characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stella makadi garden resort egypt hurghada" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1076485.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotels here are practically all new and of a class not lower than the Quartet.  Most of them have access to the water from a pier or pontoon, and only Azur hotels have sandy beaches.  The area in Makadi is windy, and all hotels have protective screens for vacationers.  "Fives" in this resort area correspond to their classification.  They are fully capable of providing you not only comfortable, but also an elite rest.  Five-star Makadi hotels, as a rule, are designed for European tourists, and therefore you should expect a very high level of service from them.  Each of them is a mini-town with its own infrastructure, has a unique architectural style and a special fabulous atmosphere.  As a rule, outwardly these hotels resemble the palaces of the Egyptian pharaohs.  And inside they are equipped quite conveniently and in accordance with all the requirements of spoiled travelers.  Not without reason, many of them, arriving in Makadi, claim that they did not expect such a high service from such a country as Egypt.  Stella Makadi Gardens Resort 5 has everything described above: a park and shops, animation and the beach, first-class food and relaxation.  And its employees can take you to the center of Hurghada with some pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Stella makadi gardens resort 5 reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1076486.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located, as it were, outside the territory of the Stella Makadi Beach Resort hotel, which is also assigned a classification of "5".  Stella Makadi Garden Resort is twenty-five kilometers from Hurghada Airport.  Get to him thirty to forty minutes, depending on the quality of the transfer.

Therefore, most of the guests who have to wait for check-in leave their suitcases under supervision and go to get acquainted with the territory.  This is a chic park, and an Internet cafe, and a gym, and a SPA center, and a tennis court, and a mini-golf lawn, and four pools with a small water park.  There are also shops with good prices.  The territory, according to tourists, is not only large and beautiful, but also entertaining.  It is not boring here, day or night.  Everything is thought out on the territory and very conveniently arranged for families with children.  The hotel has several buildings, but their buildings are arranged in such a way that they create cozy courtyards.  As a rule, pools are located there.  There are a lot of greenery and beautiful paths, everything is watered during the day, and in the evening they are very nicely highlighted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Stella Makadi Gardens Resort 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1076487.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Water recreation </h2><p>  Stella Makadi Garden Resort 5 provides guests with the opportunity to use the beach of the Beach Resort Hotel.  This is ten minutes at a slow pace through the park.  Or take the hotel bus - and there will be no problems.  It runs from the beach to the main building.  The coast is well-groomed, with white sand, about half a kilometer in length.  On the beach - pontoons, sunbeds, umbrellas, toilets and showers.  Very clean and well cleaned.  Tourists claim that the sea is simply incredible, especially in the morning.  Stingrays swim to the reef near the beach, you can see moray eels, turtles, octopuses.  It is inconvenient to enter water from sand.  Going down to the sea is necessary only from the pontoons.  But you can swim with a mask - a lot of fish.  There are two slopes on the main pier - one just for swimming, and the second at the end rests on a reef with corals and fish.  A diving center is open on the beach, and there are also many water activities: banana, parasailing, skiing.  Volleyball is played on the beach, and daytime animation seduces tourists here.  But the pools in the hotel are worth it to visit them at least once.  There are four reservoirs with water slides.  They completely imitate swimming in the sea - there are even artificial waves.  Near the pools of sand, not tile.  Therefore, it is also convenient to sunbathe around them.  In addition, the hotel offers two pools for babies. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  They can be arranged from the Stella Makadi Garden Resort 5. Tours to this hotel seem to imply participation in travel, but, as a rule, guests prefer to use the services of hotel guides rather than their operator.  It is much cheaper.  If this is your first time at this resort, then you should go on a sightseeing tour of Hurghada.  Tourists with children are recommended to visit water parks - for example, the Titanic or Sinbad with a huge number of slides and all kinds of attractions.  Many people like sailing and <span>swimming with dolphins.</span>  The ability to drive a quad bike through the endless desert with the breeze is often combined with a visit to the Bedouins and a local dinner.  And divers love the coral reefs of Giftun Island, where they not only watch colorful fish, but also explore the mysterious sea caves. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Egypt Hotel Stella Makadi Garden Resort 5" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1076489.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Prices, shopping </h2><p>  Services, excursions, food system, sea - everything is perfect at the Stella Makadi Gardens Resort 5. The price of a room starts from four thousand two hundred rubles a day, although it can reach sixteen.  Usually people go to Hurghada for shopping, but if you don‚Äôt want to spend time on this, then a good shopping complex is located near the Madinat Makadi hotel complex.  There is a bank, many souvenir shops, cafes.  However, prices in Makadi are much higher than in the same Hurghada or at the airport.  And some tourists write that the shops in the Stella Hotel itself are quite cheap, and there you can buy all the necessary souvenirs and beach accessories. </p><h2>  Stella Makadi Gardens Resort 5: reviews </h2><p>  Mostly tourists were satisfied with this hotel.  It is good for young people, and for families with children.  The hotel has excellent cuisine and tasty food, a convenient beach, many swimming pools, the cleanest sea, green, well-groomed and beautiful territory.  The rooms are spacious and cool.  Good animation, friendly, friendly and welcoming staff.  Everyone really likes the opportunity to walk in the parks of different hotels.  Some tourists described accommodation not by the sea as an additional bonus.  You can combine a trip to the beach with a walk, and most importantly, you manage to ‚Äúshake‚Äù a plentiful breakfast.  The hotel is well worth the price.  Many Europeans are resting here, mainly Germans, which once again speaks of a high level of service. </p>
