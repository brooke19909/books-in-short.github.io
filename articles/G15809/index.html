    <h2>  Value </h2><p>  A binding is a cover made of some solid material, in which a book or notebook is enclosed.  Mainly for these purposes cardboard is used, which is covered with leather or glued with cloth or paper.  In olden days, morocco binding or calico binding was used. </p><h2>  Binding history </h2><p>  If you go to the bookshelf, you can see a lot of bindings, they are also sometimes called roots.  This is essentially the spine of the binding cover.  New and old, taut and shabby - they carry information about which of the books has never been picked up, and which was read to the holes.  They have the smell of publishing.  Just as a person‚Äôs eyes are a mirror of his soul, so a book‚Äôs binding, which preserves history, speaks volumes.  This is what binding is. </p><h2>  Antique Book Binders </h2><p>  For a long time, bindings were made of wood.  In times of absolutely manual labor, binding books was a daunting task.  Wooden coverings were covered with leather, which was bent inward, and the pages of the book were kept on screeds and ties.  Bindings made entirely from this natural material (leather) were very rare. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The aesthetic side of the process </h2><p>  It was important not only how solid the binding was made.  In antiquity (however, as now), not only its protective functions were valued.  But what has now become routine design and decoration was then an absolute aesthetic.  Rich people could afford books with luxurious bindings that adorned not only with beautiful fabrics, but even with precious stones.  The finish was top notch.  What is binding, if not the opportunity not only to save, but also <span>to design a book?</span>  This is also evident in current realities, although not at such a level. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="book binding" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36882/1074340.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rarer the publication, the more elegantly it was decorated.  In the mid-nineteenth century, books in French were increasingly supplanted by works and translations in Russian, and in noble houses it became fashionable to design personal libraries.  This led to an increase in the demand for bindings, because what binding is already known for a long time.  By the end of the century, publications were exhibited at fairs and festivals, and bookbinding excelled. </p><p>  Bookbinding began to acquire modern features in the twentieth century.  The types and types of book binding that were used at the beginning of this century are still in use today, although during the years of Soviet rule there was a continual discussion about the priority of decoration for which books should be provided. </p><h2>  Modern book binding </h2><p>  Hardcover is a term that comes from printing.  It is defined as the bonding of the pages of a book (i.e., its internal block) with a cover (i.e., external).  It is made of reliable material, as it is required to ensure the safety of the almanac.  In addition, hardcover is part of the decoration and contains data on the print edition. </p><p>  There are two types of hardcover. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hard cover" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36882/1074339.jpg" width="600"></div>
