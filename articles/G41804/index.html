    <p>  First of all, we note that Belaya is actually considered one of the most beautiful waterways in the Southern <span>Urals.</span>  <span>Traveling along</span> it not only entails the contemplation of magnificent landscapes, but also gives the opportunity for a comfortable and relatively safe descent, even for beginners. </p><p>  Local residents - Bashkirs - are not without reason calling it the light <span>river Agidel</span> (the ‚ÄúWhite Volga‚Äù), partly this is because its water has a whitish hue due to the significant lime content.  But this reason cannot be called the main one.  The thing is that, among other things, the river also flows from the south, which means that the sun's rays in this place are refracted in such a way that a kind of radiance seems to emanate from the water surface on a fine day. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, the rafting remains in the memory for a long time - the richness of the flora of the Southern Urals is immediately impressive, and the rocks and caves create an atmosphere of solemnity and mystery. </p><p>  Many caves in the river valley were formed due to the fact that it flows in the karst zone.  The most famous cavity is Kapava, which is located in the reserve.  To visit the cave, tourists need to purchase a ticket.  By the way, not everyone knows that this place is known all over the world - on the walls there are rock <span>paintings of ancient people.</span> </p><h2>  Section 2.

    <p>  It should be noted that rafting on the Belaya River can be done in various ways, the most common of which are rafting and kayaking. </p><p>  At the camps, the necessary conditions were created in order to prepare everything necessary for holding such an event.  Instructors introduce tourists to the rules and explain the features of water routes. </p><p>  At the raft, rafting on the Belaya River, a photo of which can be seen in almost all guidebooks in Russia, is recommended for family vacations, as well as for competitions and just for fun.  Not only in warm weather, but also in the autumn-winter period, tourists are invited to make an exciting journey through the country's waterway. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When winter comes, the water level drops, and it becomes possible to visit the Granite Canyon, which is difficult to swim at other times of the year due to difficulties in overcoming the rapids. </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  Belaya begins its journey at <span>Mount Iremel,</span> which is considered sacred.  For tourists, the river section from Beloretsk to the Yumaguzinsky reservoir is especially interesting. </p><p>  In most cases, rafting along the Belaya River begins from the village of Kagi, where the camp site is located.  If necessary, the descent for a shorter time, it is carried out downstream.  But if you sail along the <span>Yumaguzinsky reservoir, you</span> should prepare for the fact that on the path of 57 km in front of travelers there will be almost completely still water. </p><p>  Tourists note that throughout the summer the river can be rafted.  Among other things, there are a lot of fish in it, so you should pay attention to the fact that the presence of fishing rods and spinning is simply necessary here so that you can always cook a delicious ear. </p><h2>  Section 4.

    <p>  The upper route is extreme, although at the very beginning you can go down even with children.  And on the second part of the path there are water obstacles that belong to the 2-3rd complexity category.  There should not be children on this site during the descent - security measures require this. </p><p>  The second - a difficult area - it is recommended to go with a specially trained guide.  At this place, rafting on the Belaya River (reviews of numerous travelers mark the upper route) is distinguished by a variety of conditions and unforgettably beautiful nature.  In general, the alloy takes about 2 hours. </p><p>  For tourists there is the possibility of passing the route throughout the year, with the exception of the period of critical flood.  The length of the waterway line is 7 km.  Tourists especially like to go down Belaya precisely on this site. </p><p>  The lower route of the alloy is considered easy.  It starts from the village of Dakhovskaya.  Shafts up to 1 m are found here only if the water level is high.  Children must be accompanied by their parents. </p><h2>  Section 6.

    <p>  "Lower alloy plus canyon" is the third route.  It begins in the Granite Canyon.  It should be noted that it is very beautiful here.  The descent on this site is quite calm.  And here you can dive, as the depth of the river in this place reaches 3 m. </p><p>  The fourth known route is the Valley of the Ammonites.  It begins in the village of Kamennomostsky, and ends at the bridge behind the sanatorium "Forest Fairy Tale".  Along the shores here you can see many fossilized mollusks and trees.  Interesting minerals attract travelers' attention. </p><p>  All age categories can take part in rafting on this route.  The duration of the descent is 3 hours, and the length is 17 km. </p><p>  Themed tours are also popular. </p><h2>  Section 7. For fans of extreme sports </h2>

    <p>  Upper Canyon is a medium-difficulty route.  The rafting in the Granite Canyon is very picturesque.  Complex water obstacles are encountered here, and there is also the opportunity to dive from the rocks, since the river in the canyon is very deep.  But it is especially good in this place in the off-season and in winter, when the water level drops markedly, and the obstacles become not so insurmountable. </p><p>  The most difficult rafting route along the Belaya River is the Seregin Canyon.  First, tourists are invited to walk 8 km on foot.  However, as a rule, this road does not cause objections: the rocks and vegetation on the sides are so beautiful that even experienced travelers take their breath away. </p><p>  Rafting along the Belaya River in this place begins in a narrowing, sandwiched by rocks.  The walls of the canyon are very high - they reach 30 m, and the width of the watercourse is only 2 m!  Almost all the obstacles on this route belong to the 3rd category of difficulty.  People should not be rafted here under the age of 16 and over 55.  In addition, experience in passing lighter trails is required. </p><p>  Of course, depending on the level of training and individual characteristics, tourists can choose the most suitable path for them, but the fact that in any case they will receive a lot of wonderful impressions can be considered undeniable. </p><p>  On the map of Russia you can find many rivers with the name Belaya.  There is such a river in the Krasnodar Territory.  This is a tributary of the Kuban.  Extreme lovers can go rafting on the Belaya River (Adygea) - this is also an interesting and beautiful route. <sub></sub></p>
