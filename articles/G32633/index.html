    <p>  First of all, we note that it is this direction that offers its guests wonderful beaches, a very clean and warm sea.  Amazingly <span>beautiful landscapes</span> will allow you to really have a good rest, completely forgetting about the troubles and problems of everyday life.  Scroll through any leaflet, this time it will not deceive you.  The country actually has a lot of unusual buildings, amazing <span>coconut palms,</span> golden and <span>pearl white sands</span> on the beaches. </p><p>  But the assets, one way or another connected with the history of this region, can be seen first of all in Santo Domingo - the capital of the republic. </p><p>  By the way, from Moscow you can get to this beautiful corner of the planet by direct flight in 13 hours.  Citizens of Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, however, subject to a stay in the country for 30 days, are entitled to visa-free entry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Section 2.

    <p>  Of course, a trip to such an exotic country requires a tourist, above all, calm, correct behavior.  Shouting and clarifying the relationship will not work.  Fuss and rush here is not accepted. </p><p>  Want to get a more comfortable hotel room or a good place on the bus?  Just pay a little administration.  Believe me, it's worth it. </p><p>  Experienced travelers are advised to pay attention to when the hotel was built or remodeled.  Why?  The thing is that the marine climate does not contribute to the long-term preservation of structures constructed even using modern technologies.  It is amazing how cathedrals, palaces and numerous statues are not destroyed! </p><p>  By the way, in the resorts both food and drinks are included in the service.  Of course, it is very convenient for tourists.  And if you go on an organized trip for the whole day, then you certainly will not be left hungry. </p><p>  However, you should pay attention to the fact that the attendants monitor the amount of alcohol drunk very closely, so you may well be denied another dose if they consider that you have already consumed quite a lot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you want to get to know the area surrounding you better, it is best to use a car rental or resort to a taxi.  As a rule, there are no problems with either method. </p><p>  <strong>Section 3.

    <p>  The multifaceted country of the Dominican Republic: sights, excursions and walks along the beach - this is not all that is offered to guests and many tourists. </p><p>  Architecture lovers will certainly be interested in the Alcazar de Colon Palace, the Captain's Palace, the Concepcion and San Diego forts.  Ancient cathedrals also hospitably welcome tourists. </p><p>  Interested in history?  Then take the time and be sure to visit the fortress of Ozama and La Fortales, the Tower of Honor, the palace of Cassa del la Moneda, the House of Columbus.  All these places are better to visit on their own, and not as part of an excursion group.  Signs, tablets and maps will help you not to get lost, and the inscriptions contain a lot of useful information. </p><p>  Many people know that the symbol of the capital is the lighthouse Faro-o-Colon.  By the way, we note that a maritime museum and a mausoleum are now organized inside it, in which you can see the resting remains of the famous discoverer Christopher Columbus. </p><p>  Be sure to look into the local mini-workshops, and you will see how craftsmen make a variety of products from wood and amber, leather and ceramics.  You can even try to make something yourself.  By the way, it is these crafts that are brought, as a rule, from the Dominican Republic as souvenirs.  Such establishments are located along the coast, but in fact, unusual places can be found, moving away from noisy and crowded places. </p><p>  Women love to go to local shops.  Why?  All due to the fact that they are characterized by the presence of quality goods, in particular clothing and shoes, at very low prices.  In addition, such shopping centers are often made in an authentic style, and paintings, drawings and sculpture elements will be able to introduce travelers to the history, culture and customs of the country. </p><p>  Are you tired?  Hungry?  Or just love to eat?  There are a lot of stylized restaurants, cafes and bars.  The cuisine in this exotic place is very unusual.  It features a mixture of African, European and local dishes.  Beans, vegetables and bananas are very widely used in combination with fish and meat.  The national drink is considered rum, 15 varieties of which are produced here. </p><p>  Diving, surfing, underwater fishing will appeal to tourists who are keen on the sea. </p><p>  If you visited the sights of the <span>Dominican Republic, photos</span> taken against their background will surely warm you throughout the year, decorating your <span>family album</span> and as if testifying that there are places on the planet that help you relax, switch and forget about everything. </p>
