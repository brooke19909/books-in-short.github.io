  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to leave Russia by regular bus to Germany</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is known that buses, despite the high cost of fuel, are the cheapest means of transportation over long distances.  Of course, getting to your destination faster by plane.  But firstly, it is expensive, and secondly, there are people who are panicky afraid to travel through the air.  And land transport has the advantage that you can see different countries in one trip.  This is what travel agencies lure their customers by offering bus tours.  But such trips do not quite please independent travelers.  After all, agencies want to sell the entire "package", which includes the services of a guide, hotels, tours.  And if you just need to get from Russia to some city in Germany?  And cheaper and without long stops?  For this, there are direct buses to Germany.  We will discuss them in this article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dinatravel.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Buses to Germany" class="if uuid-2238208" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2238208.jpg"></div><h2>  Ecolines </h2><p>  Many companies send their cars in the direction we are interested in.  And in many ways, the price of a bus depends on the appetite of the carriers.  You should compare the fare, choose convenient dates, routes and destinations.  The first in our review we will consider the company Ecolines.  She sends her buses to Germany from the Tushinskaya station (Moscow, 9 Stratonavtov passage).  The Ecolines cars go to Berlin, to Hamburg, Hanover, Munich, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt.  Moreover, buses depart not only from Moscow, but also from St. Petersburg (to the capital of Germany) and Kaliningrad (to Kiel, Munster and Hamburg).  What are the conditions on board the buses?  Dry closet, folding backs of comfortable seats, multimedia screens for each passenger, personal outlets, free Wi-Fi, air conditioning, hot drinks.  Such a bus takes 36 hours to get to Berlin from Moscow.  What are the fares?  For example, on the Moscow-Berlin route, the cost of a ticket is six thousand rubles.  The timetable is designed so that passengers spend two nights and one day in the car. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="techcrunch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bus to Germany from Moscow" class="if uuid-2238219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2238219.jpg"></div><h2>  Basfor </h2><p>  This reputable international company sends most of its buses to Germany from Ukraine.  But there are flights that connect Germany with Russia.  True, Busfor's prices are slightly higher than those of the Ecolines.  For comparison: a ticket on the route Moscow - Berlin will cost an adult passenger 7200 rubles.  From Kaliningrad to the capital of Germany you can go for 4825 rubles.  Berlin is not the only point on the map of Germany that can be reached with the help of the Basfor company.  Reviews note the extremely wide geography of flights, as well as their frequency.  On board the bus, passengers can count on comfortable soft chairs, air conditioning, and a TV.  Tickets can be bought online, and it is also easy to refuse a trip and return the full price. </p><h2>  CJSC Euro-Trans-Company </h2><p>  The Russian carrier decided to keep up with international companies and in the summer of 2017 launched a new route, which is currently the longest.  The departure point is Mosgortrans station.  A bus to Germany from Moscow follows to Aschaffenburg, making stops in Magdeburg, Berlin, Braunschweig, Bielefeld, Hanover, Dortmund, D√ºsseldorf, Essen, Cologne, Montabaur, Frankfurt am Main, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Pforzronheim, Heilb.  The total length of such a route is 3200 kilometers.  Flights do not depart daily, but only on Thursdays.  Passengers will be in transit for 47 hours (if they go to the final station).  The price of an adult ticket to Aschaffenburg is 7200 rubles.  The bus leaves for Germany from Teply Stan.  This is a metro station.  Finding her is easy.  Near the exit to the surface of the earth and is the bus station Mosgortrans.  Her address is 4. Novoyasenevsky Avenue. What do the reviews say about services on board Euro-Trans-Company vehicles?  The conditions are very basic, but if you have health and a romantic desire to see the world, then you will enjoy the trip. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.msk.kp.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Teply Stan Germany bus" class="if uuid-2238234" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2238234.jpg"></div><h2>  Deutsche Touring </h2><p>  The German company is known for its wide network of routes, which covers not only Germany, but also all of Europe, as well as the CIS countries.  About 40 flights were opened in Russia alone.  Buses to Germany from Deutsche Touring will deliver you to Berlin, Aachen, Bielefeld, Dresden, Frankfurt, Essen, Hanover, Cologne, Karlsruhe, Magdeburg, Stuttgart and Nuremberg.  At the same time, the prices of the German carrier are even lower than domestic, and the level of comfort in cars is higher.  Tickets can be purchased online, and students, retirees, schoolchildren and groups of more than ten people receive a significant discount. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.euromag.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosgortrans bus to Germany" class="if uuid-2238243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2238243.jpg"></div><h2>  Europa Light </h2><p>  A bus trip to Germany from Moscow will be a pleasant pastime due to the comfortable conditions on board.  Smiling stewardesses, hot meals and drinks, media devices built into the back of the front seat, the ability to reserve a seat in the cabin and other amenities will make the long journey shorter.  With this company you can easily get from Moscow to Nuremberg, Munich, Ulm, Augsburg, Stuttgart, Cologne, Hanover, Magdeburg and other big and small cities in Germany.  The price of the trip ranges from 80 euros / 5456 rubles (eastern lands) to 105/7162.  If you buy round-trip tickets with an open date, you can significantly reduce the cost of the trip. </p>
