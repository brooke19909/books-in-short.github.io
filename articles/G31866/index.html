  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ruggear mobile phones: specifications, description, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When working days are not in a normal environment, special equipment is needed.  The well-known company RugGear makes those things that are useful for a walk in the woods or in any extreme conditions.  Of course, in their assortment you can find devices with special protection.  One of these models is the RugGear RG150 Traveler phone, and the RG128 Mariner will also be an excellent accessory.  The article will be devoted to them. </p><p>  If we compare these two options with other protected ones, then we can say that both look very commonplace.  However, their functions are quite interesting. </p><h2>  RugGear Phone Positioning </h2><p>  For those who like to go climbing and other extreme sports (ATVs, bikes), RugGear phones will become best friends.  These devices, after falling into sand, water or on the ground from a relatively high height, can withstand shock, pollution and continue to function, as if nothing had happened.  Some manufacturers even thought about creating the so-called "float", a phone that can float.  Rather, it is designed for fishermen. </p><p>  Inexpensive RugGear phones are also suitable for children who are leaving for the camp.  In order to prevent an incident on the beach with the main device, you can take a protected model.  It should be understood that it is intended mainly for calls and messages.  There are no other functions like on smartphones.  If they are necessary, then it is better to purchase a special protected gadget for a higher fee. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  RugGear phones are sold complete with a charger, a USB cable, a special key in order to remove the bolts from the panel if necessary, and instructions.  Judging by the reviews of people, it would be nice if the manufacturer provided a cover for the hand or a carabiner for the belt. </p><h2>  RG128: design, dimensions, controls </h2><p>  The <span>RugGear RG128</span> Mariner <span>phone</span> has a sufficient level of protection, and it looks very interesting, neat and not tough.  Holds well in hand.  The body material is such that it does not slip out, even if it is in water.  In similar devices, as a rule, there are buttons on the side of the case - here they are not.  For headphone jack located on top, there is also a flashlight.  Below you can find a place for a USB cable.  The connectors are closed with a special plug, and they are attached to the body and tightly insulate the nests so that water or dirt does not get there.  On the side of the phone is covered with soft rubber. </p><p>  The rear panel is fastened with screws, although it already fits perfectly due to the presence of grooves.  There is a protective gum that does not let even a drop of water pass.  Although it dries out over time, the chance to drown the phone is practically zero.  Therefore, there are no problems with tightness.  The model comes in black.  When reading reviews, it became clear that it would be better if the RugGear phones, which are declared as floaters, were available in red or white housing. </p><p>  There are no complaints about the assembly of the device, it is really good.  The phone supports 2 SIM cards, the connector for which is located directly under the battery.  It is possible to use a memory card up to 8 GB. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ruggear phones" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056952.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, the resolution is slightly lower.  True, there are no significant differences.  RugGear phones have an inexpensive matrix, so you can‚Äôt see text and pictures in the sun.  This is the main minus of the device.  But due to the fact that he uses the maximum for calls and messages, this nuance is uncritical and does not require a lot of attention.  In principle, a comparison of this display with other similar ones takes place, although in some respects it is inferior. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ruggear phone" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056950.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Keyboard RugGear RG128 </h2><p>  The buttons are made of rubber, comfortable when pressed, while the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù sensations when pressed are created both in air and under water. </p><p>  The backlight is specially made in blue to make it noticeable.  However, it does not differ in special brightness.  The RugGear phone has keyboards in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once.  There is a separate button for the camera and flashlight.  According to reviews of people, it becomes clear that you can immediately forget about using the first one.  The quality of the photos is terrible (0.3 megapixels).  The flashlight is bright enough.  The user experience with the keyboard is quite good, almost all customers liked its size and ergonomics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ruggear phones reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1057307.jpg" width="237"></div>

One is designed for 650 mAh, it should be used if the owner has a long voyage with the device.  For everyday use, the manufacturer recommends the use of 1400 mAh.  Judging by the technical characteristics, the device can withstand 4-7 hours of talk time, 200-400 hours in idle time. </p><p>  In fact, RugGear phones, reviews of which are almost all positive, work for about 2-3 days with an hour of conversation and sleep mode.  This is how many users characterize a weak battery.  A more powerful battery can work twice as long.  The charging time of the first is 1.5 hours, the second is 3.5 hours. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone ruggear" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1057308.jpg" width="299"></div>

    <h2>  Positioning RugGear RG150 Traveler </h2><p>  Looking through the assortment of the technical market, it may seem that all the models are commonplace, and nothing new can be found here.  However, the RugGear phone can exceed the expectations of many.  The manufacturer was able to come up with very interesting details and functions that allowed the gadget to surpass many standard ones. </p><p>  At first glance, the device has nothing special: a banal appearance, IP68 protection.  But when you open the settings menu and maintenance book, it immediately becomes clear that a lot of secrets are hidden in the phone.  It is safe to say that there were no analogues on the market before. </p><p>  Why are people reluctant to buy RugGear phones, the manufacturer of which is trying so hard to surprise the consumer with something?  This is due to the fact that they have few functions and are largely inferior to sophisticated smartphones. </p><p>  This device is intended for trips, for example, to the forest, where the Internet and games will simply be inappropriate, but incidents in the form of diving occur quite often.  It is better to use a <span>secure phone</span> than to constantly leave your smartphone at home. </p><p>  The RG150 model supports two SIM cards, it can connect via Bluetooth to other devices.  It is possible to forward calls from the main phone to this one.  Many may argue that it is easier to get around a headset then, but it is unlikely that it can ring loudly, vibrate, swim, and this device will not remain ‚Äúalive‚Äù after falling from a cliff.  The RugGear mobile phone has a <span>powerful flashlight</span> and the ability to charge other devices.  All these options allow you to make it interesting and interesting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone ruggear rg150 traveler" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056940.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  RG150: design, dimensions, controls </h2><p>  The phone is presented to the public in black.  <span>IP68 protection</span> assumes that the device is resistant to water and drops.  Experiments were conducted not only by the manufacturer, but also by consumers: the equipment was lowered into the flask to a depth of 1 meter, water did not leak, and the phone continued to work properly.  The dimensions of the device are 1.2x5.8x2.3 cm;  weight - 165 g. </p><p>  The first thing you can pay attention to when viewing a device is thickness and power.  There is a rubber insert on the side, it helps to fix the phone not only in dry but also in wet hands.  At the top of the case you can find a standard headphone jack, and in the center - a lens that is used to turn on the flashlight. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone ruggear rg128 mariner" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056937.jpg" width="238"></div>

    <h2>  RG150: Brief Description </h2><p>  The screen is small (2 inches).  Its resolution is 176x220 pixels.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcheap, so you can‚Äôt see the text in the sun, but this is a minus of every protected phone.  However, Ruggear is the leader among the rest, so you should not pay attention to a bad display. </p><p>  The navigation key is white, it is highlighted, but not very bright.  The buttons are made of a material such as plastic, pressing them conveniently and comfortably with gloves and fingers.  False clicks do not happen, because in order to carry out any manipulations it is necessary to press with some effort. </p><p>  The battery is lithium-ion, its capacity is 2400 mAh.  The manufacturer introduced this characteristic - the battery can withstand 560 minutes of talk and 600 hours of downtime.  The charger is capable of gaining a full battery in 3.5 hours;  when changing the memory, this time is reduced to 2.5 hours </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ruggear phones manufacturer" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1056935.jpg" width="334"></div>

    <h2>  Phone Impressions </h2><p>  Ruggear phones (reviews are presented in the article) has an excellent speaker, which is clear and loud.  There is also a vibro function, it is average in power, but it feels quite good.  Users of phones do not see any special disadvantages.  Models of protective devices appeared on sale 2 years ago and during this time they gained immense popularity. </p><p>  The competitor can be called Texet TM-511R.  RugGear phones are inferior to it in battery capacity (2700 mAh).  If you take into account only the price, then Texet is much cheaper, but with the importance of functionality, you need to pay attention to RugGear.  Moreover, there are much more positive reviews about the latter. </p>
