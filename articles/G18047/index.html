    <p>  Palanga (its location is visible on the map) stretched along the seashore.  The settlement of ≈†ventoji also belongs to the territory of the city.  He was annexed to Palanga in the 73rd year.  The distance at which the city is located from various objects: </p><ol><li>  Klaipeda - 26 kilometers. </li><li>  Vilnius - 331 km. </li><li>  19 kilometers - the border of Latvia-Lithuania. </li></ol><p>  Palanga, hotels in which offer a high quality service, is considered one of the most popular resorts on the coast. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Holidays in Palanga will suit those who prefer a cool mild summer, rather than a sweltering heat.  The weather here is quite moody and can change at any time.  So it‚Äôs almost impossible to predict in advance what vacation days will be.  July and August are periods when the weather is most stable.  The temperature is stable: it is kept at +25 degrees.  The sea is relatively warm.  The water temperature in Palanga is from 17 to 19 degrees.  Guests can enjoy many sunny days.  However, they can be replaced quickly by long thunderstorms.  Winds blow along the coast.  Only the most seasoned and the most daring decide to swim in such weather.  You can enjoy sunbathing in the dunes.  There is no such wind as on the shore.  However, the city does not meet colds and adults.  This is due to the fact that sea air <span>is saturated with</span> iodine <span>vapor</span> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lithuania rest palanga" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/472172.jpg" width="550"></div>

Palanga is a vivid confirmation of this.  This city with its picturesque landscapes leaves no one indifferent.  About two-thirds of the country's territory is occupied by mixed and coniferous forests.  You can endlessly admire the groves and whitish dunes.  Thanks to the beauty of nature, Lithuania is so popular among tourists.  Palanga is a city in which the air is filled with the aroma of a fresh sea breeze mixed with the smell of plants.  At the end of the XIX century, this place was considered an aristocratic health resort.  Count Tyszkiewicz contributed greatly to the fact that it gained such a reputation.  Currently, Palanga is a small creek backwater.  However, this quiet place managed to maintain hotel comfort.  There are also many establishments that can satisfy the taste preferences of the most sophisticated gourmet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palanga beaches" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/472173.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  The building of an ancient pharmacy belongs to this category.  It was built at the beginning of the XIX century.  One of the symbols of Palanga is the pier, which goes into the sea for almost half a kilometer.  It was built at the end of the 19th century.  The pier was necessary for the merchant and passenger ship, which at that time cruised between Liepaja and Palanga.  Soon it became unsuitable for further use in shipping.  Later, the pier turned into a popular place for walking.  In the 98th year, its reconstruction was carried out.  Important sights include the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.  It was built in neo-Gothic style.  The Swedish architect K. Strandman was responsible for the project.  The building is the tallest in Palanga.  Tourists should also visit the following attractions: </p><ol><li>  Seaside Regional Park. </li><li>  Memorial estate of Dr. Jonas ≈†lupas. </li><li>  The house-museum of the artist and sculptor Antanas Monchis. </li><li>  Church in the name of the icon of the Mother of God "Iverskaya". </li><li>  Museum of dogs. </li></ol><h2>  Local hotels </h2><p>  Palanga has a wide variety of hotels.

If the budget option is chosen, then it is worth renting a house or one room in the private sector.  You can also check into a fashionable five-star hotel, which has an ultramodern spa.  It is logical that from such an institution to the sea - just a stone's throw. </p><p>  Expensive hotels are located mainly near the central pedestrian zone.  This is on Basanavicius street.  Other similar establishments are located in the green quarter, which stretches along the coastline.  Its territory stretches almost to the botanical park.  This is a great place to stay.  Nearby is the sea, as well as promenades, <span>restaurants, cafes,</span> clubs, shops, attractions and more.  The road to them does not take much time.
