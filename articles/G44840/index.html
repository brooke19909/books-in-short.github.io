Leforge and R. Sazek, and in 1957 was published in his monograph The Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality.  Interestingly, this test is still actively used by US intelligence agencies.  Due to its compactness and informativeness, the Leary technique is also very popular among psychologists. </p><h2>  Description and purpose of the technique </h2><p>  The test examines a person‚Äôs self-image.  At the same time, it can be used to evaluate ideas about both the real "I" and the ideal.  It is also possible to use others to evaluate if it is necessary to clarify the vision of one individual in the eyes of another.  In the process of diagnosis, the dominant type of attitude of the individual to others is highlighted.  We are talking about two key factors that determine interpersonal relationships: </p><p>  1) domination - submission; </p><p>  2) friendliness - aggressiveness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lyre technique" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31720/895551.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  These factors were identified by M. Argyle as the main characteristics of interpersonal behavior.  They also correlate with the two axes of the <span>semantic differential of</span> C. Osgood, who used bipolar scales (for example, hot-cold, strong-weak, etc.) with a fixed number of divisions on each of them to study psychological variables. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Schematic representation of factors </h2><p>  For a schematic representation of the main social orientations of an individual, the method of diagnosing Leary's interpersonal relations includes a conditional scheme: a circle divided into 8 sectors - octants.  Two axes are distinguished in the circle (corresponding to the factors of interpersonal relations described above): "dominance - submission" and "friendliness - hostility".  Moreover, Leary assumed that the relationship between these variables is stronger, the closer the respondent‚Äôs results are relative to the center of the circle.  The sum of points for each of the orientations, which are determined by the methodology for diagnosing interpersonal relationships of Leary, is translated into the index, respectively, of the dominant axis.  The distance obtained between the indicators and the center of the circle determines the adaptability of interpersonal behavior. </p><p>  The qualitative characteristics of the selected sectors (octants), which are determined by the methodology of interpersonal relations of T. Leary, can be represented as follows: </p><p>  I. Good leader, mentor and adviser. </p><p>  II.  Confident type, independent and rival. </p><p>  III.  Sincere, direct, persistent in his achievements. </p><p>  IV.  Skeptical, non-conformist, realistic in his judgments. </p><p>  V. Modest and shy, willingly fulfilling other people's duties. </p><p>  VI.  Needing help and trust from others. </p><p>  VII.  Friendly, seeking cooperation. </p><p>  Viii.  Empathic and able to help others. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="methodology for the diagnosis of interpersonal relationships lyre" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31720/896949.jpg" width="600"></div>

These items are arranged in ascending order of intensity.  Moreover, the methodology is structured in such a way that the characteristics aimed at identifying a certain type of relationship are arranged in a special way: not in a row, but in groups of four judgments in each, repeated through an equal number of judgments. </p><p>  Leary's technique, aimed at interpersonal relationships, can be accompanied by two types of instructions.  In the first of these, respondents are asked to carefully read and evaluate judgments characterizing the psychological characteristics of a person and their relationships with people around them.  If, in the opinion of the respondent, the judgment corresponds to his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhimself, then it is necessary to mark him with a ‚Äú+‚Äù sign, if not, with a ‚Äú-‚Äù sign. </p><p>  In the second version of the instruction, Leary's method involves evaluating not only the real "I", but also the ideal.  Example: "Having assessed your real" I ", please read all the judgments again and mark with a" + "sign those that correspond to your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow you would like to see yourself ideally."  In this case, you can subsequently determine the level of discrepancy between the real and ideal representations of the individual about himself.  An assessment of the relationships of others can also be reflected in the instruction offered by Leary's technique.  Example: ‚ÄúAs in the first case, please evaluate the identity of your colleague (boss, spouse, child, etc.).‚Äù  Accordingly, it is possible to diagnose the vision system of one individual by another. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Processing the Leary technique involves several steps.  Initially, the number of points is calculated for each of the 8 types of interpersonal relationships (authoritarian, selfish, aggressive, suspicious, subordinate, dependent, friendly, altruistic). </p><p>  The next step is to determine the severity of the type.  The maximum level score for each type, which Leary's methodology suggests for interpersonal relationships, can be 16 points, which, in turn, are divided into 4 degrees of severity: </p><ul><li>  from 0 to 4 points: low severity (adaptive behavior); </li><li>  from 5 to 8 points: moderate severity (also adaptive behavior); </li><li>  from 9 to 12 points: high severity (extreme behavior); </li><li>  from 13 to 16 points: extreme severity (extreme behavior to pathology). </li></ul><p>  The third stage of processing, which involves the method of diagnosing interpersonal relationships of T. Leary, is the determination of indicators by two main vectors: dominance - friendliness.  Calculations are made using the following formulas: </p><p>  Domination = (I - V) + 0.7 x (VIII + II - IV - VI). </p><p>  Friendliness = (VII - III) +0.7 x (VIII - II - IV + VI). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="a technique for diagnosing interpersonal relationships" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31720/895587.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Finally, as the final stage, Leary's method implies a qualitative analysis carried out by comparing discograms constructed on the basis of the data obtained for each respondent with each other.  It is also possible to build an average profile of interpersonal relationships in a particular group.  It seems optimal to use the questionnaire in the system of educational institutions.  In addition, a <span>longitudinal study</span> (for example, within the framework of a particular class) may turn out to be indicative, the possibility of which is also provided by T. Leary's method for diagnosing interpersonal relationships. </p><p>  The interpretation of the main indicators of the relationship is carried out according to 8 types: </p><h2>  I. Authoritarian type of relationship </h2><p>  From 13 to 16 points.  A type of <span>strong personality</span> characterized by an imperious, dictatorial character.

    <h2>  Viii.  Altruistic Relationship Type </h2><p>  From 9 to 16 points.  It is characterized by pronounced hyperresponsibility, as well as responsibility for others - often unjustified.  Ready to help others to the detriment of their own interests.  At the same time, in his help, he can be overly active and even obsessive.  However, in some cases, this behavior can also be a kind of mask.  In this case, we are dealing with the opposite type of relationship. </p><p>  From 0 to 8 points.  This type is characterized by selflessness and responsiveness.  He is responsible in relation to other people, shows them responsiveness and compassion.  Soft, delicate and caring. </p><h2>  Interpretation of Results </h2><p>  The methodology for the diagnosis of interpersonal relations T. Leary involves a fairly wide amount of information to study the personality of the respondent.  If testing was carried out in group form, then the researcher, as already mentioned, has the opportunity to compare the results of individual individuals with a group profile, as well as with each other.  When interpreting the results, it is important to focus not on absolute values, but on the dominance of indicators of one type over others.  It is also important to consider if there is a negative attitude of parents to the defect of their child (the ‚ÄúPARI‚Äù Leary method). </p><p>  If an assessment is made of both the ‚ÄúI‚Äù of the real and the ‚ÄúI‚Äù of the ideal, then normally there should not be significant differences between them.  In turn, if there is a moderate level of discrepancy, then this indicates the possibility of self-improvement, which, in fact, is indicated by Leary's method.  Interpretation of the results of the questionnaire revealed the fact that most often dissatisfaction with oneself is typical for people with low self-esteem (which corresponds to the 5th, 6th and 7th octants) or for people experiencing a state of prolonged conflict (corresponds to the 4th octant). </p><p>  If the respondent has a simultaneous predominance of the 1st and 5th octants, then this indicates that he has the problem of authoritarianism and painful pride;  2nd and 6th - there is a contradiction between the desire for independence and the need to obey (for example, when due to official necessity the individual is obliged to obey, despite his inner protest).  The conflict between the 3rd and 7th octants takes place in the conflict of motives for self-affirmation and affiliation;  4th and 8th - manifests itself when an individual suppresses hostility towards others for the sake of recognition by them (the desire for recognition by the group and a simultaneous feeling of hostility towards it). </p>
