  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic policy, or CJSC "RF"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <strong>Theoretical background</strong> </p><p>  The internal policy of the state is a series of measures, laws, orders, decisions, actions of the government that regulate the economic, cultural, spiritual life within the state.  Its department includes the development of society‚Äôs infrastructure, control over the strict observance of all the rights of citizens, the stabilization of economic processes, the growth of spiritual, moral and scientific potential, so that society, along with its state, moves steadily along the path of progress. </p><p>  <strong>From theory to practice</strong> </p><p>  The domestic policy of any country, in theory, should be aimed at improving the <span>standard of living of</span> its citizens.  An example of this is the United States.  Their economy is the largest economy in the world, equal to the fact that the same country is considered the largest consumer in the world.  The state and its citizens consume almost 50% of all goods, services and other goods produced in the world. </p><p>  The question arises: how do you manage to satiate such needs?  What kind of measures does the US government apply?  What is characteristic of US foreign and domestic policy? </p><p>  If we mention the <span>foreign policy,</span> it draws attention to its pronounced aggressive nature.  It is to meet its domestic needs that America is forced to maintain the largest and most combat-ready army in the world.  US military spending is incomparable with spending in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãany other country. </p><p>  US aggression is expressed in the fact that this superpower unleashes armed conflicts in order to seize other people's <span>natural resources,</span> as was done in Iraq, in order to get Iraqi oil.  The states are organizing color revolutions around the world to bring power loyal to America to power in other countries.  A recent example is the invasion of Libya, contrary to all international law, the overthrow of Libyan power, and all with one goal - again, open access to oil, this time Libyan. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But America itself is far from poor in terms of natural wealth.  Her reserves can be envied.  However, the Americans treat them extremely carefully, and the country's domestic policy is aimed at preserving and enhancing them.  For example, mining is not carried out in the mainland, with the exception of Alaska.  The US government thus ensures that future generations of citizens have enough of their resources, while in the world there will be a shortage of them. </p><p>  Another wise step towards strengthening our own economy and stabilizing the lives of our people is the fact that the American government managed to get the rest of the world to work for American dollars.  In other words, oil and gas for the United States are no more expensive than the cost of paper and ink, which went to print their currency, which has become the equivalent of a world banknote ... </p><p>  Naturally, the American population is protected by such a wise domestic policy of its leadership.  Most importantly, it does not matter at all who in the country will become the next president.  In any case, he, the Senate and Congress will think about the good of the American people. </p><p>  <strong>What about us?</strong> </p><p>  The domestic policy of the Russian Federation is being built in a completely different way.  It is unique in that a Russian citizen feels economically in his country as a foreigner.  Considering that the main and sole owner of all natural resources is the people, then, by any healthy logic, every Russian should receive returns from, for example, the country's oil and gas excess revenues.  But the oligarchic system, led by President Putin, pursues a completely different policy.  And one of its negative manifestations was the principle of equal profitability in relation to the activities of the same Gazprom.  The essence of this principle is this: no matter where and to whom gas is sold - to Germany, to Ukraine or to Smolensk, Kursk, Vologda and other areas - the profitability from sales should be the same.  Those.  Russian citizens are not only eliminated from receiving returns from the export of Russian wealth, but also put in a position equal to foreign buyers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Let's go further.  Every <span>new year in Russia</span> , all tariffs for housing and communal services are growing rapidly.  They are raised by private management companies, on which all residents of the country are dependent.  Only this year, some exceptions were made, and at Putin‚Äôs command, prices didn‚Äôt jump up.  This is due to the fact that parliamentary elections were held in December, and presidential elections were expected in March.  As soon as the elections ended, from July 1, a rapid increase in tariffs began.  Now there is an intention to raise them again, in the fall, without even waiting for the next new year. </p><p>  <strong>Summary</strong> </p><p>  What does such an internal policy of the Russian Federation, pursued by its leadership, speak of?  It is thought that the people who are at the helm of the authorities do not consider this country their Motherland.  Their children study and live in the West, their money is in Western banks and work for the economies of other countries.  The officials themselves, having retired, also rarely remain in their native lands.  Russia for them is nothing more than a means of personal enrichment, and the Russian people are nothing more than an electorate, and it needs to be a little cajoled before the election.  On the one hand, one can only sympathize with citizens, and on the other, one should never forget that every nation has the government that it deserves.  The Russian government is elected by the very people that does not consider it necessary to go to the polls, is not interested in politics, sincerely believing that its 1 vote will not solve anything.  And as long as a similar state of affairs, a similar level of consciousness persists, the Russians will never heal like the Americans.  Moreover, the Americans have a clear understanding that they hired the president, governor, Senate and Congress, that their money - the money of taxpayers - goes to cover the presidential expenses and the bureaucracy.  And therefore, almost so, they assert their rights.  This is called a developed civil society.  The Russians, on the other hand, look at the president as a priest-king, a benefactor, and deputies as celestials.  Naturally, with such a mentality one cannot count on another life.  And the state‚Äôs internal policy will not change its course. </p>
