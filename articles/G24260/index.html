As tourists say, the beaches are always crowded, so you should come here right away in the morning.  By the way, 200 meters from the beach there is free parking. </p>

    <p>  The most popular party in the city is the Sportsmans bar, where by tradition all Germans and British gather.  Accordingly, the cuisine of this institution is saturated with the spirit of these countries.  The Arenal has the largest water park, where both an adult and a child will find entertainment for themselves.  In the water park at the same time can be about 3500 people. </p><h2>  Mallorca tours: what to visit? </h2><p>  Having chosen this picturesque <span>island of Spain,</span> you should not spend precious vacation only on the beach and visiting bars.  A good geographical position is worth exploring the island up and down.  So, taking a mini-train, you can get from Arenal to Can Pastilla - the most beautiful place in Spain.  Entertaining excursions, for example, a visit to a <span>knightly tournament</span> or show program at the Son Amar club, will present a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvivid impressions. </p><p>  You should not ignore the variety of water activities: water skiing and windsurfing, kartsurfing and diving, you can rent a boat and just swim in the bay.  The city‚Äôs nightlife is also very active: a variety of discos in small cellars, show programs on various topics - you can plunge into the atmosphere of unrestrained fun even near your hotel. </p>
