And in general, why is this phenomenon observed?  These questions arise in citizens more and more often.  Actually, telephone echoes can be explained by various reasons.  Once it turns out to resolve the situation without any particular problems, in some cases this cannot be done.  In general, if the subscriber has the described problem, you will have to go through several options for the development of events, the diagnosis of which is very difficult without outside help.  So what if an echo is heard during a conversation?  Why it happens?  How dangerous is the phenomenon? </p><h2>  To be adjusted </h2><p>  The first step is to understand how realistic it is to solve the task.  Perhaps it will not work out in any way to eliminate the echo interfering with the conversation in the receiver? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="telephone echo" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1465260.jpg" width="424"></div>

    <p>  As practice shows, the echo during a telephone conversation is a phenomenon that usually needs to be adjusted.  And without radical action.  Accordingly, you should not be scared if this problem occurs.  But because of what the echo is heard in the receiver?  And what to do in this or that case? </p><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  The most obvious option is a manufacturing defect.  Actual for new phones.  It is likely that the device was initially malfunctioning.  As a result, an echo is heard during the conversation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the problem begins to bother the buyer immediately after the first call.  That is, from the very beginning.  You can act in several ways: </p><ol><li>  Hand over the phone for repair.  If the reason is not marriage at all, but some kind of breakdown, then it will certainly be eliminated.  And you can pick up an already working device. </li><li>  Exchange the gadget in the store and write a complaint about the purchase of defective goods.  Actual if the echo is detected immediately after purchase.  Typically, sellers quickly exchange defective phones for working ones. </li></ol><p>  However, marriage is only one of the reasons.  It has already been said that it is detected immediately after the start of using the phone.  What situations do most often occur in real life? </p>

    <h2>  Volume </h2><p>  Why is the echo in the phone heard during a conversation?  Sometimes subscribers complain about just such a situation.  Moreover, regardless of the services of which operator they use.  Why is the interlocutor or myself heard repeatedly? </p><p>  It is likely to blame the volume of sounds.  Or, as people say, phone settings.  The speaker or microphone is too loud for the other party.  Because of this, the indicated problem occurs. </p><p>  In such circumstances, it is recommended that you lower the microphone and speaker volume.  And on the phone with the interlocutor, and at home.  You can also try calling another person and making sure that it‚Äôs not the phone‚Äôs settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wiretap </h2><p>  Why is there an echo when <span>talking on the phone</span> ?  If the device has been used for a long time, it is possible that a bug is installed on the mobile phone.  He helps someone to listen to telephone conversations.  From here comes an echo. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why echo in the phone when talking" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1465258.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, such a situation is a rarity.  If there is a suspicion of wiretapping, you can take the mobile phone to a service center, report suspicions and wait for the completion of diagnostics and repair.  This technique is the fastest, most logical and easiest solution.  After all, it is very difficult to get rid of a bug on your own. </p><h2>  Factory Feature </h2><p>  If an echo occurs while talking on the phone, you should not be scared.  And immediately think about the fact that a low-quality product was purchased, too.  The thing is that each mobile phone has its own "filling."  That is, all phones are arranged differently.  The cause of the problem can be just a factory feature. </p><p>  That is, initially the phone was assembled so that when working with a mobile network, an echo will be heard.  Actually mainly for older models of gadgets.  The solution is only in 2 options: </p><ol><li>  Accept the echo.  Have to carefully listen to the words.  But sooner or later it will bother. </li><li>  Immediately buy a new phone.  It is advisable to continue to make a test call before making a purchase. </li></ol><p>  There are no more solutions in this situation.  How to remove the echo in the phone during a conversation?  It all depends on the cause of the problem.  What other methods of struggle are worth paying attention to?  For example, if all the previously listed layouts do not explain the emerging echo? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove the echo in the phone when talking" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1465263.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  Speaker </h2><p>  In such a situation, only a service center will help.  Or buying a new phone.  But this is not about the features of the device of the mobile phone.  Echo in the phone during a conversation can occur if it is a speaker breakdown. </p><p>  A fairly common problem faced by subscribers who do not follow their mobile phones.  If the phone falls or falls into water, it is likely that an echo problem will occur. </p><p>  By the way, if you leave this phenomenon unattended, in the end the speaker will refuse to work in principle.  That is why, after some negative impact on the phone and the appearance of this problem, you need to contact the service center.  There, the speaker will either be repaired or replaced.  Fortunately, in most cases you do not need to buy a new phone.  But you also should not expect that the repaired speaker will last a long time. </p><h2>  Case tightness </h2><p>  Echo in the phone during a conversation can occur in case of violations of the tightness of the gadget's case.  The situation is not too common, but to combat it is very problematic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why when talking on the phone you hear an echo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1465262.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If the subscriber is thinking about how to get rid of the emerging echo, you can offer him the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Take the phone to a service center.  They will be able to conduct a full diagnosis and fix the problem.  Although few people are involved in correcting the tightness of the case. </li><li>  Change housing.  This method does not always work.  Housing panels need to be replaced with denser ones.  You can buy these components in any store, depending on the model of the gadget. </li><li>  Change the phone.  The most logical, though not the most pleasant solution.  It is almost impossible to fix a leak in the device.  That is why you often have to buy new mobile ones. </li></ol><p>  But this does not end with possible options.  There is another fairly common reason for which you will hear an echo on the phone when talking to the other person.  It is also necessary to know about her. </p><h2>  Mobile network operator </h2><p>  It is about the work of a mobile operator.  In each city, such companies have a huge variety of transmission lines.  Because of this, for some operators in some places the signal is blocked.  From here appears an echo in the phone when talking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="echo on the phone when talking with the interlocutor" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1465261.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  There are several ways to fight.  Usually at least one of them is effective: </p><ol><li>  Change of location.  Often, an echo is heard only in certain places of the city.  In this case, it is better to avoid such areas. </li><li>  Change mobile operator.  Another way that helps get rid of the problem forever.  Usually it is the people who use it.  Especially now, when you can easily change the mobile network operator, while maintaining the old phone number. </li><li>  Call to the operator.  Alternatively, if the echo is not a permanent problem, you can call the company that provides communication services, and then report any problems.  Be sure to name a place where it is inconvenient to communicate with interlocutors.  The operator will try to fix the problems on the line or explain why the echo is heard. </li></ol><p>  Perhaps this can complete all the most common causes of the appearance of an echo during a conversation.  What to do in this or that case is now clear.  In reality, everything is not as scary as it seems. </p><h2>  Reboot </h2><p>  However, before going through all the previously listed problems, it is recommended to use a little trick.  Sometimes when talking on the phone, an echo is heard due to minor system failures.  Both on the operator‚Äôs line and in the mobile itself. </p><p>  Turning the situation off will help to turn off and on the phone again.  Or you can end the call and call the other person again.  Nevertheless, it is recommended that you use the restart of your smartphone.  This technique, as practice shows, helps quite often. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="echo while talking on the phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1465259.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions should be drawn?  There are many reasons why an echo occurs during a conversation.  It is very difficult to independently diagnose it.  But most often, this phenomenon occurs due to: </p><ul><li>  phone settings; </li><li>  violations of the tightness of the device; </li><li>  factory defect; </li><li>  sloppy phone / due to the long life of the device; </li><li>  operator‚Äôs work; </li><li>  assembly features; </li><li>  listening to conversations; </li><li>  network outages or phone malfunctions. </li></ul><p>  Most often, you can cope with the problem.  And as already mentioned, only in some cases have to act radically. </p>
