    <h2>  Short story </h2><p>  As noted above, in the ninth century the city of Ghent was founded.  Belgium at that time was the subject of constant attacks.  In this regard, Count Baudouin I founded a fortress here, which was supposed to protect local abbeys from Viking raids.  Some time later, villages appeared around her.  In the XI century, Ghent turned into the center of the region.  Textile, handicraft and lace production flourished here.  The era of the greatest dawn and economic power for the city was the period of the XIV-XV centuries.  In 1817, with the support of King William I, a university appeared here.  Another 10 years later, the Ghent-Trenesen Canal was laid, through which the city is connected to the North Sea.  This, in turn, contributed to the emergence of the port and led to the rapid further economic growth of the entire region.  Today, its annual cargo turnover reaches 25 million tons. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The capital of the province of East Flanders is the city of Ghent (Belgium is divided into ten such administrative units).  It was erected at the confluence of the rivers Scheldt and Leie.  At approximately the same distance from it (less than 50 kilometers) is the capital of the country, Brussels, and one of its most famous cities - Brugge.  Such a convenient geographical position contributed to the rapid development of Ghent.  As of today, about 250 thousand inhabitants live here.  In terms of population, it is the third in the country. </p>

    <h2>  Nature and climate </h2><p>  The unique nature and unique landscapes are primarily determined by the area where Ghent is located.  Belgium as a whole is a very green country.  However, it is definitely impossible to say so about this city.  When looking at it from a height, you can only see sharp turrets and tiled roofs.  Along with this, local residents are very fond of flowers, so they decorate the streets with colorful flower beds. </p><p>  High humidity and frequent rains are the main weather feature that distinguishes Ghent.  Belgium in this regard throughout the year is under the influence of the air masses that come from the Atlantic Ocean.  The climate that dominates the city itself is of a moderate marine type.  The sultry heat in the city is almost never.  In the summer, the thermometer bars are on average around 18 degrees, and in winter - 3 degrees above zero.  According to the reviews of tourists who visited here, the spring-summer season is an ideal time to visit it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Tourism and Attractions </h2><p>  Walking through the local streets, each tourist can feel the unique atmosphere that has been created for centuries.  Many lovers of a relaxing and cultural holiday just come to Ghent for this.  Belgium, the attractions of which many travelers associate with Bruges, is the country that is best visited in the spring and summer season.  Due to its considerable age, Ghent is one of the richest in Europe in terms of the number of architectural and historical monuments.  All of them will have to be listed for a very long time, therefore only the most significant among them are presented below. </p><p>  In 1180, the Counts of Flanders erected a castle for themselves here.  According to their idea, he looked ominously and gloomy.  This was done in order to protect the city and scare away independent-minded people who often rebelled against their masters. </p>

    <p>  Almost the most significant attraction is the Cathedral of St. Bavon.  It is named after one of the local landowners, who, during his lifetime, was canonized for the generous help of disadvantaged people and the ministry of the church.  In the architecture of the building, Romanesque and Gothic architecture intertwined with the Baroque style.  The main highlight of the cathedral was the altar image of the famous artist Jan van Eyck "Ghent Altar" dating from 1432. </p><p>  The bell tower (Belfort), which is a magnificent monument in the Gothic style that rises 90 meters, is one of the attractions that almost all tourists who come to Ghent want to see.  Belgium in the Middle Ages was part of the Duchy of Burgundy.  The building was built in 1425 to preserve the document, which Ghent was granted city status.  Later, important papers were also kept here, which was confirmed by the trade and tax privileges of local guilds.  In addition, from that time to the present day, the bell plays an important role in alerting residents to important events. </p><p>  Other interesting local monuments are the City Hall, which is decorated with Gothic sculptures and reliefs, as well as the Sint-Jorishof Palace, in which the marriage of Maximilian of Austria and Mary of Burgundy took place.  Mandatory visits are the streets of Grasse-Leu and Koren-Lei, which are the <span>most beautiful buildings of the</span> city.  The presence of many museums in Ghent should also be noted. </p>
