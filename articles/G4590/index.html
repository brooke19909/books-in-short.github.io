In this country, the cradle of our civilization, every corner is covered with legends and worthy of a visit, but perhaps there are no equal to Crete.  We invite you to this wonderful island in the city of Hersonissos, in Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 *.  Tourists who have been here characterize it only with the epithets ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, ‚Äúbetter than expected‚Äù, ‚Äúgreat‚Äù.  Such high marks are influenced primarily by sincere Greek hospitality, which allows each guest to feel welcome and dear.  What else attracts our compatriots to this hotel?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The southernmost island in terms of places where tourist services in Greece are developed is about.  Crete.  Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 * is one of its best three-star hotels, pleasing with low prices and high level of service.  It is located on the outskirts of Hersonissos - a city with a rich past and a vibrant multi-color present.  By the standards of the Russians, it is small, but in Greece there are completely different evaluation criteria for the size of settlements.  Hersonissos with its 30 thousand inhabitants is a large tourist center, therefore, the infrastructure here is appropriate.  The location on the outskirts, about three hundred meters from the nearest city street, is very convenient for those who come to Greece to have fun "to the fullest", because it will not be difficult to get to the city center, where the main entertainment centers are concentrated.  If necessary, you can also get a taxi, for which you have to pay no more than 5-7 euros.  On the other hand, the location on the outskirts is suitable for those who are looking for peace and quiet, and the hotel plans to relax from the hustle and bustle of the city. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990481.jpg" width="525"></div>

Here you can successfully shop, buying very cheap real olive oil, fruits, olives, exotic Greek products.  In addition, not far from the hotel there is also a small market where you can bargain and take these same goods even cheaper. </p><h2>  How to get to the hotel </h2><p>  There are two ways to get to Crete in Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 *.  If you purchased a tour at any Russian travel agency, most likely, they will organize an air flight to Heraklion, the capital of Crete.  Hersonissos is located 20 km east of it, but the hotel will need to be driven through the whole city, so the distance increases to 25 km.  At the airport, organized tourists, as a rule, are waiting for a modern transfer, which will take them to their place along a perfectly smooth asphalt road.  The journey will take no more than 20 minutes, but waiting for your suitcases at the airport can take up to an hour.  If you travel through beautiful Greece on your own, and if you follow Crete from Athens, it is better to get there by ferry.  This trip in itself will be an unforgettable adventure, plus, a ticket for a ship costs half as much as a plane.  Ferries arrive at the port of Heraklion or at the port of Agios Nicholas, a resort located 40 km from Hersonissos.  You can get to the city by regular bus or taxi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 Greece Hersonissos" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990447.jpg" width="527"></div>

In Greece, the ‚Äútroika,‚Äù and many of the ‚Äúfours,‚Äù have sinned with such a small flaw.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that here, especially on the islands, the terrain is mountainous, there are very few even shreds of land, which is why they are quite expensive.  Therefore, hotel owners, including Central Hersonissos, do not seek to arrange a walking park on their territory with alleys and benches on them or to impress guests with multi-level sun terraces.  What for?  After all, the sun is already abundant around!  Even for playgrounds, there is not enough space.  The maximum that can be seen on the territory of the hotel in question is emerald green lawns, a swimming pool with a relaxation area, a platform in front of the entrance to the building where a summer cafe is organized, and a small, unguarded but free parking.  All this, as a rule, is very clean and well-groomed, everything is buried in flowers growing on flower beds and in pots.  Again, for the Greek "triples" this is a classic, so you do not need to count on more. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  Central Hersonissos Hotel consists of two buildings, three and four floors.  Both are equipped with elevators.  There are no architectural excesses in the design of buildings - classic ‚Äúboxes‚Äù with light walls and spacious loggias-balconies.  The four-story building is considered the main one.  It has recently undergone major repairs, the rooms have changed furniture and plumbing, refreshed the interior.  The second case of innovation is waiting.  Perhaps they will be held this winter and next season, and the hotel starts functioning in May, everything will be different here.  In the current year 2017, the rooms in this building seemed tired to our tourists, and the furniture was old, although this did not affect its functionality. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990451.jpg" width="528"></div>

The staff speaks three languages ‚Äã‚Äãperfectly - Greek, English and German.  In Russian, only one person understands - Janis, with whom our tourists solve all their issues. </p><p>  At the reception they will always help to invite a doctor (if you suddenly need it), call a taxi, book a ticket (for example, by ferry), organize an excursion.  Here you can also rent a car or a bicycle, rent personal items for washing / dry cleaning, rent an iron, and use a photocopy / fax machine.  Kind-hearted Greeks even help deliver suitcases to your room if they see that tourists themselves can‚Äôt do it.  In addition, at the reception you can order breakfast or early wake up in your room. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Since the Central Hersonissos Hotel is three-star, there is no diverse infrastructure.  On the ground floor of the main building there is a spacious hall, very bright, shining with white marble tiles.  It has sofas and armchairs, air conditioning.  It is always pleasant here to relax from the summer heat and talk about the island and about life with the talkative Janis. </p><p>  Another advantage of the lobby is the bar and excellent free Wi-Fi.  Also on the ground floor there is a place for playing billiards and a large flat-screen TV.  There are no saunas, a gym, sports grounds or a conference room in the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 Hkrsonissos" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990464.jpg" width="526"></div>

    <h2>  Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 * (Crete, Greece): rooms </h2><p>  Just want to warn that in this hotel all the rooms, and there are 62 units, have the category "Standard".  They differ only in size and type of beds installed in them (one and a half or double).  Based on this number are divided into double and triple.  Each has the ability to accommodate one crib.  In the season when there is an influx of people in Crete, and in all hotels (including Central Hersonissos) a full house, it is common practice to add one more full-sized one-and-a-half bed (if the area allows) or a folding bed.  So if you are coming here in a large company, you will always find a corner where to stay.  The design of all rooms is simple: on the floor - tiles, on the walls - paintings of local painters, the windows are light, but still save curtains from the sun.  Of the free equipment there are necessary furniture, a TV, a telephone for communication with reception staff and a refrigerator.  Safe and air conditioning are paid.  Bathrooms are installed in the hygiene rooms of the main building, and showers are installed in the second building.  Of hygiene products, only liquid soap is offered. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The infrastructure of the Central Hersonissos Hotel has a restaurant, which our tourists have given the status of "cafe" or "buffet", as well as a bar.  Tours to this Greek hotel are offered with the ‚ÄúBB‚Äù or ‚ÄúBH‚Äù catering system, which means ‚Äúbreakfast and dinner‚Äù.  Tourists consider the best option to take vouchers only with breakfast, because it is better to have lunch in one of the dozens of Cretan restaurants, where there is always a large selection of dishes, and even have dinner somewhere in the city, because in the evenings there is organized in almost every cafe or restaurant performances by musicians or another entertainment program. </p><p>  Breakfast at the hotel is self-catering.  The menu always has cereal, granola, milk, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãsausages and cheeses, eggs, sausages, french fries, pancakes or crepes, fruits, muffins and other desserts, juice, coffee, tea, water.  At other times, drinks need to be bought. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel reviews" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990467.jpg" width="526"></div>

    <p>  Who decides and have dinner at the Central Hersonissos Hotel, also does not fail.  The cook here is excellent, it cooks excellently.  The menu has a lot of classic Greek dishes: paidaki (lamb ribs), shuvlaki (small skewers on wooden skewers), gemista (stuffed tomatoes, peppers, zucchini), moussaka, Croatian salad and dozens of other tasty and healthy dishes. </p><p>  A nice feature of the hotel is that its bar and restaurant do not serve diluted alcoholic beverages.  It offers Greek wines, ouzo, beer, crayfish.  You can also buy imported drinks that are more familiar to us. </p><h2>  Services for children </h2><p>  In Greece, they love children very much, but, unfortunately, they are rarely provided for them in three-star hotels.  So, in Central Hersonissos Hotel in Crete, you can only rely on a crib in the room and some products in the restaurant menu (for example, milk).  There is nothing more for the kids here, not even the children's section in the pool.  Those who come to rest with children can be advised to buy baby food in a nearby supermarket, and the hotel will always help you with boiling water or warm milk. </p><h2>  Leisure for adults </h2><p>  It is difficult to be bored and sad if you come to Greece, to Hersonissos.  In Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 * for entertainment, there is only a pool table (for a fee) and a medium-sized pool.  Around him you can always find a free sunbed and umbrella (by the way, they are clean and whole).  That‚Äôs probably all.  But dozens of unique places await you outside the hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 Greece o Crete" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990483.jpg"></div>  Ideally, if you decide to rent a car (price - from 40 to 50 euros per day, your gasoline).  Then you can independently travel the whole island, see a lot of interesting things, choose a quiet, cozy, and most importantly, sandy beach, where you will be alone or in company with no more than a few people.  If you can‚Äôt take a car, you can make some walks.  So, tourists speak well of the three villages located just above Hersonissos.  It is surprisingly beautiful and calm, there are many cozy cafes with a homely pleasant atmosphere, delicious food and huge portions.  You can also go to Hersonissos, visit its aquarium, museum, take a look at the performances of folk dance and music groups.  By bus you can go to Heraklion, Malia, Agios Nicholas (that's what the Greeks say), visit the cave of Zeus, the labyrinth of the Minotaur, the central park where peacocks walk along the paths, and the Valley of the Butterflies.  There are excursions to all these places that are ideal for those who are not used to organizing their trips on their own.

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Despite the rich past of Greece and its beauty, many tourists just for the sake of the sea go to rest in this country.  About the beach near Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 * reviews of our compatriots are mixed.  They call the advantages of its location from the hotel just 200 meters, the cleanest sea, where at a depth of even 10 meters you can calmly view the bottom and its inhabitants, excellent weather, which means gentle sun, gentle wind, low waves.  The disadvantages of the beach for vacationers are as follows: </p><p>  - it is municipal (like almost everything in Greece), so sun loungers and umbrellas are paid here; </p><p>  - poor entry into the sea (slippery stones underfoot); </p><p>  - small in area (made by paid sunbeds, it is very difficult to find a place to spread your free towel); </p><p>  - cool water even in June. </p><p>  Regarding the last point, it should be noted that Hersonissos is located on the northern tip of the island and not in the bay, where the water could be warmed up well, but simply on the seashore with running water.  For this reason, it only gets warm by July. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Central Hersonissos Hotel 3 Crete" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1990445.jpg" width="524"></div>
