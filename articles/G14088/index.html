    <p>  Useful information can be obtained by reading reviews of people who have already managed to visit a particular place.  So what do tourists say about the Centra Coconut Beach Resort Samui 4 * hotel?  Reviews are for the most part positive.  It is really beautiful here - a large clean area, uncomplicated design, a picturesque grove of <span>coconut trees</span> and, of course, a warm sea. </p><p>  The rooms are also spacious, always cleaned - maids change towels every day.  Household appliances are working, there is water constantly.  Convenient and the presence of a separate shower.  The food is quite varied, and the dishes are fresh.  The disadvantage of the hotel, unfortunately, is the sea, since there are a lot of algae near the shore.  True, the hotel administration is already taking steps to clear the coast. </p><p>  Some tourists note that the Centra Coconut Beach Samui is located at some distance.  Therefore, the hotel is unlikely to suit lovers of noisy entertainment and night parties.  On the other hand, there is a car, motorbike and scooter rental service nearby.  The presence of transport greatly facilitates movement in the vicinity.  The city center can also be reached by bus, which runs regularly. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the hotel is not too suitable for children to relax.  Of course, the child will be pleased to swim in the warm sea, and in the city there are many entertainments, but, unfortunately, there are no children‚Äôs animation and attractions in the resort complex itself. </p><p>  In general, the hotel leaves behind a positive pleasant experience and is perfect for lovers of a relaxing holiday surrounded by nature, especially considering the relatively low cost of living in a hotel. </p>
