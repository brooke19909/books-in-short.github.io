    <h2>  Description of the village </h2><p>  It got its name from the Darasunka River, on the coast of which it is located.  Translated from Buryat into Russian, this word means "red water", and this is completely true.  The fact is that when standing for a long time, the water acquires the corresponding color due to the considerable iron content. </p><p>  Darasun resort is located in the low-mountain zone, at an altitude of 750 meters above sea level, 132 kilometers from Chita.  The mountains surrounding it are covered with forests (birch, pine and larch). </p><p>  The local climate is sharply continental.  On average in summer, the air temperature is +15 ¬∞ C.  Winter is long, there is little snow, but it can be very cold.  During this period, the temperature drops to -22 ¬∞ C. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="resort Darasun Transbaikalia" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1354813.jpg" width="557"></div>
