    <p>  The principle of operation of most systems designed for urban housing is similar to complexes for private houses.  Moreover, there are a number of differences that determine the advantages and disadvantages of such protection.  As a rule, a security alarm system is installed in an apartment based on GSM technology, that is, with the expectation of fixing an intruder's intrusion through the door and window.  Accordingly, a certain number of sensors should be provided that can fully cover all openings.  A common problem when implementing such systems in apartments is cramped space and interference from household equipment.  In such conditions, the sensors can be triggered by the air flow from the air conditioner, the movement of animals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After detecting signs of an uninvited guest in the apartment, the system sends a corresponding message to the owner.  If an alarm is set in an apartment outside the private, then, as a rule, the notification of the owner and the response of the device is limited.  It is also possible to send a signal to the center of a specialized security company, but this approach is more common when protecting private houses. </p><h2>  Standalone alarms </h2><p>  This type of GSM alarm system has significantly limited functionality, but there are a number of advantages.  The fact is that such complexes are able to work regardless of the main energy supply.  If the attacker decides to disrupt the power supply of the house with electricity, the alarm in the apartment will not stop its function.  Autonomy is provided by its own batteries, which are able to maintain the health of security systems for several months. </p>

    <p>  As for the shortcomings of models of this type, they are directly related to the need to minimize energy consumption.  Just in order to ensure continuous battery life, manufacturers are reducing the capabilities of the modules.  For example, interaction with the central console, feedback, and also combination with other devices are excluded.  At the same time, the alarm systems of apartments with autonomous operation allow the use of the sensors provided in the kit, and also have a radio module in the design for control. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wireless alarms </h2>

    <p>  The classic implementation scheme for connecting sensors to the main unit provides for the organization of a wired network.  However, this installation method has several significant flaws - for example, the visibility of communications for an attacker.  In addition <span>, the installation of a</span> burglar alarm in an apartment using a cable connection involves the implementation of additional installation operations.  For this reason, wireless systems are becoming more and more popular, in which the interaction between the components of the security complex is implemented via radio channels.  In terms of functionality, such models are practically not inferior to wired ones - the same two-way communication capabilities, notification of the owner about threats, connection to other devices. </p><p>  But in this case, some cons are expected.  In particular, it is not possible to directly send a signal to a departmental control panel.  Many users are concerned about the possibility of third-party signal suppression.  But if the installation of an alarm in an apartment is carried out using anti-jammers, then such threats can not be afraid. </p><h2>  Alarm with connection to the control panel </h2><p>  As mentioned above, for apartments, systems are rarely selected that allow you to immediately notify the owner and special security teams.  But this issue is, rather, not technical, but tactical, and everyone decides it based on their own conditions of housing operation.  If cooperation with security companies is supposed, the system should definitely support the ability to connect to the central console.  Similar apartment alarm systems usually have wider functionality, are equipped with several <span>communication channels</span> and allow you to send messages to several recipients.  But the cost of such complexes significantly exceeds solutions for non-departmental signaling. </p><h2>  Alarm sensors </h2>

    <p>  Before the system begins to send danger signals, reacting devices must be activated - that is, sensors.  A lot depends on the choice and installation of sensors.  In the latest sets, manufacturers provide several dozen sensors with different operating principles.  In addition, the alarm system in the apartment can also perform indirect functions for detecting smoke, gas leaks, etc. To date, the most effective means of protection include infrared, magnetic, ultrasonic, and microwave sensors.  It is for the apartment that it is advisable to use motion detectors that are installed in the entrance area, as well as devices that allow you to fix glass damage - respectively, they are mounted on the windows. </p><p>  The main problem with using sensors is the likelihood of a fake call.  It has already been mentioned that the GSM-alarm system in the apartment can be triggered by animals and other equipment.  To exclude such a probability, it is recommended to mount different sensors, while performing settings taking into account the complex activity of the detectors. </p><h2>  Installation of equipment </h2>

    <p>  The key to a quality installation is an initially correctly designed system.  The installation plan takes into account the location of the main unit, sensors, and auxiliary safety equipment.  A typical installation of a security alarm system in an apartment assumes that the control panel will be mounted to the wall, and the detectors will be dispersed along the most vulnerable penetration zones.  On the doors are usually mounted opening sensors, which allow you to record the entry of third parties.  In the places of passage, additional <span>motion sensors</span> can be provided <span>,</span> and windows should be provided with devices to control the integrity of the glasses. </p><p>  The interaction between the sensors and the main control panel depends on the type of system.  The most time-consuming installation of an alarm in an apartment is done through a cable connection.  In this case, it is desirable to implement the wiring in an underground or ceiling niche, the main thing is to ensure minimal cable visibility. </p><h2>  Connection and setup </h2>

    <p>  At this stage, the panel is connected to a power source.  Again, if you are using an <span>autonomous system,</span> just make sure the battery is fully charged.  In other cases, it is necessary to carry out an electrical connection.  Typically, kits include a complete set of elements with which to connect the alarm in the apartment, as well as fixing the wiring.  As for the settings, it depends on the functionality of the system.  The basic performance of the equipment requires only the compilation of a list of contacts and the installation of the complex in working condition.  The most convenient in this regard are devices connected to a computer.  Using a special program, the user forms contacts and selects the optimal alarm mode. </p><h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  In a standard set of alarm systems, apartments can cost an average of 7 to 10 thousand rubles.  This is the optimal format for a set of several sensors and a control panel, which allows for the protection of an acceptable level.  If an inexpensive option is required, then you should turn to stand-alone wired systems.  This is a very effective alarm system in an apartment, the price of which can fit in 5 thousand rubles.  For multi-level protection of an apartment with a large area, it is desirable to provide a wireless type system, which also has the ability to connect to a departmental security console.  This option can cost 20-25 thousand rubles.  The most popular products today are Kenwei, Legrand, Express GSM. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  A modern apartment is a platform in which dozens of electrical appliances and devices can be concentrated.  Therefore, the alarm system in the apartment should occupy an optimal place in terms of convenience, the conditions of which, however, should not reduce the effectiveness of the security function.  In addition, technologies allow combining such systems with household appliances, ensuring the safety of a different property - from fires and leaks.  Initially, the response of the device to the fact of penetration should also be provided.  At a minimum, an alarm should alert the owner of the threat, and even better, automatically call an emergency team. </p>
