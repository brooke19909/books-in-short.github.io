    <h2>  Bella Elena: reviews </h2><p>  The vast majority of Russians were satisfied with their stay at this hotel.  Judging by the reviews, Bella Elena has quite spacious modern rooms with all the necessary filling.  The hotel itself is small.  Holidays here are suitable for all categories of tourists, from the elderly to the youth who can have fun in the center of Malia. </p><p>  The Russians left a lot of positive feedback about the staff.  The friendly atmosphere, the willingness of workers to help in everything, appealed to everyone.  This hotel has a lot of advantages - excellent territory, delicious food, etc. But there is one big minus - remoteness from the beach, so our compatriots advise to think before choosing a few times.  In turn, it is very convenient for young people to get to the sea on free bikes. </p>
