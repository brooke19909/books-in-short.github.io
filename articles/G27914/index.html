  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to spend your holidays in Europe without compromising the budget</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year, most people face the question: where to go to relax?  The friendly <span>Arab countries</span> with the all-inclusive service are already bored, and the Russian service is still not up to world standards.  There is only one conclusion: you need to choose a vacation in Europe!  It will be interesting to supporters of outdoor activities, and lovers of nightlife, and people who prefer winter vacations, and, of course, to all lovers of history, architectural monuments and attractions. </p><p>  The tourist is not an easy task to organize their own trip.  He needs to decide: a vacation in Europe will take place in one country or it will be a sightseeing tour.  For those who want to see several countries in 10 days and get acquainted with their main attractions, a bus tour that goes through cities such as Paris, Berlin, Prague, etc. is suitable. For details about which cities will be included in the tour, please check with the tour operator .  For the rest of the tourists it is necessary to determine the purpose of their trip and choose the appropriate direction.  If a traveler is fond of history, the Middle Ages, castles, then he just needs to visit France with its unforgettable <span>castles of the Loire,</span> buildings that are more than 500 years old, provinces where <span>medieval culture</span> has been preserved <span>.</span>  Lovers of <span>beach holidays</span> will suit the south of Italy, Sicily with its cleanest sandy beaches on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  Many people prefer to rest in Europe to other Arab countries and Africa because of the quick flight and a slight change in time zones, which allows the body to pass acclimatization almost imperceptibly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All those who live a nightlife and can not imagine a quality vacation without DJ sets and a dance mood are looking forward to the Spanish Ibiza, where the annual festival of electronic music takes place.  They say about this island that he never sleeps.  In Ibiza everything was mixed up: day, night, people, institutions.  Clubs work around the clock, and for those who do not want to spend time in a stuffy room, beach parties are constantly held.  Ibiza is an island of ongoing celebration! </p><p>  For many, a vacation in Europe can be too expensive, because its prices are much higher than usual destinations.  To solve this problem, you can take the opportunity to spend a vacation by buying a burning tour.  In this case, the traveler does not have time to think, and he flies out within a few days from the moment the tour is paid.  So where do the last-minute packages to Europe come from and what do you need to know so that your vacation does not turn into a test?  First you need to choose a reliable tour operator who has long established itself in the market of travel services as a responsible executor.  This will protect the traveler from fraud scammers. </p><p>  In fact, last-minute tours to Europe are vouchers that were refused at the last moment or places in a group that was never fully staffed.  Due to the fact that the seats are empty, the travel agency suffers losses.  Therefore, it decides to sell such tours at a price without agency fees, in order to at least justify its costs.  Last minute offers appear about a couple of days before the departure date.  Here, the client cannot choose any specific services or hotel room, because he pays for a fully formed set of travel services, which for some reason remained unclaimed.  In order for a vacation on a last-minute holiday trip to be successful, you need to prepare in advance for it, that is, decide on the departure date, have all the necessary documents and just pick up options that match the request.  It is possible to get to know Europe without real financial resources, just for this you need to show maximum attention to the details of the trip and act promptly. </p>
