  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rating of Russian insurance companies: company overview, working conditions, customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The economic situation prevailing on the current date in Russia requires organizations and citizens to take care of the safety of their property.  Consider the largest insurance companies in Russia, the rating, as well as the benefits that they provide. </p><h2>  Reliability criteria </h2><p>  The structure of the insurance portfolio of the company, its financial condition - these are two main factors.  They determine solvency.  <span>The rating of insurance companies in</span> Russia is built on the same principle - each organization is assigned a number on a reliability scale.  For instance: </p><ol><li>  A ++ - a high level of reliability.  This means that insurance pays for obligations in full, even with market fluctuations.  There are varieties of A-ratings - AA, AAA - this indicates stability at the international level. </li><li>  B ++ is an average level of reliability.  In this case, the company makes guaranteed payments only provided that the market is stable at the maturity date of the obligation. </li><li>  C ++ is a low level at which the insurance organization cannot fulfill even its current obligations. </li><li>  E - license revocation. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="blog.erstebank.me" data-author=": Tatjana Kekoviƒá, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance Advice" class="if uuid-3233043" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233043.jpg"></div><h2>  Largest in the market </h2><p>  The rating of Russian insurance companies is as follows: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  SOGAZ.  The insurance group has been operating in Russia since 1993.  Leading international experts have confirmed the high reliability and solvency of this company. </li><li>  SPAO Ingosstrakh.  This company has existed on the market since 1947. Initially, the insurance company was part of the USSR Ministry of Finance, later it acquired the status of an independent legal entity.  Refers to systemically important insurance organizations - participates in the control of the insurance market and carries out operations in the international financial market. </li><li>  "VTB-Insurance" - a large insurance company operating since 2000, the existing name in use since 2008.  It is part of the All-Russian Union of Insurers, has a rating of A ++. </li><li>  Sberbank Insurance, a subsidiary of Sberbank, has been operating in the market since 2014.  The reliability of the company is evaluated by international agencies at the level of AA +; in forecasts of further development, they are classified as financially favorable. </li><li>  AlfaStrakhovanie, an authoritative publication of Forbes, estimates this company as the largest on the market in Russia.  Founded in 1992, is a member of the Alfa Group Consortium. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="bukisa.com" data-author=": JESSICA AGUERO, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Discussion of the terms of a life insurance contract" class="if uuid-3233044" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233044.jpg"></div><p>  The rating of insurance companies in Russia may vary depending on the size of the financial portfolio and the universality of the services provided.  When deciding on the choice of an organization, it is better to familiarize yourself with the current tariffs and conditions provided by each of them in advance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tariff spread </h2><p>  The rating of the largest insurance companies in Russia contains a list of names of organizations whose price range for services may vary up to 20%.  This is due to the fact that there is an approved tariff corridor within which a company can set tariffs. </p><p>  Regardless of the status of the company, it is important to remember that you can refuse the additional services that the manager proposes to include in the policy. </p><p>  Study of information about the duration of the company in the Russian market will help determine the choice of insurance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bahamascommercialrealty.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Favorable insurance conditions" class="if uuid-3233040" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233040.jpg"></div><h2>  Favorable CTP conditions </h2><p>  Before proceeding to the analysis of the rating of Russian insurance companies on civil liability, it should be noted that the basic rates for compulsory motor liability insurance have risen since January 9 of this year.  This is important to consider!  More precisely, the corridor within which insurers can set tariffs has changed.  Practice shows that within the price corridor insurance organizations are guided by the upper limit.  For cars, the price range will range from 3432 to 4118 rubles. </p><p>  The rating of Russian insurance companies in which OSAGO is provided on favorable terms will be considered further. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  No. 1.  "RESO-guarantee" </h2><p>  A stable Russian company offers non-alternative compensation for damage caused to a vehicle.  The convenience is that in the event of an insurance event, you will need to contact your insurance company.  On the day of the accident, an independent examination is carried out, an examination of internal damage is scheduled for several days. </p><p>  Customer reviews confirm that RESO-Garantia makes payments on time and in the declared volume.  Motorists warn that it is necessary to contact the company‚Äôs office, do not respond to statements by lawyers who invariably catch the client‚Äôs hand near the insurance office and offer intermediary services.  Such "lawyers" most often have nothing to do with insurance, in addition, company managers draw up all the necessary documents quickly and efficiently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="business.lesechos.fr" data-author=": shutterstock.com, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance transaction" class="if uuid-3233042" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233042.jpg"></div><h2>  No. 2.  SPAO Ingosstrakh </h2><p>  You can issue a policy in your account on the company's official website, as well as extend the existing one - everything is done for the convenience of customers. </p><p>  Clients of this organization who have repeatedly encountered a situation where compensation for damage caused to the car is required recommends compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, but does not recommend comprehensive insurance, and this is why: in the case of third-party liability insurance, payments are made to a bank card in a short time.  Naturally, this happens on the condition that the client contacted the insurance on time and provided a full package of documents.  On the network you can find a positive response from an elderly client who said that he brought Europrotocol with corrections, as he suffers from myopia and had difficulty filling out papers.  The protocol was accepted, and the amount of payment exceeded even the value expected by the applicant. </p><p>  However, many had problems with comprehensive insurance - for example, there was damage to the windshield.  In the car service, only glass was replaced, and the gum of the seal remained the same, respectively, it broke down during movement.  The representative of the repair organization argued objectively to the client that only glass was listed in the direction from Ingosstrakh.  To avoid such unpleasant moments, you need to carefully study the terms of the Casco agreement. </p><h2>  No. 3.  VSK Insurance House </h2><p>  Registration of the policy is possible both in the office of the company, and online.  The site interface is convenient and allows you to go through all the tabs quickly and without comment.  The only drawback noted in the reviews of customers of the insurance home is the inability to issue an insurance policy online until at least one additional option is selected (which, of course, is paid in excess of the cost of the policy). </p><p>  When making insurance, it is important to immediately decide whether the payment will be made in monetary terms or the policyholder will receive a referral to repair his car.  Moreover, if the client agrees to a monetary refund, then it is immediately stipulated that he will not have any claims to the amount of payment. </p><p>  Accordingly, if the repair of the vehicle, the conditions of which will be indicated in the direction from the insurer, does not allow to eliminate all the damage, then the car service will make the difference to the car owner. </p><h2>  Life insurance - an investment in the future </h2><p>  The rating of life insurance companies in Russia is opened by Sberbank-Insurance, in the second place is Renaissance Life, and in third place is Alfa Insurance Life.  The fourth and fifth are occupied by Rosgosstrakh Life and Vita Consent, respectively. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aier.org" data-author=": Brian C. Albrecht, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Acquaintance with the insurance contract" class="if uuid-3233045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233045.jpg"></div><p>  Endowment life insurance is becoming increasingly popular in the Russian market.  And demand, as you know, creates supply.  The rating list of insurance companies in Russia presents several of them to choose from.  Which is very convenient.  In fact, the conditions of life insurance in all organizations are approximately the same.  Most often, NSWs are issued at banks - at the suggestion of a manager-consultant.  Customer reviews come down to the fact that this type of insurance requires careful study.  People who agreed to sign the agreement when drawing up a bank card subsequently regretted their decision. </p><p>  HOA is a long-term investment, therefore it is especially important to understand all the nuances of such a transaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loucruz.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Life and health insurance" class="if uuid-3233047" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233047.jpg"></div><h2>  Central Bank Rating </h2><p>  Insurance organizations are ranked not only by the size of the insurance portfolio and ability to cover current liabilities, but also by the amount of the size of the insurance premium received from customers.  This is the sum of all payments that policyholders have made to the company account for the reporting period. </p><p>  Now let's move on to the most interesting.  The rating of insurance companies of the Bank of Russia is headed by Sberbank Life Insurance.  Next are SOGAZ and Alfa Insurance, VTB Insurance and RESO-Garantia. </p><h2>  Foreign companies </h2><p>  When choosing an organization for long-term investment, many people opt for those with foreign capital.  The list of international insurance companies in Russia, whose financial reliability rating is rated as high, is presented below: </p><ul><li>  Allianz, Germany; </li><li>  Zurich Financial Services, based in Switzerland; </li><li>  Aviva, Britain; </li><li>  AXA Group, France; </li><li>  China Life Insurance, China. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="blogs.mazars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pros and Cons of Foreign Insurance Companies" class="if uuid-3233046" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/101713/3233046.jpg"></div><p>  Reliability of foreign insurers has a downside - double taxation and minimal risk coverage.  Make an informed decision when choosing an insurance company, independently studying the conditions for concluding a contract. </p>
