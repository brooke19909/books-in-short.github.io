In history, he is often called the "last knight" for those qualities that he possessed or which it was customary to ascribe to him.  He lived in a cruel age, and it can hardly be reproached with those acts whose descriptions make the modern man shudder. </p>

    <h2>  The son and heir of Philip the Good </h2><p>  Karl got a very good heredity.  His father Philip the Good, despite the fact that he spoiled his reputation by betraying the British to Joan of Arc, managed to give Burgundy power, thanks to which she gained high authority in Europe.  The development of art was encouraged at the ducal court, and the ruler himself was an ardent supporter of the knighthood code and founder of the Order of the Golden Fleece, which has survived to this day. </p><p>  Philip's favorite pastime was <span>jousting</span> and minnesinger competitions.  It is quite clear that heir born on November 10, 1433, who was named Karl, he tried to instill the features inherent in a real knight.  Philip‚Äôs work was not in vain, and his son completely inherited his love for fights, hunting and military campaigns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Youth of the future Duke of Burgundy </h2><p>  Guided by political considerations, the father hastened to betroth his son to Katarina, daughter of the French king <span>Charles VII,</span> and so that someone would not intercept the vacant bride, he did this when the heir was barely five years old.  By the way, the happy chosen one was only four years older than her fianc√©.  Subsequently, Karl was married twice more - to the Frenchwoman Isabella de Bourbon and the Englishwoman Margaret of York.  Both were royal blood. </p>

    <p>  In early youth, Karl Smely met and even made friends with his future sworn enemy - the heir to the French throne, Louis, when he was hiding from the wrath of his father in the Duchy of Burgundy.  Almost the same age, they were strikingly different from each other.  Karl Smely - ‚Äúthe last knight‚Äù - was a tall and strong young man, ready with a sword in his hands to prove his innocence.  Louis, short and thin, with small stature was distinguished by cunning and treachery. </p><h2>  Military campaign against a former friend </h2><p>  Their friendship came to an end when on July 22, 1461, Louis succeeded his father on the throne, becoming <span>king of France</span> Louis XI.  From the first days of his reign, he pursued a policy of joining the kingdom of lands belonging to his feudal lords.  This caused their extreme discontent, as a result of which the sovereign barons and dukes united against their overlord, concluding an agreement called the League of General Good.  Karl Smely joined this alliance, forced to enter into conflict with the new king over the county of Charolais, which they both claimed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Very soon, the political confrontation escalated into a military clash.  By this time, Philip Good died, and Karl inherited not only the vast possessions of his father, but also the title of Duke of Burgundy.  Now at the head of the army assembled by the League of General Good, he had the full opportunity to show off his courage and courage. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of bloodshed </h2><p>  Karl the Brave won his first brilliant victory in 1465, completely defeating the army of his former friend at the Battle of Montlery.  This forced the king to abandon claims to the disputed county of Charolais.  Encouraged by the success, the duke rushed to new exploits.  He recalled that a couple of years ago in the city under his control Li√®ge there was a riot caused by prohibitive taxes.  But the worst thing is that a rumor was spread among the rebels that he - Karl the Brave, the Duke of Burgundy - was not born at all from Philip the Good, his official father, but from the local bishop with whom his mother, the Duchess Isabella, retired for confession. </p><p>  The true knight, namely, Karl considered himself that way, could not forgive the insult inflicted on the lady, especially the mother.  He acted in the spirit of his time - the cruel and dark Middle Ages.  Capturing Li√®ge, whose inhabitants did not even try to resist, he destroyed them all, including women and children.  Proudly raising his head, Karl left the smoking ruins of a flourishing city yesterday.  He visited in a similar manner several more areas of his duchy. </p><h2>  On the eve of the Burgundy Wars </h2><p>  Having finally established himself in the consciousness of his own greatness, Karl wished to make Burgundy a kingdom subject to him, and in this case himself to receive a crown from the hands of the Pope.  But so ambitious plans of the duke were not destined to materialize.  Both the emperor of the Great Roman Empire and the king of France opposed this.  Neither one nor the other was unprofitable strengthening of Burgundy. </p><p>  The goals of Karl the Bold and Louis 11 were one - the maximum concentration of power in their hands, but they sought to achieve it in different ways.  If the Burgundian relied on brute force in everything, then the king acted by cunning and intrigue, in which he was an unsurpassed master.  To destroy his opponent, he managed to drag him into a series of military adventures, later called the Burgundian Wars. </p>

    <h2>  Impoverishment of the country </h2><p>  Under his influence, Charles the Bold attempted to annex Alsace and Lorraine to his possessions.  The beginning was encouraging, but then Louis XI, through secret negotiations, managed to militate against him almost half of Europe.  Hopelessly bogged down in campaigns, the duke completely transferred the life of Burgundy to war footing.  Since the maintenance of the army completely devastated the treasury, all amusements were canceled.  Competitions of poets and musicians are gone, and crafts not related to military affairs are simply abolished.  The former wealth turned into hunger and poverty. </p><h2>  Defeat at Granson </h2><p>  The experience of history shows that no matter how great ambitions are, no single ruler alone can resist the coalition of developed countries.  Karl the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, was no exception.  If he somehow managed with the Germans and French, then the best <span>army of Switzerland</span> at that time was too tough for him. </p><p>  He suffered his first crushing defeat in 1476 at the Battle of Granson.  Shortly before this, the Duke Karl the Brave captured the city, taking advantage of the betrayal of one of his defenders.  With the garrison captured, he did as he was accustomed to do - some of the soldiers hung, and drowned others in Lake Neuch√¢tel. </p>

    <p>  The Swiss, in a hurry to help, it became completely clear what awaits them in case of defeat.  Neither of them wanted to drown or hang, so, inspired, they defeated the Burgundians.  Karl Smely - the ruler of Burgundy - barely escaped, leaving the enemy at the time with his advanced artillery and a magnificent camp full of treasures looted during the campaign. </p><h2>  Another failure </h2><p>  However, this rout did not diminish the commander's agility and arrogance.  The next rake on which he was to step, waited for the duke near the city of Murten.  Here Carl received an even more crushing defeat from the Swiss.  From the documents of that era it is known that he had the opportunity, using the mediation of a third party, to make peace and, albeit pretty battered, but alive, to return to his native Burgundy.  However, furious with military failures, he missed this saving chance and thereby signed a death sentence.  The fact is that the ambitious goals of Karl the Bold were not comparable with the potential that he possessed. </p><h2>  The tragic end of the Burgundian ruler </h2><p>  At the end of that year, at the head of the newly formed army, he approached the city of Nancy.  The defenders showed enviable tenacity, and the siege dragged on.  Despite the fact that due to the low temperature, many of his soldiers received frostbite and could not continue to fight, Karl refused to retreat, hoping that hunger would force the besieged to surrender.  At this time, a large army, consisting of Alsatians, Austrians, Germans and French, came to the aid of the city. </p><p>  January 5, 1477 became fatal for the army of Karl the Bold.  Unable to confront an enemy superior in numbers, it was completely destroyed.  The commander himself died in battle.  A few days later, his body, mutilated by wounds and stripped by looters, was found in a nearby river.  His severed face was so unrecognizable that only the personal doctor could recognize the duke by his old scars. </p>

    <h2>  The disappointing outcome of Karl‚Äôs reign </h2><p>  The death of Karl the Bold ended an entire era in the history of Burgundy.  Deprived of a male heir, it was soon divided between the Habsburgs and the French crown.  The importance of the duchy as an independent European state has irrevocably gone.  The restless ruler Karl Smely, whose biography is an uninterrupted series of wars and campaigns, also became history.  This is not surprising, because all his life he has been hostage to his own ambitions. </p><h2>  Fearless warrior and bad politician </h2><p>  The characterization of Karl the Bold given to him by researchers is rather contradictory.  It is undeniable that he directed all his forces to ensure that the Burgundy subject to him, by joining the conquered lands to it, acquired even greater greatness.  However, the result of such a militaristic policy was the ruin of the duchy and general impoverishment.  Brought up at the court of his father, Philip the Good, Karl professed the principles of knightly honor, but, in accordance with the traditions of his time, put to death the innocent inhabitants of the captured cities. </p>

    <p>  The question arises: why was Karl the Bold called the "last knight"?  Probably the answer lies in the fact that he was one of those who considered political games and intrigues shameful and unworthy, preferring to solve all issues in open battle, as befits a true knight.  Undoubtedly, this approach will give nobility to any private person, but for the head of state it is unacceptable.  The leadership of the country is inseparable from big politics, and in this its head must be a professional. </p>
