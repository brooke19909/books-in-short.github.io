Ideas and Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Summer holidays are the most carefree and happiest time for our children.  Therefore, I do not want to carry it out in the city.  Family trips to the cottage - this is a great option for a summer pastime.  But for the rest to work out, the little family members need their own <span>children's corner</span> in the country.  Do it yourself is very easy.  They will be able to spend time in the fresh air, they will have something to do, small physical activity will also benefit.  In general, from the arrangement of a <span>playground in the country, there</span> are some pluses.  Where to start? </p><h2>  Basic requirements for the playground </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY corner in the country" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/403871.jpg" width="300"></div></h2><p>  First of all, you need to take care of a convenient place in order to equip a children's corner in the country with your own hands.  It is best if this place is close to the house or a recreation area for adults, so that it is convenient for you to watch the children without leaving them unattended. </p><p>  For safety and comfort, arranging a children's corner in the country, it is necessary to observe a number of other rules.  This is the location of the site in a place as far as possible from objects that pose a danger to a small child.  Wells, an electric cable, a pond, a place for storing tools, prickly plantings - all this should be located as far as possible from the playground.  If this is not possible, then it is necessary to take measures to protect the place for childish entertainment with the help of a grill, mesh or openwork fence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another important point - at least 30-40% of the future playground for children should be in the shade.  If there are natural green spaces (shrubs, trees) and they create the necessary shade, then this is very good.  And in case of their absence, you will need to take care of the construction of a canopy or gazebo.  A completely shaded and damp place is definitely not suitable for the construction of a children's territory. </p><h2>  Children's corner in the country.  Choice of coating and equipment </h2><p>  To make your kids comfortable and comfortable on the playground, you need to take care of its quality coverage.  After all, when there is a smooth and safe surface under your feet, especially for children, then you will be calmer and it‚Äôs more convenient for the kids.  The best coatings that can be used on the playground are the following options: </p><ul><li>  lawn grass (wear resistant); </li><li>  cut bark; </li><li>  rubber crumb, or rather mats made from it. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Children's corner in the country" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/403870.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Choosing equipment for a children's corner </h2><p>  Having decided on the coverage, you can proceed to the selection of everything that the site will be equipped with.  Depending on the interest of your children, financial opportunities, free territory on the site, the age category of kids, you can choose a different set of children's attractions.  Evaluate your capabilities and begin to equip a children's corner in the country.  The photos shown as an example will help you with this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Examples of playground equipment </h2><p>  Here are a few popular options for children‚Äôs corners: </p><ul><li>  In the event that there is not much space on the site, there is a slide, a swing, a sandbox and a cozy house. </li><li>  If the playground is medium in size, you can equip it with sports equipment.  This category includes stairs, various sports equipment, horizontal bars and the like.  A ready-made children's sports corner for factory-made summer cottages is an excellent solution. </li><li>  With unlimited area - a large sports and gaming complex, which combines various elements of both a sporting nature and gaming. </li></ul><p>  When choosing one or another option of equipment for a playground, pay attention to the availability of free space.  It is necessary in front of ladders, slides and swings.  If you purchase a ready-made game complex for a children's corner, then in this case you can save space, since they are more compact than equipment purchased randomly. </p><h2>  Homemade designs on the playground </h2><p>  Some designs on the playground can be made with your own hands.  If you do not have the necessary skills to complete this task, then do not engage in the construction of complex and large-sized structures.  In the absence of experience, it will be very difficult for you to ensure the reliability and safety of homemade equipment.  But if you are a true master, then it will not be difficult for you to make a children's corner in the country with your own hands. </p>

The use of inflatable toys will not only add brightness to the playground, but also diversify it.  Such designs as a trampoline, a house and a pool are loved by all children, without exception.

    <p>  In order to make a playground on your own, you can use everything that is at hand.  For example, old tires (device swing), plastic bottles (decor of the site) and more.  The most important thing is that when you design a children's corner, you do not forget about safety and take care of the absence of sharp corners and loosely fixed structures.  Having set up a children's corner in the country house with your own hands <strong>,</strong> you will kill two birds with one stone at once - you will delight the children and provide yourself with free time, as your kids will have something to do! </p>

    <h2>  Rating of the most popular children's designs for a summer corner </h2><p>  So, you decided to equip the playground in the country, but do not know what structures to place on it.  Check out the most popular playground equipment options. </p><ol><li>  <em>A hut or a house</em> .  Remember yourself in childhood - to sit in a hut with friends was the most mysterious and fascinating activity.  You can bring some sweets from home, share secrets with friends, and just do something under the roof of a hut (read, draw, play).  Any activity in such a mysterious place brings complete pleasure.  You can make a hut yourself or replace it with a ready-made plastic house.  This will be the most comfortable corner in the country. </li><li>  <em>The snake</em> .  If you have pieces of timber in your inventory, you can make such an attraction as a snake.  For this, pieces of timber are dug into the ground at different heights.  Their location should be zigzag in nature.  Any kid will like to move from one pile to another, trying to maintain balance. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="A cozy corner in the country" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17517/403923.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  <em>Balancer</em>  These swings are always popular.  All that you may need for the manufacture of such entertainment is a board that is suitable in length, staples and the remains of linoleum.  The seats for these swings can be made using plastic cutting boards or ice cubes.  Staples need to be fixed to the board, and using pieces of a water pipe, convenient handles can be made.  To ensure the effect of depreciation, linoleum is used.  A cylinder made of it is attached to the bottom of the board under the seat. </li><li>  <em>Rope ladder</em> .  This can be done from a rope (synthetic).  Importantly, do not forget that the cells of this staircase should be smaller in diameter than the baby‚Äôs head, and the location of all nodes should be on one side.  At first, your baby may not be able to climb it, but, by training, he will surely achieve great success and be able to boast of them in front of his friends. </li></ol>
