  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warsaw Pact</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Warsaw Pact of 1955 was signed by the GDR, Bulgaria, Albania, Hungary, the USSR, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia on cooperation, mutual assistance and friendship. </p><p>  The need for its conclusion was caused by the threat to peace created in Europe by the decisions of the <span>Paris Agreements.</span>  They provided for the formation of the Western European Union, the inclusion in NATO and the remilitarization (restoration of armaments) of West Germany. </p><p>  The Warsaw Pact was exclusively defensive.  The purpose of its signing was to take certain measures to ensure the security of the countries participating in it and to maintain peace in Europe. </p><p>  The Warsaw Pact includes 11 articles and a preamble.  Based on its conditions and <span>the UN Charter,</span> its participants committed themselves to abstain from the threat or use of force in their relations with other states.  In addition, mutual assistance was provided for the countries that would be attacked.  The Warsaw Pact obligated states to provide full immediate support by all means necessary, including weapons. </p><p>  Mutual consultations were also envisaged for the signing states on important issues of an international character, regarding the common interests of countries.  In order to conduct these consultations, a GAC ‚Äã‚Äã(Political Advisory Committee) was established. </p><p>  <span>The creation of the Warsaw Pact Organization</span> obliged the signatory countries to act in a spirit of cooperation and friendship.  Thus, it was supposed to ensure the further strengthening and development of cultural and economic relations between the participating states.  At the same time, a prerequisite was following the principles of non-interference in affairs within other states, mutual respect for sovereignty and independence. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>The contract is valid for</span> twenty years.  An automatic extension of ten years is provided for states that do not file one year before its expiration of the denunciation (termination) statement to the Polish government.  The Warsaw Pact could be signed by any state, regardless of its state and <span>social system.</span>  It was assumed that in the event of the creation of a common security system in Europe and the conclusion of a pan-European agreement, the Polish agreement would cease to be valid. </p><p>  The Joint Command of the Armed Forces Armed Forces was created in order to provide the most effective protection against a possible attack.  The collective command and headquarters should facilitate the interaction of the armed forces and strengthen the defense capabilities of the states parties to the agreement in Warsaw.  To this end, joint military and command-staff maneuvers and exercises were carried out on the territory of all countries that signed the agreement. </p><p>  However, the main position of the states parties to the Polish treaty is aimed at developing peaceful relations in Europe and strengthening security. </p><p>  At a meeting in Moscow in 1960, a Declaration was adopted approving the decision of the Government of the Soviet Union on the unilateral refusal of nuclear tests.  In this case, all the conditions for the non-resumption of nuclear explosions by the Western powers should have been met.  At the same time, the USSR allied states called for the creation of favorable conditions conducive to the completion of an agreement on the cessation of any nuclear tests. </p><p>  The proposals put forward by the countries participating in the agreement, and their activities, being the focus of the powers of Europe, testified to the real peacefulness and desire to maintain security and peace in Europe. </p>
