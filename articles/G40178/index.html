What are the factors of the formation of the Belarusian currency?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Belarusian ruble is an interesting currency.  It is simply called a "bunny", and in exchange offices they usually ask the question: "How much is 1000 Belarusian rubles today?"  What are the reasons for such features of the national banknote of the Republic of Belarus? </p><h2><strong></strong>  About the Belarusian ruble </h2><p>  The country neighboring Belarus - Belarus - despite the fact that we are united in the Union State, has its own currency.  It is called the same as the banknote of the Russian Federation - "ruble".  And to emphasize national identity, a definition is added - "Belarusian".  The ruble of our neighbors is divided, like ours, into 100 kopecks (although they are not issued in coins now).  Banknotes of various denominations are spinning in the turnover - from 10 to 100 thousand <span>Belarusian banknotes.</span>  Citizens themselves often call their currency ‚Äúbunny‚Äù, and this is understandable: this animal was depicted on the 1992 ruble banknote. </p>

    <p>  In general, the name ‚Äúruble‚Äù for some time competed with other potential denominations of the Belarusian banknote: at one time, ‚Äúthaler‚Äù (a German coin of the Middle Ages, a prototype of the dollar) was considered a working option.  The currencies of Russia and Belarus are called almost the same, but have completely different values.  So, how many Russian rubles are in the Belarusian ruble and why? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What affects the Belarusian ruble exchange rate </h2><p>  To begin with, about how the "bunny" monetary rate is formed.  According to some analysts, the national currency of Belarus depends on the situation in the leading economies of the world, especially in the United States.  And in some cases, investors prefer to invest in banknotes of more developed countries.  In particular, recent publications by the Federal Reserve (America‚Äôs main financial institution) indicate that the country's GDP has every chance of increasing. </p>

    <p>  Investors, having familiarized themselves with this information, decided to move capital to the US market.  Against the background of this process, the currencies of the BRICS countries, as well as their neighbors (Belarus borders and closely interacts with Russia in the economic field), have weakened.  There are also internal factors affecting the Belarusian ruble exchange rate.  Analysts note as the most important - difficulties with the sale of products by exporters from Belarus.  And in order to maintain the competitiveness of national producers, the government can make decisions on currency devaluation.  So, we are closely approaching the answer to the question of how many rubles of Russian origin are in the Belarusian ruble. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Belarusian ruble: a difficult history of foreign exchange trading </h2><p>  The economy of two countries - Russia and Belarus - after the collapse of the USSR was going through difficult times.  Over the course of several years, the main vectors of <span>monetary policy</span> were defined <span>,</span> the national banknote exchange rate was not stable in relation to each other, nor in comparison with the dollar and the euro.  A simple example from the history of trading: in April 1994, the Belarusian ruble against the US banknote was 19 thousand units, in May - already 20 thousand, in June - about 24 thousand. Real inflation of the national currency of Belarus, according to economists, in 1994- m amounted to more than 1500%.  And prices, according to Belstat estimates, increased 20 times.  Rates on ruble deposits did not in any way cover the depreciation of the ‚Äúrabbit‚Äù.  But over time, the situation of the Belarusian currency has stabilized noticeably.  What do we have today?  Russian 1 ruble How many Belarusian rubles is it worth?  In <span>foreign exchange trading</span> at the end of June 2014, one banknote from Russia was equal to about 300 units of the currency of a neighboring country.  Or, more precisely, about 3.36 rubles per 1000 ‚Äúbunnies‚Äù - in today's banking practice, the rate of the Belarusian banknote is indicated, as a rule, per thousand units.  Well, how much is our rubles in the Belarusian ruble?  It turns out, tenths. </p><h2>  Factor of integration with Russia </h2><p>  According to analysts, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus can take a course on the devaluation of the "bunny" - this is facilitated by <span>the</span> country's <span>integration processes</span> with the countries of the Customs Union, primarily with Russia.  Active interaction between the authorities of the two countries has not stopped since the collapse of the USSR.  Back in 1999, an agreement was signed on the prospects of creating a single currency of the Union State and a common emission center.  But so far, such a banknote has not been put into circulation.  And experts cannot clearly say when exactly the introduction of the single currency will occur. </p>

    <p>  Well, as long as there is no analogue of the euro for the Union State, we continue to consider how much our rubles are in the Belarusian ruble.  Countries continue active integration, and there is a chance that in the foreseeable future, Russians and Belarusians will be able to pay each other a single banknote model. </p>
