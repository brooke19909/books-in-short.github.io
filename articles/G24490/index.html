Tour operators characterize this period as a velvet season - a time when it is still warm enough, but not so hot as in the middle of summer.  Since for many of our compatriots the traditional summer vacation remains their favorite, with the advent of autumn, the demand for tours falls.  And this is a great opportunity to save money for those who have not had time to relax yet.  Trips to Greece in September are much cheaper than in July or August.  If the budget is strictly limited, consider last minute tours.  It is not worth worrying about the quality of rest, in fact, Greece is good at any time of the year.

But in the first month of autumn it is still quite warm.  In some areas, cooling is noted after the 20th.  You can swim all September, the average water temperature for this month is +24 degrees.  There may be storms at sea.  On well-maintained beaches, they should not be feared due to breakwaters, but if the waves are too high, you should refrain from walking on water transport.  The air temperature in September ranges from +25 to +30, depending on the area.  Athens and Rhodes are considered the warmest.  Thessaloniki and Heraklion are no less popular, but here it is always a couple of degrees colder.  The weather in September in Greece is most often sunny, without precipitation.  The length of daylight is still enough to find an even tan.  At the same time, due to a decrease in solar activity, it is almost impossible to burn, but it is still recommended to use sunscreen.

    <p>  September in Greece is a great time to enjoy a full list of resort entertainment for a moderate fee.  Even the largest hotels offer seasonal discounts; they are also pleased with the owners of cafes and souvenir shops.  Due to the decrease in the number of visitors to the country, service is noticeably improving.  The staff in restaurants and hotels with great attention to their customers, and guides are ready to serve small groups on favorable terms.  It is still warm at night in most regions.  In early autumn, Greece has unusually beautiful sunsets.  Most tourists prefer to meet the evening on the coast or in outdoor cafes, and then go to parties, which, despite the off-season, spend in large numbers.  Greece in September turns into the center of festival life and festivities.  Various events of national and international importance, as well as various national holidays, are held here.  Many of them can be visited for free. </p><h2>  Beach or cultural program? </h2>

Ancient ruins and well-preserved architectural monuments are literally at every step, and in order to see something interesting, it is not at all necessary to go somewhere far away.  However, tourists who just want to relax peacefully on the coast will also like this country.  At the beginning of autumn, rental of various accessories for beach holidays and water sports is still working.  There are no problems with the infrastructure either - bars and cafes are open on the coast as usual, in large cities - various entertainment venues.  If your goal is sightseeing, consider living in a village located in the immediate vicinity of the objects of interest to you.  Nevertheless, the most memorable and productive vacation in Greece in September will be, if you can combine two options for spending time.

Autumn is the best time to explore large-scale objects: tourists are noticeably less than in summer, a long stay in the open air and walking do not bring discomfort.  One of the most famous sights of Greece is the Acropolis of Athens.  In ancient times, all large settlements had their own upper city.  Initially, it was something like a fortress in case of an attack by enemies, later temples were built here and all religious holidays and ceremonies were held.  From the former greatness of the Acropolis of Athens there are not so many left, but even in the present state, the ruins are amazing.  All archaeological finds are presented in a separate museum, preserved fragments of buildings are being restored.  This place looks especially interesting in the dark due to the backlight.  If we talk about entire cities with a rich history, Corinth, Delphi, Mycenae, Knossos and Sparta deserve the most attention.  Greece in September offers an extensive program for its guests.

This is a great place for walks and photo shoots.  In fact, this is another city, but its buildings are practically not preserved.  An interesting place due to the large number of statues, most of which are copies.  If you are interested in natural attractions, you should definitely visit the <span>Samaria Gorge,</span> Aphrodite Bay and Dikti Mountains.  Many tours to Greece in September already include these excursions in the program.  Do not forget to take time to visit museums, as it is in them that you can see most of the original art objects found during archaeological excavations.

    <h2>  How much does a vacation in Greece cost? </h2><p>  Warm beaches, a moderate number of tourists and attractions available for visiting - all this is Greece in September.  Holiday prices make this trip affordable for everyone.  For example, a tour with a departure from Moscow for two can be found already for 40 thousand rubles.  Of course, we are talking about a mid-range hotel, only meals are included in the price of the ticket.  A tour with dinners and accommodation in an elite complex will cost twice as much.  But quite often some excursions are already included in this price.  Greece in September will appreciate the low prices for various entertainment services and excursions.  Care should be taken only to taxi drivers and street vendors.  Many representatives of these two professions do not mind cheating tourists even in the off-season. </p>
