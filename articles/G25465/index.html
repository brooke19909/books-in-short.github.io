Thin tablecloths, bright napkins and openwork paths enliven and decorate the dining area, making it attractive to households and guests.  Handicrafts emit a special light and reflect the love of their creator. </p><p>  If you want to learn how to crochet beautiful interior items, this article is for you.  In it, we will present different crochet patterns of tracks, give simple understandable descriptions and necessary recommendations.  Linking a new product will not be difficult for beginners, and the workflow and result will give joy and satisfaction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="laughingredhead.me" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful crochet track patterns" class="if uuid-2864987" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2864987.jpg"></div><h2>  Beautiful square motif </h2><p>  Needlewomen who do not have much knitting experience will be able to learn how to crochet an <span>openwork napkin path,</span> with the patterns and descriptions presented below.  The main thing is to purchase the necessary tools, yarn and carefully follow the instructions.  To create a gentle, airy path of square motifs, you will need: </p><ul><li>  several skeins of yarn ALPINA HOLLY (100% mercerized cotton), with a density of 50 g per 200 g, any color; </li><li>  hook number 2 or number 2.5; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  In the manufacture of the canvas, we recommend using knitting threads of calm pastel colors - beige, ivory, peach or white.  To tie the edges, you can choose contrasting yarn, this will give special expressiveness and beauty to the product. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Learning to knit a square motif </h2><p>  Our path will consist of individual square motifs connected in a single piece of cloth, which will be tied around the edge with a delicate pattern.  To make a product measuring 35 * 50 cm, you need to knit 54 squares (5 * 5 cm). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns 3" class="if uuid-2856517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2856517.jpg"></div><p>  Let's connect the first square motif.  Getting started with the Amigurumi ring.  We make 4 air loops and 3 double crochet stitches (hereinafter VP and C2H).  To the end of the row we knit a rapport: 9 VP - 4 C2H, repeating it three times, we close with a connecting loop. </p><p>  We start row No. 2, making out 4 VP, 3 C2N and 5 VP.  In the arch we knit 2 C2H, connecting them together, 5 VP.  Repeat three more times.  The first corner of the square motif is ready.  Next, we do 4 C2H, one in each loop of the base and 5 VP.  We knit to the end of the row by analogy, guided by the crochet pattern of the tracks.  Finish, cut the thread, fasten.  The first element is ready. </p><h2>  Crochet the edge of the openwork track.  Scheme and Description </h2><p>  The second square motive is performed by analogy with the first.  At the same time, as we knit, we attach it to the first connecting loops, as shown in the following diagram of the tracks with a hook.  In turn, we carry out all the motives, attaching them to each other in the right places.  As a result, you get a smooth, beautiful canvas of square motifs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet patterns 4" class="if uuid-2856573" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2856573.jpg"></div><p>  It remains to complete the binding and subject the finished product to wet and heat treatment.  To design the edge, we take a thread contrasting in color.  We carry out rows No. 1 and No. 2 with single crochet (we work in a circle).  In the third row we knit according to the scheme 1 column with a crochet (C1H) - 1 VP.  In the corners of the fabric we knit 3 C1H, between which we do not forget to make air loops. </p><p>  We draw up the fourth row with the help of groups of 4 C1H and pico of three VP.  Between the elements we make 2 VP, 1 single crochet and again 2 VP.  As a result, we get a beautiful lace edge of the product.  We fix all threads, remove excess ones. </p><p>  We subject the product to wet-heat treatment, let it rest and enjoy the result!  Such a beautiful, openwork path will decorate any kitchen, adding to its coziness and comfort. </p><h2>  Small napkin path "Lemon" </h2><p>  With the help of a bright, elegant napkin-path, the interior of any kitchen will sparkle with new colors.  Such a product will allow you to make the necessary color accents, giving the dining area more light and heat.  Napkin path "Lemon" will decorate any tea party and will serve as a stand for hot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern" class="if uuid-2853676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2853676.jpg"></div><p>  To work, you need acrylic yarn of white and yellow colors, with a density of 50 g per 200 m, hook No. 2.5 or No. 3, scissors.  Having prepared the necessary, we proceed to knitting: we consider the crochet patterns of the tracks carefully and steadily follow the description.  You will succeed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  We knit the track "Lemon" </h2><p>  The product will be carried out in four stages: </p><ul><li>  knitting three square motifs; </li><li>  knitting the main part of the fabric; </li><li>  product assembly; </li><li>  edge banding. </li></ul><p>  We start by knitting the "grandmother" square.  With a yellow thread we make an amigurumi ring, 1 VP, 8 single crochet.  We start knitting the second row with 6 VP and a single crochet.  In the next loop of the row we knit 2 crochets, between which we make 1 air loop.  Next, execute 1 double crochet, 3 loops and again double crochet.  Repeat the pattern according to the pattern to the end of the row. </p><p>  The third row will be performed with white yarn, using a pattern of 3 double crochets - 1 VP.  Only in the corners of the square we will knit three loops, forming the corners.  Please note, we complete row number 3 with a double crochet. </p><p>  The fourth row is again performed with a yellow thread, starting with 3 VP.  The pattern is simple - we use groups of four columns, knitting them in arches from the air loops of the previous row.  In the corners do not forget 3 VPs, forming a square. </p><p>  The fifth row involves a neat binding of the edge with the help of single crochet columns.  Cut the thread, fasten.  The first square motif is ready. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ar.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet track patterns and description" class="if uuid-2853685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2853685.jpg"></div><p>  By analogy, we carry out two more of the same elements.  Be careful, in the fifth row do only single crochet, we will use pico later, with the final strapping, when the whole product is almost ready.  We connect the finished squares into a strip using columns without a crochet. </p><h2>  We knit the main fabric of the napkin path </h2><p>  With a white thread in the initial row, we collect 54 air loops.  In the fifth and sixth from the end of the loop, we perform one crochet column (C1H), and then 1 VP.  We knit to the end of the row using rapport: 1 1 - 1 VP (repeat 4 times, skipping the base loop) - 1 in each loop of the base (3 times) - 1 VP. </p><p>  We start the second row with three VP, we knit in the opposite direction according to the rapport 3 1 - 1 VP - 1 1 - 1 VP -1 1 - 1 VP.  We knit all other rows according to the scheme similar to the second.  As a result, we get a smooth, beautiful canvas of 25 rows of double crochet and VP. </p><p>  Getting to the assembly.  We attach three square motifs from the right edge to the canvas with single crochets.  Almost ready.  It remains only to complete the binding.  We take a yellow thread and around the entire perimeter of the product we make crochets.  In the second row of strapping we use pico.  We knit 4 sc and 3 VP, connecting them into a ring. </p><p>  We fix the threads, cut them, wash the product, process with steam and enjoy the result!  Now that you‚Äôve familiarized yourself with the track layouts, crocheting will be a lot easier.  And each needlewoman will be able to decorate her home with cozy handmade products. </p><h2>  Beautiful path with floral motifs </h2><p>  Those needlewomen who love airy, lace products will like our track patterns.

In the first row we perform 4 lifting loops and knit according to the scheme 5 VP - 1 column with two crochets.  Repeat 6 more times.  We start the second row with a connecting loop in the first loop of the arch of the previous row and three VPs for lifting.  Next, in the arch, we carry out 8 columns with one crochet, two VP, 1 single crochet in the next arch and again two 2 VP.  Next, we knit 9 1 in the arch, two VPs, 1  in the next arch and 2 VP.  We continue to work according to the scheme until the end of the row. </p><p>  We start the third row with 3 VP, do 4 1, one in the base loop.  Next, we knit 1 1 - 5 VP - 1 1, forming the angle of the motive.  Again we knit 4 C1H.  In the single crochet of the previous row, we perform 1 1 - 3 VP -1 1.  According to this scheme, we work until the end of the row.  The first floral motif is ready.  We make the rest of the motifs by analogy with it, in turn, in the course of knitting, attaching them to each other with single crochet columns in the corner and central arches, as indicated in the diagram. </p><h2>  We continue to work: lace trim </h2><p>  Consider crocheting the edges of a beautiful track.  The scheme involves knitting 6 rows.  The first and second are performed using the scheme 1 1 - 3  - 1 1 along the entire perimeter of the product.  In the corners of the track we make one additional double crochet, surrounded on both sides by three air loops.  In the third row, we work using the pattern 2 1 - 2 VP - 2 1 (into the arch), 1 VP - 1 SBN - 1 VP (into the next arch).  The fourth row is performed by analogy with the first and second, and the fifth - with the third. </p><p>  The sixth, final row is made of arches (9 PN and 1 single crochet), we repeat until the end.  We fix the thread, cut off the excess, we subject the product to the WTO.  Congratulations, you crocheted a delicate napkin path.  Descriptive schemes helped you in this creative endeavor?  We hope you didn‚Äôt have any difficulties.  Good luck! </p><h2>  Beautiful filet crochet.  Scheme and description of the process </h2><p>  One of the most beautiful crochet techniques is considered to be fillet knitting.  Due to the alternation of columns with crochets and air loops, followed by filling the cells necessary for the drawing, a grid with beautiful patterns and ornaments is obtained.  The technique of fillet knitting allows you to get great tablecloths, napkins and paths of extraordinary beauty.  In this case, the needlewoman does not require special skill and a lot of time, all that is needed is to prepare the materials and carefully follow the diagram. </p><div class="photo" data-original="portaldoscroches.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="filet crochet pattern 2" class="if uuid-2860164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2860164.jpg"></div><p>  Let's look at how to crochet a filet path.  Schemes and description will help us with this.  For work, we will prepare thin cotton yarn (with a density of 25 g per 150 m), hook No. 1.25, scissors. </p><h2>  How to make a track with floral patterns? </h2><p>  Fillet knitting involves creating a beautiful openwork grid of squares.  Some are left empty, while others are filled in groups of four single crochet columns.  Empty squares are knitted using a combination of double crochet - 2 VP - double crochet.  In this case, the first and last columns of one cell serve as the walls of the previous and next.  A beautiful filet path with floral patterns is performed as follows. </p><div class="photo" data-original="portaldoscroches.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="filet crochet pattern" class="if uuid-2860140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/2860140.jpg"></div><p>  We start knitting with a narrow edge.  To do this, we collect 214 air loops, 3 lifting loops and in the fourth from the end we begin to knit double crochets.  We knit row No. 2 with empty cells using the pattern 1 1 - 2  - 1 1 (except the first and last). We knit further rows according to the drawing, carefully counting and filling the cells.  From the thirteenth row on the sides of the central rose we knit openwork mesh using the scheme 1 1 - 2 VP - 1 SB - 2 VP -1 1, and above them 1 1 - 4 VP -1 1.  As a result, you should get a beautiful openwork canvas with floral patterns.  At the last stage of work, the product is wetted in cool water and steamed through a cloth.  Ready filet path with flowers and ornaments will be an amazing decoration of your living room.  I wish you creative success. </p>
