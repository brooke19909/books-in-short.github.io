History, characteristics and manufacturing methods</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When it comes to ordinary wardrobe items, such as a skirt, dress or trousers, there are no additional questions with the requirements of clarification of their purpose.  Things are completely different when they ask: "Gaiters - what is it?"  Let's find out how they look and what they put on. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gaiters what is it" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10712/404364.jpg" width="340"></div></h2><h2>  Gaiters - what is it?  History of their appearance </h2><p>  It turns out that this wardrobe item appeared a very long time ago and was completely different in appearance from the modern one.  Gaiters were mainly used to <span>protect legs</span> and shoes.  They were sewn in the form of a short cover with a clasp.  Moreover, their height sometimes did not significantly reach the knee. </p><p>  So, in ancient Rome they were always worn by gladiators in order to protect the ankle area from possible damage.  Later gaiters became a mandatory attribute of warriors.  And indeed, for a long time they were considered a purely masculine wardrobe item.  They were used mainly as a cover for legs during horse riding. </p><p>  Over time, gaiters become popular among the masses, becoming one of the fashionable things.  A special chic in the late XIX and early XX centuries was to have white gaiters.  At this time, they find recognition among women, so they become completely different in style, color, material used and other characteristics.  So gradually gaiters from an object to protect shoes from pollution turned into a useful insulating little thing for the feet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Length matters </h2><p>  But nevertheless, despite the completeness of the information presented here, few people can accurately answer the question: "Gaiters - what is it?"  It turns out that the majority opinion is rather mistaken.  For some reason, many people call gaiters ordinary leggings or underpants.  Such a judgment is especially prevalent in the northern regions of Russia.  But real gaiters should not be longer than the knee.  At the same time, another property is necessarily present - there is no ‚Äúpaw‚Äù, like golfs or socks.  In this case, often from the strap, located in the lower part on the ankle, ribbons can go for fixing under the foot. </p><h2>  Qualitative characteristics of the subject </h2>

    <p>  So, it became clear that gaiters are directly related to wearing over shoes or in order to maintain heat.  Therefore, the material from which they are made must be appropriate.  But really, if you think about the topic ‚ÄúGaiters - what is it?‚Äù, Associations immediately arise with something warm and soft, doesn‚Äôt it?  Therefore, definitely no thin features similar to summer socks can be considered.  Although some modern supermodels look that way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Having learned about the purpose of the gaiters, let's find out which material for the manufacture is the most suitable and with the help of which technique it is better to do the work.  This will be discussed later in this article.  A brief description of the manufacture of warming things for girls is also presented. </p><h2>  What material and tool is better to use when knitting gaiters? </h2><p>  In the process of wearing items should be on the foot at a level just below the knee.  Therefore, you need to think about how they should be kept there.  There are three options: </p><ul><li>  <em>First one</em> .  Make the upper edge of the knitted fabric in the form of a hollow rib, so that then you can insert an elastic band into it. </li><li>  <em>Second one</em> .  The knit must be chosen more dense in relation to the main fabric.  Therefore, it is more advisable to make knitted gaiters using knitting needles.  And as an ornament, choose a gum pattern.  Of course, you can make do-it- <span>yourself gaiters</span> and crochets <span>with your own hands</span> , but it will be quite problematic to choose the right pattern with the required ‚Äúcorrugated‚Äù qualities. </li><li>  <em>Third</em> .  Decorate the top of the gaiters on the clasp.  This is guaranteed to provide the desired density while standing on the foot. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to tie gaiters?  Brief instruction </h2><p>  First, pick a pattern for the future product.  Gaiters for girls with knitting needles are best done with openwork knitting.  Therefore, to begin with, perform a test sample to count the loops.  Take measurements: leg circumference in the area under the knee, ankles and length of the product.  You can start knitting both from below and from above.  Some models are made quite loose, and not ‚Äútight-fitting,‚Äù with multiple transverse folds.  Therefore, they can be knitted in the form of a rectangle with lower and upper elastic.  It is also welcome to perform work on the principle of socks - in a circle. </p><p>  So, after completing the test sample, calculate the required number of loops and start work with gum.  Make it 5 to 10 cm wide, depending on the model.  Its same width will be at the top of the gaiters.  The insulated models look original with knitting braids, large weaves, cones and other expressive elements.  Surely a new wardrobe item will be to the taste of any girl, it will become a fashionable little thing.  It is very convenient to wear gaiters on cold autumn days over closed shoes, imitating <span>autumn boots.</span> </p><p>  Imagine and delight your loved ones with new useful things made by yourself! </p>
