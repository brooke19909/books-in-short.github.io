    <h2>  What is Medieval Studies </h2><p>  If you translate the name of this historical discipline from Latin, it will become clear that medieval studies is the science of the Middle Ages.  First of all, it means that medieval scholars (as experts in this field are called) examine the history of Western Europe from the 5th to the 15th centuries, in fact, the history of the Catholic world.  It should be noted that in Soviet science the era of the Middle Ages is extended to the beginning of the New Age, that is, to the XVIII century.  However, in part, medievalists study the history of the New Age. </p><p>  Secondly, these scientists also explore other time periods, for example, the Middle Ages, but this designation of medieval studies is used much less frequently.  However, modern mediaevalists tend to consider their field of activity as more global, not limited to the European Middle Ages.  In addition to the history of countries in this era, medieval studies includes numerous historical disciplines - sphragistics, historical demography, genealogy, medieval philosophy, heraldry, the history of literature, theater, art and other auxiliary sciences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  A Brief History of the Formation of Science in the West </h2><p>  Interest in the <span>Middle Ages</span> first appeared in the Renaissance, when the years of the Middle Ages began to be singled out as one of the historical periods (the name Flavio Biondo is associated with this innovation).  In the XVII-XVIII centuries, the approach to sources became more and more qualitative (their number increased significantly against the background of a general interest in their own "dark" past).  A critical look was formed on them, additional disciplines appeared, such as numismatics, genealogy and others.  A special role here was played by humanist scientists using their methods of analyzing sources, and the so-called ‚Äúchurch scholars,‚Äù which contributed to an increase in the number of sources.  In the 18th century, a romantic and idealized view of the <span>Middle Ages</span> prevailed <span>,</span> as opposed to the position of the enlighteners, which created additional interest in this time. </p><p>  Closer to the 19th century, it could already be said that medieval studies is a full-fledged scientific discipline.  During this period, historians actively turned to archives, extracting new sources of information, which contributed to an increase in the number of historical studies, the formation of national historical schools.  As the main scientific paradigm, a positivist approach to the study of the topic is used.  At the beginning of the twentieth century, interest in the Middle Ages focuses on a specific person, for example, in the 1930s the ‚ÄúAnnals School‚Äù appeared (shortly after the appearance of the magazine founded by Mark Blok and Lucien Fevre), as a result of which new scientific directions arose.  In addition, in the twentieth century a critical school of medieval studies was formed, Marxist views were spread - the latter were clearly reflected in Soviet historiography. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  A few words about Russian medieval studies </h2><p>  The study of the Middle Ages in Russia acquired a scientific character in the 1st half of the 19th century.  Particular attention was paid to socio-economic history, in particular, the ‚ÄúRussian agrarian school‚Äù stood out, which perfectly matched the requirements of historical realities.  In the twentieth century, a Marxist approach to medieval studies was developing; this did not have the best effect on the objectivity of research, which is observed in Soviet historiography.  In part, it can be said that the scientific works of the Soviet era were opportunistic, but since the study of the Middle Ages was not relevant research material, it did not experience any particular oppression of ideology.  Therefore, it cannot be said that medieval studies in the USSR did not achieve success in studying the social aspects of the Middle Ages, the centuries of this era were extended by Soviet scientists until the Great French Revolution (1779), a turning point between the Middle Ages and the New Time. </p><h2>  The main issues of medieval studies </h2><p>  Now medieval scholars are conducting research in new directions, such as microhistory, psychohistory, the economy of the Middle Ages, gender relations, the history of everyday life and other specific areas. </p>

    <h2>  Medieval studies now </h2><p>  Today, around the world there are centers of research of the Middle Ages, which are attached to large educational institutions or research centers.  Each of them was formed during the formation of national schools for the study of the Middle Ages and, accordingly, for them, medieval studies is a study of the national specifics of this period and the country's role in world history.  In recent years, the Middle Ages is increasingly viewed in a global context, which is facilitated by numerous conferences in which scientists from various countries take part, that is, "supranational" relations are formed in this way.  In Russia, there is an All-Russian Association of Medievalists, the magazine "Middle Ages", which has existed since 1942, is published. </p>
