Many people think that such an element can perfectly decorate a room, becoming an integral and conspicuous part of the interior.  DIY box decoration is an interesting and entertaining pastime that helps to express your own individual style and emphasize taste preferences.  In addition, such a box will be a great option as a gift to a friend or colleague. </p><h2>  Product Preparation </h2><p>  Regardless of which way of decorating and decorating was chosen, the first thing to do is to conduct an inspection and some starting work.  The walls of the casket should be inspected for any residues of paint, varnish or glue on them, and if they are found, clean.  It is important to remember that the overall quality of the work will generally depend on the evenness and smoothness of the surface of the product.  For these purposes, you can use sandpaper and sand the walls. </p><p>  After that, the next stage will begin, at which it will be necessary to degrease the surface of the casket.  Only in this way will the new material hold firmly.  For the procedure, you will need an ordinary napkin, which must first be moistened with vodka or pure alcohol.  After wiping, you will have to wait about 10-12 hours until it dries completely or accelerate this process with a simple hair dryer.  Upon completion of these procedures, the direct process of decorating the casket with your own hands begins. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Preparation for decorating the casket" class="if uuid-3066498" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066498.jpg"></div><h2>  The choice of performance technique </h2><p>  Each of the options has its pros and cons.  For example, some techniques are easier to perform, while others look more aesthetically pleasing.  However, the latter in any case remains solely a matter of personal preference and taste.  The only general advice that can be given is that it is best for a novice to try their hand at decorating the casket on some small item, and only then transgress to work with the main one. </p><p>  Also, the performance technique is chosen with an eye to what this box will be used for.  Most often resort to the technique of paper art, shabby chic, quilling or painting.  However, there are many other options.  As a rule, the method is limited only by the imagination of the master.  Moreover, most families have such an item, because women often use it to store jewelry and cosmetics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.alore.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The choice of jewelry box decoration techniques" class="if uuid-3066508" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066508.jpg"></div><h2>  Mosaic technique </h2><p>  It is considered one of the most fashionable and uncomplicated in execution.  From the tools at hand should be any sharp cutting objects, cardboard, talcum powder, varnish and adhesive adhesive.  You will also need a brush with a roller for rolling, plastic or polymer clay and a ribbon as the final touch for decoration.  This option is perfect in order to make a box for needlework with your own hands. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Previously, circles are cut out of the cardboard, which will create the future image.  The interior is decorated with white clay.  To give it a form, you can use an ordinary reel.  After that, the polymer material is applied to the circles to smooth the bubbles and joints, and all excess elements are cut off.  In the final, the circles are baked in the oven. </p><p>  The second phase of work begins.  The outer walls are sprinkled with talcum powder for more convenient application of plastic elements, from which various patterns and weaves are formed.  After cooling circles, you can then mosaic in accordance with your own wishes.  The tape attaches to the base of the cover and forms a loop.  In the final, the casket can once again be put into the oven, and at the end of the process, cover with a layer of acrylic paint.  Finishing is done with a simple varnish with a matte shade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="emusing-emma.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosaic Box Technique" class="if uuid-3066520" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066520.jpg"></div><h2>  Mirror technology </h2><p>  A wonderful box-chest for storing various items can be made with a sharp knife, brush and ruler.  You will also need an adhesive binder, adhesive tape and acrylic plastic with a special coating for refraction and reflection of light.  It is important to note that it is better to carry out all procedures in the presence of protective gloves and glasses. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The execution technique is quite simple and does not require any special skills.  On a pre-prepared acrylic plastic, three trimming trims are measured using a ruler.  It should allow you to lay rectangular blanks in one row.  You can connect the resulting panels with glue.  Drying takes place on its own within a few hours.  At the end of the procedure, the inside is glued with felt.  It should be remembered that until the very last stage, the plastic must always be contained in a special protective film. </p><h2>  Shabby Chic Technique </h2><p>  If the previous products were perfectly suitable as unique hand-made caskets for needlework, this style has a slightly different application.  Ready chest will look great as a storage for jewelry.  From improvised items, you should take any candy box that you like, glue, polystyrene and patterned sheet.  In addition, various lace, fabric, decorative beads and beads, as well as a dense thread, can be useful. </p><p>  In the first step, the desired shape is cut with the help of scissors from a candy box.  This will be the bottom of the future decorated box.  After that, the above-mentioned sheet with any pattern is attached to the box with glue from all sides.  The cover will be created from a combination of fabric and paper.  The finished foam form is sheathed and superimposed on the casket from above.  Beads and lace are the final decorative elements that are arranged to the taste of the master. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fr.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black and white jewelry box" class="if uuid-3066531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066531.jpg"></div><h2>  Quilling technique </h2><p>  If you do not want to bother too much, but achieve an acceptable result, then this option can be called the most optimal decor with your own hands.  The box will be decorated with twisted strips of multi-colored paper.  You will also need a toothpick and a brush with glue.  The optimal set of colors is selected in accordance with the wishes of the author himself. </p><p>  Spirals of different colors should be twisted and glued into strips.  In the future, they will need to be glued to pre-prepared long columns of the same paper.  So the base of the product appears.  Toothpick in this case is needed in order to simplify twisting.  The walls, bottom and cover are laid out with paper of a certain shade.  Then, in the upper part, flower forms are created, created using several spirals.  In the final, the structure is glued on all necessary sides. </p><h2>  Patchwork technique </h2><p>  It is considered one of the most extraordinary options, which creates the appearance of volume in decorative elements.  The work is done using self-hardening clay for modeling, background paper napkins with a pattern, glue, acrylic varnish, paints and soil.  Among other things, you will need stacks for modeling, a rolling pin for rolling clay and a paper knife. </p><p>  At the very beginning, to imitate the patchwork, a future three-dimensional drawing is created and cut out in detail from the cardboard in the box‚Äôs decor.  Clay is rolled to a thickness of 3 mm, and then previously prepared templates are applied along the contour.  On the box there are places for gluing.  Smoothing to the surface is done by the stack.  Clay hardens in about 24 hours.  After that, it remains only to glue up the necessary elements and color them to your liking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mondo-cattolico.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Imitation patchwork in the decor of the box" class="if uuid-3066546" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066546.jpg"></div><h2>  Button technique </h2><p>  This style is as simple as possible, but from that it looks equally impressive in the final result.  To decorate the box with buttons, you need PVA glue, acrylic primer and napkins.  The main elements will consist of buttons of various sizes and colors fastened together. </p><p>  First you need to find five identical buttons and arrange them in the shape of a daisy.  The sixth - a larger size - must be placed in the center of the resulting flower.  Previously, the last button is coated on the back with glue in a circle, so that it joins the other five.  The amount of glue should be small but sufficient.  Next, the box is primed with acrylic, and decorative elements are arranged according to the author's idea.  It is allowed to use an arbitrarily large number of button compositions. </p><h2>  Decoupage Technique </h2><p>  The style refers to France of those times when a special paper was created with an ornament on which various decorative elements were laid out.  For work you will need varnish, paint with a brush, glue and a clipping of fabric and some thematic picture.  Thus, you can make, for example, a beautiful box for the New Year. </p><p>  The desired image is cut from the source and applied to the surface of the product.  Glue is spread on top, and after drying, varnishing is performed.  In this case, it is allowed to decorate the internal parts of the box, and not just the external ones.  When using fabric, it is best to securely fasten the elements with glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.holytrinitystore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casket decoration with decoupage technique" class="if uuid-3066550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066550.jpg"></div><h2>  Heart shaped item </h2><p>  The basis for such a box can be the most ordinary bobbin for tape or duct tape.  Of other means, you will need to get a tube with PVA glue, a thermogun, scissors, a piece of wallpaper, thick cardboard.  Of course, you need two of these bobbins, as well as flowers, braid and ribbons for decoration. </p><p>  The creation of a heart-shaped box begins with cutting the base in the form of two circles from scotch tape until they fold into the desired shape.  Glue pieces of bobbins using a heat gun.  The bottom and cover are made of thick cardboard, on which the finished part of the structure is superimposed for cutting along the contour. </p><p>  You can trim the resulting plates on the outside with wallpaper or any fabric.  Then they stick to the bobbins.  The side parts should be made of the same material.  The lid is fixed with braid and secured with a thermal gun, and the bottom is fully attached.  Next, decorative elements are superimposed. </p><h2>  Kansashi Decoration </h2><p>  Under this word of Japanese origin are ordinary flowers, with which girls decorate their hair.  To decorate the box with your own hands using the kanzashi technique, you will need glue, a candle, scissors with a needle, tweezers, threads with rhinestones and a two-color ribbon. </p><p>  The process starts with creating petals.  Pieces of tape are bent at the selected angle, and their edges are fired with a lighted candle.  To give the future flower a flat shape, the petals must be glued together.  In total, it will be enough to make 12 such elements.  After they are in turn strung on a thread, it is recommended to alternate the two selected colors.  The ends of the thread are connected, and the petals are straightened. </p><p>  In the finale, glue the center of the box with glue in order to firmly fix a flower over it, on which glue is then dripped exactly the same.  The finishing touch is the fastening of beads and rhinestones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Casket decoration with kanzashi technique" class="if uuid-3066552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98452/3066552.jpg"></div><h2>  Production and decoration for the holiday </h2><p>  For work, you only need to show sufficient patience and imagination.  From improvised means, it is best to use good thick cardboard, scissors, paper, PVA glue and paints.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa New Year‚Äôs decor may consist in the fact that the assembled casket will remind in its form about the upcoming holiday soon.  For example, many make small products in the form of a herringbone, which are then painted in the appropriate colors and tied with a beautiful satin ribbon. </p><p>  If such an idea does not seem too original, then you can create simpler options like a New Year's snow-covered house or even snowflakes.  Various rhinestones or beads of several colors can play the role of decorative elements.  Such a box will not only be a wonderful decoration of the room‚Äôs interior, but can also be used as a gift wrap that will definitely make a positive impression on the donee. </p><h2>  New Year Product </h2><p>  The animal that will be the symbol of next year is a yellow pig.  Therefore, you should definitely use this image as an idea for New Year's decor.  This can be realized either using the decoupage technique described above, or by giving the product an explicit shape of the animal.  The first option looks a little easier to implement.  In any case, such a box can be an excellent repository for money coins, because since ancient times it has been a pig that has been universally used as a piggy bank. </p>
