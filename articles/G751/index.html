  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting needles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Work on the product is almost always completed by making a neckline.  The most common neckline that never goes out of style is a round neckline or neckline.  It can be big or small.  Make such a cutout as follows.  From one third of the hinges of the front part, a collar is tied, and from the remaining two-thirds, shoulder sections. </p><p>  Knitting with the needles of a neck decorated with an inlay must be started a few centimeters lower, exactly as much as an inch in width.  The hinges located in the center of the neck of the front, remove the thread.  After that, each half of the top is knitted separately, reducing through the row two times three, one two and three times one loop.  Just before the shoulder section, they are knitted exactly to the end.  After the shelf and back of the model are connected, the right shoulder of the product is sewn and loops are drawn on the needles along the neckline, starting from the edge of the left shoulder, the loops taken on the thread are thrown, then the loops on the other side of the cutout and the loops from the neckline cut out which are also filmed.  The tie is usually knitted with an elastic band two or three centimeters high.  Knitting the last few rows, they switch to smaller knitting needles to better fit the trim.  Then all the loops are closed, making an elastic edge (the loops are closed according to the figure).  The tie can be connected with any other pattern. </p><p>  Knitting needles with a sharp neckline begin to make out at the height of the armhole.  The hinges of the front part are divided into two, leaving one loop for the middle (it is removed by a thread).  Gradually, on each side, first one loop is reduced eight times in every fourth row, and after six times in every sixth and two times in every eighth row. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Knitting with a sharp neckline with covered neckline is made simultaneously with the neckline as follows.  Two centimeters below the armhole, knitting loops for the left shoulder, half of the loops for the cutout and another loop are collected on the spoke, and the remaining loops of the front part are assembled on a string.  The first few stitches left on the knitting needle are knitted with an elastic band (this will be the width of the inlay).  The loops between the elastic of the inlay and the main viscous are reduced as in the usual sharp cut.  On the right shelf, knitting with the needles of the neck begins with the addition of seven loops to the needles from the wrong side, then loops from the thread are transferred to the knitting needle and the neck is knitted in the same way as the left.  After the design of the right shoulder, the trimmings continue to be knitted 15 cm higher, for the back detail.  Then it is sewn along the back cut separately. </p><p>  Quite often, knitting of a product starts from the neck and knits an integral part, including a back, in front and two sleeves.  A feature of this method of knitting is a strict calculation of loops, without which work may not work.  First, determine the circumference of the neck and make the necessary calculation of the loops.  <span>Knit sweaters</span> from the neck start from the outer edge of the collar.  For example, if a collar with fastener straps is provided, then the number of loops needed for the collar is gained for work, and loops are added to the width of the fastener straps.  Having tied the desired collar height, the loops begin to decrease so that the collar better lies in the neck.  Decreases are made at the same distance from each other.  After finishing knitting the collar, they switch to knitting the product itself.  Raglan lines are determined strictly according to the pattern, along which loops will be added.  Increases are made on both sides of the <span>raglan</span> lines <span>.</span>  <span>Knitting</span> from the neck of the main product begins with the calculation of loops from the neck along the lines of the raglan.  The number of loops for the back should be two times more than for the sleeves.  For each shelf, it is necessary that the number of loops is equal to the number of loops for the sleeves plus loops for the slats.  Success in work with this method of knitting, as already noted, depends on the correct calculation of the loops, as well as on a good pattern, with which you constantly need to check the progress of work. </p>
