They are considered to be the natural border dividing the mainland into two halves: Europe and Asia.  Their length is more than 2000 kilometers. </p>

    <p>  A distinctive feature is the expansion of the massif according to its length: at the top point it is 40-60 km, down to 150. The mountain range is also divided into five parts: the Northern Urals, Southern, Middle, Subpolar and Polar.  Scientists claim that this massif was formed more than 3.5 billion years ago as a result of a rupture of the earth's crust. </p><h2>  Rich natural area </h2><p>  This area is an area with a large reserve of minerals.  Of the 55 items, 48 ‚Äã‚Äãwere mined in the bowels of the Urals: iron, nickel, copper, gold, platinum, aluminum raw materials, potassium salts, precious stones - and this is not a complete list of them. </p><p>  Due to its favorable location in the taiga zone, in addition to natural resources, the Northern Urals is famous for its forest.  Most of the territory of the Sverdlovsk region is occupied by deciduous and coniferous vegetation.  Basically, these are trees of valuable species: cedar, pine, spruce, larch, which allows us to develop the wood processing industry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many large rivers flow through the ridge: Vishera, Pechora, Kosva, Lozva.  A lot of different fish live in them: herring, grayling, whitefish, taimen, salmon and other valuable species, therefore fisheries are well developed here.  But no one can still name the number of small river basins. </p>

    <h2>  General array information </h2><p>  Mount Kosvinsky Kamen is very famous outside the Urals, its height is 1519 m. It is only half a meter lower than its neighbor (Konzhak), therefore it is considered one of the highest on the Ural ridge.  Its circumference is 40 km. </p><p>  The mountain surprises many with its original form, which is presented in the form of a regular cone with a plain at the top and steep slopes.  Therefore, in the period of snowmelt, small lakes form on its plane. </p><p>  I would like to note that on the Kosvinsky Kamen mountain there is the presence of rocky outcrops (sections of the once higher surface, preserved from destruction by arrozia, presented as separate massifs) of a very interesting shape.  Simply put - stone pillars. </p>

It falls into the <span>Kama reservoir.</span> </p><p>  It is worth noting that the weather in this area is very variable, there are often rains and very few clear days. </p>

    <h2>  Vacation spot for tourists </h2><p>  The small village of Kytlym administratively belongs to the city district of Karpinsk, and it is located on the east side at the foot of the mountain we are considering.  Kosvinsky Stone attracts many tourists, and the village is a favorite stopping place for visitors.  Its good location - surrounded by the Ural Mountains - provides an opportunity to choose to conquer any of the peaks. </p><p>  Have you decided to spend your vacation here?  Perfectly!  I want to say that the road, although not very difficult, but it will take a lot of time to overcome it.  Those who have gathered on the road in their own car can drive the coordinates into the navigator and follow the laid route to the very mountain with such a beautiful name - Kosvinsky Stone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  How to get from Yekaterinburg?  A bus runs from the North Station in the direction of the city of Karpinsk.  This trip takes up to 8 hours.  From Perm, the route will be 11 hours long.  Then you have to get to the village of Kytlym minibus taxi. </p><p>  Using public transport, a bus, for example, you can get to Karpinsk central station, and from there - a local minibus to the village. </p>

    <h2>  Types of rest </h2><p>  Vacationers, especially skiers and snowboarders, are very fond of coming here in winter.  High steep slopes and a lot of snow will provide a lot of fun and increased levels of adrenaline.  You can not just ride, but take part in the competitions that are held here and try to win. </p><p>  You can also test your strengths in a more active <span>form of relaxation,</span> such as climbing to the top of the mountain. </p><p>  Kosvinsky Stone, as already mentioned, is replete with the presence of water flows.  A large number of the latter opens up the possibility for tourists to travel by boat and catamaran.  Rafting along mountain rivers is very popular among tourists.  Moving along the surface of the water, it is almost impossible to get off the route and get lost.  You are in a good mood and good spirits. </p>

    <h2>  Underground secrets </h2><p>  Locals say that inside the Kosvinsky Stone Mountain is completely pitted with underground tunnels and passages and looks like a large anthill.  These walkways are so spacious that not only a car, but also a large truck can drive through them. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that a mysterious construction is still underway there, special transport with construction materials and cement trucks constantly arrives there.  In the old days, platinum was mined here, so the horizontal mines dug for this are convenient enough for work.  There is also a multi-level security system, and entry there is only possible exclusively by passes. </p><p>  And another secret is hidden by the Kosvinsky Stone Mountain - a bunker that has been located inside since Soviet times.  It is there that the command center <span>for the Strategic Missile Forces (Strategic Missile Forces)</span> and the main center for controlling the air defense system - the "Perimeter" are located.  All work there is carried out under special control and in complete secrecy, so we can only guess what is happening there. </p><p>  The unique material dunite, which is used in the manufacture of refractories, has the unique ability to block scanning radio waves.  Therefore, the location of the secret base of the armed forces here is very beneficial for the military. </p><p>  To ensure the life of the facility, a power line was built, bridges were laid across the rivers to provide easy access to transport to the destination.  Near the base, in the village of Kytlym, for the military, who are involved in its protection and maintenance, they built a small town with residential buildings and the necessary infrastructure.  The officers and their families live nearby - in the city of Karpinsk. </p>

    <h2>  Selection made </h2><p>  These places are of unique archaeological, historical and cultural value.  Therefore, it is worth taking a moment and come to just relax and enjoy the landscapes of the Urals, plunge into the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvast expanses, forever green forests and majestic peaks. </p><p>  In good clear weather, from the top of the Kosvinsky Stone mountain, a wonderful view of the valley of Konzhakovsky and <span>Serebryansky Stone</span> opens <span>.</span>  It is especially beautiful here in the fall, when everything is painted in bright colors, and the slopes are covered with a carpet of ripe blueberries. </p><p>  Due to the presence of conifers, the air here is ecologically clean and healing, tourists claim that it is easy to breathe in this area.  And this means that during walks you get less tired, the body just recharges with energy.  And traveling through the forest, you can pick up a variety of mushrooms, berries and cedar cones. </p>
