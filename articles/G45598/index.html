It is unlikely that such a person will be found.  Another thing is that often many can not afford long trips.  And if anyone goes where, then, as a rule, the standard route is Thailand, <span>Turkey, Egypt or</span> Vietnam.  However, some prefer Europe - France, Italy, Spain ... By the way, the Canary Islands belong to Spain, among which is the island of Lanzarote - a great place to relax and unwind. </p><h2>  Briefly about the Canaries </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the Canary Islands belong to Spanish territory.  They are located in the Atlantic Ocean, in close proximity to the African coast - they are separated by only one hundred kilometers.  Strictly speaking, it is right to call this cluster of islands (there are thirteen in all) the Canary Archipelago.  The largest and perhaps the most popular among them is Tenerife. </p><p>  The total length of the Canary Islands from southwest to northeast is more than five hundred kilometers.  It is not known for certain which island was formed before the others, but are considered the most ancient Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.  The western islands are called younger.  In general, the origin of the archipelago is volcanic.  However, some adhere to a different version: the Canary Islands are supposedly nothing more than the mysterious Atlantis. </p><p>  Canaries are considered a place with an almost perfect climate - the temperature there is quite moderate, the air is soft, not hot and not dry due to the nearby ocean.  As a rule, the average temperature in summer and autumn is 25-27 degrees above zero, in winter and spring - from 17 to 22 degrees.  The water is also relatively warm - it does not drop below twenty degrees.  In the Canaries there is a lot of sun, a small amount of rainfall (without drought).  It is comfortable to breathe there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lanzarote, Canary Islands: A Short Excursion </h2><p>  Lanzarote is one of the oldest among the Canary archipelago.  It is believed that he was educated more than twenty million years ago.  It is medium in size - its total area is more than eight hundred and forty square kilometers; it is the fourth largest in the archipelago in size.  It got its name thanks to an Italian navigator named Lancelotto Maloseio, who visited the Canary Islands at the beginning of the fourteenth century.  Prior to this, the natives called him the word, which is translated into Russian as ‚Äúred mountain‚Äù. </p><p>  Lancelotto Maloseio owned Lanzarote for two decades, until he was expelled by the aborigines with shame.  In the new century, the Spaniard Jean de Betancourt arrived on the island and claimed his rights, so that Lanzarote became a Spanish colony.  After Betancourt, his nephew was considered the owner of Lanzarote.  However, his rule was not long - the island was constantly raided, first by Moroccan tribes (Morocco is in the immediate vicinity of Lanzarote), then the French and British.  All this led to an almost complete extermination of the population.  And initially it was Lanzarote that became the first inhabited among all the Canary Islands. </p>

Now they are "sleeping", but the last lava emissions did not happen so long ago - at the end of the nineteenth century.  It is because of the volcanoes that Lanzarote has such an unusual appearance.  Its surface is almost a third covered with ash, as if torn with cones.  It is on the island of Lanzarote that the lava cave Cueva de los Verdes is located, considered the deepest in the world.

The population is mainly represented by the Spaniards, as well as other Europeans, Africans, residents of China and even Latin America.  Among tourists, it is less popular than Tenerife, but compares favorably with discreet architecture and unique landscapes from the rest of the Canary Islands.  Lanzarote has been a nature reserve since 1993, it is forbidden to build high-rise buildings on its territory. </p><h2>  Geographic features </h2><p>  Like the other Canary Islands, Lanzarote does not have large rivers; accordingly, there is not too much fresh water (this is why a special salt water processing plant was built).  A lot of mountains, among which stand out Achaches in the south and Famara in the north.  Near the latter is a large desert. </p>

    <h2>  Lanzarote Economy </h2><p>  Lanzarote began to actively re-populate from the end of the eighteenth century.  The main occupations of the inhabitants at first were fishing and agriculture, and this brought them some kind of income.  However, with the development of tourism (in the last century), it was this particular industry that began to profit the island.  In addition, since the mid-twentieth century, the already mentioned desalination plant for ocean water has been operating in Lanzarote. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From agriculture, the most developed is the cultivation of grapes.  It is unique in that it is bred directly on volcanic stones, because the fertile layer of soil is deep under the layer of lava.  Wine is then made from this grape, which is sold to tourists and exported. </p><h2>  Climate and environmental conditions </h2><p>  Of all the Canary Islands, Lanzarote can be called the coolest.  It is never too hot here, and only for this fact you can love this place.  There is little rain in Lanzarote, but there is a lot of sun.  Strong winds constantly blow from the north side, in the south they are much smaller, because volcanoes do not let them in there.  It is always comfortable to swim in Lanzarote, as the water temperature also fluctuates in the optimal range - from twenty to twenty-two degrees of heat. </p>

Of the first, ferns, Canarian palm trees, cacti can be distinguished;  Among the latter there are a blind white crab, a gallot lizard, an Egyptian vulture - all these named wildlife representatives live only on this island.  The vulture is generally considered almost wiped off the face of the Earth.

    <h2>  Island Attractions </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Lanzarote is rich in beaches, the island has places to go and things to see - you won‚Äôt list everything.  So, Timanfaya National Park is considered one of its main attractions.  Its peculiarity is traces of solidified lava, since it is located in the very center of the island, where it is full of volcanic ash.  Guided tours are carried out in the park, not forgetting to remind tourists that under their feet there is a red-hot lava, only at a depth of several meters.  At the same time, despite the fact that there are several volcanoes on the territory of Timanfaya, only one is considered active - the eponymous, in whose honor the park got its name. </p><p>  Timanfaya Park, whose area is 51 square kilometers, began work in 1974, and seven years later, a law was passed on the protection of flora and fauna on its territory.  You can only walk around the park, ride a camel or take a bus - a special route has been laid for this purpose.  They are not allowed to go to Timanfaya by car. </p>

It is located in the north of the island, at an altitude of 470 meters.  From the site you can admire beautiful views of the Atlantic Ocean, see the Cinijo archipelago and the island of La Graciosa.  Mirador del Rio works daily, from ten in the morning until seven in the evening.  They are also popular among tourists and caves, which are more than enough in Lanzarote.  They are also located in the north and stretch six kilometers inland.  Previously, pirates found refuge there, and now in the halls of the caves there are restaurants, concert venues and even a tropical garden.

    <p>  The artist Caesar Manrique, born on it, did a lot for the island.  Thanks to Manrika, many sights appeared on Lanzarote, in particular, the already mentioned observation deck, the caves of Hameos del Aua with a salt lake, the Cactus Garden ... It is not surprising that the museum of his name also functions on the island - in the building where the artist used to live.  Among other things, it shows a personal collection of paintings by Caesar Manrique, which he collected all his life.  It includes the works of Picasso, Chillida, Tapies and other famous personalities.  The museum, opened in 1992, is the largest cultural center of the island, popular throughout the world. </p>

As already mentioned, Caesar Manrique created it.  As early as the seventies of the last century, work began, but the garden was opened only in 1990.

    <p>  At least for the sake of another attraction, you should visit the Canary Islands.  The reviews of Lanzarote for those who have been there are full of enthusiasm for Lake El Golfo.  It is relatively small, it is forbidden to swim in it, but this trifle is completely compensated by the stunning view: the coast of the lake is colored with red, green, gray, black and beige flowers of different shades.  Nearby there is access to the ocean, where skilled swimmers can plunge, and in addition, all visitors are free to walk along the nearby crater of the volcano - they often find semiprecious green stones that local jewelers actively use in their work. </p><p>  One cannot but mention the vineyards - due to the specifics of the landscape, they are all located on semicircular terraces, so you can only harvest by hand.  Their territory extends over 50 hectares.  There is a winery in Lanzarote, and even a wine museum, and also a winery where you can taste not only amazing wine, but also wonderful cheese.  The island is rich in many other no less interesting sights, it is impossible to name everything, but many can be seen in the picturesque photos of Lanzarote. </p><h2>  Cities of the island </h2><p>  Since 1852, the capital of Lanzarote has been Arrecife.  In addition, it is also the largest seaport and shopping center.  Previously, the main city of the island was Teguise.  This is its historical center, it is located ten kilometers northeast of Arrecife.  Also from the largest settlements can be distinguished Aria, Yaysu and Tias. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  No matter where a tourist arrives, one of his worries is where to live.  Lanzarote hotels provide a fairly wide selection.  Among the most popular destinations is the two-star Apartamentos La Florida in the resort of Puerto del Carmen, located just a ten-minute walk from the beach.  There is another hotel there - Apartamentos Europa, also two stars.  A higher rank is the three-star Apartamentos The Las Gaviotas, it stands almost on the beach and offers guests beautiful bungalows with all amenities.  More expensive and abruptly - the four-star Gloria Izaro Club Hotel.  And near the resort of Playa Blanca is Villa Ganesha - from it to the airport and the center of the capital is only forty minutes drive. </p>

Reviews indicate that it turns out much cheaper, therefore, if there is a certain limitation in funds, this service is the most convenient option.

    <h2>  Lanzarote Island Resorts </h2><p>  Not everyone loves passive <span>relaxation.</span>  <span>Holidays</span> in Lanzarote involve activity: diving, golf, horse riding, surfing, tennis - all this and not only available for tourists.  However, beach relaxation is also open for those who wish.  There are no large beaches in Lanzarote, as a rule, they are all of artificial origin and are small enclosed coves.  Nevertheless, all of them are characterized by a highly developed infrastructure, clean ocean and the absence of environmental pollution.  In total, the beaches occupy about sixteen kilometers of the coast, the rest are cliffs. </p>

It extends for about a kilometer.  On Las Cucaras beach in the north-east of the island, in the resort of Costa Teguise, you can go windsurfing, and El Reducto beach in the capital resembles a large swimming pool in shape.  The resort of Puerto Calejo will appeal to diving enthusiasts and sailors.  The longest of the beaches of Lanzarote is Playa de Famara.  It takes three kilometers, but its minus is in the location on the north coast, where strong winds blow.  It will be considered successful by surfers, and because of this feature it is not very suitable for swimming.  Lanzarote also has a nudist beach - near the resort of Playa Blanca.

    <h2>  Lanzarote Cuisine </h2><p>  Seafood and fish predominate in Lanzarote cuisine - and this is not strange, because the ocean is nearby.  Paella, baked potatoes, and corn grits are very popular (it is called gofio, and bakery products are baked from it).  Many delicacies are prepared using olive oil or white wine; they like to add wheat or grapes to the products.  Actively included in the diet are goat cheese, fried ham, and also local sausage - pork with the addition of paprika and garlic. </p><p>  Lanzaroteans love and willingly eat soups, for example, fish soup, corn broth, vegetable soup, potato broth.  Despite the abundance of fish and sea delicacies, meat dishes are no less popular on the island, however, meat is usually fried poorly.  Most of all restaurants, cafes and coffee houses in the resort of Puerto del Carmen, so this is where the true gourmets should go. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ol><li>  The landscape of Timanfaya National Park resembles the surface of the moon. </li><li>  Lanzarote landscapes are often shot for various movies and TV shows (Moby Dick, Doctor Who, Open Hugs, and so on). </li><li>  Volcanic eruptions destroyed dozens of villages on the island. </li><li>  More than a million tourists from different countries visit Lanzarote annually. </li><li>  If you look at the water near Lanzarote from the porthole of an airplane, you would think that clouds lie on it.  This is due to fogs. </li></ol>
