In fact, you can create such an outfit for the baby without much effort, if you know the basic secrets and features of manufacturing.  One prerequisite is that the level of skill in knitting should be at least at an average level.  Then the knitting will be neat and even, which will directly affect the appearance of the product. </p><h2>  How to get started? </h2><p>  Before you start work, you must definitely build an action plan.  The given algorithm will help to plan all the work in stages.  Those who are scrupulous about their hobbies can even make a work schedule. </p><p>  Algorithm of actions: </p><ol><li>  Knitting of children‚Äôs overalls with knitting needles always begins with the choice of tool and material. </li><li>  Then you need to choose a pattern in accordance with the features of further use of the thing. </li><li>  After that, you need to choose the design of the overalls. </li><li>  Be sure to take measurements from the baby. </li><li>  In accordance with the sketch and parameters, patterns are created. </li><li>  Each part can be knitted according to the pattern or according to a selected pattern. </li><li>  Then the product is assembled. </li></ol><p>  After finishing work, it is necessary to wash the jumpsuit and iron the thing well. </p><h2>  Features of the choice of threads </h2><p>  Knitting baby overalls with knitting need initially requires the right choice of thread.  In this case, it is worth considering the following parameters: color, thickness, quality, composition.  Each item is determined by the situations in which the thing will be used. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="overalls for overalls" class="if uuid-2871978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2871978.jpg"></div><p>  Usually, children's acrylic is chosen if the jumpsuit will be used in everyday wear or to perform the functions of warm pajamas.  If the item will be used for walking, it is better to choose an option in which wool is present in a minimal amount. </p><p>  It is also important to choose a color scheme.  Typically, gender is considered when choosing.  In addition to gender, a psychologist recommends paying attention to the preferences of the baby.  In any case, do not choose too bright or acid tones.  An ideal option would be pastel colors. </p><p>  Not the last place is quality.  It is necessary to check the thread for composition and dye.  It is important that the thread does not fade and the thread does not heat up quickly. </p><h2>  What to look for when choosing a model </h2><p>  Knitting baby overalls with knitting initially suggests a sketch.  The choice of model must be approached especially carefully, since the product for young children must meet several points: </p><ul><li>  Overalls must have a front bar to the very legs, which will be fastened with buttons or a zipper. </li><li>  It is advisable to tie the cuffs on the sleeves and panties so that the product does not move from the arms and legs, fixing with an elastic band. </li><li>  The overalls should be spacious, so when fitting sizes, it is worth adding a few extra centimeters to each parameter. </li><li>  It is worth considering the design of the overalls.  It is undesirable to knit a product with a hood or volume decorative elements, too embossed pattern.  All convex parts can dig into the skin crumbs. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.woollykins.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best option" class="if uuid-2871983" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2871983.jpg"></div><p>  Other features are associated with individual conditions and the needs of the crumbs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Option for beginners - start knitting the jumpsuit from the bottom </h2><p>  Knitting overalls from 0 can be done in three different ways.  But the simplest and fastest is the method of knitting from the bottom.  This embodiment of the work involves a separate manufacture of sleeves. </p><p>  In this way, you can knit and jumpsuit from 6 months.  The universal pattern will be the front surface.  Cuffs are knitted with a regular elastic band from the back and front loops that alternate with each other. </p><p>  In the process of doing work, you can think of a more complex design, which will have a hood for children who are already sitting - from 6 months.  As well as inserts from decorative yarn such as cones or grass. </p><h2>  Features of work when knitting from the bottom </h2><p>  Knitting children's overalls with knitting needles with a description will help you do the job quickly and efficiently.  The presented option involves the creation of a product in size 56, that is, the jumpsuit is suitable for a baby about 52-54 centimeters tall and weighs 3.5-3.8 kg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesprucecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting elastic for cuffs" class="if uuid-2871999" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2871999.jpg"></div><ol><li>  You need to dial 50 loops and knit 3-5 cm of elastic.  Go to the garter stitch and knit in this way another 13-14 centimeters. </li><li>  Without closing the loop, finish work on the part, tearing the thread, leaving at least 20 cm. </li><li>  In the same way, we begin to knit the second leg. </li><li>  When the second leg is ready, you need to put the loops of the first part on the spoke.  In this case, it is necessary that the thread from the second work is on the opposite edge from the beginning of the first part. </li><li>  Then the usual knitting of all the loops that are on the working knitting needles is performed.  Two parts are joined seamlessly. </li><li>  Having knitted the fabric until 25-27 cm from the start of work, you need to close the middle 4 loops to form an armhole. </li><li>  When the 4 middle loops close, you get two shelves that fit separately. </li><li>  Having knitted another 5 centimeters of the shelf where the working thread remained, it is worthwhile to reduce for the armholes of the sleeve and neck.  It is necessary to reduce 3 loops for the sleeve through 2 rows. </li><li>  When the decrease for the sleeve ends, you need to decrease for the neck, where the zipper will be fixed, another 4 loops every 2 rows. </li><li>  In the same way, the second shelf of overalls ends. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="finished part of the product" class="if uuid-2872152" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2872152.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of knitting sleeves and forming a hood </h2><p>  If you plan to create a jumpsuit with a hood, then you need to finish the shelves as follows: </p><ol><li>  When the first shelf is finished, you need to tear the thread at a distance of 20 cm from work.  In this case, the loops do not close. </li><li>  At the end of the second shelf, you need to bring the thread to the opposite edge from the first shelf.  Put the hinges back on the work knitting needles and knit the hood according to the same principle as the legs at the very beginning. </li><li>  Usually a fabric is knitted that has a length of 18-20 cm. Close the loop.  Fold the fabric along and sew the halves at the top. </li></ol><p>  Such a seam will be located in the upper part of the head, so the crumb will not lie on it, which means that the relief element will not press in the supine position.  Thus, knitting a jumpsuit with a hood can be done without much effort and skill, and the finished thing will turn out to be comfortable for the baby. </p><div class="photo" data-original="intheloopknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="model with a hood" class="if uuid-2872128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2872128.jpg"></div><p>  Then you need to tie the sleeves, which are made separately in accordance with the work plan: </p><ol><li>  Get 50 loops.  Tie an elastic band of the same height as on the legs. </li><li>  Tie 15 cm with a garter stitch. </li><li>  Make reductions similar to those performed when knitting shelves. </li><li>  Close the loop. </li></ol><p>  The second sleeve is knitted in the same way. </p><h2>  How to assemble the product </h2><p>  The last step in the manufacture of overalls is the assembly.  But before stitching the parts, you need to wash the product and iron it through gauze. </p><p>  Assembly principle: </p><ol><li>  Using a needle or hook, connect the seam on the legs. </li><li>  Sew on sleeves. </li><li>  Sew a zipper to connect 2 shelves. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="knanaknits.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="version of the overalls model for the newborn" class="if uuid-2872116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2872116.jpg"></div><p>  Thus, a knitted baby jumpsuit for the newborn will be completely ready for use.  The item can be worn at home or for a walk. </p>
