This is a mountainous area, where in some places the mountains approach the ocean itself.  The coastline stretched as much as 90 km.  It has a wonderful climate and no environmental problems. </p><p>  Another distinguishing feature of the emirate is that it does not have access to the Persian Gulf coast, as in other parts of the state. </p><p>  <span>The population of the emirate</span> lives mainly on the coastline (80%). </p><p>  There are many hotels in the emirate, people come here not only for taking sea and sun baths, but also for diving and fishing, because the Indian Ocean is a wonderful underwater world.  In addition, the water is crystal clear, there is even a tiger shark. </p><h2>  Climate and geographical features </h2><p>  Al Fujairah - the emirate with the most ideal climate in the whole country.  In summer, it is not as hot as in other parts of the state, but in winter, on the contrary, the water is warmer compared to the Persian Gulf.  There is little rainfall during the year, at 102 mm.  The average annual temperature is 26.9 degrees. </p><p>  July is the warmest month (33.6 degrees), January is the coldest when the temperature drops to +19 degrees. </p><p>  The emirate itself is located in the center of the Hajar Mountains on the Arabian Peninsula.  Al Fujairah has many spring wells and beautiful fertile valleys. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fujairahtoday.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="surrounding beauty" class="if uuid-2536470" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536470.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical background and modern economics </h2><p>  Al Fujairah is the youngest emirate of the state; it gained its independence only in 1953.  Prior to that, he was part of the emirate of Sharjah.  Since 1971, it has been part of the UAE as a separate administrative-territorial unit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is no main wealth of the country - oil, but there is a magnificent coast and a developing port.  The main economic activities of the emirate are agriculture and fishing. </p><p>  Sheikhs of the UAE in this emirate: </p><ul><li>  Hamad I bin Abdallah (1876-1936); </li><li>  Muhammad bin Hamad (1936-1974); </li><li>  Hamad II bin Muhammad, rules from 1974 to the present. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.tawyeen.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sheikhs in a meeting" class="if uuid-2536468" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536468.jpg"></div><h2>  Capital </h2><p>  The capital is the city of the same name Al Fujairah.  In tourist catalogs the name Fujairah is often used.  It is a village with wide streets, sculptures and fountains.  50 thousand people live in the city, the city itself is very comfortable due to the fact that there are practically no skyscrapers, in any case, there are very few of them.  But then the existing skyscrapers, which in their beauty are not inferior to the skyscrapers of Dubai.  It is here that government and state institutions are located. </p><p>  But first of all, the city is famous for its fountains, which not only delight the eye, but also carry the life-giving coolness, which is so necessary in the hot climate of the country. </p><p>  There is a modern airport and seaport. </p><p>  People do not live in the Old Town; it is concentrated around the Portuguese fort, surrounded by dilapidated buildings.  This territory is an architectural monument of the 17th century.  It is very beautiful in winter, when a bush has a bright color on Mount Hajar. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fujairahtoday.ae" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="modern city" class="if uuid-2536467" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536467.jpg"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Like the other emirates of the UAE, this territory is famous for its coast.  The city has a very diverse landscape: sandy beaches and gorges, mountainous capes, greenery and mineral springs. </p><p>  Al Aqah Beach Al Fujairah is a beautiful coast of the Indian Ocean, there is golden sand and magnificent surrounding nature.  It is 49 km from the capital of the emirate.  The total length of the beach is 50 km.  Here you can meet vacationers with children and divers.  On the coast, a popular form of recreation is scooter safari. </p><p>  Snoopy Island is a paradise for divers.  There are beautiful coral reefs, clear water and sea turtles.  And from the variegation of the color of the fish it is impossible to take your eyes off.  On the island there are hotels and a diving school, where they will teach the art of diving to a vacationer with any training. </p><p>  Another popular spot among divers is Shark Island.  Here you can see beautiful corals and lobsters, octopuses and electric rays.  Near the island there is always a comfortable temperature of water + 25 degrees, and a depth of 5 to 35 m. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.3indubai.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="amazing UAE" class="if uuid-2536471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536471.jpg"></div><h2>  What to watch and where to go? </h2><p>  The city has a bazaar that works only on Fridays, which attracts tourists.  Here you can buy magnificent carpets and pottery.  Although you can buy almost everything, but the most important thing is that you can, and even need to bargain. </p><p>  It is impossible to imagine the UAE emirates without mosques.  Here the oldest mosque is built not only in the country, but also in the world, it is called Al-Bidiya.  By some estimates, she is about 500 years old.  It is here that you can see the forgotten and traditional architectural style for the Ottoman Empire.  Four domes are supported by one central pillar, the mosque itself is white-stone, very elegant inside and rough outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ounousa.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of Fujairah" class="if uuid-2536466" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2536466.jpg"></div><p>  Fujairah Fort is a 16th-century historical monument located along the Castle Road.  This is an ancient conical-shaped fortress, the top of which is crowned with pyramid-shaped towers, which once served as watch posts.  The fort is well watched, and not so long ago, reconstruction was carried out in it. </p><p>  And, of course, having arrived in Al Fujairah, you should visit the hot healing springs.  At the source of Ain al-Gamur people come to treat rheumatism and skin diseases, with separate pools, for men and women.  Here the water temperature is from +50 to +60 degrees.  Sources are surrounded by a beautiful park, hotels are built in the park area. </p>
