It is useful in many ways.  Here is the development of imagination, creative abilities, and motor skills of children's hands, the formation of precision movements, a beneficial effect on the psyche.  The application “Autumn” from colored paper, like other crafts of this kind, makes it possible to learn how to use scissors well, carefully cutting out various small details;  use glue, evenly distributing it on the surface of paper or fabric.  Kids learn the basics of drawing.  Therefore, such fine art lessons are extremely important in the general system of training and education in preschool institutions.

Aesthetic feeling - a sense of beauty - is inherent in the child from the beginning, and the task of the teacher is to cultivate it carefully and methodically.  In art classes it is more convenient to do this than in others.  In addition, if we are talking about an older group, the application “Autumn” from colored paper can be accompanied by suitable poetic lines.  Thus, the teacher synthesizes literary reading and fine arts, which will make the lesson more interesting and productive.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ideas for Compositions </h2><p>  Children's applications on the theme of "Autumn" can be extremely diverse.  But, as a rule, they are systematized according to the following thematic groups.  The first is elegant autumnal nature.  These are trees in bright color foliage, greenery of still not wilted grass, the sun and small clouds.  Children's applications on the theme “Autumn” of the second group also belong to landscape sketches, but of a different type.  Here you can see naked trees, a dark background of paintings, bare ground with fallen leaves on it, gloomy clouds.  The voluminous application on the theme “Autumn” will turn out to be more expressive and original, especially if the child uses not only paper, but also “living” material: twigs, leaves, grass blades, cones, rowan berries or viburnum.  Well, the third type of work includes paintings with the plot “Harvesting” or “Generous Gifts of Autumn”.  The fourth group is animals of the autumn season.  The fifth can be called so: "Natural Ornaments."  Let's take a closer look at each. </p><h2>  Eye charm </h2><p>  What might a <span>voluminous applique</span> on the theme “Autumn Golden” look like?  Invite the guys from brown paper to cut out the silhouette of a large tree or several, but smaller in size, with sprawling branches.  Paste them with the kids together on a landscape or cardboard sheet.  You will get a forest glade or a mall of the park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="voluminous applique on the theme of autumn" class="if" height="207" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/585822.jpg" width="309"></div>  Now the crowns.  Real <span>autumn leaves</span> collected by children for a walk are great for them.  Experienced educators, by the way, can combine a lesson in teaching application sticking with learning to count.  Invite the guys to glue one sheet on one tree, two on the other, etc. Tell me not to glue the whole sheet, but a small part of it, with a glue.  Then the volumetric applique “Autumn” will turn out, and not flat.  Next, from the green paper, draw grass and other landscape elements with your students.  If there are no living leaves at hand, you can cut them out of colored paper.

Invite your wards to bring from the house to the next lesson in fine arts a little pasta - shells, spirals, pasta.  What for?  Now let’s explain.  Again, cut out the silhouette of the tree from brown paper.  Previously, of course, drawing it on the back - white - side.  Stick on the base sheet.

    <h2>  Painting with plot </h2><p>  Using natural material, kids can make interesting story crafts.  The application on the theme "Autumn" does not have to be only landscape.  Let her hedgehog go out on a mushroom hunt.  You will need to realize the idea of ​​leaves and tassels of mountain ash with berries, linden, aspen, oak, maple and others.  From two leaves - brownish and yellowish or beige shades and heart-shaped - glue the hedgehog.  A light sheet, small, will become a muzzle, dark, larger in size - a back with needles.  Draw the nose with a black felt-tip pen, cut the eye out of paper and stick it.  From the same tree leaves, suitable in shape and color, build fungi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="appliques autumn for children" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/585818.jpg" width="524"></div>  You can stick to the paper and small branches of a Christmas tree.  Then your application will resemble a spruce meadow.  And green leaves and blades of grass will replace real grass.  Glue the dried rowan berries to them, not forgetting to decorate a thirsty hedgehog with a few things.  Surely such a composition will lead little artists to the delight!

    <h2>  3D application </h2><p>  And nevertheless, it is volumetric paper application that is more interesting to children.  Autumn can be portrayed in different ways, the main thing here is creative ideas, imagination and a little skill.  For example, is it possible to combine application and sculpture?  It turns out that even if the working material is thick paper and colored napkins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="napkin applique autumn" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/585821.jpg" width="520"></div>  So, a small piece of thick brown or gray paper, from which shopping bags are made, first carefully knead, and then, slightly curled with a tourniquet, attach with glue to the base sheet.  This is a volumetric <span>tree trunk.</span>  Let its lower part be slightly expanded.  So your tree looks more natural, believable.  Spread the top of the barrel a bit, like a fan.  Now take the usual paper table napkins in green and yellow, crush them, giving a shape resembling leaves, and stick to the trunk, forming a spreading crown.  Here you can make such a chic autumn tree if you take a non-standard approach to the task!  Such an application from napkins “Autumn” will take its rightful place among the best crafts of the group.

Therefore, if you offer them to design a game room, a corridor, a dining room or a bedroom in a kindergarten in the autumn style, they will agree without hesitation.  In this case, applications can be made directly on the walls.  All the guys in the group will be involved.  Some draw leaves on colored paper, others cut them out, while others, under the guidance of a tutor, draw up a <span>wall panel.</span>  Applique elements are pasted either in random order, or forming certain patterns.  A huge plus of such an activity is that kids learn to work in a close-knit team and gain important skills in arranging their home in a playful way.  And it’s just very interesting for them to observe how the familiar environment is changing.  And after such an event, children with great desire will come to the kindergarten, in their group.

Ask your pets how they imagine the apple orchard.  But emphasize that the garden is autumn.  Surely the children will depict trunks in brown or gray, the crown in green and yellow and ripe, juicy apples in red circles.  For a realistic picture, let a few apples appear below, under the trees.  And such a composition, for example, looks very picturesque.  Take the base sheet and stick black colored paper on it.  This is the background.  From yellow and orange cut out the silhouettes of pumpkins of different shapes and sizes.  Fix them on the background sheet.  Now cut thin, twisting strips-stems and serrated leaves from green paper.  Glue to the pumpkins.  Real autumn melon, right?  Bright, elegant, impressive.  The main thing is to do the work carefully.  And if you offer kids to draw funny faces on pumpkins, you will get a peculiar illustration to the famous fairy tale by Gianni Rodari “The Adventures of Cipollino”.

    <h2>  Merry corn </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of autumn gifts, invite the children to depict corn cobs on applications.  Children generally like cheerful yellow and green colors and use them most often in their work.  Therefore, they will like the idea.  And composition is easy to master, therefore even small ones can cope with the task. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="autumn gifts" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/585815.jpg" width="423"></div>  First you should draw, cut and paste the ear itself.  Explain to the children the features of its shape.  Boys will understand you perfectly, if you compare it with the body of a rocket.  Then the leaves.  They should cover only the lower part of the cob, diverging in different directions.  It remains to depict the grains.  You can simply cut out arbitrary small pieces from multi-colored paper and stick on the cob.  Here is such a funny corn!
