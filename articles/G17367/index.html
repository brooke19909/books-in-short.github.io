    <h2>  Credit Check </h2><p>  Credit history refers to information about the borrower for the repayment of loans.  It is necessary to assess the integrity of previous payments.  This information is checked when applying for a new loan.  The Bureau stores information on loans granted, as well as on those that were refused.  But if the bank approved the application, and the client did not want to get a loan, then such an entry is not recorded. </p><p>  In Russia, <span>credit histories are checked by</span> banking organizations at the time of receiving a loan.  Information is stored for 10 years from the date of the last change.  The credit history is canceled after the expiration of the term, by a court decision.  Alfa-Bank also checks it when applying for a loan.  The advantage is enjoyed by customers who have a positive credit history. </p><h2>  Rate </h2><p>  A loan in Alfa Bank in cash (without information including) is issued at an individual rate.  It is affected by the size of the loan and the category of client.  Salary clients will have less overpayments.  For them, the rate will be from 16.99%.  Corporate clients receive loans at least 17.99%, and the rest - from 23.99%. </p><h2>  Required documents </h2><p>  What is needed to get a loan from Alfa-Bank without information and guarantors?  The reviews indicate that it is required to collect documents, but their list depends on the category of the borrower.  Much less paperwork needs to be provided with a salary card.  It is enough to have a passport and a second document, for example, TIN or SNILS. </p><p>  Employees of partner banks need to prepare a statement of income.  The rest of the citizens will confirm their income with a 2-NDFL certificate.  A third document is also needed, for example: </p><ol><li>  Employment history. </li><li>  Title for a car from 4 years. </li><li>  International passport. </li><li>  Medical policy. </li></ol><h2>  Loan repayment </h2><p>  Loans received (in cash, without income statements and any other loans) must be paid in a timely manner.  The bank offers various payment methods: </p><ul><li>  ATMs </li><li>  transfers via the Internet and mobile bank; </li><li>  terminals and ATMs of ICD and UBRD; </li><li>  through bookkeeping at work; </li><li>  with the help of partners: Golden Crown, Eleksnet, Rapida. </li></ul><p>  If there is a possibility of early payment or part of it, then you need to notify the bank specialists about this by calling the hotline.  In case of partial early closure, the amount of payment must be at least 15 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alpha bank credit card and cash loan" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1831044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  A loan without references and guarantors at Alfa Bank is considered one of the most convenient.  But, like any other banking product, it has pros and cons.  Of the advantages we can distinguish: </p><ul><li>  quick review of the application; </li><li>  large amounts; </li><li>  refusal of insurance; </li><li>  many payment options. </li></ul><p>  In the presence of urgent daily needs, it is the loan that will help out.  The amount is issued to the client immediately after the contract.  It remains only to make payments in a timely manner, and then in the future the bank will offer more favorable conditions for cooperation. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the following: </p><ul><li>  the minimum amount of prepayment is 15 thousand rubles; </li><li>  increase in the rate for borrowers from the "standard" category; </li><li>  proof of income (except for holders of salary cards). </li></ul><p>  Alfa-Bank is a large organization in the market, offering favorable conditions.  More benefits apply to payroll card holders.  They are provided with funds for a long period without commissions, as well as with the possibility of refusing personal insurance. </p>
