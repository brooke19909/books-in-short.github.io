Of course, beyond the tropical sun, warm sea, an abundance of exotic fruits!  And also for truly Chinese peace, meditation.  It is so pleasant to find yourself in the arms of summer in the middle of winter!  Hainan Island lies in the tropical zone, so the peak of the season falls on the period when Russia is cold, windy, snowy.  Isn't that a fairy tale?  Hainan Island is also popular among the Chinese themselves.  Many people come from the mainland in season to enjoy sea bathing.  The most lively resort on the island is the city of Sanya, and the most beautiful bay is Dadonghai (Great East Sea).  There is a developed tourist infrastructure and a lot of entertainment.  But where to stay in Sanya?  Your attention is invited to the hotel South <span>China Hotel</span> 4 *.  We built a description of its merits on the reviews of those who have already visited there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="South China Hotel 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1423966.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resort specifics </h2><p>  Stars of Chinese hotels are very arbitrary.  And Hainan Island is no exception in this regard.  Hoteliers sculpt stars on the facade as they please, but this does not guarantee the quality of service.  Sometimes in the "four" is better than in a hotel, the class of which is declared as "luxury".  Therefore, when choosing a hotel in China, you should always read reviews.  About South China Hotel 4 * almost all of them are positive.  What you need to know about the resort of Sanya?  This is the most popular Russian tourists city on the island of Hainan.  Whether this is good or bad is up to you.  But people who do not know foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill be comfortable here.  The inscriptions on the stores are duplicated in Russian.  Local people also understand you well (especially merchants).  Restaurants and cafes have a menu in Russian.  Sanya has a resort area.  She goes to the bay and is called by his name - Dadonghai.  Russians pronounce this name as Dadonghai.  The sea here is clean and mostly calm.  Entry into the water is also very good.  The beach has plenty of fun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="South China Hotel 4 (Dadonghai)" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1423972.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is located outside the city limits of Sanya, thirteen kilometers from the resort center.  But the hotel is located in the Dadonghai zone and stands directly on the shores of the Great East Sea.  The hotel has its own beach.  From the Phoenix Sanya International Airport to the hotel, drive about twenty kilometers.  Sauce China Hotel 4 was one of the first built in Dadonghai.  The year of its foundation is nineteen ninety-two.  Of course, since that time the hotel has gone through many reconstructions and renovations.  She even changed the owner.  The last repair was five years ago.  Reviews say that new furniture and sanitary ware appeared in the rooms, the famous Harbin restaurant was opened on the whole island, where people come to have dinner from other resorts of the island.  The hotel territory is constantly being landscaped and ennobled.  Therefore, the Garden View rooms are the cheapest and really overlook the blooming garden, in addition, there is no need to pay extra for a sea view. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="South China Hotel 4 pics" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1423967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Best show the merits of South China Hotel 4 * photo.  The pictures show that this is a real hotel complex.  And the reviews claim that its area should be at least fifty thousand square meters.  A flowering tropical garden, full of exotic plants, gradually descends to the sea, to the wonderful sandy beach on which coconut palms grow.  On the territory of the hotel complex stands an eight-story building.  Groups and those who prefer to live in large hotels settle there.  A little at a distance are two four-story cottages.  They are of different price categories.  In the main building, called "A", there is an elevator.  But since this building is old, all rooms in it have no balconies.  The most budgetary is the four-story cottage "C".  It is without an elevator and balconies.  But in the case "B" all this is available.  The most luxurious are two-story villas.  There are eight of them in the hotel complex.  Beautiful brand new buildings of original architecture are very close to the beach, have sea views and are surrounded by lush greenery of the garden.  Despite the fact that the hotel is located outside the city, it is adjoined by various entertainment venues, restaurants and shops. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="South China Hotel 4 Dadonghai" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1423969.jpg" width="600"></div>
