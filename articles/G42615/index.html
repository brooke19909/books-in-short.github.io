Start making markup by eye, and you will surely succeed.  The result may not be as elegant and beautiful as that of Antonio Gaudi, but it will surely absorb the elements of curvature and non-parallelism of all the architectural elements of your design. </p><p>  And in order to get angles and surfaces minimally conjugated with the horizon, you will definitely have to use some kind of plumb line or level.  To build the ideal lines of walls and ceilings, you need a modern plane builder.  The laser device will ensure a 100% hit in the horizontal plane and help to get absolute vertical lines. </p><p>  Further in the article is information that will help you navigate the world of modern laser technology. </p>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The <span>laser source</span> at the output gives a powerful and thin beam of light.  And the alignment system automatically balances this ray relative to the horizon.  For simple models, special pendulum compensators do this.  More complex instruments use built-in inclinometers and electric servos. </p><p>  With automatic adjustment, beam alignment occurs without human intervention.  The only thing that the master initially needs to do is set the laser level with a maximum horizontal deviation of 3-5%.  The plane builder requires the same pre-installation. </p><p>  If the device does not have automation elements, then for its horizontal installation, the built-in bubble level is used.  Alignment is done manually.  Most often, such simple laser devices look like long rulers for straight lines of any inclination. </p><h2>  What is the difference between a level and a plane builder </h2><p>  In everyday practice, such an established concept as the laser level, or level (niveau - French) is usually used.  To understand the general meaning of this is enough.  In professional construction, laser levels are used for marking over long distances and areas.  Plane builders have a shorter beam radius. </p><p>  This is due to the fact that the level does not build a light line, it gives a point.  Due to this, the concentrated energy of the light beam hits further along the distance.  And the dispersion of light energy along the solid lines of the perimeter does not allow this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Therefore, where you need to make markings over long distances and very large areas, a laser level is used.  And in small rooms - a plane builder.  The builder's laser beam draws solid lines of light on floors, walls and ceilings.  It is very convenient, although not so long-range. </p><p>  By the way, the traditional optical level in the same way gives a point, more precisely, a target mark.  It is clearly visible in the eye of the device.  Therefore, when the laser device works only pointwise and does not draw a solid line, it would be more correct to use the word "level". </p><p>  There are devices on sale that combine both methods of beam construction - linear and point.  For advanced models, a special laser receiver is included with the device.  This allows you to expand the range of the device several times.  For example, the Bosch GCL 25 laser plane builder builds lines in the range of 10 meters.  With the receiver, its radius of action increases to 30 meters. </p>

    <h2>  Laser Levels </h2><p>  Most often in construction, the so-called rotational laser levels are used.  What it is?  These are devices in which the light beam moves in a circle thanks to a special rotational mechanism.  Hence its name is rotational, that is, rotating (rotatio - rotation, lat.). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The rotary head is automatically aligned horizontally.  The rotation speed of professional models is regulated using the remote control.  Up to a turn-based movement with a full stop. </p><p>  In addition to horizontal rotation, some devices allow operation in vertical mode.  That is, the same rotational mechanism head describes a full circle with a laser beam in a vertical plane. </p><p>  To fix the light beam, the kit includes special monochrome glasses and a laser receiver.  Using the receiver, the beam can be accurately positioned on the surface.  After this, a mark is made with a marker or pencil. </p><p>  Once again, pay attention to the fact that laser levels are used for marking large spaces.  Plane builders are more interesting for small spaces.  For example apartments. </p>

    <h2>  Laser plotters </h2><p>  Their appearance significantly increased the speed of construction work and improved their quality.  Why are they so interesting? </p><p>  Laser plotter draws solid light lines on the surface.  On the ceiling, walls and floor.  For example, the laser plane builder Bosch GLL 3-80 P draws one horizontal line and two vertical ones.  A horizontal line is projected onto all the walls of the room, outlining the full perimeter.  And vertical ones go perpendicular to each other, starting on the floor and converging on the ceiling. </p><p>  In addition to building lines, professional models mark one light point underneath on the floor, and the other is done on the ceiling.  Thus, building a vertical luminous plummet.  For example, the laser plane builder ADA 3D Liner 3V has such functionality. </p><p>  Most models scan the lines between 120-160 °.  But the laser plane 3D plotter has already appeared on sale.  Such a tool can draw solid lines without gaps in all planes.  For example, the previously mentioned Bosch GLL 3-80 P does an excellent job of this. </p>

    <h2><br>  Laser makers </h2><p>  The name itself conceals the essence of this device.  He builds static light lines in space - axis.  The rig builder does not draw anything on the surface; he projects a light point.  Due to this, the beam range is much greater than that of the plane builder. </p><p>  In old simple models, automatic alignment may not be.  But this is already a rarity.  In modern devices, level adjustment is automatic.  And if you wish, the beam can be firmly fixed.  This is convenient when working with sloping markings. </p><p>  The device is small in size, so it is very easy to carry on the belt.  For the builder, the mast builder is a good auxiliary tool, which, if necessary, can replace the plane builder. </p>

    <h2>  What can be done with laser tools </h2><p>  Everything that was previously done at a construction site using water, bubble or other levels can be easily replaced with laser devices.  For example, with their help you can: </p><ol><li>  Install supports, columns and any vertical structures. </li><li>  Collect walls and partitions. </li><li>  Glue the tile. </li><li>  Mount multi-level ceilings. </li><li>  Set the angle of inclination of various building elements.  For example, sewers, downpours or stairs. </li><li>  Expose window and door blocks. </li><li>  Align the line of windows in height and horizontal. </li><li>  Install hinged elements.  For example, furniture. </li><li>  Monitor accuracy at all stages of construction. </li></ol><p>  And much more.  For example, imagine installing a door frame.  What happened before?  Plain metal plummet on a thread.  You can work with it with good accuracy.  But after using the modern laser level, the desire to use a metal plummet completely disappears. </p><p>  How can I return to the metal plummet, at least once having tried a modern plane builder in my work?  A laser device installed in the doorway immediately draws all the lines around the perimeter.  At the same time, they are perfectly balanced vertically.  Putting a box is a pleasure. </p>

    <h2><br>  Disadvantages of laser devices </h2><p>  To date, no significant drawbacks have been found in laser technology.  All plane builders and levels work reliably enough.  The accuracy of building lines and points is very high.  Professional laser levels work with an error of no more than 2-3 mm at a distance of 50 meters.  This is a very high precision. </p><p>  Sometimes defects may occur due to the build quality of the device.  For example, loose contact of the batteries in the connectors.  For this reason, batteries may not be fully charged and, as a result, may lose charge capacity.  But this happens quite rarely. </p><h2><br>  Laser plotter.  How to choose? </h2><p>  First you need to decide - for what purposes you need a device.  The functionality of the tool and its cost will depend on this.  According to the classification, all laser devices are divided into three types: </p><ul><li>  Household. </li><li>  Semi-professional. </li><li>  Professional. </li></ul><p>  The main differences will be in the power of radiation and the ability to build closed loops.  For example, a 3D laser plotter is very useful for professional interior decoration.  360 <sup>0</sup> circular drawing of lines will be in this case very much in demand. </p><h2><br>  The main criteria when choosing laser tools </h2><p>  For home use, a household plane builder is quite suitable.  The laser beam of the device calmly draws lines and puts the points you need anywhere.  The solid contour will lie within 120 <sup>°</sup> .  You will have the opportunity to build vertical and horizontal with a single intersection.  This is enough for home repairs and other household needs. </p><p>  Semi-professional laser tools will be needed if you are engaged in repair or construction on an ongoing basis.  They have more advanced functionality.  For example, they can simultaneously build one horizontal and four vertical lines.  Dot.  Have a complete laser receiver. </p><p>  A professional laser tool speaks for itself.  He is the most expensive, most accurate and most long-range.  With a large set of additional functions, which in everyday conditions, as a rule, will not be in demand. </p>
