Many tourists, especially those who want to learn new facts during the trip, come here for a good vacation, and often with their families. </p><p>  Travel agencies always have several hotel options that can be offered to tourists for a vacation, one of them is Vrissiana Beach Hotel, which differs from all others in its unusual hull - it is made in the form of a large boat.  This appearance attracts the attention of tourists, which they often write about in their comments. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vrissiana beach hotel 4 cyprus protaras" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/2063849.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  The date of construction of the hotel is considered to be 1985, however, despite this, at the moment it has a fairly modern appearance, as well as technical equipment inside.

One of the last major renovations was completed in 2008, after which he was assigned a new category - "4 stars". </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Vrissiana Beach Hotel is located in Protaras in the very center of it.  There are many places for entertainment that can be visited both in the daytime and at night.
