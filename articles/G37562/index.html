    <p>  Special attention deserves the cottage village of White Lake.  It is located in the immediate vicinity of the sanatorium and is called the ‚ÄúRussian Village‚Äù.  This is a series of beautiful, new cottages, which are made in the old Russian style.  The design idea is embodied not only in a wooden log house and carved windows.  Embroidered towels and tablecloths, wooden furniture and dishes, icons on the walls - all this recalls the life of our ancestors. </p><h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  Going on vacation to White Lake, first decide what you expect to receive.  If it is important for you to be alone with untouched, virgin nature, to breathe in healing air, to experience the magical properties of healing mud, then you need to be in the Nikolaev district of the Ulyanovsk region.  Here you can have a great vacation without burden for the family budget, plenty of fun and sit with a fishing rod on the beach.  If comfort and prestige are important to you, then welcome to the Moscow region.  Local clean air also contributes to the healing of the body, and in combination with a high level of service and well-organized leisure forms an excellent impression of a vacation. </p>
