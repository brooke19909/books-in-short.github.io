    <p>  Black - the most famous African rhino - lives in East Africa.  Scientists have nearly 3 thousand animals of this species.  They live, uniting in small groups, or in pairs, and sometimes alone.  Horns of different sizes, like the white rhino, have black. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rhino cub is called" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47158/1737584.jpg" width="600"></div>  Prefers to live in humid places near lakes, rivers and swamps.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Indian rhinoceros is a one-horned animal, on the dermis there are multiple folds.  Outwardly, he looks like a rhino in military armor.  Animals are very warlike, live up to 25 years. </p><p>  Javanese rhinoceros is one of the rare animals that lives in Indonesia.  There are only 50 individuals.  Animals have one horn (females can be hornless), a long head, and smaller in size than other species. </p><p>  The Sumatran bicorn rhino lives on the island of Sumatra and northeastern India.  His dermis is covered with bristles, one horn is small in size.  The species is endangered, only 150 individuals. </p><h2>  Lifestyle </h2><p>  Rhinos go to a watering place daily, making a path of 8‚Äì10 km.  There, for a long time, they cross over from side to side in coastal silt.  Gigantic baths of huge animals are ready to take all day.  So they are saved from intolerable heat and annoying insects. </p><p>  After a dirty bath, rhinos, covered in a thick layer of wet silt, go to sleep in the shade.  As evening approaches, they go to pasture.  On the way, they freely make their way through the impassable thicket, tearing out small trees, bushes, and throw them under their feet.  Huge and clumsy animals run fast, developing a speed of up to 48 km / h.  Animals sleep at night in a deep sleep for 8‚Äì9 hours.  I wonder what is the name of the rhino cub that sleeps?  Aboriginal children call them stag. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Rhinos are unpretentious to food.  They eat bushes with thorns, tree roots, thick branches.  They eat a lot and chew poorly, swallowing everything with earth and stones.  With a finger-shaped trunk, which is located on the lip, the animal can take very small objects and put it on its tongue. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Breeding </h2><p>  <em>Indian rhinos</em> .

    <p>  In the mating season, males conduct fights, pursue their rivals, showing their strength and power to the females. </p><p>  <em>Black rhino</em> .  There is no specific season for the breeding season.  Homosexual individuals of this species of rhino are found only for mating.  The gestation period lasts 16 months. </p><p>  <em>White rhino</em> .  Sexual maturity in females occurs at 4-5 years.  They will be ready for breeding by 6‚Äì7 years.  The male half is ready for mating after reaching 10-12 years.  In battles for the female, the strongest wins.  The winning male leads the female to its territory and marks its borders, which are constantly patrolled.  Throughout the mating period, the female cannot leave his possession.  After the conception of offspring, couples live together for about twenty days.  The female is born offspring for 16 months, after 2-3 years they are again ready for reproduction. </p><p>  In some species of rhino, the female first begins mating, attacking the male and hitting him in the side. </p><p>  Newborn rhinos weigh from 20 to 35 kg.  The baby has a small bump on its head - this is the future horn.  Mother‚Äôs milk is fed for two years.  A few minutes after birth, they are ready to move independently.  They do not part with their mother until 3.5 years.  What is a rhino cub called?  Many animal lovers are wondering, and so they call him - rhino cub. </p><p>  The female loves her offspring and gently takes care of them.  Mother very fiercely guards her children from ferocious predators who almost never manage to feast on young offspring.  Of particular danger to the younger generation are lions and hyenas. </p><p>  Female white rhinos with their offspring form groups of 10-14 individuals.  In black rhinos, there are pairs consisting of a mother and a baby. </p><p>  If young offspring are lost, then mothers track them down in the wake.  An animal can be very aggressive and attack a person if it approaches a female with a cub. </p><h2>  What is a rhino cub called? </h2><p>  There is no single answer to this question.  Some sources say that rhino cubs have no other name, in others they are called calves.  In colloquial speech, the name rhinoceros or rhinoceros is found.  What is the name of the rhino cub?  The dictionary of T. Efremova says that it is called a rhinoceros. </p>
