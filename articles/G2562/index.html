It happens that the arrows turned out beautiful, the lipstick fell well on the lips, but the eyebrows could not work out.  This situation is relevant for girls with a thinned or uneven shape.  For this reason, it's never too late to make eyebrow stencils with your own hands.  They will change even the most hopeless situation.  They will also help to make beautiful, bright and, most importantly, even edges. </p><h2>  What is a stencil? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="theneonleopard.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Using a stencil" class="if uuid-3142936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3142936.jpg"></div><p>  Today, most of the female population of the planet thanks the creator of the stencils, as they greatly facilitated life.  Such devices can change shape or bend very quickly.  The essence of use is that you need to attach the invention to the eyebrow, remove excess hair, and draw the missing ones with a pencil in tone.  To remove excess hair, you can use tweezers or a technique using threads. </p><p>  For a beautiful image, it is possible to print stencils for eyebrows, it is very simple to make them with your own hands a similar option.  We will deal with the problem in more detail below. </p><h2>  DIY Eyebrow Stencil Shape </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.printablee.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of size stencils" class="if uuid-3142940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3142940.jpg"></div><p>  To create a fixture, templates are required that have different bends, lengths and widths.  Such a variety is necessary so that a girl with any form can find the ‚Äúsame‚Äù stencil for herself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, in order not to make a mistake in choosing, a special marking is put on the inventions, which makes it clear what bending height and size a suitable eyebrow should have. </p><p>  To understand the difference, you need to see how any of the many stencils on eyebrows will look like.  It will immediately become apparent that you need a size smaller or larger. </p><p>  In order not to create unnecessary hassle for herself and run around shopping once again, girls wonder how to make a stencil with their own hands?  The procedure is quite simple, but requires attention, especially from those who are limited in the materials for the creation. </p><h2>  Variations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stencils with the shape of the letter T" class="if uuid-3142939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3142939.jpg"></div><p>  Before you learn how to make eyebrow stencils with your own hands and templates for them, you need to understand how they will be attached. </p><p>  There are four effective options: </p><ol><li>  A template of plain paper and adhesive tape - it does not need to be constantly supported, just stick it on and get down to business.  If the line accidentally went in the wrong direction, this will not cause irritation, since the device creates clear boundaries, beyond which the eyebrow will not go.  It is important that such a template is disposable. </li><li>  In the form of a mask or a pattern - the shape resembles the letter "T".  It must be constantly held, and with the other hand to draw an eyebrow.  Do-it-yourself stencil for eyebrows and a template are not difficult to print, as well as cut.  It is easy to use and makes bends symmetrical to each other.  But often slides. </li><li>  Simple transparent plastic - it is similar to the previous one in the technique of use, but the only difference is separate devices for each side. </li><li>  Plastic tapes are one of the easiest options.  It needs to be fixed on the back of the head, and only then proceed with the design.  It is convenient in that it does not need to be held, and the eyebrows are the same. </li></ol><h2>  Do it yourself template </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeupfiles.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Initial stage of creation" class="if uuid-3142942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3142942.jpg"></div><p>  In stores, such inventions range in price from 200 to 400 rubles.  Perhaps the cost is not so great, but it's still easier to make eyebrow stencils with your own hands without spending a dime. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  First you need to collect all the necessary materials.  The set includes: plastic sheets or folders, scissors, marker, adhesive tape.  It is important that the plastic base should be as flexible and thin as possible. </p><p>  Then from the plastic base you need to cut a not very wide tape, which will be about 3 centimeters wide, and about 20 in length. This will be the template. </p><p>  In the photo, the eyebrow stencil (with your own hands, as you can see, it's easy to make it) has its own parameters.  Which depend on the individual form.  For this reason, it is necessary to lay the product on the eyebrows and mark three main points.  This is the middle of the tape, which corresponds to the middle of the distance between the eyebrows, the beginning of the eyebrows and the bend point. </p><h2>  Process of creation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cutoutandkeep.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Create Template" class="if uuid-3142948" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3142948.jpg"></div><p>  Creating a template begins with building a form.  You can choose one yourself or see the options on the Internet.  The main thing is to take into account the shape of the face and eyes. </p><p>  If the bend of the eyebrows is not clearly defined or does not correspond to the expected, then you can calculate it.  It is enough to take a long pencil, one end of which will be at the wing of the nose, and the other in the region of the highest point.  It is important that its center passes visually through the center of the pupil of the eye. </p><p>  You can not print the template, it will be enough to maximize the picture with the selected eyebrow option and outline along the main lines.  Thus, the shape can be easily modified if they are not suitable. </p><p>  Then they begin to redraw the form on the plastic base itself.  It is necessary to cut out the picture and attach it to the future stencil. </p><p>  It is important to focus on the points that stood out earlier.  This will help to make the most suitable type of stencil.  The picture should not go beyond the points, since in this case the shape will look unnatural. </p><p>  When the procedure is completed, the lines are surrounded by a marker to make them clear and noticeable. </p><p>  After that comes the most interesting and serious stage - cutting the mold out of plastic.  To do this, you need a clerical knife to do everything most accurately.  On the boundaries drawn by the marker, it is necessary to walk with a sharp point several times, so that as a result the unnecessary part of the eyebrow stencil with your own hands falls off. </p><p>  If there is no knife at hand, then you can use scissors.  Before use, they need to be warmed up, and then make a hole in the middle of the product, carefully moving to the main lines. </p><p>  In addition, you can use the trick.  Take another tape, which in length will coincide with the circumference of the head, and sew a ready-made stencil to it.  As a result, it will not be necessary to hold it, it is enough to fix it correctly and proceed to the design.  Also, by gluing a small tube, as a result, you can get a stencil in the shape of the letter T. </p><h2>  pros </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.makeup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Application result" class="if uuid-3142947" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/116178/3142947.jpg"></div><p>  Girls love the device under study because: </p><ol><li>  The result is a neat and beautiful eyebrow. </li><li>  The processing time takes several minutes. </li><li>  There are many stencils, but you can‚Äôt even count them yourself. </li><li>  You can modify the shape of the eyebrows as you like.  The main thing is that she fit the face. </li><li>  The ability to make your perfect eyebrow, which will go even better than natural. </li></ol><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Some do not favor eyebrow stencils for the following reasons: </p><ol><li>  It is quite difficult to search for a stencil yourself.  Also, without any experience, it will be difficult to do it.  It is necessary to verify the parameters of your eyebrows so as not to be mistaken in either case. </li><li>  If the wrong type of stencil is selected, then the face can change significantly.  In the absence of certain makeup skills, asymmetrical eyebrows can result. </li><li>  People with pronounced asymmetry may have problems with the search, since the same template will no longer work.  Need to look for two different. </li><li>  Girls with no squint on the eyebrows are unlikely to be able to use this type of design, as this, on the contrary, will highlight a similar flaw. </li></ol><p>  In any case, you can try a homemade little thing, and then pick up a store one.  If the product is to your liking. </p>
