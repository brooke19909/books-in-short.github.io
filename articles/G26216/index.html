    <h2>  Features of rest in Tunisia </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this country is located on the African continent, there is no sweltering heat, at the same time it is warm and comfortable throughout the year.  In a word, here is a real Eden for beach lovers.  In the winter months here, as well as throughout the Mediterranean, it is hardly possible to swim in the sea, however, walking around the local sights, sunbathing in the gentle winter sun, breathing in the fresh sea air will even work out very well.  The most favorable months for thalassotherapy classes and "lazy" relaxation on the beach are September-November, that is, the so-called velvet season.  The shores of Tunisia are especially fond of fans of diving, as well as yachting.  Tunisia has a great many small resort towns, which until recently were fishing villages.  In this article we want to tell you a little about the Hammamet resort and the actual hotel Dar El Olf <span>4 * (Tunisia).</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dar el olf 4 tunisia" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/624890.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  ‚ÄúA place for swimming‚Äù </h2><p>  The Hammamet resort, whose name is translated from Tunisian as ‚Äúa place for swimming‚Äù, is one of the first villages that, at the dawn of the twentieth century, headed for tourist development.  Its popularity probably lies in the fact that it is located at a fairly close distance (70 km) from the capital of the country.  The first tourist attraction in the village was the luxurious villa of the Romanian millionaire Georges Sebastian.  This magnificent building in the <span>Moorish style</span> could hardly be called a hotel, but in those years it served precisely for these purposes: in the beach season, numerous friends of Sebastian gathered here.  They liked the coast so much that some of them also began to erect their dachas here, on the Tunisian shores of the Mediterranean Sea. </p><p>  It is these wonderful buildings of the beginning of the last century that today adorn the coastal area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHammamet with their magnificent appearance, giving it a special flavor.  Next to them rise the chic buildings of snow-white hotels, among which the aforementioned Dar El Olf 4 *.  As for the center of the town, the Medina, it is the personification of the Arabic style.  A quadrangular fortress with a giant mosque, an oriental bazaar, buildings of unique architecture, over which domes rise.  The modern city is also of interest to tourists.  There are concentrated entertainment venues - restaurants and discos, as well as the Carthagoland water attraction center.  In view of all this, Hammamet is deservedly considered the tourist capital of Tunisia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dar el olf 4 hammamet" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/624889.jpg" width="500"></div>
