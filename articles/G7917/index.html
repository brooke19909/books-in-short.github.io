    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  All tourists are interested in what weather they will be met by the pearl of Thailand, the popular resort - Pattaya.  Our compatriots, who arrived from snow-covered cities, already when leaving the plane will feel how hot air blows around their faces, and the humidity is so high that it seems that they got into the steam room. </p><p>  Such sensations take possession of all the guests of the city in the first minutes of arrival.  After a few days, as a rule, their severity decreases after acclimatization.  The weather in Pattaya in January is considered the most favorable for recreation: there is little precipitation (no more than 24.4 mm), humidity is quite tolerable (75%), many bright sunny days, but most importantly - the absence of storms.  Two or four rainy days in no way spoil your vacation: rainfall at night. </p><p>  The temperature in Pattaya in January is suitable for everyone who does not tolerate the sweltering heat.  In the daytime, the air temperature warms up to +29 ¬∞ C.  Only on selected days does it heat up to +32 ¬∞ C.  At night, the temperature drops to +21 ¬∞ C.  At night comes a pleasant coolness. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Pattaya in January" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/2204970.jpg"></div>

Fans of nightlife will enjoy the discos in nightclubs. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the glory of a party resort has entrenched in Pattaya, there are many natural, cultural, historical sights on its territory. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  It's no secret that the city beaches of Pattaya do not quite match the photos from glossy magazines.  The water in the bay is quite muddy, which does not prevent vacationers from enjoying, frolicing in its pleasant freshness.  Tourists are offered to engage in various types of water sports: surfing, diving, kitesurfing, parachuting, parasailing, water skiing, scooters, bananas and pills. </p><p>  Because of the poor condition of the water, beach tours to Pattaya in January are not very popular.  More often, Russian tourists purchase combined tours, which include other resorts of the country in their program.  However, this does not mean at all that lovers of impeccably clean sea water should refuse to get to know Pattaya. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays on the islands </h2><p>  A few kilometers from the city are the unusually beautiful <span>islands of Koh, Lan,</span> Phai, Krok, which attract tourists with idyllic beaches, very reminiscent of those that we remembered for the bounty advertisement.  They are not crowded, so you can fully enjoy the unusual landscapes.  To get here, you should rent a colorful junky on the Bali Hai pier. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>Chang Island</span> is also very beautiful <span>,</span> but the journey to it takes longer - the bus and then the ferry will take you three hours in total.  In general, a beach holiday in Pattaya in January brings real pleasure - the water temperature does not fall below +27 ¬∞ C, and strong waves due to the bay are extremely rare. </p><h2>  Entertainment and excursions </h2><p>  Pattaya is an amazing city, which has turned from a small and unremarkable village into a motley, noisy tourist center, where life boils day and night at any time of the year.  This is a real treasury of various entertainment. </p><p>  At night, you can watch here (or take part) incendiary parties, amazing foam parties, fun open-airs.  With the onset of dawn, Pattaya turns into a calm city with a measured lifestyle.  At this time, admirers of cognitive and sightseeing vacations set off to explore local attractions. </p>

    <p>  The indisputable advantage of this Thai resort is its relative cheapness.  Even with a very limited budget, you can afford to order an air-conditioned taxi or motobike, so independent inspection of interesting places in the city will not cause problems. </p><p>  It is well known that one of the symbols of Thailand and Pattaya is an elephant, so it is not surprising that the Nong Nooch tropical park is so popular among tourists.  There are amazing shows of trained animals. </p><p>  Connoisseurs of beauty have the opportunity to enjoy the botanical gardens and greenhouses where beautiful orchids grow.  Those who are not indifferent to exotic entertainments are advised to attend the competitions of Thai boxers and performances of folk dance groups. </p><p>  You will have a unique opportunity, without leaving the city, to travel around Siam and even look at some of the tourist centers in Europe.  To do this, you just need to visit the Mini Siam Park.  Here, in the form of small copies of world-famous monuments, all the wealth of the kingdom is collected.  In addition to them, copies of the Tower Bridge (Great Britain), the Leaning Tower of France (France), the Trevi Fountain (Italy), the Statue of Liberty (USA), the Arc de Triomphe (France) and other structures of European countries are presented here. </p>

    <p>  But surely a storm of emotions will cause you to walk through the quiet backwaters and picturesque surroundings on a boat with a glass bottom.  Through it, it is very convenient to observe everything that happens at depth. </p><h2>  Festivals and Holidays </h2><p>  Thais are a temperamental people, therefore, all the celebrations here are celebrated on a grand scale, and prepare for them very carefully.  The first of January in Pattaya, as in many other countries of the world, celebrate the New Year except the traditional one, which takes place in April. </p><p>  Festivals, fairs, various entertainment events around the palm trees dressed up with toys are held with enthusiasm.  On December 31, in every house in Pattaya Lama, a purification rite is performed, designed to save household members from the negativity of last year and clear the way for all the brightest. </p>
