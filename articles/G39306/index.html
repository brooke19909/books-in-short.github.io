Mobile traffic makes up one third of all existing in the network, and this number is growing every day.  As more and more people spend their time on smartphones, the emphasis is gradually shifting from desktop computers to mobile devices. </p><p>  However, most users are still shopping on computers.  Does this mean that e-commerce should focus more on sites for PC?  Does this affect the monetization of mobile traffic? </p><div class="photo" data-original="optiinfo.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of mobile traffic is" class="if uuid-2235003" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235003.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to see how users behave on each device.  People make fewer purchases on mobile devices.  According to experts, almost twice as many users make purchases and visit information sites from a PC or laptop.  But at the same time, people do not ‚Äúturn off‚Äù their interest in goods and services when they use mobile devices.  Instead, they spend more time studying the offer, and as a result, many make a purchasing decision. </p><p>  It should be noted right away that the monetization of mobile traffic is not only the sale of your own goods and services, but also the receipt of interest from participating in affiliate programs, as well as <span>funds for viewing ads</span> placed on your site. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Despite the low level of purchases from mobile devices, the rate of transition to advertising on them is higher than on computers.  And it turns out profitable if you make money on ads from your site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pctechmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of mobile traffic what is it" class="if uuid-2235004" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235004.jpg"></div><h2>  How to increase such a profit? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, today not too much attention is paid to the monetization of mobile traffic.  However, from devices with a smaller screen size, it is quite simple to read the text.  By themselves, such devices are designed for quick reading, scrolling and listening.  The text should be shorter, more informative and more noticeable. </p><p>  Due to the small screen size, ads may take up more space, but they don‚Äôt seem so intrusive.  Perhaps this is another reason why mobile ad conversion rates remain high.  With the right organization, monetization of mobile traffic with pay-per-impression impressions can be very profitable. </p><h2>  How else can I earn? </h2><p>  The time spent online from mobile devices is most spent on applications.  On average, users spend more than 30 hours on various services and mobile browsers per month, compared with the average 27 hours spent on <span>surfing the Internet</span> from computers.  According to statistics, more than a third of smartphone owners download at least one application per month.  About 90% of the time of the mobile Internet is devoted to such services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.seoclerk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of mobile traffic with payment" class="if uuid-2235005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235005.jpg"></div><p>  In view of the above, monetization of mobile traffic can be organized.  What does it mean?  Everything is pretty simple.  If you want to earn money from smartphone users, you need to develop your own application.  It is these services that are confidently starting to select a market share that used to belong to computers. </p><h2>  What do you need to do first? </h2><p>  Before reading tips on monetizing mobile sites, quickly review your site‚Äôs statistics.  Get a rough estimate of how many visitors are using mobile devices, and then look at segment metrics.  How does your mobile traffic compare with computer traffic?  Is there a big difference in key metrics?  If this difference is obvious, you can proceed with various methods. </p><h2>  How to do it? </h2><p>  As noted above, the monetization of mobile traffic does not always mean electronic commerce.  If you want to make money this way, advertising is one of the best monetization approaches you can take.  Integrating advertisements or search tools into your website is one of the best ways to make a profit. </p><h2>  What should be your resource? </h2><p>  Make your site simple and straightforward - this is an absolute must.  Each modern theme for WordPress or other engines is lightweight and easily changeable.  Explore mobile advertising solutions and integrate them into your website. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.atxwebdesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of mobile traffic with payment" class="if uuid-2235009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235009.jpg"></div><p>  Direct users to other segments of your site.  Although mailing lists are an ideal marketing tool, you can still communicate via Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and so on.  Moreover, monetization of mobile traffic without subscriptions is today the most desirable.  Think about how your site should look like a network with multiple devices.  The more links are created in your content network with a person, the more likely they are to become your regular visitors. </p><h2>  How to attract users? </h2><p>  Constantly attract people's attention.  The key to building trust and long-term relationships is to keep the attention of visitors who come to your mobile site.  Forms for subscribing to actions and email should be minimal: the more fields you need to fill out, the less likely that people will do this on a mobile device. </p><p>  If you have a steady flow of visitors, it‚Äôs important to keep it.  In this case, we are talking about creating high-quality content compatible with mobile devices.  Long articles look bad enough even on a computer screen, and even worse - on a smartphone.  If you monetize mobile traffic, you must follow the same basic principles of clear communication as with standard network marketing.  This includes calls to action, effective advertising, and high-quality content.  Once you complete these three requirements, you will begin to notice some improvements in monetization. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techmoran.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of mobile traffic with pay-per-impression impressions" class="if uuid-2235010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235010.jpg"></div><p>  What kind of advertising can be used for profit?  Monetization of mobile traffic with payment may include the use of the following services. </p><h2>  CPI and CPA </h2><p>  CPA is a pricing model where the advertiser pays for a certain action, such as registering, selling in a store, etc. CPI is a more accurate version of CPA in which payment occurs when the user installs the application. </p><p>  The first option of advertising is paid three to four times more than the second, depending on the region.  This means that if you use only CPI offers, you will lose profits dramatically. </p><p>  Despite the fact that most advertising networks out there make a lot of money in the CPI business, it is advisable to choose a niche for yourself in CPA.  The main action of these links is to encourage users to subscribe to a paid service, thanks to which they will receive excellent mobile content, such as video, ringtones, games, wallpapers, etc. The peculiarity of these subscription offers is that they are designed to work on mobile devices.  Thus, the placement of such ads on your site is the monetization of mobile traffic with pay-per-action. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.somnio.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of mobile traffic without subscriptions" class="if uuid-2235013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235013.jpg"></div><h2>  Ad space </h2><p>  The traditional advertising model, which dates back to paper newspapers, is to sell advertising space and embed ads in content.  The same model is used for television with 10-minute commercials for every 20 minutes of broadcasting.  Since some time, even videos on various hosting companies have received income from the placement of such advertising.  The Internet has been using this model for the past 15 years, and revenues from it have reached tens of billions of dollars. </p><p>  This method can also be used on a mobile platform, and it can generate real income.  By placing small ads at the top or bottom of the screen, the advertiser will receive referrals and traffic to their sites.  It turns out monetization of mobile traffic with <span>pay per click.</span>  However, the main drawback of this approach is that creating an attractive ad on a small screen is much more difficult.  Application developers want to make money, but do not always want to sacrifice too much screen space, which can interfere with the application. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dnaindia.com" data-author=": DNA Research &amp; Archives, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monetization of pay-per-click mobile traffic" class="if uuid-2235016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32550/2235016.jpg"></div><h2>  Affiliate and referral programs </h2><p>  Another monetization idea recently includes affiliate marketing with mobile apps.  In fact, instead of selling the advertising space, the advertiser offers an affiliate program that contains links embedded in the application.  They will generate revenue for the creator of the service based on the recommendation.  In affiliate programs, the advertiser pays for the sales facts that are generated by the affiliate.  The system can track these "clicks", and if the consumer goes to the advertiser's website and makes a purchase, the application developer receives a commission. </p>
