All of them contribute to further improvement of the situation in Russia, creating new square meters of housing and providing the population with the opportunity to invest their savings in real objects, and not leave them on virtual bank accounts. </p><p>  One of the companies operating in this field for more than 20 years is Setl City.  The reviews we found about this developer show that this is an international organization, the scale of which allows us to talk about very strong positions in the market and confident development. </p><p>  In this article we will talk about this company.  First of all, attention will be paid to general information about it, to facts that investors who should work with this organization should know.  In addition, we will also consider the characteristics of the objects built and delivered to the happy tenants. </p><h2>  About company </h2><p>  Traditionally, characterizing a large and successful developer, it is necessary to provide some information about him in order to understand what distinguishes him from competitors and what the company can boast of.  In the case of Setl City, reviews of which we will provide hereinafter, we mean serious experience in the market.  If we analyze the history of the organization (and it has been operating since 1994), then throughout this period the company has been actively developing and increasing its presence in the sector.  Today it is one of the leaders in the St. Petersburg market, despite the fact that it is also part of the international holding Setl Group, which also works in other countries with residential and commercial real estate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Regarding the name of the company, we can say that it has changed once in the history of the institution.  So, since 1994, it was called "Petersburg Real Estate", and such a name is "native" to her.  Further, starting in 2006, the company was rebranded, and it continued to work under the name Setl City.  Reviews note that the old name was left for another business operating in this group (we are talking about a brokerage company and a real estate agency). </p><p>  Today, the company operates not only in St. Petersburg.  Objects that are successfully developing are also located in Kaliningrad and the Leningrad Region.  Each of them can be confidently called a guarantee of honesty and impeccable reputation of the developer, his correct approach to work and the organization of all activities as a whole. </p><h2>  Interest vector </h2><p>  As you already understood, the company is engaged in the construction of real estate.  In this regard, the company can be called a universal and integrated solution, since its competence includes all types of services: from project preparation to connecting communications and commissioning.  In addition, Setl City new buildings differ significantly in their characteristics, representing completely different types of objects.  This confirms how wide the company has a profile and how easily it can adapt to certain tasks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, we‚Äôll also tell you about the objects that were built by this developer, and what people who directly bought an apartment here say about them, in the following sections of our article. </p>

    <p>  In the meantime, it should be emphasized that the organization is engaged in various segments of the real estate market: both in budget, "mass" housing, and in the construction of elite properties designed for sale at higher prices and, accordingly, for more demanding buyers who will accept housing here. </p><p>  Working with each of its housing complexes, the company uses a set of tools that include optimizing the space occupied by the construction site on the allotted land, as well as laconic design of the facility so that it "fits" with the overall concept in place in the region.  They also apply control over the progress of construction and ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, pay attention to escorting the client, starting with the signing of the contract and ending with the receipt of all documents for their housing. </p><h2>  Unique approach </h2><p>  According to the information provided on the official website, the Setl City developer takes a unique approach to each of his tasks, which allows you to develop a complete solution that satisfies the client.  As an example, note the different types of housing that are ready to be implemented here.  In addition to the usual one-, two- and three-room apartments, the company also sells less common configuration options for real estate: studio apartments and non-standard housing.  Due to this, each buyer can find for himself that solution that will satisfy his needs as much as possible.  In addition, this approach will provide residents with maximum comfort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Using such a strategy at work, Setl City receives market recognition, which is confirmed by various awards, certificates and prizes in various competitions.  You can learn more about them (for those customers who would like to make sure that the developer really meets their expectations), you can directly on the official website.  We will not dwell on such details in the framework of this article. </p><h2>  New buildings Setl City </h2><p>  So, according to the information on the company‚Äôs website, over the entire history of its activity, the latter has handed over more than 6 million square meters of housing.  All these are different apartments in which happy customers have invested and settled in.  At the time of writing, the developer is working on 23 complexes of different classes.  All of them, as indicated on the organization‚Äôs website, are an individual solution with their integrated approach.  This is not just residential buildings with a beautiful name: each of the complexes is also equipped with the appropriate infrastructure, which completes the image, creates a whole microdistrict. </p><p>  In this article, we will characterize several of the most famous objects by submitting reviews written by customers about Setl City, as well as recommendations on websites, forums and blogs regarding these objects.  Such information will allow us to draw conclusions about the reliability of the developer and the quality of his work, based not on messages from the official website, but directly on the practical experience of people who bought housing here. </p><h2>  LCD Moscow </h2><p>  The complex called ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù is one of the most famous facilities erected by the company.  By itself, it is a building consisting of several parts built on a territory of 1.4 hectares.  Each of these parts will have a different number of storeys (from 6 to 22).  The company said that such segmentation of the complex was not in vain.  LCD Moscow is a residential property in one part and a full-fledged hotel with 417 apartments in the other.  In addition, they also plan to build a parking lot and a kindergarten as an infrastructure for a more comfortable life for people who have come here.  It is planned that in the third quarter of 2018, the developer will be able to hand over the finished object. </p><p>  If you read the reviews describing Setl City, you can conclude that he enjoys a pretty good reputation among his customers.  People note that the company, in view of the vast experience of its work and dozens of completed facilities, is a reliable partner, and you can cooperate with it.  As for directly what kind of housing this organization offers, it is also characterized as high-class real estate in the business segment. </p>

    <p>  At the same time, looking at the price grid of the described housing complex, we can say the following: Setl City construction company takes a flexible approach to the client.  Apartments in this complex are offered at different prices, ranging from studios for 3 million and ending with 4-room apartments for more than 20 million rubles.  They can be afforded by completely different people (by type of employment and welfare).  Thus, at Setl City prices can seriously vary. </p><p>  Regarding the object itself, reviews note mainly its positive qualities.  This is the proximity to the metro, and the opportunity to enjoy the attractive view from the window, and well-developed infrastructure.  It is immediately clear that the developer thought in advance over all issues and took concrete steps to resolve them.  Especially important is the fact that earlier, at the construction site of the facility, there was another, unfinished construction, which, according to local residents, created an unfavorable impression of the neighborhood.  So the construction of the complex "Moscow" will be very useful here. </p><h2>  LCD "Clear Sky" </h2><p>  The next complex, which I would like to say a few words about, is also designed and built by Setl City.  "Clear Sky" with its name alone indicates that the property is located on a wide territory in the Primorsky district of St. Petersburg.  Near the object is a conservation area that will delight the eye of the residents of these houses.  The complex itself will consist of 5 houses of different floors, in which residential apartments will be offered.  It is planned that the object can be described as a comfort class property. </p><p>  The developer notes that Setl City plans to sell these apartments with a full finish, which will include solutions for the interior.  This format of rental housing will allow happy buyers to move into their homes as soon as possible without having to wait for the completion of exhausting repair work.  On the company's website, it is noted that the object will be completed in stages (starting from the 1st quarter of 2017).  Reviews positively characterize this object, since it will really be located on a large land plot.  In addition, the company promises to arrange wide walking paths around the houses and develop infrastructure for maximum comfort of residents. </p><h2>  LCD "Sunny City" </h2><p>  If we previously described what St. Petersburg real estate is, then in this section we will talk about the complex, which is located in Novo-Sergievo.  Nevertheless, they also promise to make it very comfortable and modern so that the residents enjoy living here.  The description of the complex promises that it will be so. </p><p>  The houses, according to the plan, will be built in the European style: they will be decorated with light decoration in warm colors.  The number of storeys of Setl City facilities (St. Petersburg) will be small especially to make the complex look more comfortable.  note that the tallest building will have 12 floors, while the lowest - only 5. In total, it is planned to build 2372 apartments ranging in size from 23.66 to 80.43 square meters. </p>

    <p>  The reviews left by Setl City (St. Petersburg) customers indicate that this LCD is really very interesting.  The prices here are affordable, the quality of the constructed facility is very high, and the developer is quite reliable.  The only (at the moment) drawback is the lack of infrastructure.  The problem is that in the 4th quarter of 2016 the first phase of the facility will be commissioned, while the construction of everything necessary for a comfortable life here will begin only with the third phase.  Therefore, people who settled immediately will have some time to experience inconvenience.  But after a few years, a full-fledged and convenient microdistrict with everything necessary, developed by Setl City, will appear here.  ‚ÄúSunny City‚Äù is, rather, a solution for those who are thinking for the future. </p><h2>  London Quarter </h2><p>  The company is building a very unusual (in design and decoration) complex in Kudrovo.  Externally, the houses of this residential complex are cubic structures that have a clear division into segments (vertical).  Due to the original concept, it seems that these segments are somewhat shifted relative to each other.  The right choice of color scheme complements the good impression: warm colors (brown, beige, green, blue).  The development company promises that in addition to attractive architecture, a powerful infrastructure will also appear here.  For example, they promise to build beautiful walking squares with fountains, kindergartens and schools, sports grounds, a medical center and much more.  Wi-Fi is going to be handed out in the yards, and in order to organize security at any time of the day, surveillance cameras will be installed around the complex. </p><p>  A large shopping center (Mega Dybenko) is located near residential buildings.  In addition, there is a forest nearby, which guarantees fresh, clean air.  The first 6 houses have already been put into use, the next 5 are planned to be commissioned by the end of 2016.  They are followed by several more objects, the commissioning of which is planned until 2018. </p><h2>  The residence </h2><p>  Another interesting object will be built on Maly Prospect.  Outwardly, it looks like a typical elite St. Petersburg real estate with an original design.  The design of the houses is made in such a way as to give the impression of safety, stability, comfort.  Elongated windows of a special shape alternate with special segments, which creates an attractive appearance.  The object will consist of two houses, each of which will be made in the shape of the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù.  The commissioning is scheduled for the 2nd quarter of 2016. </p>

    <p>  User reviews that we managed to find about this complex give both positive and negative aspects of The Residence.  The first include comfort and safety, attractive appearance, reliability of the company that conducts the construction.  Perhaps, the presence of a nearby Smolensky cemetery can be attributed to the negative.  Some of the apartments have windows facing directly to it.  Therefore, the view for some residents may not be the most positive, despite the fact that this cemetery is, rather, of cultural value. </p><h2>  Stockholm </h2><p>  The company, in addition to building classic <span>block houses,</span> sometimes allows itself to experiment.  In particular, the Stockholm complex can serve as an example of this.  It is being built on the banks of the Bolshaya Nevka, and it can be called original due to its design and concept.  So, 2 houses that will be included in this complex are made in the shape of a horseshoe.  Due to this, a greater number of apartments have river views.  Also, this form means that the courtyards for each of the houses are fenced from the outside world by the building itself, which creates a sense of comfort and security.  The object belonging to the premium class is going to be commissioned in 2017.  The cost of an apartment here starts from 8 million rubles and ends with almost 100 million for five-room apartments. </p><p>  The advantages of the complex, of course, can be called the presence of a river nearby, the original shape of the houses and the high quality of the materials used.  The disadvantages are the high price, as well as the proximity of the busy highway. </p><h2>  Neva Sails </h2><p>  Another complex that the builder is building on the banks of the Neva is Nevsky Sails.  It is located quite originally: on the one hand - the proximity of nature and the oldest district of St. Petersburg, and on the other - a good transport interchange (and the presence of the metro nearby). </p><p>  The complex received such a name not by accident.  If you look at it from afar, a silhouette of sails painted in scarlet is created.  In the first stages, 6 houses will be built, each of which will accommodate 797 apartments.  Different objects will be combined into one complex due to parking.  The height of the houses will be 25 floors.  Of course, in addition to the real estate objects themselves, the company also takes care of infrastructure, while parallel to the construction of playgrounds.  The commissioning of the first three houses is planned for the 1st quarter of 2017. </p>
