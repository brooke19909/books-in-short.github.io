    <p>  It’s worth at least remembering the “third eye”.  This amazing “organ” is endowed with some children who are now called in a special way - the “indigo generation”.  If we talk about the superpowers of people, then the first thing to note is this generation.  Experts believe that children, in fact, are aliens who have recently appeared in this world from another.  In infants, the higher chakras are open, which energetically connect them with the Cosmos.  And they were open because his soul had recently been in the astral world.  Then she chose her body, which she possessed.  These chakras give a person supernormal abilities.  There are very few people who have these chakras open.  These are those who possess clairvoyance, clairaudience, astral vision and a unique ability called “memory of past lives”.  Some parents should know that when their child says something like this: “Mom, when you were away, I saw fairies ...”, “I have such an invisible friend who ...” and all that follows is not fiction or his fantasies.  It really is.  After all, children see a lot, unlike their parents.  The indigo generation belongs to those, at least at the moment this term has been given just such a definition.  Although there is, of course, a synonym - hyperactivity, however, this already relates to another topic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Speaking about the superpowers of people, it should be noted the <span>power of thought.</span>  Everyone has heard about this at least once.  They say that thoughts are material.  Or - do not think about the bad ... These are not empty words.  After all, thoughts really tend to materialize. </p><p>  There is a story about <span>materialized thought,</span> which has a scientific basis.  The young girl decided to commit suicide.  To do this, she swallowed the cockroach remedy and lay down on the bed.  An hour later, death overtook her.  However, one detail is interesting here.  At autopsy, it turned out that this poison was completely harmless to both humans and insects, since the expiration date of this tool has expired a long time ago.  Also surprising is the fact that the girl died before this powder dissolved.  She was simply killed by the thought ... of imminent death. </p>

    <p>  But what about the cases when people coped with a deadly disease, wanting to live?  Or get out of a coma?  What is the reason for this?  People’s superpowers actually have no boundaries, although skeptics can only shake their heads at this.  Regarding such a topic as the development of human superpowers, it is worth noting - here you only need to believe.  Faith and thought stand together.  One must believe in one's own strengths, that <span>thought is material.</span>  After all, as often happens: what we constantly think about, what we are afraid of, is what overtakes us.  Or vice versa.  What we want soon becomes our property.  People with superpowers like the ability to control their thoughts can achieve a lot.  But there is one caveat.  Need to believe.  Strongly believe in yourself. </p>
