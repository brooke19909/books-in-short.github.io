    <h2>  To sew or not to sew? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the gift bags described below are sewn on a sewing machine, they can be made without such equipment.  True, you will have to make very small neat stitches so that the product does not look untidy. </p><p>  For those who absolutely can not imagine themselves with a needle in their hands, there is also a way out.  They can simply cut out a circle from the fabric (the threads of which do not spill out on the slices), put a gift in the center, collect the edges in a bundle and tie it with a beautiful cord.  Of course, such packaging will no longer be a bag. </p><h2>  What you need for sewing </h2><p>  To make gift wrapping you should prepare: </p><ol><li>  The cloth. </li><li>  Threads in color or contrasting (in accordance with the plans of the craftswoman). </li><li>  Needle, scissors and <span>tape measure.</span> </li><li>  Beautiful cord or ribbon. </li><li>  Decorative elements: appliques, beads, threads for embroidery and other materials. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="drawstring fabric bag" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424095.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  Any bag pattern is a rectangle.  The length of its sides varies depending on what size of the product is planned.  The selected fabric for the bags is very convenient to cut. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the craftswoman needs several identical products, she can speed up the process by automating each stage.  For example, several rectangles should be cut out at once, then they should be marked, stitched, ironed and laced with all of them. </p><p>  If we are talking about making embroidered hats, then you should take care of the decor before stitching the bag with ties.  Embroidery is performed on a cut rectangle, otherwise then it will be very inconvenient to do it. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  Before you sew a bag with ties, you need to decide on the fabric.  The most elegant and most suitable for packaging is organza.  However, stitching bags made of organza is a bit more complicated than using other materials (cotton, linen, wool or synthetics).  This fabric "floats" and is constantly strewed.  This means that all seams must first be carefully marked and ironed, and only then sewed on a typewriter.  In addition, the organza is transparent, so that all the edges will have to be carefully processed with an overlock or small zigzag. </p><p>  If the craftswoman is afraid of such difficulties, you can do fine with a beautiful cotton fabric.  Now in stores selling a variety of materials with amazing colors.  The best thing here is that many of them can be bought in pieces of 30 cm or more. This is quite enough for several bags of the same or different size. </p><h2>  How to sew a bag with ties: a step-by-step workshop </h2><p>  This and the next paragraphs will describe the process of sewing the crochet.  All steps are equipped with photographs, so it will be difficult to get confused even for a beginner. </p><ol><li>  First of all, overlock the rectangle around the perimeter. </li><li>  Next, you need to fold it in half (or combine two identical rectangles, if you could not cut one big one) and sew it on the sides.  In the case when two parts are combined, three sides are sewn together: the sides and the bottom. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bag sewing process" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424101.jpg" width="600"></div>  Performing this step, you should pay attention that the line ends at a distance of 5-6 cm from the edge. </li><li>  Overlocked but not sewn edges are tucked in and smoothed with an iron.  In order not to deform the fabric, you can first notice the collar. </li></ol>

Then you have to rip it up, so you need to immediately bend one edge. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stitch up the gateway" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424105.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the last stage, a tape is threaded into the holes formed.  That's the whole story about how to sew a bag with strings. </p><h2>  Stitching </h2><p>  In the event that the craftswoman could not find the ribbons matching the color or structure, she would have to sew the ties herself. </p><p>  To do this, cut out a tape three centimeters wide (the length depends on the size of the bag).  The sequence of further work: </p><ol><li>  Tuck and hem the edges.  Bend at least one centimeter, and lay the line very close to the edge. </li><li>  Next, a strip of fabric is folded in half and ironed. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bag pattern" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424097.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  By expanding it, you can see a clear fold line.  Both edges fold to the center and smooth in this state.  If this is difficult to do and the tape is constantly unfolding, you can make seams and remove the basting after ironing. <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a bag with ties" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424098.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  The workpiece is folded along the ironed fold and sewn.  Here you also need to try to make the seam as close to the edge as possible. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gift bags" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424099.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><p>  So the plot is ready.  They put it in gift bags and make knots at the ends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bag with applique" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424100.jpg" width="600"></div>  This is optional, but eliminates tape loss.  It should be noted that sewing organza ties is an extremely difficult and thankless task.  Organza bags are best decorated with purchased ribbons.

    <h2>  Making Aromatic Herb Cases </h2><p>  The described method of sewing bags is great for making herbal compositions.  Despite the fact that in specialized stores they offer a huge number of synthetic decontaminants that repel moths and other insects, many housewives prefer the use of environmentally friendly products. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="organza bags" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1424108.jpg" width="434"></div>

    <p>  They sew grass bags with their own hands and lay in them a special mixture of several types of herbs.  The most commonly used combinations are lavender, peppermint, thyme, rosemary, cloves, cinnamon and cedar shavings.  At the same time, seeds, stems and leaves do not work better than crushed materials.  To the delight of many girls and women, home-use bags require much less attention than gift wraps.  Here you can apply the remnants of the fabric, from which it is no longer possible to sew any large product.  Ties can be ordinary durable threads.  Given that no one will look inside, the seams can not be processed with an overlock. </p>

    <h2>  Practicality and beauty </h2><p>  Bags for herbs (with their own hands they are made exclusively from natural fabrics) are laid out on shelves of cabinets or hung on hangers.  Periodically, they should be wrinkled to release the essential oils and renew the smell.  It is believed that this set is enough for the whole season, that is, when folding winter clothes for storage, you can not be afraid for their safety. </p><h2>  How to decorate grass bowls </h2><p>  Here everything depends only on the imagination and abilities of the craftswoman.
