  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is quantum mechanics?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  By quantum mechanics we understand the physical theory of the dynamic behavior of radiation forms and matter.  This is the <span>theoretical basis</span> on which the modern theory of <span>atomic nuclei, atoms,</span> physical bodies, molecules and elementary particles is built.  In general, <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> was created by scientists who sought to understand the structure of the atom.  For many years, legendary physicists studied the features and directions of chemistry and followed the historical time of the development of events. </p><p>  A concept such as <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> was born over many years.  In 1911, scientists N. Bohr and <span>E. Rutherford</span> proposed a nuclear model of the atom, which resembled the model of Copernicus with its solar system.  After all, the solar system had in its center a core around which the elements revolved.  Based on this theory, calculations of the physical and chemical properties of certain substances that were built from simple atoms began. </p><p>  One of the important issues in a theory such as <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> is the nature of the forces that bound the atom.  Thanks to the law of Coulomb, E. Rutherford showed that this law is valid on a massive scale.  Then it was necessary to determine how the electrons move in their orbit.  At this point <span>, Newton's law</span> helped <span>.</span> </p><p>  In fact, <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> often contradicts concepts such as common sense.  Along with the fact that our common sense acts and shows only those things that can be taken from everyday experience.  And, in turn, everyday experience deals only with the phenomena of the macrocosm and large objects, while material particles at the subatomic and atomic levels behave very differently.  For example, in the macrocosm, we can easily determine the location of any object using measuring instruments and methods.  And if we measure the coordinates of an electron microparticle, then it is simply unacceptable to neglect the interaction of the measurement object and the measuring device. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In other words, we can say that <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> is a physical theory that establishes the laws of motion of various microparticles.  From classical mechanics, which describes the movement of microparticles, <strong>quantum mechanics</strong> is distinguished by two indicators: </p><p>  - the probable nature of some physical quantities, for example, the speed and position of the microparticles cannot be determined exactly, only the probability of their values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be calculated; </p><p>  - a discrete change in <span>physical quantities,</span> for example, the energy of a microparticle has only certain certain values. </p><p>  <strong>Quantum mechanics is</strong> still associated with such a concept as <strong>quantum cryptography</strong> , which is a rapidly developing technology that can change the world.  Quantum cryptography aims to protect communications and the secrecy of information.  This cryptography is based on certain phenomena of <span>quantum physics</span> and considers such cases when information can be transferred using the object of quantum mechanics.  It is here that with the help of electrons, photons and other physical means the process of receiving and sending information is determined.  With quantum cryptography, you can create and design a communication system that can detect eavesdropping. </p><p>  To date, there are a lot of materials where the study of such a concept as <strong>quantum mechanics of the basis</strong> and direction, as well as the activities of quantum cryptography is proposed.  To gain knowledge in this difficult theory, it is necessary to thoroughly study and delve into this area.  Indeed, quantum mechanics is far from an easy concept, which has been studied and proved by the greatest scientists for many years. </p>
