China for me is a camp of paradoxes, and Dalian in this sense was no exception.  I‚Äôm a meticulous person by nature, so while we were rushing along the Shen-Da freeway, I managed to ‚Äúdig‚Äù on the Internet a lot of information that was not very pleasant for myself.  I found out that in 2010 the oil pipeline exploded in the port of Dalian (China remembers this tragedy, because tons of oil spilled into the sea), and in 2011 there was a severe flood.  Preparing to see the dirty <span>yellow sea</span> and the ruins left after the floods, I did not even understand that the clean, beautiful and well-groomed city we entered was Dalian.  China, by the example of this city, showed how he cares about his ‚Äúface‚Äù. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="china dalian photo" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/217741.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The streets sparkling with purity, green lawns, gently curling buildings of European architecture, lush bright green tree crowns, flowering shrubs - you can never say that the city is one of the largest ports in China.  I liked the city so much that there was no trace of a bad mood.  As soon as we settled in, we immediately went for a walk.  Our translator turned out to be a smart woman.  She immediately said that Dalian is China in miniature.  The city has everything that is in the country: ports and universities, luxury resorts and large construction enterprises, endless beaches and striking clean streets.  The translator continued: ‚ÄúDo you know what China really is?  Dalian (photo) will show you this. ‚Äù  She was right. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in China Dalian" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/217738.jpg" width="600"></div>  After spending a week in this city, I fell in love with China forever.  Today I can talk for hours about how the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus struck me, how I liked to walk along Zhongshan Square, how beautiful the coastline is, which stretches for almost one and a half thousand kilometers.  Dalian is a city where they study, work, relax, fall in love.  I still could not determine for myself why staying in this city has become so romantic for me, but I know for sure: in my plans for next year, the first item is to <span>rest in China.</span>

    <p>  There is a <span>place</span> in <span>Dalian</span> that allowed me to feel like a special royal blood.  Half a kilometer from the coast, we saw a small rocky islet.  The translator smiled mysteriously and said that he is called Baichui, and we can visit <strong> </strong>  his.  Baichui turned out to be only part of the resort area, more like an earthly paradise than the former resting place of the Chinese party elite.  Luxury villas, golf courses, pools, fabulous beauty of nature attract tourists from all over the world.  Surprisingly, by our standards, living in this resort is relatively inexpensive.  Talk about Dalian for hours.  Those who are going to go there, I advise you to definitely visit all the beaches, go to the street.  In order to admire the retro trams, Changjianglu is sure to stroke the Guileshi (stone-turtle) located in Jinshitan, to photograph the unique reefs located in this government resort area.  By the way, shopping lovers will also find something to do here.  Things in China are very cheap, but their quality is much higher than that of the usual ‚Äúimported‚Äù Chinese consumer goods. </p>
