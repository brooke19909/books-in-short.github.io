Rest in the Krasnodar Territory</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tuapse district of Krasnodar Territory is a continuous resort.  At least its coastal part.  Many villages of the region have already become part of the Greater Tuapse.  Each of them has its own characteristics of relaxation.  Lermontovo is famous for its long and wide beach, which rightly bears the name "Golden Coast".  In such villages as Novomikhailovsky and Agoy, there are quiet bays.  Dzhubga attracts with its picturesque nature, and Olginka - with fun entertainments.  Family tourists choose Shepsi - there is a clean sea and a gentle entry into the water. </p><p>  In this article we will consider the resort village of Tuapse Nebug.  Hotels there have their own specifics, associated primarily with the location of this settlement relative to the sea.  But what attracts Nebug vacationers is the beautiful pebble beaches and a huge water park.  Let's do an in-depth review of summer rental housing in this village. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nebug hotels" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/1296282.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The specifics of resort hotels Nebug </h2><p>  This settlement was formed a long time ago, in 1864, when bathing and sunbathing were not yet in fashion.  And now Nebug (Tuapse district) is located on both banks of the river of the same name.  At the very same sea two huge departmental holiday homes settled down.  Their territories occupy almost the entire Nebug embankment.  Of course, between these departmental institutions is full of shops, shops, restaurants and cafes, nightclubs, discos and other amenities of a developed leisure infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are also private houses.  But housing prices there are unreasonably high, and those who stay in these places at night reluctantly take part in the general fun.  Most vacationers prefer to rent a private sector in the village itself.  The prices there are much lower than on the coast, although twenty minutes have to pass daily to get to the beach.  And, accordingly, the same amount back, just downhill.  Therefore, some hotels include a transfer to the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tuapse district" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1296179.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Who will like in Nebug </h2><p>  Lush subtropical vegetation, mountains, pebble beaches, the warm Black Sea - all this sets up for measured outdoor recreation.  But at the same time in Nebug there is a dolphinarium and the oldest water park in the entire former Soviet Union.  And these two institutions make vacation in the resort very attractive for children of all ages.  In the evenings, foam discos and other recreational activities are organized in the evenings.  Therefore, many youth companies rush to Nebug in the summer. </p><p>  <span>Resort hotels</span> do not lack vacationers.  Book accommodation on the beach should be no later than February.  Only four thousand people live in the resort village, but every year it receives about eight thousand vacationers.  So what category of tourists will Nebug enjoy?  For families with small children, the resort is suitable only if they have their own vehicles or agree on a transfer.  The same can be said of the elderly, since a daily walk of a kilometer and a half uphill will be tiring.  But from the rest in Nebug teenagers will be crazy who will appreciate the water park and dolphinarium;  young people who run into plenty of discos;  active tourists, because in the vicinity of the village there is something to see. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nebug vacation hotels" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1296180.jpg" width="600"></div>

Smaller, coastal, is considered the most elite for recreation.  There are: a water park, a dolphinarium, a beautiful arboretum.  However, all hotels in Nebug are not budgetary.  After all, the demand for housing in this small village at the height of the season is far ahead of supply.  But if you still want to reduce the cost of your stay in Nebug at least a little, we recommend that you look for a hotel in the Yamal, Sportivny blocks or in the area between Tyumenskaya and Gazovikov streets.  <span>Private hotels of the</span> village shine with novelty.  Often these are two- or three-story buildings with modern amenities, but a small adjacent territory.  But some of these hotels have their own pool.  Expensive hotels are located in the square of such streets as Naberezhnaya and Primorskaya.  But even there, rooms should be booked in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel atelika nebug" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1296199.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel complexes outside the city limits </h2><p>  The dense development determines that even expensive Nebug hotels have a small territory, limited to a shady courtyard.  Therefore, it makes sense to look for housing outside the village.  An example of such a place to relax is the Atelika Resort Hotel (Nebug).  It is on the front page, but on a high bank.  You will have to go down the stairs to the sea.  Vacationers are accommodated in two buildings - a five-story building, with an elevator, and a two-level building.  The rooms in this hotel are divided into two categories - economy and luxury.  But even in the cheapest room (about 1700 rubles per day), vacationers have new furniture, a TV, air conditioning and a refrigerator. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This hotel has a large well-groomed area, planted with relict trees and shrubs.  There is also a pool with a designated children's area and sunbeds.  Atelika Hotel (Nebug) is one of the few that operates on an all-inclusive basis.  The main restaurant serves buffet meals.  And in the bar, guests are poured wine and soft drinks for free, while children are offered delicious ice cream.  This hotel has a team of children's animation, and the leisure of adults will also be eventful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Price hotel nebug" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1296188.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels on the beach </h2><p>  When choosing a place of residence, many Russian tourists do not focus on the quality of services or amenities in the room, but on proximity to the sea.  So you can recommend the "Marine Club" (Nebug).  This hotel is located almost on the beach.  To the water's edge you need to walk only fifty meters.  The guests are accommodated in two buildings - two- and five-story.  The rooms are divided into economy, standard and luxury.  The rooms have a split system, TV and refrigerator.  On the floor there is an electric kettle and an iron.  All rooms have balconies.  The hotel has a freshwater pool, which is zoned for adult and children.  The Maritime Club Resort Hotel (Nebug) has recently introduced an all-inclusive food system, but it is rather a <span>full board</span> consisting of three meals.  Bar service is chargeable.  There is a free car park.  You can rent equipment for the production of barbecue or grill. </p><h2>  Lightning (Nebug) </h2><p>  This wellness center is located south of the village and fifteen kilometers from Tuapse.  In walking distance is another health resort - OK "Yamal".  Now they are a single complex.  Therefore, it is called "Lightning-Yamal."  To the sea, vacationers need to walk only three hundred meters.  The beach is equipped with sunbeds and awnings, there are changing rooms, showers.  The guests settle in the hotel "Lightning" (Nebug) in a seven-story building.  The rooms are standard, studio, deluxe, the apartment has all the necessary amenities for a quality stay. </p><p>  On the territory of the Molniya-Yamal common complex there are two swimming pools (outdoors and indoors), tennis courts, gyms and playgrounds, a football field, a health center, a casino and a billiard room.  The price of the room, which starts at 1,500 rubles per day, at Lightning includes a full board with three meals a day in the buffet format.  The food is good here, the hotel services are of high quality, and therefore the vacationer is not afraid of the price. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Nebug" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1296189.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotel "Nebug" </h2><p>  Under this sign in the village there are two institutions: a resort hotel and a boarding house.  The hotel is located at the very beginning of Central Street, in the "golden square" of Nebug.  Five minutes from here to the water park.  The pebble beach is three hundred meters away.  The modern, bright rooms of the hotel with new furniture and fixtures are equipped with air conditioning, seating areas and satellite TV.  As a bonus, free Wi-Fi is offered.  For those arriving by their own transport there is a secure parking.  But this city hotel does not provide food for its guests.  On its territory there is a small cafe where you can eat deliciously.  Within walking distance there are many points of catering. </p><h2>  Heliopark </h2><p>  Fans of chain hotels can also safely go on vacation to Nebug.  HELIOPARK Hotels &amp; Resorts hotels are renowned for their high level of service.  The representative office in Nebug fully complies with the requirements for a four-star hotel.  This hotel is located in the center of the village, near the water park and the Aqua Mir Dolphinarium.  The hotel has a restaurant "Sorrento", which will offer you the best dishes of Italian cuisine.  If the sea is cold or stormy, you can always compensate for this inconvenience by swimming in a pool with clean fresh water.  Guests are invited to sing karaoke and steam in the sauna. </p>

    <h2>  "Dolce Vita" </h2><p>  Should we count on a quiet - taking into account the specifics of the Nebug resort - relaxation?  Family-type hotels provide you with this opportunity.  Hotel Dolce Vita is small.  She occupies a two-story mansion.  For those who want to cook on their own, there is an extensive kitchen with all the necessary utensils.  By agreement, the hosts can provide you with half or full board.  Dolce Vita is located two hundred meters from the free city beach.  In walking distance all the amenities of the resort.  But the rooms are pretty quiet.  A surveillance camera ‚Äúlooks after‚Äù the machine left at the gate.  Double economy will cost about 1000 rubles per day, and a junior suite for the same number of places - from 1200 rubles. </p><h2>  Offshore hotels </h2><p>  If you are not afraid of a half-hour walk to the sea, you can rent cheaper accommodation in the upper quarters of a resort such as Nebug.  Hotels in the Yamal and Sportivny districts are in no way inferior in quality of services and room comfort to those that are located near the beach, and in some cases even surpass them.  You can recommend such mini-hotels as Nesta (Tsentralnaya street, 456), Oliver (Fontanny lane 11), Snow leopard (Vesennyaya 30) or Cozy courtyard (Stroiteley 43).  All of them have good service, amenities at a decent level, and the reviews of vacationers are quite positive. </p>
