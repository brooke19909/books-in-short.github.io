The possibility of obtaining it is for men and women who have crossed the threshold of 60- and 55-year-olds, respectively.  In this case, the length of service must not be less than that established by law and the number of pension points not less than the minimum amount.  However, a separate group of citizens may be paid an old-age pension ahead of schedule.  The list of works, professions, industries, positions, specialties and organizations, taking into account which this benefit is assigned, was approved by order of the Government of the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  What is an early retirement pension? </h2>

Moreover, insurance payments must be made for these periods. </p><p>  On the basis of the entries made in the workbook, the RF PF bodies conclude on the appointment or denial of early retirement benefits.  Often, data on preferential seniority is not indicated in full, or individual information about the employee is not available for a certain period.  Therefore, the reliability of the special experience, specifying the special nature of the work and working conditions, will need to be documented. </p><p>  Early retirement benefits are available to citizens who, at the time the law on occupational pensions came into force, have already completed more than half of the required length of service in their respective positions or types of work.  In other cases, it will be established according to the norms and rules of the professional system. </p><p>  The amount of early retirement pension depends on the total amount of insurance payments. </p><h2>  What documents are needed? </h2><p>  When applying for an early pension in the RF PF, you must provide: </p><ul><li>  <span>application for the appointment of a pension</span> ; </li><li>  passport and, if necessary, a document confirming registration at the place of residence; </li><li>  SNILS, it is necessary to confirm the insurance experience. </li></ul><p>  The insurance experience accumulated before the start of accounting for information about the insured person in the pension system is confirmed by the work book.

The notice shall indicate the reasons for the refusal and the procedure for appealing against it.  All documents submitted to the Pension Fund are returned. </p><h2>  General terms of appointment </h2><p>  According to the law, an old-age pension is transferred ahead of schedule from the day of application, but not earlier than the day of acquiring the right to receive it.  The date of appeal is the day of receipt from the citizen of the application and all required certificates and documents. </p><p>  The Pension Fund confirms the fact of acceptance by issuing a receipt-notification. </p><p>  When mailing the application and all required documents, the date indicated on the postal stamp at the place of departure will be accepted for the date of application.  The receipt will be sent to the address of the applicant or will be handed out. </p><p>  If a citizen has not provided everything necessary, no later than three months he can deliver the remaining papers.  In this case, the day of application will be counted the date of receipt of the application or the number indicated on the postal stamp when sending.  The list of missing documents is determined by the RF PF body and is prescribed in the receipt-notification. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  An application for calculating early retirement pension must be considered by the Pension Fund department no later than ten days after its submission.  Based on the information contained in all the documents submitted, a decision on the appointment is made.  The amount of early retirement pension cannot be less than the subsistence minimum established in the country. </p><h2>  Citizens working in places with difficult working conditions </h2>

    <p>  There is a list with certain types of hard work.  Citizens employed in these jobs have the right to early retirement pensions. </p><p>  A man who has at least twelve and a half years of work experience and more than twenty-five years of insurance experience, upon reaching 55 years of age, has the opportunity to take advantage of him.  The same right is enjoyed by women aged 50 years, with labor and insurance experience of at least ten and twenty years, respectively. </p><p>  If the elaboration of a special length of service is incomplete (but not less than half), and the insurance period has been worked out in full, early retirement pension is possible.  In such a situation, it is established with a decrease in the retirement age.  A decrease of one year occurs for every worked two and a half years for men, for every two - for women. </p><h2>  Citizens whose work activities took place in the Far North and in equivalent regions </h2>

They have the right to retire at the age of 50. </p><p>  Basic conditions for obtaining: </p><ul><li>  each child, the mother must raise at least eight years; </li><li>  the presence of insurance experience of more than fifteen years. </li></ul><p>  An old-age pension can be assigned ahead of schedule to a parent who raised a child who is disabled since birth, at least up to eight years of age.  Only one person can exercise this right: either the mother of the child or the father.  Moreover, the working experience should be more than twenty and fifteen years for a man and a woman, respectively. </p><p>  The guardian of a child who is disabled since birth also has the option of registering early retirement.  How soon he will be able to start receiving it depends on the duration of the guardianship.  One and a half years of care allow reducing retirement time by one year.  But the total term may not exceed five years.  That is, if the guardianship period was six years, then the woman has the right to receive early retirement pension at the age of 51 years, if nine - 50. </p><p>  In addition to parents and guardians, certain categories of people with disabilities are entitled to early payment processing.  An early retirement pension is granted to a disabled person if the group was received as a result of a military injury.  It is necessary to have only a working experience of twenty-five years for men and twenty for women. </p><p>  Men with an experience of fifteen years, having a disability of the first group, can apply for an old-age pension at the age of 50 years.

    <p>  For employees of budgetary organizations, the state provides all possible benefits.  If the following requirements are met for employees of healthcare institutions, regardless of age, an early old-age medical pension is required: </p><ul><li>  The duration of professional activity should be at least thirty years.  If the seniority was only at work in rural areas and urban settlements, then more than twenty-five years. </li><li>  For the period included in the length of service, insurance payments must be made to the Pension Fund. </li></ul><p>  An old-age pension can be issued ahead of schedule to citizens if the position and name of the institutions in which they worked are included in a special list developed by the government of our country, since it is these data that the PF employees rely on when making decisions. </p><p>  It should be noted that employees of private medical organizations have the same right to early registration as employees of state and municipal institutions. </p><p>  In the experience, work is equally taken into account both with a normal schedule and with a reduced working time.  According to the rule, periods are set off in a calendar order.  That is, one year of work is taken for one year of experience.  There are exceptions to this rule: </p><ul><li>  if during his professional activity a person, in addition to the city, worked both in urban villages and in rural areas, then one year of his work in rural areas should be considered as one year and three months of experience; </li><li>  one year of work in the city counts for one and a half years of experience for the following categories of health workers: surgeons, anesthesiologists, resuscitators, pathologists, forensic experts; </li><li>  when these persons work in urban settlements or rural areas, the year of their work activity is counted for one year and nine months. </li></ul><p>  The duty of medical workers, on the basis of the law of our country, is to improve their skills.  Therefore, these periods should be included in the length of service regarding which an early pension is assigned. </p><h2>  Pedagogical citizens </h2>

    <p>  Features of the appointment of pensions are regulated by law.  Early retirement pension for teachers is assigned regardless of their age.  The main thing is that the experience of professional activity is more than twenty-five years. </p><p>  When carrying out work in an organization whose name is not included in the list of pedagogical posts and institutions, this period of professional activity in the length of service for the appointment of a pension is not counted. </p><p>  Professional activities carried out before September 1, 2000, are counted in the length of service, regardless of the conditions for fulfilling the norm of working time at this time.
