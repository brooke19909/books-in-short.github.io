In addition, the loss of the adult population was so catastrophic that raising the birth rate became an extremely important task.  Given these factors and the obvious role of women, in 1944, the Soviet leadership approved the Order of "Maternal Glory". </p>

    <h2>  Regulation on the Order </h2><p>  "Maternal glory" is an order whose purpose, in principle, is understandable.  This is the difference between the valor and strength of the mother, her selfless work.  However, awards were awarded only to those women who gave birth, and also took on the upbringing of seven to nine children.  The decision on the award is taken by the Presidium of the Supreme Council, the ceremony of presentation of the order is held on behalf of the highest executive in the country. </p><p>  The Maternal Glory Order has three degrees.  The highest, of course, is the first.  This award is given to those women who have become a mother nine times.  According to the status of the insignia, it can be awarded only when the youngest has reached one year and all other children are alive.  The “Mother Glory” Order of the 2nd degree is awarded if there are eight children in the family.  It is also worth noting that the mother is awarded the appropriate award once, which she wears on her chest on the left side.  If there are other insignia, this order is hanged after all of them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Order of "Maternal Glory" of the 3rd degree is awarded in the presence of seven children. </p>

    <h2>  Award Features </h2><p>  When a decision is made on the presentation of this award, those children who were registered under guardianship law will certainly be taken into account.  And this is understandable, after the war there were a lot of orphans in the country.  Orphanages, hastily formed, could not cope with such a stream.  And in the same villages there were quite a few good people who took orphans from their neighboring yard to their family.  “Maternal Glory” is an order that must nevertheless reflect a feat.  And to take in the hungry, difficult years the devastation of other people's children into your family, what is not a feat? </p><p>  As follows from the award regulations, the selection of a candidate also takes into account those children who have disappeared or died while protecting their homeland or performing military duty, saving the lives of others, protecting state property or the rule of law.  In addition, if the older children of a woman died while performing a professional duty or injuries that were received during the hostilities, the state also takes them into account. </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  “Maternal Glory” is an order that was designed and created by the famous artist in the Soviet Union, Ivan Dubasov, who headed the art department of Goznak.  In parallel, the Order of the Mother Heroine and the Medal of Motherhood were established.  Thus, this award in its significance was somewhere in between. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The first recipients were selected on December 6, 1944, when 21 women were awarded with the first degree insignia, 26 received the second degree and 27 mothers received the third degree.  The first three medals were awarded to a collective farmer (first degree), a store saleswoman (second degree) and a housewife (third degree).  For almost twenty years, more than 753 thousand women received the highest award, orders of the second and third degree - more than 1.5 and 2.78 million women, respectively. </p><p>  By the beginning of 1995, the total number of women awarded exceeded 5.53 million women. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  "Maternal Glory" - an order that in all three degrees was made of silver.  Unlike most medals and orders, the shape of this award is an oval.  All three degrees differ from each other by the presence and color of enamel and gilding. </p><p>  The Soviet flag is located above: at the highest award it is covered with red enamel, at the second degree - blue, at the third - without enamel.  The name of the award and degree are engraved on the banner.  On the order of the first degree they are covered with gilding.  Below, under the banner on the right is a shield with embossed letters "USSR" and a small red five-pointed star in the middle and at the very top.  In the middle of the shield is a hammer and sickle.  The shield on the order of the first degree is covered with white enamel.  On the left side of the award is a full-length figure of a woman with a child sitting in her arms.  Below they are strewn with roses.  On the lower plane of the order are petals, also gilded at the order of the first degree. </p>

    <h2>  Order of modernity </h2><p>  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, almost all public institutions were destroyed or abandoned.  At that time, few were interested in demography and the institution of the family, as such.  However, in 2008 they again returned to stimulating family values.  The order "Parental Glory" was established, which became essentially an analogue of the Soviet insignia, but taking into account the merits of his father.  A new award is given to parents or adoptive parents whose family grows from four or more children.  The status of the Russian order repeats the position of the Soviet.  Details such as the presentation of the order occur when the youngest child reaches three years of age.  In the case of adoptive parents, it is necessary to comply with the conditions for decent detention of children taken from the orphanage for at least five years.  It is worth noting that the order is also accompanied by a monetary reward.  Initially, it was a one-time allowance of fifty thousand rubles, since 2013 it has been one hundred thousand. </p>
