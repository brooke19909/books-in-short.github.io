There are many options for decorating clothes, among which bead embroidery on clothes is one of the most spectacular and bright.  Simple patterns can even be performed by a novice craftswoman. </p><h2>  Materials </h2><p>  To perform beadwork on clothes you will need the following materials: </p><ul><li>  Beads of the required size and color.  In addition to the usual round beads, there are bugles, chopping, and faceted beads that give the finished product a beautiful shine and overflow of color.  In stores you can find beads of various shapes and sizes made of glass, natural stones, wood, plastic, metal.  Using a combination of these materials, you can create original and unique patterns using bead embroidery on clothing. </li><li>  Threads need to pick up strong and strong.  It can be nylon, cotton, silk or synthetic threads.  The quality of the threads is very important, otherwise the finished work will simply crumble when worn if the thread is frayed.  It is very important to attach beads and beads so that the pattern lies on the fabric evenly.  Even if the thread breaks, then it is much easier to restore a section of the pattern than the whole picture.  Threads are selected according to the color of the main fabric, and not the shade of beads. </li><li>  The hoop is needed in order to make it easier to embroider beads on clothes.  Using the hoop, the fabric is stretched and does not move. </li><li>  A pencil or crayon will help transfer the pattern to the fabric. </li><li>  Scissors, non-woven or canvas - necessary accessories. </li></ul><h2>  Performance technique </h2><p>  For those who for the first time decided to make embroidery on clothes with beads with their own hands, the easiest way is to buy a ready-made pattern applied to a water-soluble non-woven.  They are for sale in needlework stores.  You can also independently draw a pattern on the non-woven fabric, copying the picture you like.  It is important that the pattern is simple, without small details, otherwise it will be difficult to perform. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="pixshark.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for embroidery with beads on clothes" class="if uuid-2446887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2446887.jpg"></div><p>  Embroidery on the canvas simplifies the process when it comes to counted embroidery.  The canvas is sewn onto the main fabric, and at the end of the work, the canvas threads are simply pulled out.  If the embroidery size is large, then it would be more expedient to make it on a separate canvas, and then cut along the contour and attach it with hidden stitches to clothes.  When washing, the fragment is carefully steamed so that the fabric does not shed, and the beads do not lose color or fly off. </p><p>  The drawing you like can be applied directly to the fabric using a simple pencil, crayon or a dissolving marker.  If the fabric is thin, then the wrong side is sealed with non-woven fabric, and embroidery is used in the embroidery process. </p><p>  The technique of execution depends on the preferences of the needlewoman and the choice of drawing. </p><h2>  Types of seams </h2><p>  For embroidery with beads on clothes, several types of seams are used.  When working, one is selected that is easier to perform in this case.  The seams are simple and even a beginner needlewoman can master them.  Here, accuracy of execution is important so that the thread fits as close to the bead as possible, and there are no voids and gaps between the beads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thesewingdirectory.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork on clothes" class="if uuid-2446830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2446830.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Forward the needle - the beads are sequentially strung on the needle and sewn onto the fabric close to each other. </li><li>  Lowercase seam - beads are sewn sequentially to work, and at the end of each row, the needle is drawn through all the beads to the beginning of the seam.  Such a seam looks even and tight. </li><li>  Stem-shaped seam - fix the thread and string 2 beads.  Insert the needle after the second bead and again bring to the front between the beads.  Pass the needle through the second bead and string another one.  Repeat the procedure until the end of the row.  The seam will be tight and stiff. </li><li>  Arched seam - 4 beads are put on the thread immediately, the needle is inserted into the fabric at the end of this gap and is removed through the fabric between 3 and 4 beads, and passed through the extreme bead, as in a stitched seam.  3 beads are strung again and the process repeats. </li><li>  The seam is fastened - perhaps the simplest and fastest of those listed.  The required number of beads is put on one thread fixed at the base and punctured along a row.  With another thread with a needle, the chain is sewn to the fabric, the needle is inserted between the beads and wraps around the thread.  In this way, embroidery on clothing with beads can make flower stems, the outline of the pattern, or perform more complex fragments. </li><li>  Monastic stitch - work for the patient.  Suitable for counted embroidery on the canvas.  Each bead is sewn alternately.  The needle is displayed in the lower right corner of the canvas, a bead is strung, a needle is inserted in the upper left corner.  It turns out that on the front side all the stitches will be diagonal, and on the wrong side - vertical. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="weddingown.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork on clothes photo" class="if uuid-2446902" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2446902.jpg"></div><p>  These are the main types of seams that can be useful to a beginner needlewoman.  Anyone who has ever picked up a needle with a thread knows them, so they can handle bead embroidery on clothes, a photo of which can be seen here, without any problems. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Simple patterns </h2><p>  There are simple and effective ways to decorate your wardrobe, making elegant outfits from everyday simple options. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beadwork on clothes" class="if uuid-2446833" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44022/2446833.jpg"></div><p>  Pullover, <span>silk blouse</span> and even a wedding dress can be embroidered with single beads of different sizes.  This can be done both randomly and in a planned manner.  For example, from larger to smaller or with equal intervals. </p><p>  On clothes with a pencil or small pencil it‚Äôs enough to outline simple patterns for embroidery with beads on clothes: curved lines, stripes, contours of geometric shapes and bead embroidery on given lines with one of the above seams. </p><p>  Large and dense fragments of the picture are best done separately on the canvas or on fabric that matches the color of the item to be decorated.  Then, with sharp scissors, trim the pattern as close to the edge as possible and sweep it with a hidden seam to the clothes.  So that the edge is not visible, it is covered with a <span>decorative cord</span> or bead strip.

You can make monochrome embroidery, which will be strict and ascetic, or funny, bright, colorful. </p><h2>  Canvas embroidery </h2><p>  Canvas greatly facilitates the embroidery process.
