We look at the sky</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Those who like to look at celestial bodies today have practically no restrictions in expressing their interest.  It is enough to purchase a ticket to the observatory and enjoy watching the stars.  However, sophisticated amateurs are still advised to organize the possibility of such reviews right at home.  Moreover, manufacturers of astronomical equipment are constantly expanding and updating model lines designed for use by non-professionals.  An interested consumer just needs to turn to the segment, which presents telescopes for astronomy lovers.  How to choose a suitable device is the next and rather difficult question.  To answer it, you need to determine the selection criteria, the types of telescopes and consider the most successful models. </p><h2>  Key selection criteria </h2><p>  At the first stage, you should decide on the size and basic functionality of the telescope.  Home models, as a rule, have an aperture (diameter) from 60 to 200 mm.  As for the length, it is in the middle corridor from 300 to 1000 mm.  So that observations in the telescope can be recorded and conveniently converted to digital format, it will not be out of place to foresee the possibility of synchronizing the device with a computer.  Accordingly, the model should be provided with electronic filling and means for photographing.  Such devices are more expensive, but their capabilities justify the price.  With this equipment, for example, you can keep statistics by sending the created materials to a special database. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now it is worthwhile to examine in more detail the characteristics that telescopes have for astronomy lovers.  How to choose the best option?  The answer to this question is impossible without taking into account the capabilities of the equipment in terms of increase. </p>

    <h2>  Increase Ability Requirements </h2><p>  It is believed that the magnification of any optical device is determined by aperture and the ability to provide a clear image.  Roughly speaking, telescopes have no limits for magnification - just equip it with the right eyepiece.  But there is a border beyond which observable objects become indistinguishable.  That is, at certain ranges, detail and brightness begin to suffer.  Therefore, the main task of a novice astronomer is to learn how to determine the optimal magnification of a telescope in a specific model.  There is a simple formula for this: the diameter of the lens in millimeters is multiplied by 2. Thus, a high-quality apparatus with a diameter of 100 mm will provide a 200-fold increase.  This is enough to observe the clouds of Jupiter or the rings of Saturn.  True, much in the benefits of applying such an increase depends on weather conditions, but this is another matter. </p>

    <h2>  Proper selection </h2><p>  There are several types of telescopes that can be classified by purpose.  Those who plan to purposefully observe the planets should recommend refractor models in the diameter range from 120 to 150 mm.  A feature of such devices is the lack of central shielding, which provides a contrasting and vivid ‚Äúpicture‚Äù.  If you need to observe distant cosmic bodies or even faint galaxies, then you should choose larger telescopes for astronomy lovers.  How to choose the appropriate option in this case?  Firstly, it should be a reflector on the equatorial mount.  And secondly, its diameter should be selected within 200-250 mm. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are many lovers who observe through the telescope ground objects and phenomena.  For such tasks, it is recommended to use short-focus azimuth-mounted refractor models equipped with a reversible prism.  If you need an apparatus with the possibility of sorties outside the house, then it is better to prefer a transportable model developed on the basis of the Maksutov-Cassegrain system.  These are the so-called "hiking" devices that provide a good image, and at the same time are light and compact. </p>

    <h2>  Models for children: what to consider? </h2><p>  In the lineup of any major manufacturer of astronomical equipment, a children's telescope in several modifications is necessarily provided.  In particular, good options are presented in the Bresser Junior series.  Usually these are achromat refractors, the diameter of which varies from 80 to 90 mm.  It is important that the device is mounted on an azimuth mount for the convenience of a young user.  In addition, in order to save the child from unnecessary manipulations with equipment, it is worth referring to models with a lens system.  They are not particularly demanding in maintenance, but at the same time they are reliable and durable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Very small astronomers under 8 years old are recommended devices with lenses 60-80 mm.  Such a diameter will make it possible to get acquainted with the starry sky in general terms, which will at least cultivate the child's interest in further studies.  It will also be useful to supplement the children's telescope with a map of the sky and educational literature appropriate to age.  Practical lessons of astronomy, coupled with theory, will certainly give a good result in the development of hobby. </p>

    <h2>  Telescope mount </h2><p>  This device has been mentioned more than once.  It provides fixation of the apparatus and the possibility of its control.  There are many mounting options, but for amateur telescopes it is advisable to consider three varieties - the equatorial, azimuthal and Dobson systems.  The first option will be the best solution if you plan to observe elusive bodies, as well as perform astrophotographic operations.  Separately, it is worth considering support designed for transportable telescopes for astronomy lovers.  How to choose a mount for such a device?  The best option would be the azimuthal system, which is also used for children's telescopes.  Its advantages include ease of use and small size.  Devices built on the Dobson system also have a simple design and are unpretentious in maintenance.  For a beginner astronomer, this is the best option. </p>
