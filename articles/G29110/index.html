Creative way of the singer with a delicate soprano</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Maria Voronova has already taken several years a beautiful creative pseudonym - Marianne Moreau.  Under this name, she performs on the opera stage.  Easily and naturally, she managed to sing M. Weinberg‚Äôs complex composition ‚ÄúThree Palms,‚Äù which not every opera diva includes in her repertoire.  Both the first and second solo albums of the singer pleased the listeners.  One of them is called ‚ÄúWhen we live in love‚Äù and is a mixture of classical, popular and electronic music.  In another way, this style is called the "classic crossover." </p><h2>  Maria Voronova: biography </h2><p>  Maria was born in 1982 in Moscow.  At three years old, parents noticed the girl‚Äôs musical abilities and were taken to a music school.  It turned out that little Maria has an absolute pitch, and she was immediately assigned to the vocal department and the piano class.  She studied there for eleven years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Maria Voronova" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/1775800.jpg" width="600"></div>

Wanting to get a higher musical education, the girl entered the Moscow Conservatory.  She was lucky with teachers, and her personal and conservative teachers significantly developed Mary's natural data, she improved her singing spectrum, the range with which she currently easily takes notes from the first octave. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  First successes </h2><p>  With her gentle soprano, Maria Voronova performs complex parts in operas by famous composers without internal tension.
