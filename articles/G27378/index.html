If the child is large, then they will bring him not a crib, but a cot. </p><p>  In the mornings, a mournful chant of the muezzin, gathering the faithful to prayer, is clearly audible.  Near the hotel Saphir Hotel 4 * (Turkey, Alanya) is a real oriental bazaar.  It sells fruits, clothes, beach items.  Need to bargain. </p><p>  In the high season, there are not enough sunbeds by the water.  To take a deck chair, tourists got up at six in the morning.  The sea in this part of Turkey is turbulent.  Waves are a frequent occurrence.  A few meters from the shore, small pebbles are replaced by large boulders. </p><p>  But the food in the restaurants received excellent marks.  It was varied and tasty.  Chefs tried their best!  The chef often went out to the hall to make sure that visitors were satisfied.  But there were complaints about the Turkish Night program.  The table did not break from the abundance of traditional dishes.  Everything was modest. </p><p>  Travelers thanked the gardeners.  The park was always clean.  It grows lemons, oranges and other tropical trees. </p>
