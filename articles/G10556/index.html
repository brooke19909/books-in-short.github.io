    <h2>  What is the Serena water park in Finland? </h2><p>  First of all, it should be noted that this water park is the largest indoor tropical center of water attractions on the whole <span>Scandinavian peninsula.</span>  Serena is located in a place called Espoo, which is a suburb of the capital of the country - Helsinki.  Thus, you can get to it from the city center in just half an hour. </p><p>  Serena Water Park in Helsinki amazes visitors at first sight.  After all, it is located in a cave, surrounded by forest.  The entrance to it, as well as restaurants and changing rooms are right inside the cliff.  I must say that it looks very impressive. </p><p>  As regards the price-quality ratio of the services provided, according to this indicator, the water park is one of the best not only in Finland, but also in neighboring countries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park rating" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/460986.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do in the water park? </h2><p>  Serena Water Park in Helsinki has everything in its arsenal that will allow visitors to have a great time.  It has cold and hot pools, waterfalls, hot tubs, a <span>Finnish sauna</span> and a Turkish bath.  Also, it is worth highlighting the Serena water attractions.  Of these, two slides stand out especially - ‚ÄúTornado‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Hole‚Äù.  Be sure to visit the halfpipe, which is a descent from a <span>water slide</span> on rugs or <span>airbags.</span>  Of course, few people manage to stay on such a craft, but this is the whole charm of the attraction. </p><p>  The Serena water park in Helsinki also has a number of different cafes and bars where you can eat and gain strength before the next descent.  Also on the territory of this water amusement park there are shops where you can buy all the necessary beach accessories, if you suddenly forgot something at home, and snorkeling equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Water Park Hours </h2><p>  Serena welcomes guests almost all year round.  So, in the summer, the water park operates seven days a week.  In September, it closes for prevention.  During the off-season, Serena opens its doors only on weekends, however, during school holidays, the water park is open every day.  If you plan to visit this water attraction center from autumn to spring, keep in mind that not all attractions will function, but only those that are not located outdoors.  As for opening hours, the water park is open from 12 noon to 8 pm. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Perhaps the only inconvenience you may encounter when visiting Serena in Helsinki is a very large number of vacationers.  Moreover, most of them in the summer are our compatriots.  So, you‚Äôll hear Russian speech here almost everywhere, so you may get the feeling that you are not in Finland, but in the Anapa or Sochi water park.  On weekends, local residents are added to the flow of tourists, who also want to take a break from the heat and have fun on the rides.  Therefore, it is recommended to choose <span>weekdays</span> for visiting the water park <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Waterpark "Serena": prices </h2><p>  This amusement park rates its services as follows: </p><ul><li>  a day ticket on the <span>All inclusive</span> system will cost you 25 euros; </li><li>  for an evening ticket (from 16 to 20 hours) All inclusive will have to pay 20 euros; </li><li>  a family ticket for two adults and two children costs 94 euros, and for two adults and three children - 117 euros. </li></ul><p>  However, all food and drinks, with the exception of beer and other alcohol, are free.  Children under four years old do not take money for visiting the water park. </p><h2>  How to get to the water park? </h2><p>  Serena is located at Espoo, Tornim√§entie, 10. The easiest way to get here from Helsinki is by car.  However, you can easily do this with the help of a bus.  So, the following routes will take you to Serena: 21, 82, 71 and 339T.  On average, the road takes about half an hour. </p><h2>  Where to stay? </h2><p>  This water park in Helsinki does not have its own hotel to accommodate visitors.  Therefore, if you want to live closer to the amusement park, you can rent a cottage directly in Espoo or book a room in Korpilamp, located just half a kilometer from Serena.  However, most travelers do not see the point, because the water park is only 25 kilometers from Helsinki.  Thus, you will spend no more than an hour a day on the road. </p>

    <h2>  Rating of water parks in Finland </h2><p>  Interestingly, this country of our compatriots is poorly associated with water recreation.  Meanwhile, water parks in Finland are worth a visit.  After all, the quality of the services they provide is at the highest level.  As for the rating of water parks of this country, the first place in it is confidently occupied by Serena.  In second place is the Holiday Club Caribia in Turku.  Its name is not accidental, because this water park is stylized as exotic islands of the Caribbean.  It is located at a luxury spa hotel.  In addition to fun and dizzying rides, here you will find a whole range of water and recreational treatments. </p><p>  In third place is the Flamingo water park (Helsinki).  It is located on the territory of the largest shopping and entertainment complex in Finland.  This water park in its scope is able to surprise even the pretentious public.  So, there are seven pools with gushing geysers, dizzying water slides and long descents (the length of the most extreme of them is 150 meters).  Also at the service of visitors ‚ÄúFlamingo‚Äù offers towers for diving, a jacuzzi, saunas, platforms for playing water polo, etc. </p>
