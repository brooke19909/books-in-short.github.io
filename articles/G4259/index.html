In particular, the population in it was not like the European.  In the article we will answer the question: "Who is the purchase?"  So, the entire population of Ancient Russia was divided into two large categories: free and dependent people.  The first category included the aristocratic elite of society (princes, boyars), the service (combatants) and the merchant (merchants).  The second category was more complex in its structure, and two main social groups can be distinguished in it: personality-dependent or slaves.  These included serfs, who, unlike antiquity, were not classical but patriarchal slaves, and people who were economically dependent were purchases and rank-and-file, as well as stinks. </p><h2>  Code of Laws "Russian Truth" </h2><p>  These two categories of economically dependent populations are narrated by one, but very important historical source - Russian Truth.  It is a complex of ancient rules of written law, which took shape over several centuries, starting from the XI century.  It also contains the answer to the question: "Who is the purchase?"  The first to write down these laws was <span>Yaroslav the Wise</span> when he was a prince of Novgorod.  Then he supplemented after occupying the grand-ducal table in Kiev.  Then his children, the princes Yaroslavichi, and his grandson, Vladimir Monomakh, contributed to the Russian Truth. </p>

    <p>  The most detailed set of laws regulates the situation of procurement, to a much lesser extent - rank and file.  He also determines that procurement is a dependent category of the population.  In the <span>social status</span> of both, there are both common features and differences. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Common in the position of rank and file and procurements </h2><p>  The general thing is that the dependence of purchases and ranks had an economic basis.  A free man, or lyudin (in the terminology of that time), could become a rank-and-file worker, if he concluded a contract - a row, and a purchase - if he took a compartment, that is, a debt.  This instantly discounted the lives of addicted people.  If a fine of 40 hryvnias was imposed for the murder of ludin in Ancient Russia, then the life of a procurement and an ordinary soldier was equated to the life of a slave and stink and amounted to only 5 hryvnias.  It is such a fine that best emphasizes the dependence and incompleteness of these categories of the population.  Of course, procurement suffered more.  Defining them as dependent people implied the possibility of selling into slavery and so on. </p><h2>  Differences between Procurement and Ryadovich </h2><p>  Between purchases and rank-and-file there is a significant difference.  Ryadovich concluded an agreement, a series, for a certain period of time, and, as the Russian Pravda says, it was impossible under any circumstances to sell him into slavery, that is, to make him dependent on him. </p>

    <p>  The situation with the purchase was more complicated.  Taking the compartment, this man had to work it out on the farm of his master.  Typically, purchases were used in agricultural work or in cattle care.  The gentleman allowed them to use his property and inventory, but if the purchase spoiled him, then he was liable.  If he spoiled or stole someone else's property, then the responsibility lay already on the lord.  This is another feature of the social status of procurement, emphasizing the incompleteness of this category of the population. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But, unlike Ryadovich, procurement could be slandered, i.e., <span>enslaved.</span>  <span>This</span> was only allowed in two cases: </p><ul><li>  if the purchase steals something on the side; </li><li>  if he escapes from his master, and thereby actually refuses to return the debt-coupe. </li></ul><p>  If the master tried to slap the purchase without sufficient legal grounds, he could receive protection in the princely court. </p>

    <p>  Legal protection of procurement, unlike Ryadovich, is spelled out in enough detail in Russian Pravda.  In particular: </p><ul><li>  the purchase could not be sold as a slave; </li><li>  it was impossible to seize property in his possession; </li><li>  it was impossible to take from him the compartment given to him; </li><li>  procurement was forbidden to lease to anyone; </li><li>  he could not be tortured for no reason. </li></ul><p>  That is, procurement is a <span>dependent person,</span> but with a clearly defined legal status in society. </p><h2>  Protection of procurement rights </h2><p>  If any of the rights was violated, he could run to the prince‚Äôs court and claim non-compliance with the law.  This privilege of defense in a princely court emphasized that procurement is a former free man who, having worked a compartment, had the opportunity to return to his former social status.  He was also given the right to testify in court in the so-called minor claim, i.e., not very serious cases.  No other category of dependent population could do this. </p>
