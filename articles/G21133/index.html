LCD "Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya" offers just such housing.  This project, despite the eminent developer and its excellent location, has become a long-term construction, but now, with the change of the developer, the construction of the house has resumed.  They promise to commission this complex in the II quarter of this year.  We offer information on the current status of work, as well as on all the advantages and disadvantages of this complex. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  In the capital’s CJSC, in one of its most prestigious areas of Ramenki, the project “Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya” is being implemented.  The address of the object is: Mosfilmovskaya street, building number 74B.  Geographically, it is less than 100 meters from the intersection of Mosfilmovskaya with the understudy Lomonosovsky Prospect and Minskaya Street, and from Michurinsky Prospekt it is about 600 meters.  The closest neighbor to the complex under construction is the Zolotye Klyuchi residential complex, and the Vorobyovy Gory residential complex is located a little further.  These places in Ramenki differ in that the business and cultural life of Moscow is concentrated here.  A great advantage of the location is the calm situation in relation to crime in this area, focused on respectable wealthy citizens.  The building of the complex occupies a plot of 0.47 hectares, surrounded on three sides by highways.  There are no other residential buildings and high-rise buildings nearby, therefore, from the windows of each apartment there are picturesque views that are pleasing to the eye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1779286.jpg" width="495"></div>

According to residents of the Ramenki district, traffic jams are a rare occurrence, so it will be easy to get from here to the desired point in the city.  For those who prefer urban transport, it is convenient that within a radius of 150 meters from the residential complex, on Mosfilmovskaya street and on Lomonosovsky prospect, there are bus stops and buses heading to the Luzhniki stadium, Kiev railway station, Cheryomushki, Dovzhenko street, Universitet metro station "," Youth "and" Kashirskaya ".  Interval of movement of 10 minutes.  You can drive to these metro stations in 7, maximum 10 minutes.  In March this year, the new Lomonosovsky Prospekt station was commissioned.  It is only 850 meters from the complex, so now for residents and on foot the path to the metro will take a maximum of 10 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ZhK Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1779302.jpg" width="495"></div>

    <h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  The Ramenki district in Moscow is one of the most environmentally friendly.  There is not a single plant here, and the wind rose is such that all the pollution from the thermal power station and the industrial zone of the CJSC “fly away” without harm.  The only thing that will worsen the environment for residents of the Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya residential complex is the large motorways and gas station in the immediate vicinity of the complex.  In contrast to this small inconvenience, just 450 meters from the building being built, the river Ramenka flows, a little further, just behind the railway  the branch stretches the Matveyevsky forest, and a little further on the unique reserve “Setun River Valley”.  If you move from the complex towards the center of the capital, then there are many green areas where you can walk while enjoying nature.  The most popular are the Botanical Garden, Vorobyovy Gory, Michurinsky Pond, Mosfilm Pond, Vorobyevskaya Embankment. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The well-known and fairly responsible company Morton began to build the complex.  “Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya” is one of dozens of its large-scale projects.  As a rule, the Morton company always brings its facilities to completion, improves the local area, and builds housing with good quality.  Regarding this LCD, the situation was not entirely favorable.  Its deadline was set for 2015, but the construction site was frozen.  In 2016, Morton Group joined PIK, Russia's largest construction company, which undertook to reanimate this project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Morton Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1779253.jpg" width="497"></div>  PIK Group appeared on the real estate construction market in 1994.  Now it unites about 50 divisions in many regions of Russia.  In the past 2016, the company commissioned 12 housing complexes, including 63 multi-storey buildings.  Among them are “Buninsky meadows”, “Novokurkino”, “Orange Park”, “Salaryevo Park”.  PIK Group of Companies is considered one of the most reliable developers in Moscow and the region, characterized by high quality construction and installation works in surrendering complexes.  At the same time, the company is trying not to violate the deadlines.

    <h2>  Description of apartments </h2><p>  Spacious and bright apartments are offered in the residential complex “Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya”.  Reviews about housing in this complex are mixed.  Buyers like the fact that they have large panoramic windows laid in the project from which fabulous views open, especially from rooms in the front of the building.  Some of those who have purchased or are going to purchase housing here, note the free planning as a merit.  This means that in the apartments there will be no interior partitions at all, with the exception of the bath and the bathroom, and a niche of up to 5 m2 is allocated for the kitchen.  Other potential residents see a flaw in this concept.  The housing stock in the complex includes apartments: </p><p>  - one-room, with an area of ​​47 square meters.  up to 75 sq. m .; </p><p>  - two-room apartments - from 61 sq. m.  up to 70 sq. m .; </p><p>  - three rooms - 95 sq. m.  up to 127 sq. m. </p><p>  You can buy them both without finishing, and with finishing (pre-finishing). </p><p>  The apartments will have glazed windows, flooded floors, radiators installed, communications installed and electrical wiring completed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya parking place" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1779244.jpg" width="482"></div>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Morton promised to hand over Morton, which became a long-term construction project, at Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya.  Later, a few more times the deadlines were postponed until the construction work stopped at all.  The new PIK developer has set a deadline for the second quarter of this year.  Work at the facility is very active.  The house is already fully erected, now the builders are finishing the glazing in the apartments, conducting internal work, and are engaged in underground parking.  Many potential residents have great doubts that the property will be completely finished within the remaining month.  More realistic forecasts are such that the complex will be commissioned, and people will receive the keys closer to the end of this year. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Ramenki is an expensive area.  Real estate prices here are about the same as in the center of the capital.  Residential complex “Headquarters on Mosfilmovskaya” does not stand out from the general standard that has developed over the past years.  At this stage of construction, apartments here can be purchased at the following prices: </p><p>  - one-room from 8,237,000 rubles; </p><p>  - two-room apartments from 11 143 000 rubles; </p><p>  - three-room apartments from 16 937 000 rubles. </p><p>  The method of registration of real estate upon purchase is DDU. </p><p>  It should be noted that since apartments are classified as non-residential premises, it is impossible to register in them, utilities will cost about 4000-5000 more than in classic apartments, plus property tax must be paid annually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Headquarters Mosfilmovskaya reviews" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1779321.jpg" width="488"></div>
