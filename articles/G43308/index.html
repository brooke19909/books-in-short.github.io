  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sanatoria of Crimea offer excellent relaxation and treatment</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Rest in Crimea</span> causes every person many associations.  The sun, the beach, tanning, bodily comfort, mild climate and clear sky.  But first of all, of course they go to the Crimea overseas, it is not just beautiful here.  Scientists believe that the composition of <span>sea ​​water is</span> similar to human blood and lymph, so when bathing in it through the skin, microelements and other useful substances penetrate the body.  They increase the general tone, strengthen the heart, blood vessels, skin and other organs.  This is especially felt in the Black Sea, in which water has a balanced salt composition. </p><p>  Therefore, it is not surprising that the sanatoriums of Crimea are very popular among tourists who know the rich healing abilities of this peninsula.  There are more than three dozen mineral muds that have been used for three thousand years.  For example, in the muds of Lake Saki there are 10 times more vitamins and amino acids than in the <span>muds of the Dead Sea.</span>  To use all these therapeutic possibilities, numerous boarding houses, hospitals and sanatoriums of Crimea have been built and are receiving visitors. </p><p>  <span>The Crimean peninsula</span> is unique in its relief and in the variety of intense geological processes that took place here.  Therefore, it is so rich in various thermal and mineral springs, which are found in large numbers (about 100).  There are waters that are familiar with daily use, and there are unique sources.  For example, the water of the spring Suvlukh-su located near Alushta removes radionuclides from the body with high intensity.  The most famous mineral water is “Crimean”, which helps with diseases of the stomach, liver and kidneys, as well as “Theodosia” for the treatment of the nervous system and upper respiratory tract. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the sanatoriums of Crimea help to recover not only with the help of mineral waters and mud.  The unique climate of the peninsula has healing properties.  The territory of the <span>Southern coast of Crimea,</span> which is considered to be sub-Mediterranean and has subtropical vegetation and amazing wildlife <span>,</span> is especially different.  In summer, the climate is hot (in August the temperature reaches 40), but such weather is often refreshed by short salvation showers.  Traditionally, the holiday season in Crimea begins in May and lasts until mid-October.  This is the best resort for residents of the European territory in terms of humidity and the intensity of solar radiation. </p><p>  Under such natural climatic conditions, the sanatoriums of Crimea provide their visitors with not only excellent opportunities for relaxation, but also provide a wonderful opportunity to be treated and gain strength.  The most famous resorts of the peninsula are Yalta, Alushta, Simferopol, Sudak, Feodosiya and Yevpatoriya.  The recognized resort <span>capital of Crimea</span> is Yalta.  Here are located Massandra Beach that meets international standards, the Druzhba health resort, the Foros health resort, and others, known on the Crimean peninsula.  Alushta resort is more attractive for those wishing to combine an excellent quality vacation with affordable prices.  Here is a magnificent sanatorium "Alushta". </p><p>  You can perfectly relax and be treated in the West of Crimea in Yevpatoriya, which is a large balneological and mud resort, especially useful for children.  The sanatoriums Helios, Oren-Crimea and Eaglet are distinguished.  Near the numerous sanatoriums of Evpatoria is the sanatorium Nikolaevka Crimea.  The eastern part of the peninsula is famous for the <span>sanatoriums of the Feodosiya resort</span> (the healing mud from the local lake Ajigol received the Great European Gold Medal).  The sanatoriums Voskhod and TsVKS are very famous here.  Koktebel is a unique place for rest and treatment. Famous creative personalities have traditionally rested and are resting here.  It is believed that the beauty of the Blue Bay located in Koktebel is in friendship with muses. </p>
