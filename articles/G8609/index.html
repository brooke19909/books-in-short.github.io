However, an unprepared user will not even notice any difference between the speakers for several thousand dollars and the usual active speakers in 2.0 format.  Therefore, for simple listening to music and playing visual content, ordinary speakers (albeit in a wooden case) are quite suitable.  Just to the acoustics of this class belongs Sven SPS-702.  A review of these custom speakers promises to be interesting.  "Non-standard" in the sense that now the dominance of acoustics is in 2.1 format.  And such instances look too outdated.  However, they may surprise.  So let's get started. </p><h2>  A little bit about the company </h2><p>  Manufacturer Sven appeared on the international market in 1991.  Then a little-known Finnish company could not count on some decent place in a world full of competitors.  However, over time, users realized that Sven offers quality products at reasonable prices.  At the moment, the company is engaged in the production of budget <span>speakers, systems for home theater,</span> headphones and headsets, as well as other computer peripherals.  And things are going pretty well with the manufacturer.  For example, the 2.0 Sven SPS-702 speakers have become a true bestseller.  Although in fairness it is worth saying that many products from Sven boast good sales.  Their headsets for gamers also enjoy well-deserved popularity among users. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sven sps 702 reviews" class="if uuid-2548273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548273.jpg"></div><p>  And in modern realities, Sven products are very stable in popularity.  Even cheap Chinese counterparts could not squeeze it off the pedestal.  And all because the main thing for the company is quality.  If a customer purchases a quality product, he is satisfied.  And again, he decides to buy products from this manufacturer.  This is Sven's logic.  And she looks right.  If all global manufacturers thought that way, users would get completely different quality components.  But all this is fantasy.  Today, companies make very unreliable devices (before the first breakdown).  However, we were distracted.  Now let's move on to the review <span>of the</span> Sven SPS-702 <span>speaker system</span> .  User reviews give hope that the speakers will not disappoint. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  So, let's start the review of the multimedia speaker system.  And the first item is the scope of delivery.  He is Spartan simple.  The speaker is packaged in a recycled cardboard box.  The box is colored.  On one side is a colorful image of the speakers themselves, and on the other, technical specifications in different languages.  Inside are the Sven SPS-702 speakers themselves, connecting cables and user manuals in different languages.  There is nothing more.  Such scarcity of the delivery set is standard for speakers of this class.  Do not forget that we have entry-level speakers.  They don‚Äôt even have the ability to remotely control through the remote.  Therefore, do not be surprised.  Now let's move on to the design of acoustics.  For many, this is an important factor, since the speakers should not only sound good, but also have a presentable appearance. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="market.yandex.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers sven sps 702 reviews" class="if uuid-2548276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548276.jpg"></div><h2>  Appearance and design </h2><p>  The appearance of the column can be attributed to the classic.  There are no designer frills here.  And it is right.  For all sorts of "prettiness" and unusual forms only spoil the sound.  True, this statement is true only for speakers of the same class.  The casing of the columns is made of MDF coated with black or brown veneer (depending on the color scheme).  On the front panel are speakers covered with a protective mesh.  An amplifier is built into one of the speakers.  Volume and frequency controls are displayed on the front panel.  But the power button is located on the back of the column, which is not quite convenient.  These are in appearance the SVEN SPS-702.  User reviews suggest that the <span>speaker system</span> fits perfectly into any interior thanks to its classic design.  Now let's move on to the technical specifications. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  It is time for boring numbers and obscure abbreviations.  No numbers anywhere.  According to the passport data, these speakers have a rated output power of 40 watts.  At first glance, not bad.  But everyone knows perfectly well what the "western" Watts are worth.  The number should be divided by two.  But 20 watts is enough to sound a room of standard sizes.  Computer speakers Sven SPS-702 has a two-way design.  In the arsenal of each speaker is a low-frequency and high-frequency speakers.  There is no special speaker for reproducing mid frequencies.  The frequency range of the speakers starts at around 40 Hz and ends at 22,000 Hz.  This is a standard feature for speakers of this class.  The active speaker also has a headphone output.  The connection between the active and passive speakers is via RCA connectors (tulips).  Here, in principle, all the characteristics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sound features </h2><p>  Now let's analyze the sound quality.  It should be noted right away that one should not expect divine reproduction from these columns.  The class is not the same.  Nevertheless, the Sven SPS-702 acoustics copes well with the mid frequencies (which is strange, given the lack of a special speaker) and reproduces the high ones quite well.  But with the low, in general, trouble.  The shallow ‚Äúbass‚Äù is clearly not enough to show the full depth of the bass.  And if you unscrew the low-frequency control to the maximum, then the speakers begin to choke.  This is either a miscalculation of constructors, or class features.  In any case, when watching a movie, the speakers will not be able to provide a reliable sound of the explosion or rumble of a rocket turbine.  But the speakers cope well with simple music.  They especially succeed in genres in which powerful and deep bass is not required: rock, metal, country and so on.  Problems with dubstep, acid, and grooving can occur.  But overall, the sound is acceptable.  Unassuming listeners will be satisfied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="price-altai.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers sven sps 702" class="if uuid-2548278" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548278.jpg"></div><p>  As for watching movies, here the feelings are twofold.  On the one hand, the speakers provide good quality playback of dialogs and music.  There is even an illusion of volume, which is not observed in other speakers of this level.  However, the sounds of explosions, the roar of engines, the rumble of turbines in an airplane speakers clearly fail.  There is a problem when playing moments saturated with deep low frequencies.  However, this option is much better than headphones or cheap Chinese "tweeters."  The proper depth of low sounds will not be, but the quality of the rest of the voice acting will be on top.  And therefore, this speaker system is quite suitable for viewing the masterpieces of world cinema.  Unassuming users will be thrilled.  Especially after cheap Chinese "tweeters" or the sound of laptop speakers. </p><h2>  Noise level </h2><p>  But this is one of the few drawbacks of the Sven SPS-702.  User reviews are full of negativity in this regard.  Indeed, in idle mode, the speakers mercilessly "fonit".  <span>Extraneous noise is</span> also noticeable when listening to music at minimum volume.  But, based on the experience of testing such speaker systems, we can safely say that this situation is typical for Sven.  In speakers of this class, the simplest amplifiers are used, which create a similar background.  It is also worth considering that the speakers do not have magnetic shielding.  And this factor also negatively affects the noise level.  Particularly advanced owners of these speakers have found a way to deal with this problem.  They simply turn off the built-in amplifier and connect speakers through a separate receiver.  This allows you to get rid of noise and improve the sound several times.  But this option is not for everyone.  However, given the price of this speaker system, a small background noise is quite acceptable for the money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="market.karelia.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers sven sps 702 specifications" class="if uuid-2548284" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548284.jpg"></div><h2>  Column Setup </h2><p>  Fine tuning of the speakers is necessary only if the user wants to achieve the highest quality sound.  It is worth noting immediately that each style of music requires its own settings.  But if the user is an adherent of any one musical direction, then there will be no problems with this.  So, let's begin.  First of all, it is worth taking care of the correct reproduction of high frequencies.  Here you can safely twist the appropriate controller to the maximum.  In the standard position there is a clear lack of high.  This is a feature of the Sven SPS-702.  The characteristics of the tweeter are such that it cannot reliably reproduce high without a little help.  Now they are medium: nothing can be done with them, since there is no corresponding regulator.  However, if you listen to music through a computer, you can amplify the midrange using the software equalizer of the player.  This will add a sound of credibility.  Now low.  You have to be careful here.  The knob should be twisted to a minimum, checking the sound at each stage.  If it is noticeable that the speaker begins to wheeze and choke, then it is worth lowering the level of bass.  This is the only way to find the ideal value.  If everything is done correctly, then the sound of these speakers will be quite acceptable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="price-altai.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speakers sven sps 702" class="if uuid-2548286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548286.jpg"></div><h2>  Instructions for use </h2><p>  This "piece of paper" is in the box, in the same place as the Sven SPS-702 speakers.  Specifications, wiring diagrams, precautions for use - that's all there is.  True, all this is framed very accessible and set out in several languages.  Including Russian.  A very interesting speaker connection scheme.  It is colorfully depicted as a picture and provided with textual comments.  Even a frank beginner will figure out the connection.  And the presence of a full-fledged Russian language in the instructions favorably distinguishes Sven products against the background of Chinese goods with a crooked translation.  For this alone, you can put the company five points. </p><h2>  Owner reviews </h2><p>  The opinion of users about the product is very important, since it allows you to find out how the product behaves in real life.  The numbers can be anything, but not the fact that they correspond to reality.  So how do Sven SPS-702 columns qualify?  User reviews are inconsistent.  There are both positive and negative comments.  However, with a slight margin, the positive win.  Negative ones were left by those people who wanted to get premium-class acoustics for ridiculous money and were disappointed in their expectations.  However, we consider the reviews in more detail.  Let's start with the positive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.onlinetrade.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="speaker system sven sps 702" class="if uuid-2548281" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548281.jpg"></div><p>  Many owners of these columns note the highest build quality.  All elements are fitted exactly, nothing creaks and does not play, protective nets sit tight.  Also praised were awarded materials.  They are very high quality.  Users also note the correct speaker design.  All internal elements are positioned to provide the best quality sound (as much as possible within the enclosure).  As for the sound, the vast majority of owners are satisfied with the playback quality of the Sven SPS-702.  Positive reviews in this regard make it clear that people knew what they were taking.  And they do not require crystal clear sound from budget acoustics, as in the speakers for several thousand dollars.  Ease of use of the speaker system also received positive comments.  Even a child can configure these columns correctly.  For a certain frequency spectrum, you will have to use a software equalizer, but all the main things can be adjusted in the amplifier itself.  Now let's move on to the negative reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="5element.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="computer speakers sven sps 702" class="if uuid-2548282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2548282.jpg"></div><p>  Negative comments for the most part do not deserve attention.  But there are those among them that really reflect the state of things.  For example, complaints about the strong background of the Sven SPS-702 speakers.  User reviews here are true.  Extraneous noise interferes with listening to music at minimum volume.  And at night, the speakers have to be completely turned off, because even with the sound turned off, the background remains.  This is due to the features of the amplifier and the complete absence of magnetic shielding.  Also, adequate owners left their comments about the woofer.  He does not cope with his duties at high volume levels.  Of course, this is not a subwoofer, but reliable reproduction of low frequencies would not hurt when watching a movie.  However, reviews are moderate.  Everyone understands that far from everything is available to a budget speaker system.  Also, many owners note that using speakers would be much more convenient if you had a remote control.  It's true.  But you do not always get what you want.  Of the adequate negative comments should be noted and complaints about the location of the power button.  It is really ill-conceived.  Reaching for the back panel is very uncomfortable.  But this is all the little things.  The speakers provide good sound for their price.  And this is the most important thing. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we examined the Sven SPS-702 speakers.  The review makes it clear that this is an entry-level speaker system.  Therefore, "audiophiles" and other connoisseurs of high-quality sound, it does not fit.  Nevertheless, the unpretentious listener can count on a relatively accurate reproduction of all frequencies in some genres of music.  And when you consider that many people buy such speakers just to make ‚Äúsomething in their ears,‚Äù this option can be considered ideal.  It is unlikely that any other manufacturer will have speakers in a wooden case for such a price.  Of course, there are drawbacks to these columns, but their advantages easily outweigh.  The main thing here is relatively high-quality sound.  And this does not take away from the ‚ÄúSvens‚Äù.  And the acquisition of this speaker system will not hit your pocket, and the family budget will remain intact.  There is something to think about. </p>
