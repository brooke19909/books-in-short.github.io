Which washing machine is the most reliable</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When every consumer watches a washing machine, he asks a question of a reliable choice of equipment.  Because now there are a lot of different manufacturers.  If a person does not understand this, it is sometimes difficult to choose a good washing machine.  So that it meets the requirements of the buyer.  After all, I want the washing machine to have a long service life and not break.  Usually, all manufacturers promise that it will work without problems, but in reality it happens differently.  And some devices work for a long time, while others break down after a short time of use. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discountappliancecentre.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="why washing machines break down" class="if uuid-2912231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108418/2912231.jpg"></div><h2>  Reliable manufacturer </h2><p>  Opinions about the operation of the machine a lot.  Someone thinks that cars break prematurely simply because the person himself made mistakes.  Of course, we get used to rely on the assessment of the masters in service centers. </p><p>  Among various manufacturers, the Bosch washing machine is noted. </p><p>  It is distinguished from many others by its long service life without breakdowns.  On average, it will serve the consumer for 16 years.  This service life is a big indicator.  Because, for example, washing machines from other manufacturers, namely: LG, Atlant, do not differ by a long period of operation.  They work without breakdowns up to 10 years.  Therefore, German quality in this area speaks for itself.  Many consumers have already appreciated the really long service life, time-tested. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The most important thing is that once you spend money on buying a washing machine, you can use it for so long and not worry about it breaking down.  Such fears mainly appear when working with the technology of companies such as Candy, Zanyssi, Vestel.  After all, they are considered the most short-lived in use.  Many consumers who bought cars of these companies very often turn to service centers with a request to repair them.  On average, the washing machines of these companies will last up to 5 years.  Which is very small compared to other manufacturers.  And there is no desire to invest in such a purchase.  Because I don‚Äôt want to repair it in a year.  Thus, it becomes clear which washing machine is the most reliable and best. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.reference.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do not lose the guarantee" class="if uuid-2912237" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108418/2912237.jpg"></div><h2>  Factors Affecting Life </h2><p>  The period during which you can use the washing machine depends on many points. </p><p>  First of all, it is the quality of water.  If it is very stiff, then a plaque may form inside the machine.  It is very important that various small objects do not fall into the drum.  Since these factors will shorten the life of the device.  Grounding must be done so that no power surges occur.  After all, they can occur during washing, and the program will fail.  Washing machines of not very reliable manufacturers will break due to such voltage drops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Using a washing machine </h2><p>  To use it, the entire life of the washing machine must: </p><ul><li>  At the end of washing, unplug it from the outlet. </li><li>  Do not violate operating rules. </li><li>  Wipe it regularly inside and out. </li></ul><h2>  Warranty Period </h2><p>  For different manufacturers, this period may vary slightly.  But for example, a warranty period of 1 year is provided by the company that manufactures the Bosch washing machine.  This is the duration of service that is established by law. </p><div class="photo" data-original="versus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="car bosh" class="if uuid-2912250" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108418/2912250.jpg"></div><p>  There are also models for which the guarantee is issued for a period of 3 years. </p><p>  When buying a hand washing machine, a document is issued that confirms that it is possible to eliminate the breakdown of the washing machine if necessary during the warranty period.  You can extend the warranty period of a washing machine for a small fee, thereby increasing it to 5 years.  The warranty is extended in accordance with the tariffs set by this company. </p><h2>  Types of damage </h2><p>  A washing machine is an apparatus that is technically complicated.  Damage can occur in different places.  For example, it can: </p><ul><li>  damage the tank; </li><li>  deteriorate the heating mechanism; </li><li>  burst the hose; </li></ul><p>  Therefore, it is important to know what types of damage apply to warranty service. </p><p>  These include damage resulting from: </p><ul><li>  factory defect; </li><li>  inaccurate storage; </li></ul><p>  That is, there should be breakdowns that arose not through the fault of the consumer.  Only with such signs will the warranty on the washing machine be valid. </p><div class="photo" data-original="productnation.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to care" class="if uuid-2912259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108418/2912259.jpg"></div><h2>  How not to lose the guarantee </h2><p>  It is important to understand that the warranty applies only to damage that is provided for in this document.  In service centers, the masters first check for themselves whether it is really possible to carry out repairs for free.  If the consumer seeks a solution to the problem when the warranty or the life of the washing machine is over, he will be denied repairs. </p><p>  If violations are identified by the masters, then on this basis the consumer is deprived of the right to free repair.  In the future, you can fix the washing machine, but only on a fee basis.  And at the prices that are set by the service center.  Therefore, it is better not to try to mislead the workers, counting on the repair of the washing machine, which broke down due to improper care of the owner himself.  After all, experts will immediately understand this. </p><p>  In this regard, it is necessary to know the cases of cancellation of the guarantee: </p><ul><li>  if the installation of the washing machine was carried out by an employee who does not have a certificate; </li><li>  if the unit breaks when using an extension cord; </li><li>  if a small object gets into the drum; </li><li>  if the machine has previously been given for repair; </li></ul><p>  The latter case is sometimes regarded ambiguously.  Because there are situations when equipment that was being repaired is sold in a store. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.papertostone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warranty service" class="if uuid-2912271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/108418/2912271.jpg"></div><p>  After that, the consumer bought a washing machine with a non-existent warranty.  It is difficult to prove that it was being repaired before the purchase.  To do this, it is necessary to conduct an examination.  Also, in order not to lose the warranty, it is not necessary for any reason to open the body of the washing machine. </p><p>  Now you know how long the washing machine lasts.  Having examined the main points regarding the purchase of a washing machine and its maintenance, you can make a purchase.  Warranty service conditions are best known before going to the store.  So that the masters do not refuse to repair the washing machine due to the fact that damage is not included in the warranty. </p>
