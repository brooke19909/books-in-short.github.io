His work marked a new stage in Russian literature.  To this day, many consider his educational and religious ideas to be authoritative and solely correct.  Such popularity could not but lead Tolstoy to world recognition. </p><h2>  In memory </h2><p>  In addition to the fact that on the territory of Russia there is a village of Leo Tolstoy, and not one, there are also schools of the same name, clubs, libraries and, of course, museums.  The main attraction, which reminds us of the greatness of this writer, is in Yasnaya Polyana.  The museum was decorated in the former estate of Lev Nikolaevich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lion Tolstoy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1547659.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Moscow also houses the Tolstoy Memorial Museum in its former manor house.  There is also another memorable place at the former Apostolovo station (now Leo Tolstoy).  It was in him that the writer died. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, there is a village of Leo Tolstoy.  The most popular is in the Lipetsk region, also in the Kaluga and Grozny regions.  Of course, these are not the only references to the name of the writer. </p><h2>  Toponyms </h2><p>  The village of Leo Tolstoy is located in the Lev-Tolstoy district of the Lipetsk region.  This area borders with the Ryazan region.  During its formation, this region had a different name - Astapovsky.  It was formed in 1928.  For a long time the district was part of different regions, in 1954 it became the property of Lipetsk.  Already after 10 years, the Leo-Tolstoy settlement was divided between two others: Dankovsky and Chaplyginsky.  But after 2 years, he again regained his independence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Village </h2><p>  Almost all his life Lev Nikolaevich lived in Yasnaya Polyana.  But he did not die in his native village.  It so happened that his death was overtaken by the head of the station.  The writer was the last to see Ozolin's house.  The village of Leo Tolstoy received this name 8 years after the death of the writer. </p><p>  Already in 1918, a museum dedicated to Lev Nikolaevich was opened in the house of the head of the station.  After the Great Patriotic War, this memorial became a branch of the Moscow State Museum of L.N.  Tolstoy.  By the way, in 1927, the village became much larger and received the status of urban settlement. </p><p>  Its area is only 18 square kilometers.  Previously, there was an increase in population, but now only a decrease is noticeable.  If you look at the photo of the village of Leo Tolstoy, Lipetsk region, you can see a pretty enough place.  Despite the fact that there are 9 more village councils in this region, the writers' is the most populated - 8,457 inhabitants, although the smallest.  Leo-Tolstovsky village council has only one settlement. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="photo of the lion village of the thick Lipetsk region" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1547660.jpg" width="600"></div>

It was organized back in the Soviet years, and in 2000 it became the center of the October rural settlement. </p><h2>  Memorable places </h2><p>  In the Samara region there is also a mention of the great writer.  In the regional center is the <span>estate of Tolstoy,</span> in which he lived in the summer of 1875.  And in Alekseevsky district there is a tiny village named after the classic. </p><p>  But in the Chernsky district of the Tula region the memory of the writer recalls even more places.  Of course, here you can‚Äôt find the village of Leo Tolstoy, as in the Suvorov district of the same region.  But there is no less famous family estate Nikolskoe-Vyazemskoye, which is located 100 km from Yasnaya Polyana, as well as the village of Tolstovsky. </p><p>  There is also another clan settlement Pokrovskoye.  Here lived a cousin of the writer.  Later Tolstoy‚Äôs sister settled here.  By the way, not only Lev Nikolaevich, but also Ivan Sergeevich Turgenev came to her.  In the village of Grinevka, the writer‚Äôs son used to live.  Here is his former manor. </p><h2>  Kaluga region </h2><p>  In Russia, not the only village Leo Tolstoy.  Photos can be found in the village named after Leo Tolstoy.  It is located in the Kaluga region.  The administrative center is located in the Dzerzhinsky district.  There are only 3 settlements. </p>

    <p>  This rural settlement is officially called a municipality.  It received such status in 2004.  The past few years have seen a decrease in the population, but since 2016, positive trends have been noticeable.  Now 3894 people live here. </p><p>  Perhaps this is the only settlement named after the writer, which at the moment looks poor and unhappy.  The village of Leo Tolstoy is famous for its poultry farm and monastery.  The latter really looks very beautiful and majestic.  Perhaps this is the only place in the whole village where you can spiritually get enough and relax. </p><h2>  Always remember </h2><p>  In addition to place names, the name train was awarded the name of Leo Tolstoy, which follows from the Russian capital to Helsinki.  There is also a ship, it is the second in its series.  The first was named after Anton Chekhov.  Both carry passengers along the Volga, Neva and Volga-Balt. </p><p>  On Mercury is the ancient impact crater Tolstoy.  He received such a name for a reason.  The fact is that all the craters on this planet, it was decided to name in honor of writers, artists, poets, composers and sculptors.  Therefore, next to Tolstoy, you can see Beethoven, Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, etc. </p><p>  Also in 1978, a typical asteroid was found, which is located on the main belt.  He was discovered by the famous astronomer Nikolai Chernykh.  It was this cosmic body that was decided to be named in honor of Lev Nikolaevich. </p>
