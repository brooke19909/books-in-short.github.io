You can choose any one that will be best suited to the interior and the nature of the person.  In addition, these methods of creation are simple and do not constitute any special difficulties in their implementation.  The main thing is that there is a desire to create something beautiful and individual. </p><h2>  Where to start creating a picture </h2><p>  First you need to decide on the technique of the future masterpiece.

Even when the abstract and absurd idea came to mind, one should not be afraid of it.  It‚Äôs best to record it somewhere in a conspicuous place. </p><p>  Materials and threads are recommended to be put aside in a separate box, which will help in the future when creating a new masterpiece. </p><p>  After all the ideas are collected, you can begin your work and create a panel of threads.

    <p>  To create such a picture, threads for floss, yarn, silk and even threads drawn from pieces of fabric are used.  All this wealth will give the product a peculiar charm and sophistication.  And in combination with lace, the picture will become simply irresistible. </p><p>  Phylumics as a technique for creating paintings with their own hands is not too common, but its popularity among needlewomen is growing.  Thread painting helps to create amazing paintings for every taste. </p><h2>  DIY painting using phylum </h2><p>  In order to create a picture using the technique of phylum, you will need threads and pieces of fabric.  It is very important to follow the instructions. </p><ol><li>  First of all, you should choose a picture and its size, as well as choose a suitable frame. </li><li>  When a drawing is selected, it is recommended to determine the material.  If there are multi-colored threads and shreds of fabric, you can begin to work. </li><li>  A drawing of interest is applied to the selected fabric background with a simple pencil. </li><li>  After that, PVA glue is applied to the drawing.  If these are small sewing or fabric threads, then they are very easy to set on the surface. </li><li>  It is recommended to gently and slowly glue the threads on the picture.  Also, do not forget that a large amount of glue can spoil the background, and in general the whole picture. </li><li>  When the threads and shreds are glued, the panel is placed for several hours in a dry place. </li></ol>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The whole stage of creating a picture in the described technique takes several hours.  Of course, the production time also depends on constant practice. </p><h2>  Thread and glue paintings </h2><p>  <span>You</span> can also <span>draw with threads</span> in the technique of nitkography.  It differs from phylum in that the threads, like felt-tip pens, draw every stroke of the picture.  For this method of creating a thread from a picture you will need: </p><ol><li>  Thick sheet of cardboard or fiberboard. </li><li>  Woolen <span>threads, floss</span> or yarn. </li><li>  Glue (it is recommended to purchase building). </li><li>  A simple pencil, ruler, toothpick or gypsy needle. </li><li>  Scissors. </li></ol><p>  When everything is prepared and the pattern for the picture is already selected, you can start creating the product.  It is required to put a drawing on a cardboard or fiberboard with a simple pencil.  Subsequently, the image will be filled with threads.  For those who are just starting to make <span>paintings with their own hands,</span> it is better to choose acrylic threads.  But if the yarn is fluffy or twisted, the effect of the picture will become even more interesting.  Another important point is that the threads have the same thickness. </p><p>  After the threads are selected, glue should be applied to the drawing.  The glue is applied with a toothpick over short distances.  The thread should be glued to still dry glue and gradually pressed with your fingers.  And so, in turn, fill the whole picture with threads.  The main secret in creating such a picture: large parts are immediately glued, and then small ones are filled. </p><h2>  Colored applique made of threads </h2><p>  Pictures of <span>woolen threads</span> look great using the applique technique.  If it is possible to create a panel of colored threads, then you should adhere to certain rules. </p><p>  For starters, it is recommended to cut the threads very finely.  It is also important to be patient, because the technique requires a lot of time and perseverance.  But the results will be inspiring, the pictures will be fantastic.  To begin to implement the idea, you should stock up: </p><ul><li>  <span>construction glue</span> or PVA; </li><li>  threads of various colors; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  thick cardboard; </li><li>  with a brush and a simple pencil. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pictures from threads master class" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11007/1224518.jpg" width="445"></div></li></ul><p>  After preparing the cardboard and applying a pattern on it, the threads should be finely chopped.  It is best to arrange them in colors in insulating containers.  When all the preparatory work has been completed, you can proceed to the main stage. </p><p>  It is recommended to apply glue with a brush to the desired area.  After this, sprinkle abundantly with chopped thread and press by hand.  Next, carry out the procedure with the whole pattern and, after waiting for the glue to completely dry, squeeze out the excess thread trimmers.  Such an application will appeal not only to children, but also to the most fastidious adults. </p><h2>  DIY embroidery </h2><p>  Embroidery in the picture looks like drawn.  This makes the product even more attractive.  Known embroidery methods are cross and surface.  But in order to embroider a picture on your own, you need to have special skills. </p><p>  For beginners, manufacturers provide kits that help to complete the picture with threads, patterns of future embroideries.  They are convenient in that even a novice needlewoman can create a beautiful panel.  To do this, you only need: </p><ul><li>  scheme of the picture; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  multi-colored threads; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  decor. </li></ul>

    <p>  It is important to remember that when choosing threads, you should acquire similar colors and shades.  Then the picture will be with smooth and concise transitions. </p><h2>  Isonity Technique </h2><p>  Sinking makes it possible to make <span>paintings voluminous</span> and deep.  It uses not only threads, but also nails.  To create a picture of the thread in this way, you need to have a little experience.  Sinking is a rather painstaking and long-lasting technique, for it you will need special materials: </p><ul><li>  thick cardboard; </li><li>  an awl or a large needle; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  floss; </li><li>  compass and pencil. </li></ul><p>  Cardboard must be tight.  Velvet paper is also allowed.  The drawing is applied in the form of geometric shapes: triangle, circle, oval.  Further, holes are pierced along the edges of the figure at the same distance.  Threads are passed very carefully through the holes.  The thread should be one, otherwise it threatens to entangle them.  It is also recommended to select material with brilliance, then the picture looks much more elegant. </p><h2>  Picture of threads with nails </h2><p>  Making a picture with your own hands, you can use nails.  A pattern is applied to the chipboard, and small nails are driven along its edges.  Nails should be at the same distance and height.  Then, in turn, pull the thread on the cloves.  You can fix it with a nodule at the base of the nail. </p><p>  Such an original panel is suitable for any interior, the main thing is to choose a picture and color scheme.  The good thing is that it is very easy to do.  This technique does not require special preparatory stages and skills. </p>
