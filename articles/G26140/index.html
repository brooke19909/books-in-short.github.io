And therefore, the infrastructure here is well developed.  ‚ÄúCardinal Hotel 3 *‚Äù (Russia, Sochi, Lazarevskoye) - the hotel is very comfortable.

The beaches in Lazarevsky are comfortable for swimming.  The coast here is covered with small pebbles.  Of course, the beaches of Sochi are not as wide and beautiful as, for example, in India or Egypt.  But their length is sufficient so that there is enough space for everyone.  And the views here, and especially at sunset, are wonderful.  People in Lazarevsky, including on the beaches, usually still have less rest than directly in Sochi. </p><p>  Sunset at the seaside near the Cardinal Hotel is relatively convenient.  True, sometimes quite large boulders are found under water.  So older people should be careful.  But the sea in Lazarevsky, as well as in general in Sochi, is always very warm.  It is cloudy only after a storm (for several days).  The beach itself, located next to the hotel, is quite clean.  In any case, even cigarette butts can be seen here infrequently.  Tourists usually find a place for a rug on the beach quickly.  Existing large stones in extreme cases can be removed and stacked in a heap aside. </p><p>  Of course, umbrellas and sun loungers are rented on the beach.  This service is very inexpensive (around 100 rubles per day).  Of course, organized on the seashore in Lazarevsky and water activities.  Tourists have the opportunity to ride a "banana", "tablet", parachute, take a boat trip on a boat, etc. </p>
