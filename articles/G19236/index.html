    <h2>  Phone screen: reviews </h2><p>  Of course, the phone‚Äôs display has modest resolution and color depth indicators that are modest enough for modern mobile solutions.  But if we talk specifically about the segment in which the Philips E160 phone is represented (the reviews of its owners can confirm this), then the characteristics of the screen are quite consistent with those of competing solutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main thing is that the text is clearly visible on the display, as well as the main contents of multimedia files, if they are downloaded to the phone or downloaded via cable.  Good visibility of the display is important when using the functions of the operating system: there are practically no problems with this, due to the quality of the display, as users note. </p><h2>  Communication modules </h2><p>  Let us now examine how the owners of the device evaluate the quality of the communication modules with which the Philips E160 phone is equipped.  User reviews regarding these options can be divided. </p><p>  So, there is a group of opinions regarding the fact that the phone lacks support for modern communication standards - such as 3G and WiFi.  But if you look at the price of the device - owners who have a different opinion on this matter believe that you can understand that very few competing solutions include such options.  The lack of 3G and WiFi is quite common on budget phones, and in this sense, the E160 is no exception.  At the same time, file transfer can always be done via a USB cable, Bluetooth, or in extreme cases using the WAP 2.0 standard, if, of course, the operator‚Äôs tariffing allows. </p>

    <p>  As for the existing communication modules of the device, the quality of their work is evaluated quite positively.  According to users, data transfer via Bluetooth or via wire is carried out as a whole without any special difficulties.  Concerning the Philips Xenium E160 GSM phone module, the feedback from the device owners can confirm this, it also functions stably, providing high-quality voice, SMS and MMS without any overhead, if, of course, everything is fine on the operator‚Äôs side. </p><h2>  Phone battery: reviews </h2><p>  The most likely competitive option of the phone in question is the battery.  Many users buy this device, first of all, in order to be able to use its capabilities in terms of battery life.  Those parameters of the battery that are declared by the manufacturer Philips E160 - customer reviews of the phone can confirm this as a whole are confirmed by real testing of the device.  Indeed, it can provide stand-alone talk time of about 8 hours, and standby time is approximately 35 hours.  These indicators are practically unattainable even on many premium modern phones (unless, of course, we are talking about the use of specialized models with batteries with increased capacity, but even few of them are capable of achieving the indicated indicators of battery life). </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs battery is charged quickly enough, discharged - in relation to the intensity of the involvement of various modules of the device.  In principle, in most cases, you can calculate when the battery is about to run out, and, most likely, have time to use the charger by that time. </p><h2>  Phone operating system: reviews </h2><p>  Let us now consider how users evaluate the quality of the Philips E160 operating system.  Characteristics, reviews relating to it - an important aspect of studying the real capabilities of the device, rating the quality of its work.  As we noted above, the phone is controlled by a branded operating system.  It is presented in a very simple structure: it does not intend to deploy complex on-screen menus, nor use a large number of applications. </p><p>  Of course, for a user who is accustomed to going into branded online stores of programs for mobile solutions every now and then, the capabilities of the operating system may seem extremely limited.  But in terms of the effectiveness of solving basic user tasks, the OS installed on the phone performs its functions perfectly - providing the user with stable interfaces for making calls, sending messages, and managing calls. </p><h2>  Sound quality </h2><p>  The main function that the Philips Xenium E160 mobile phone is called upon to perform is reviews about it, probably belong to the category of the most frequent ones, this is the reception and transmission of sound during the user's telephone conversations.  In addition, as we noted at the beginning of the article, the device can play MP3 files, as well as various polyphonic ringtones. </p>

    <p>  The main requirements for the phone in this case are the reproduction of high-quality sound, as well as stable operation when the user activates the corresponding function.  According to the owners of the device in question, it is quite effective in terms of solving such problems.  Despite the fact that the function of receiving and transmitting sound seems very simple, in fact, the technologies that are implemented by manufacturers of mobile phones are very complex and require significant investment in development and debugging.  In general, Philips, copes with the task - to withstand competition in terms of equipping manufactured phones with technological modules for receiving and transmitting sound.  As well as, in fact, for playing it in various file formats. </p><h2>  The appearance of the phone and build quality </h2><p>  The appearance and quality of the sample is an important aspect of the overall assessment of any mobile device.  The Philips E160 cell phone is no exception.  Reviews of its owners regarding these characteristics are the most positive.  For many users, appearance and assembly are among the main criteria for choosing a phone, presented in the corresponding segment.  Indeed, if a lot of the phone in terms of functions and support for modern communications is not required - even if it is assembled it will be of high quality and will look decent.  From this point of view, the device in question can be attributed to the leading solutions in its segment.  There are not many phones on the market from third-party brands that would be characterized by such a high build quality. </p><p>  If we talk about design - of course, it can look very simple.  But in this you can see its advantage: laconic forms are often a sign of good taste.  Especially if we are not talking about dubious refinements that might be appropriate in the design of a higher-level phone, but in this case they will be excesses. </p>

    <h2>  Convenience of using the device </h2><p>  Another significant characteristic of a mobile device is how convenient it is to use it.  How is the Philips E160 mobile phone evaluated in this aspect?  User reviews here, again, are in many cases dissimilar.  Some phone owners believe that it is a bit complicated to manage, especially given the small range of its functions.  Indeed, the structure of the phone‚Äôs software menu may seem somewhat complicated.  But others believe that you just need to get used to it, and access to the necessary options can be carried out very quickly.  Thus, the menu structure is albeit complex (at the same time it is an assessment thesis), but it is very logical. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, we examined the main characteristics of such a device as the Philips Xenium E160 phone, user reviews about it.  What conclusions can we draw? </p><p>  Based on user ratings, as well as a list of characteristics, it is legitimate to single out the following strengths of the device: </p><p>  - a powerful battery; </p><p>  - high quality communication modules; </p><p>  - great build. </p><p>  At the same time, the phone in terms of the marked options can rightfully be attributed to the segment leaders.  If we talk about the shortcomings of the device, then these are detected mainly when explicitly comparing the capabilities of the device with a typical modern mobile solution.  In particular, the lack of support for 3G and Wi-Fi, although nominally, can be considered weak points of the phone, in fact, this nuance can not be considered a full-fledged disadvantage of the device, since these modules are also usually absent in competing solutions.  At the same time, the big question is whether devices from third-party manufacturers are capable of providing, in particular, comparable indicators for battery life. </p>
