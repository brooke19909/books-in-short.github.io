What are consoles for video games, mankind learned in the seventies of the last century.  The first consoles were much simpler than modern ones.  The very first game they played was tennis - two rackets in the form of rectangles and a ball instead of a ball.  Later in the 80s, 8-bit color games appeared, and then in the 90s - 16-bit.  Closer to the two thousandth year, manufacturers began to make game consoles, close to modern ones.

    <h2>  The choice of a modern device </h2><p>  When it comes to choosing an electronic toy for children, parents discover that progress has gone far ahead, and more than one generation has changed over the decades.  What are consoles in the modern sense?  In the production of game consoles, or as they are now called, game consoles, they use the latest technology, and the consoles themselves today stand like a real <span>desktop computer.</span>  Everyone knows that you can play video games not only on the console, but also on a computer or laptop.  This is where the question arises: what is better to choose - a computer, laptop, tablet, or still a game console? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Game console </h2><p>  The computer, in comparison with the console, is more versatile.

Modern game consoles also have some of these functions (watching videos, listening to music).  Therefore, for those who have a stationary computer at home, and the console is bought by a child exclusively for games, we can recommend making your choice towards the console.  Moreover, when downloading games that are designed for a computer, it is often necessary to go through a long registration and installation procedure.

Therefore, in order to play new games, it will be necessary to periodically ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù the computer toppings, and this pleasure is not cheap.  On the other hand, a TV set-top box requires a TV, and a new generation of consoles requires an LSD TV.  And if there is only one such TV in the apartment, you will have to give it to your child or buy him a portable video game console.  And what are consoles that fit in your pocket and do not require a connection to the TV?

    <p>  The first portable consoles appeared in the late 70s and over the decades improved, kept pace with the times.  Game consoles consist of a display, a controller, and batteries that charge from the network.  Having a small size, they fit in your pocket, this allows you to use them on the road and in any public place, which is completely inconvenient in the case of a laptop or mobile phone.  You can also connect several consoles via wires or via W-Fi, and then up to several dozen people can take part in the game.  At the moment, the most common PSP game console among consumers.  The only drawback with portable consoles is the small display and less convenient controls compared to set-top boxes. </p><p>  Having dealt with the question of what consoles are, what types are presented on the modern market, it remains only to make your choice in favor of the model of interest with the necessary characteristics. </p>
