Many vacationers compare this area with a real paradise on earth.  The nature in this emirate is really just luxurious.  And, of course, the most comfortable stay in Dubai, as in any other resort in the world, can be secured by renting rooms in a five-star hotel.  For example, guests of the UAE can stay in this city at the Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina 5 * hotel. </p><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  The Le Meridien Hotel is located in Dubai in the Jumeirah area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLamai Beach.  This resort area is notable primarily for the fact that mainly European and American tourists like to spend time here.  Very often our compatriots also come here to rest.  A characteristic feature of the Jumeirah region is that only low-rise private buildings and modest multi-storey buildings of modern architecture were built here.  In any case, this part of Dubai looks quite presentable and beautiful. </p>

    <h2>  Facilities for children </h2><p>  The Hotel Le Meridien took care of the convenience of not only adult tourists living here, but also children.  In addition to the two paddling pools, the hotel has 2 playgrounds for them - indoor and outdoor.  For a fee, parents can hire a nanny at the hotel or order a children's menu in the restaurant. </p><h2>  Guest reviews on hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  The service provided by guests at Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is considered by most travelers to be quality.  Very good reviews on the web are available, for example, about the pool of this hotel.  Water parameters are monitored here by employees of a special laboratory equipped in the hotel (samples are taken).  So tourists are absolutely safe to swim in the hotel‚Äôs pool.  There are a lot of sun loungers and umbrellas in the courtyard of the hotel and they are usually enough for all guests.  If desired, residents of Le Meridien can also visit the pool of the adjacent large hotel.  Here you can not only splash and cool, but also enjoy swimming. </p><p>  One of the features of the complex is that the pool is open until late in the evening.  Guests can swim in it even at half past ten.  This mode of operation of the pool for Dubai hotels is actually a rarity.  For a long time in the evenings, they operate at this resort only in the most expensive and good complexes.  In addition, from the hotel‚Äôs pool, tourists can enjoy magnificent views of the nearby bay. </p><p>  The hotel staff considers most travelers quite polite.  However, the employees of this hotel treat their guests, rather, not warmly and benevolently, as in many other resort hotels of the world, but neutral.  But at least employees of the complex try to perform their duties well.  At the hotel, among other things, Russian-speaking guides from tour operators are on duty. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina: entertainment in the hotel </h2><p>  The gym of this complex praises most of its former guests.  This room is equipped in the hotel, judging by the reviews, very good.  Le Meridien also earned great water sports.  Some tourists, for example, advise beginners to definitely book a kayak here.  Such entertainment in the hotel is worth about 30 dirhams. </p>

    <h2>  What kind of guests are provided with meals </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina belongs to the class of five-star hotels, the all-inclusive system for vacationers, unfortunately, is not provided.  Rooms at this hotel can only be rented with breakfast, half board or guest house.  When checking in, tourists leave a deposit to the administrators in this complex.  If desired, in the future, guests can take any drinks in the bar, working in the complex.  However, upon departure, the cost of the latter, unfortunately, is deducted by the hotel staff from the deposit.  About this, domestic tourists, who decided to rent rooms in this hotel, are, of course.  know. </p><p>  There are as many as two restaurants in Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Resort Hotel.  Both of them have earned relatively good reviews from tourists.  The menu in the dining rooms of the hotel, as noted by vacationers, is quite diverse.  Local cooks are delicious, judging by the reviews.  The only thing vacationers say in their reviews on the Web is that the food in the restaurants of this hotel is often unheated.  This vacationers, of course, are attributed to the minuses of the hotel. </p><p>  The guests of the complex can have breakfast only in the main restaurant Latest Recipe.  It is located on the lowest floor of the hotel building.  For lunch or dinner, guests can check in at Blue Orange.  Judging by the reviews, there are usually not too many people in this restaurant.  But the choice of dishes in Blue orange is not as diverse as in the main dining room. </p>

    <p>  Drinks are not included in the price, not only in the hotel bar, but also in restaurants.  This is a tourist destination in Le Meridien should also be kept in mind.  If you do not want to pay for juices and mineral water, vacationers should just carry a bottle of water with them. </p><h2>  What is a hotel beach? </h2><p>  The sea, as already mentioned, is right next to the hotel.  A feature of the Le Meridien Mina Seyahi Beach Resort &amp; Marina is that it owns as much as 1,200 m of nearby coastline. </p><p>  Reviews from travelers the beach of this hotel has earned just magnificent.  The coastline in this place is covered with fine white sand.  Walking on it, judging by the reviews of vacationers, is very nice.  However, experienced vacationers recommend that beginners still wear slates on the hotel beach.  The fact is that sometimes broken sharp seashells are found in the sand here. </p>

    <p>  The sea itself opposite the hotel also earned simply excellent reviews from vacationers.  The water in it is clear and clean.  The entrance to the sea on the beach of the complex is gentle.  And this in turn, of course, is especially convenient for tourists who come to rest with children.  Too much sea excitement near the hotel in the season almost never happens.  Among other things, in the bay opposite the complex, exotic colorful fish swim in flocks, causing swimming enthusiasts. </p>
