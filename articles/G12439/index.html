    <p>  To begin with, we will conduct a brief excursion about what washing machines (types, types) can be found on store shelves, and how they differ from each other.  Then in more detail we will consider the main group of this segment - automatic devices. </p><h2>  "Machine" </h2><p>  If automatic units have a full-featured program control, such types of washing machines as a semiautomatic device are deprived of it.  All that they have at their disposal is a timer to set the duration of the wash. </p><p>  In addition, the degree of automation of a particular model may also vary.  For example, some types of Bosch or Indesit washing machines can estimate the amount of water, its temperature, the presence of detergent and the spin speed, while others just do the washing according to a given program and nothing more.  Here we are talking about the price segment: more expensive models are able to control the whole process, as they say, from and to, and budget models are equipped with only basic functionality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Moreover, the types of washing machines "automatic" can be divided into types of working mechanism - activator and drum.  Where the latter are distinguished by a more gentle washing, significant savings in detergents and water, and also have a complex, but at the same time reliable design.  <span>Activator types of washing machines</span> (a photo of them you can see in the article) are very rare, because this prerogative is mainly semi-automatic. </p><h2>  "Semiautomatic device" </h2><p>  All models of the semi-automatic type can be denoted by a simple and understandable expression: "basin with a motor."  The main component of such units is a shaft with a disk or blades, which mixes the laundry.  The technique of this plan is not fastidious, so almost any powder can be used during washing. </p>

    <p>  Many people remember how semi-automatic ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù machines that were located in almost every house were popular in the 90s.  You can hardly find such rare types of <span>washing machines</span> , except in the ads ‚ÄúGive free‚Äù.  But some very successful owners of such a ‚Äúretro‚Äù also manage to make money for them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Today‚Äôs types of semi-automatic washing machines have received some changes in terms of reliability, ergonomics and appearance, but the principle has remained unchanged - it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbasin with a motor‚Äù, as it is not to decorate.  The production of such units is mainly carried out by domestic manufacturers (models "Fairy", "Saturn", "Unit", "Lily", etc.).  These types of <span>washing machines with a vertical load</span> are quite inexpensive in comparison with the "machines".  The price tag can vary widely - from 1,000 to 6,000 rubles. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of washing machines of this kind is mobility, that is, such a technique will be very useful for those people who often move from one place to another.  Disadvantages also occur: </p><ul><li>  washing programs, in view of their scarcity, can be said to be absent; </li><li>  low speed; </li><li>  fastidiousness to water temperature; </li><li>  binding to a bathroom or toilet to drain the waste fluid. </li></ul><p>  In general, these types of washing machines will be appreciated either by young couples, or summer residents, who are always moving. </p><h2>  Ultrasonic machines </h2><p>  In general, as such, the class of ultrasonic washing devices appeared thanks to massagers, and more precisely, after the latter was re-qualified to the first.  Such cars wash ... nothing.  In order to dissolve the stain, that is, to carry out the usual haircut, it is necessary to soak the laundry in a special strong powder.  Whether you complete the whole process with or without this device, there is no difference, because for this procedure it is important to have only water, powder and everything, and the accompanying ultrasonic poultices are just an unnecessary props. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Now consider the most popular and most sought-after automatic washing machines (types, specifications). </p><h2>  Washing class </h2><p>  There are only three indicators of ‚Äúclass‚Äù in automatic units: </p><ul><li>  washing; </li><li>  spin; </li><li>  energy saving. </li></ul><p>  All of them, as well as the corresponding class scatter, are denoted by letters from A to G. That is, the model marked "Class A" is the most advanced in technical terms, while the "G" sign indicates an extremely economical and extremely budget version of the machine. </p><p>  In addition, some types of washing machines (Bosch, Indesit, LG, etc.) have subclasses: A ++, A +++, etc., where the main criterion for evaluating is the gentleness of washing and energy saving (the more pluses, the better). </p><p>  As for the spin, this system works in the same order: ‚ÄúA‚Äù - 1600 rpm.  and dry laundry at the exit, and ‚ÄúG‚Äù - 400 rpm.  and a lot of moisture on the lees.  The energy-saving class (from "A" to "G") is determined by the same principle. </p><p>  Models that are mostly represented on our market are marked ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚ÄúB‚Äù, and the average owner does not feel much difference, so sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to chase an expensive class and pay a lot of money.  For example, the Indesit washing machine (types of ‚Äúsemi-automatic‚Äù are not considered) from category ‚ÄúB‚Äù will easily plug a similar aggregate from ‚ÄúVEKO‚Äù with a mark ‚ÄúA‚Äù into the belt, so here you need to look not only at class affiliation, but also at product quality of a brand, in general. </p><h2>  Manufacturers </h2><p>  As for the choice of this kind of equipment in the manufacturer, then everything is simple.  Models from manufacturers of the first echelon can be selected by color and size, and the brand itself will take care of the rest (reliability and quality).  Here we are talking about such venerable aggregates as "Bosh", "Indesit", "Zanussi", "Candy", etc. </p>

    <p>  Regarding the second tier - not so simple.  Among these manufacturers you can find worthy specimens, and at a very affordable price, but many characteristics will have to be weighed and studied.  These include models (‚Äúclones‚Äù) of Whirpool, Westel, ‚ÄúAriston‚Äù, etc., assembled at domestic factories. </p><h2>  Machine types </h2><p>  All <span>types of automatic</span> washing machines can be divided into two types: </p><ul><li>  with vertical loading; </li><li>  front-loading. </li></ul><p>  Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Which model to choose depends on you, your living space and the number of family members. </p><h2>  Front type </h2><p>  Front-end units in the household appliance market the most.  Looking at sales statistics, you might think that people are just strangers or have never heard of other types of washing machines.  The advantages of such models are obvious.  Here is a good capacity (about 7-9 kg), and trouble-free layout, as well as the ability to integrate them into kitchen furniture.  Well, someone just likes to watch the process through the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù in front. </p>

    <p>  But behind all the pluses, their flaws are also hidden.  One of these, and for some critical, is the dimensions.  And if the same ‚Äúbasin with a motor‚Äù can be installed in any suitable place, and put the ‚Äúvertical line‚Äù in a narrow passage or corner, then such a number will not work with the front-end.  Of course, you can look for a less picky model with a narrow "waist", but then the amount of washing will be noticeably less, which is not an option for large families. </p><h2>  Vertical type </h2><p>  One of the main advantages of frontal type models is the ability to take out and put things directly during washing.  It is very convenient if you accidentally slipped a pink sweater with white trousers, or, conversely, just forgot to put something on.  In addition, you do not have to squat and bend down. </p>

    <p>  Disadvantages of cars of this kind are also available.  One of them is the frequent complaints of owners about the quality of washing.  This also includes a very modest amount of things, in comparison with the ‚Äúfrontal‚Äù (no more than 5-6 kg), which is extremely small for large families. </p><h2>  Volume </h2><p>  If you look at the same sales statistics, you can see that models with a volume of 4-5 kg ‚Äã‚Äãdiverge more actively than other units.  In fact, this is the best option, both for an average family of 3-4 people, and for a lonely living person, with the only difference being that the family simply erases more often than a bachelor. </p><p>  Some especially pedantic citizens are engaged in the process of stripping on strictly allotted days of the week / month, storing laundry in baskets.  For such, more spacious options for 8 or 10 kg are provided, as they say, all at a time.  In addition, such models have proven themselves in large families, where fathers, children, and grandparents live in the same house / apartment. </p><p>  As for the minimum volumes, then in the domestic market you can find small copies of one and a half to two kilograms.  It‚Äôs basically impractical to use such models at home, but for a summer house or some separate sauna, it‚Äôs quite suitable. </p><h2>  Drum material </h2><p>  Be sure to check the quality of the material from which one of the most important elements in the washing machine is made - the drum, before buying.  The basis for the cylinder can be composite materials, stainless or enameled steel.  The latter is very common in units from second-tier manufacturers and is characterized by the lowest durability. </p><p>  As for composite materials, this is the most optimal and far from cheap option inherent in more expensive and "noble" models from Europe, Korea or Turkey.  In addition, the composite drum is less noisy, has good thermal insulation and is much more durable in comparison with enameled specimens. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  You need to choose household appliances of such a plan not only based on your personal preferences, but also taking into account factors such as the size of the apartment, the number of family members, the availability of water supply and other nuances. </p>

    <p>  If you huddle in a small apartment, then the frontal units will make you even more constrained, so you need to look closely at the machines with vertical loading or devices that are built into the sink.  The latter, although they are much more expensive than their unprepossessing brothers, save the lion's share of space. </p><p>  When there are no problems with free space, then you can consider all the options you like, and in addition, additionally buy a tumble dryer so as not to hang the clothes on the ropes throughout the bathroom or apartment.  Moreover, this option will save you not only space, but also time, and you will only have to come to everything ready. </p><p>  As for specific models, which can be called not only high-quality in many respects, but also more or less universal, then try to look closely at the list below. </p><p>  Widely sought after washing machines in the domestic market: </p><ol><li>  <em>LG F-1281TD5</em> (850x600x590 mm / 65 kg) - front load of 8 kg, tank volume - 58 liters, spin - 1200 rpm .; </li><li>  <em>Bosch WLM 20441</em> (850x600x450 mm / 64 kg) - front load of 6 kg, tank volume - 46 liters, spin - 1000 rpm .; </li><li>  <em>Indesit WIUN 105 CIS</em> (850x595x323 mm / 53 kg) - front loading of 4 kg, tank volume - 27 liters, spin - 1000 rpm .; </li><li>  <em>Zanussi ZWP 582</em> (890x400x400 mm / 58 kg) - vertical load of 6 kg, spin - 850 rpm .; </li><li>  <em>Hotpoint-Ariston ARTXD 109</em> (850x400x400 mm / 56 kg) - vertical load of 6 kg, spin - 1000 rpm. </li></ol>
