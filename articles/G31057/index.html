A bustling metropolis, where life does not stop for a minute, resembles a busy anthill.  Charming Cordoba (Argentina), spread on the left bank of the Sikuya River, on the Pampas Plain, is a scientific and industrial center, which is no less valuable than the capital of the state. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Cordoba, which has grown over time, has existed in the country for several centuries.  Before the era of colonization, the Indians lived here, and then the Spanish conquistador Jeronimo Luis de Cabrera in 1573 opens this part of Argentina to the whole world.  Gradually, the settlement, named after the city of the same name in Spain, turns into the administrative center of the region.  Authorities pay special attention to the city, where the Jesuits arrived are engaged in educational and cultural activities, contributing to the development of Cordoba in Argentina.  Temples are being built here, educational institutions are being built, sewer and water supply networks are being laid, and street lighting is appearing. </p><p>  In the middle of the 20th century, the village turned into the main industrial center of the country.  The capital of the province of the same name is famous for its developed tourist infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Jesuit quarter </h2><p>  Vacationers are interested in the architectural attractions of Cordoba (Argentina), which we will talk about.

And now it is a colorful illustration of the merger of European culture with the local. </p><h2>  The oldest educational institution in the country </h2><p>  For many years, a university has existed on the territory of the Argentinean pearl.  Now it consists of 12 faculties, several institutes and an observatory.  In the two-story mansion, which looks rather modest, there is also a museum, the exhibits of which tell about the history of the institution, where the Jesuits taught theology and philosophy at the beginning of the 17th century. </p><p>  And in the courtyard there is a monument to one of the founders of the university - Fernando's father. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  Connoisseurs of luxurious architectural works will not be disappointed with an exciting trip to Cordoba (Argentina).
