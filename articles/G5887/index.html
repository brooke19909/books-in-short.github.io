Marti La Perla 4 *</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hotel "Marty la Perla" (Marmaris) is actually located not in the city itself, but not far from it, in a small settlement called Icmeler.  This resort is located 8 km from Marmaris in the province of Mugla.  The location of the settlement is very good.  At this point in the Aegean is a small bay.  Icmeler itself is surrounded on three sides by a pine forest.  The air is clean, nature is simply mesmerizing.  Locals advise you to go for a walk in the mountains, because from the top you have an unforgettable view of the narrow bay, small green islands in the middle of the sea blue, a dense forest. </p><p>  In the center of all this beauty, the Marti La Perla Hotel (Marmaris) was built on the coast.  Opposite it are two picturesque rocky islands.  You can rent a boat and ride around them.  Those who love fresh air and the surrounding nature, rest in such a place will leave an indelible impression.  From large and noisy cities, it is best to choose just such small villages as Icmeler for relaxation.  Both the length of its streets and the width are approximately 1.5 km. </p><p>  From the coast you can see the port of Marmaris with many yachts and ships.  The city received its name in honor of the marble mined here in antiquity.  Now it is a famous resort and center for sailing.  Guests at the Marty La Perla Hotel (Marmaris) can go there for shopping, on interesting excursions, in the evenings, having fun in local restaurants and bars.  But first, let's look carefully at what this hotel is. </p><h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  The first thing that distinguishes the Marty La Perla Hotel in Marmaris is its beautiful view from the window.  Some rooms look at the sea bay, while others look at the greenery of the park area and the pine forest.  Even when buying a trip to the resort, you can pre-select a room with a view you like. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I would like to note the cleanliness of the beaches.  Throughout the territory of Icmeler stretches a sandy beach of an unusual dark color.  This beach is awarded the Blue Flag of UNESCO for the cleanliness of the coast. </p><p>  Another feature of this resort is the permission for all settlers to use the services of the Marti Resort Hotel located in the neighborhood. </p><p>  All rooms are non-smoking.  Some sites describe the hotel as an adult-only place.  Children under 15 are not allowed.  But there are sites where there is no such information, but on the contrary, they write what kind of entertainment for children there is in the hotel.  To confirm this, you need to check with the travel agent when booking. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The Marty La Perla Hotel in Marmaris was built in 1988, and was last restored in 2010 and 2014.  It is a building of five floors.  The case is located at an angle, enclosing a patio.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is 5700 square meters.  m </p>

    <p>  According to travelers, the hotel food is fresh and of high quality.  The breakfast buffet is the same as in other hotels.  Fried eggs, sausages, pancakes, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãcheese and meat, dairy products.  The only thing guests note is a large number of different fruits. </p><p>  For lunch, there are several options for first courses, various soups.  Meat and fish dishes with side dishes for every taste.  People note that the food seems to be simple and it seems that there is nothing special in it, but after a sightseeing trip and a forced lunch at another hotel, the difference is striking. </p><p>  For dinner, there are many dishes prepared on the grill: meat, freshly caught fish, vegetables, shrimp.  Drinks are also decent, some did not like the wine, but it is still a matter of taste. </p><p>  Most reviews regarding nutrition have a large assortment of Turkish national sweets. </p><h2>  Hotel Bars </h2><p>  In addition to the restaurant, there are also four bars in the hotel: Fenix ‚Äã‚Äãbar, Snack bar, Lobby, Restaurant bar.  They are placed in the hotel premises and in the fresh air.  There you can drink freshly squeezed juices at any time (up to 2 nights), eat delicious ice cream and drink imported alcohol, but you will have to pay extra for this.  But Turkish local drinks are absolutely free, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. </p>

Water in the sea is 25 degrees. </p><p>  In winter, the coldest nights are considered at a temperature of +10 degrees.  This is January and February.  In the afternoon - + 15-17 degrees.  But the water is warm even in winter.  Below 17 degrees does not fall.  If you wish, you can swim even in February.  For our tourists, such water will be just right, it will only refresh after a feast in the evening. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Both in Icmeler and Marmaris hotels prices are approximately the same.  To relax for a week at this hotel, you will need to pay 45,000-47,000 rubles per room with a view of the mountains. </p><p>  If you want to see the sea bay with beautiful islands, you will have to pay from 52,000 to 69,000 rubles. </p><p>  Do not forget about air tickets, transfers and other expenses. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Travelers respond positively about the rooms.  Confirm the cleanliness of the territory and the hotel.  The sea is transparent, the beach is separate with pleasant pebbled dark sand.  Towels and beach umbrellas are provided free of charge.  On the shore there is a lounge bar with soft drinks, snacks and ice cream. </p><p>  Negatively characterize the quality of the Wi-Fi signal in the rooms.  It catches well only in the Internet room or corridor near the reception. </p>
