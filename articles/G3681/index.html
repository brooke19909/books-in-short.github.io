Currently, many users neglect the concept of ‚Äúringtone‚Äù, replacing it with similar ones, for example, ‚Äúringtone‚Äù, ‚Äúringtone‚Äù.  However, there are always inexperienced people who need an answer to the question of what ringtones are, and this article is for such users. </p><h2>  History of the creation of ringtones </h2>

    <p>  The origin of the ringtone is taken from an American company engaged in the field of telephony.  It was called AT&amp;T.  By right, it is considered to be precisely its founder of ringtones.  The thing is that the company produced such products as <span>landlines.</span>  They, in turn, had seven combinations at once in the device, which made it possible to set an audio alert in case of an incoming phone call. </p><p>  Combinations of sounds made it possible to distinguish between the devices from which the sound emanated.  Otherwise, if each phone had only one ringtone, it would be quite problematic to determine the clearly needed device in a couple of seconds. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, some signals were developed specifically for those people who had hearing problems.  They were louder, which allowed users not to leave the call unattended. </p><h2>  How to make your ringtone? </h2>

    <p>  Previously, many users, along with the question of what ringtones were, were interested in how to make them yourself.  If a few years ago you could ‚Äúmake‚Äù your own ringtone only using a computer (or download it for money in one of the electronic stores), now every more or less experienced user of a personal computer and smartphone can make his own ringtone by himself. </p><p>  In some models of Nokia mobile phones, an application was already built into the design itself, allowing you to trim the audio file in the required range.  Now Nokia has moved to Windows Phone, Samsung to Android, and these two operating systems have several official application sources. </p><p>  There you can download a useful set of utilities, the list of which includes an application for creating ringtones.  It is enough just to download the full version of the music file, and then go into the program, select this same file and specify the boundaries at which the ringing tone should be played.  After that, the program will save the range as a new music file and prompt you to use it as the default signal. </p><h2>  What are the ringtones? </h2><p>  They are divided into 3 main groups: </p><p>  1) Realtones.  Their role is played by ordinary songs and music tracks recorded in digital formats.  Users who ask the question so often what ringtones are, do not even suspect that they encounter them when they just listen to music.  Typically, representatives of this category have <span>the MP3 format</span> as the most common and readable. </p><p>  2) Monaural.  At one time in such ringtones there is no more than one note. </p><p>  3) Polyphonic.  More than one note can be played back one measure, several at once. </p><h2>  Where can I find ringtones? </h2>

    <p>  Free ringtones can be found on sites that host various songs.  By accessing them from a computer or smartphone, you can quickly download the necessary file and use the program to specify the time frame in which it will be played. </p><p>  In addition, ringtones on the phone are set using special services.  However, in this case, it is worthwhile to understand that a certain amount of money will be debited from your account.  By the way, the sale of ringtones a few years ago was a very promising area of <span>electronic business.</span> </p>
