    <h2>  "Tower of free fall" </h2><p>  The main attraction is the ‚ÄúFree Fall Tower‚Äù - this is an incredibly high pillar, whose height is fifty-two meters.  Being in a suspended state, somewhere in the sky, your cabin should fall down - not everyone can handle such entertainment.  This attraction is visible from afar in the crowd watching the daredevils, and is heard from the screams that are carried throughout the park. </p><p>  There are no less cool amusement parks in Moscow, so it's hard to say which is the best amusement park in Moscow. </p><h2>  Elk Island </h2><p>  An interesting and exciting adventure for your child will be an excursion to the Elk Island national park.

    <p>  In addition, children can ride horses, listen to interesting stories about wildlife and take a direct part in environmental activities.  This is the variety that the best children's parks in Moscow offer. </p><h2>  Tsaritsyno </h2><p>  From the reviews that vacationers leave about this place, we can conclude that, once having visited the beautiful Tsaritsyno park in Moscow, everyone will want to return there again and again.  This is a huge park filled with museums and architectural monuments that you will not be able to see in one day.  It is located in a residential area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, characterized by clean air and pristine nature.  On its territory there are ponds, many stunning alleys and fragrant gardens. </p><p>  Walking around the park, you will meet local inhabitants - squirrels and birds who have been living in the park zone for more than one year.  The architecture of the park is striking - it is filled with palaces and buildings that are more than five hundred years old.  All structures are restored and landscaped, delight their visitors with unusual facades. </p><h2>  Catherine Park </h2><p>  If you ask someone about the best parks in Moscow, they will probably tell you about this place.  True, it is more suitable for romantic dates, a relaxing lunch, solitude with your favorite book, rather than for a family vacation. </p><p>  The park is decorated and its highlight is the estate of Catherine the Second, dating from the eighteenth century.  So that you enjoy the silence of the park in the shade, trees that are more than two hundred years old will protect you from the sun.  There is a planetarium in the park; a romantic walk can be made along the alleys, which in spring turn into an amazing fragrant garden. </p><p>  You can appreciate the beauty of the old park by boating in a small pond - this is a great place to be alone with yourself and nature. </p><p>  Whatever park you choose, in each you will find something for yourself, exactly what you need.  All recreation areas are good in their own way, so it is very difficult to say which park in Moscow is better.  Each is filled with its own history, legends and shadows of past years. </p><p>  Most importantly, you will be able to appreciate the beauty of nature, the grace of architectural monuments that decorate the green lands of Moscow for decades.  Parks are admired not only by guests of the metropolis, but also by <span>indigenous people,</span> which are difficult to surprise. </p>
