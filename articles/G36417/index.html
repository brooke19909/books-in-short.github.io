Description, prices, reviews of vacationers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In every corner of Russia there are unique natural beauty places.  The surroundings of the city of Volzhsky are also famous for them.  Here, on the banks of <span>the Akhtuba River,</span> there is a wonderful ‚ÄúVeterok‚Äù refreshing in summer and warming in winter - a camp site that hospitably welcomes guests year-round.  Let's take a little virtual walk through its territory and see how tourists are served here. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  "Veterok" is a camp site located near the village of Kalinina, in the Sredneahtubinsky district of the Volgograd region.  It is only 14 km from <span>Srednyaya Akhtuba,</span> 26 km from the town of Volzhsky and 43 km from Volgograd.  You can get here by public transport.  A shuttle bus (on weekdays) and minibus No. 111 go from Volzhsky to the village of Kalinina 3 times a day. You need to leave on the sign with the name of the camp site.  From this place you will have to walk about 40 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Breeze camp site" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1018611.jpg" width="510"></div>

    <p>  If you go by car to the camp site, you need to follow the highway to Srednyaya Akhtuba, call in the village, then, without crossing the bridge over the river, turn right in the direction of the Kalinina village.  From it leads the only road directly to the camp site. </p><h2>  Territory, infrastructure </h2><p>  "Veterok" is a camp site located in a virgin deciduous coniferous forest.  On its rather spacious territory there are a lot of greenery, flowers, convenient paths are laid everywhere, there is a parking lot, equipped places for recreation by large companies, where you can cook kebabs and places for children to play with your own hands.  Especially pleasing to both kids and adults is the small zoo in which ostriches, burros, guinea fowls and some other animals live.  For active people who love to play sports, the Veterok camp site (Middle Akhtuba) provides volleyball, basketball courts, a place for playing badminton and a hall with billiard and tennis tables.  For lovers of beach holidays, literally 30-50 meters from the camp site there is a beach with a sand cover, a gentle entry into the river and clear water.  Resting "Veterka" can relax in the sauna, and in the evening to pour out energy on the dance floor.

    <h2>  Chalet "Veterok": reviews </h2><p>  This camp site is popular for more than one year.  But her excellent work directly depends on the professionalism and integrity of the staff.  So, in 2011-2012, reviews about the rest in Veterka were only enthusiastic, which cannot be said about the reviews of tourists for 2013-2014.  The staff changed at the camp site, and many comments appeared immediately.  Among them: </p><p>  - untidy territory, a lot of hornet's nests, even in a children's game town; </p><p>  - groomed beach; </p><p>  - poor-quality bedding (old, unsuitable for the size of the beds); </p><p>  - inhospitable and dishonesty of employees. </p><p>  In 2015, part of the staff changed again, and there were fewer negative reviews, but some problems remained.  Vacationers noted the following disadvantages: </p><p>  - many wasps; </p><p>  - Children's town needs repair; </p><p>  - inhospitable employees. </p><p>  Always noted advantages: </p><p>  - beautiful nature on the base and around; </p><p>  - clean air, wonderful atmosphere for relaxation; </p><p>  - good living conditions in deluxe rooms; </p><p>  - convenient location. </p>
