    <h2>  How to get to Tsaghkadzor </h2><p>  The famous ski center is located only 75 km from the capital of the republic, in the Kotayk region.  If you are planning a trip from Russia, then the easiest way is to get a plane ticket to Yerevan, and take a taxi at the airport or find a bus station.  Please note that a trip by car will cost much more than public transport.  In addition, it is better to travel around the country by bus, since this type of communication is very well developed here.  If you still decide to get to the place by taxi, then find out in advance the public service telephone number and order a car from the airport by phone.  Thus, you can save a significant amount and be sure that you will not be deceived. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ski resort Tsaghkadzor reviews" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/812897.jpg" width="352"></div>
