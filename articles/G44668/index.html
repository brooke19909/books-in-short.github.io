  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Slow cooker Brand: a decent choice</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A slow cooker is a modern electric household appliance that allows you to cook a wide variety of food in a minimum short period of time.  It combines the features of a conventional stove, double boiler, oven and even a microwave.  Numerous manufacturers are engaged in its production, allowing each customer to choose the model that will be most liked.  In this article, you will learn about what a multicooker Brand is. </p><table align="left" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Brand 37300 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker Brand" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/30116.jpg" width="500"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Currently, the company cuts out about 10 models of multicookers with different price categories.  They all differ from each other in appearance, but the principle of their work is similar, in fact, as well as management, as well as the presence of additional functions.  The main plus of the multicooker is the capacity of the bowl.  Most models have a bowl in which food is prepared, with a volume of 5 liters.  This means that at one time the Brand 37500 multicooker (or any other model) will be able to cook breakfast, lunch or dinner for the whole family, especially if it is large.  The bowl has a ceramic coating, so you do not have to tear cooked foods, despite the fact that the amount of oil will have to use a minimum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Brand crock-pot is a real helper in your kitchen.  With its help you can cook soup, porridge, meat dishes, pastries and even yogurt in a short time.  It will come in handy for those who monitor their nutrition, as it allows you to steam-cook without using vegetable oil.  And the main thing is that you will need a minimum of participation.  In the bowl you need to load only the necessary products, set the desired program and wait for the end of the cooking process. </p><table align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Brand 37500 <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Brand multicooker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/30143.jpg" width="598"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The Multicooker Brand prepares products due to the special function "3D-heating", due to which there is an even distribution of heat.  The function implies the location of the heating elements not only at the bottom, but also in the lid of the device, as well as on its walls.  True, not every model possesses it. </p><p>  By the way, about the programs.  The Multicooker Brand has several of them.  In addition to the basic ones, each model is equipped with additional ones that greatly simplify cooking.  Programs can be adjusted at will by changing the temperature and cooking time.  Among the additional functions there is a delay in starting, a temperature sensor (not on all models), and a heating mode. </p><table align="left" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Brand 6050 <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Slow cooker brand 37500" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/30149.jpg" width="490"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Just imagine: in the morning you get up, and warm porridge is already waiting for you in the kitchen.  By setting the right time to start cooking, you can return home after work and immediately start eating a finished dinner.  Such a device will become an assistant for young mothers. </p><p>  The Multicooker Brand will please you with the quality of its work, since most of the buyers respond positively to the device.  Only the smell of plastic during the first days of operation is noted, as well as a not very long cord length.  The rest are no complaints.  It works quietly, easy to wash, cooks deliciously.  What else does a modern woman need?  After all, with the advent of this appliance in the kitchen, she will be able to spend less time cooking and devote more time to someone who really needs it. </p>
