    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  As tourists note, in Dreams Vacation Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt) Wi-Fi is available only at an additional cost.  The guests considered this fact a minus.  However, experienced travelers are advised immediately upon arrival at the airport to purchase a SIM card of a local mobile operator with an Internet package.  It will cost you no more than $ 20, and until the end of your vacation you can use the Internet everywhere and not depend on Wi-Fi.  By the way, a SIM card is also offered to tourists by some guides meeting at the airport.  In addition, you can buy it while walking around the city.  But the easiest way, of course, is to buy it right away at the Sharm El Sheikh airport and from the very first minutes always have the opportunity to be in touch with family and friends who have remained at home. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  As our compatriots staying at the Dreams Vacation Resort Sharm 5 * note, the hotel strictly observes the checkout time rule.  So even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will only be able to get the keys to the room you are planning for around two in the afternoon.  However, this does not mean that all this time you will have to get bored in the lobby near the reception.  So, the guest‚Äôs bracelet will be put on right away.  This will allow you to freely use the entire infrastructure of the hotel (restaurants, bars, pool, beach, etc.), with the exception of residential rooms.  You can leave your things in the luggage room.  Around 14:00 you just have to go to the reception, where you will be handed the key to the apartment.  A hotel employee will guide you to your room and help you with your luggage. </p><p>  As for the last day of your stay at the hotel, you should vacate the occupied apartments before noon.  But when you submit the number, the bracelet will not be removed from you.  So you can continue your rest until the very departure from the hotel. </p>

    <h2>  Cleaning service </h2><p>  As for the work of the maids at Dreams Vacation Beach Resort 5 * (Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt), in general, most of the guests did not complain about its quality, but some guests were not very satisfied.  According to the latter, the cleaning of the rooms was not very thorough.  So, according to them, the floors were rarely washed, and the dust was practically not wiped.  However, many tourists did not express such complaints.  Rather, on the contrary, they noted that the maids came at a convenient time for them and often built amusing figures of towels and petals on the beds.  As for the change of towels, it is carried out every day.  Bed linen is updated every three days. </p><p>  According to our compatriots, some of them enjoyed using the room service, ordering breakfast or lunch directly to the apartment. </p><p>  Also, <span>tourists whose</span> birthdays or marriage anniversaries occurred during their stay at the Dream Vacation Resort were pleased with the compliments they received from the hotel.  So, on a festive day they were presented with a cake, a basket of fruit and a bottle of wine.  Children celebrating their birthday were also additionally congratulated during the mini-disco.

    <h2>  Territory </h2><p>  As noted by Russian tourists, <span>the Dreams Vacation Resort</span> 5 * <span>hotel</span> , photos of which can be found in this article, has a very large, beautiful and well-groomed territory.  There are a lot of greenery, picturesque flowers, sculptures, pretty bridges.  In a word, guests have the opportunity to take pleasant walks around the hotel complex.  There are also plenty of places where you can take great photos to remember about the rest. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Judging by the comments left, most of the guests with this item were quite satisfied.  Of course, there are those who argue that the choice of dishes could be more diverse.  However, experienced tourists are advised not to forget that this hotel, although it belongs to the category of 5 stars, is still a budget ‚Äúfive‚Äù.  Therefore, you should not expect delicacies for breakfast, lunch and dinner here.  In general, according to our compatriots, there is always something to choose from in the main restaurant of the hotel.  So, for breakfast you will be offered a variety of cereals, side dishes, cereals, pastries, vegetables, fruits, eggs, sausages, cheeses, juices, tea, coffee and much more.  For lunch and dinner, you can eat several types of soups, main dishes of meat, poultry or fish, side dishes, stewed and fresh vegetables, salads, baked goods, great desserts, etc. In the evenings, they always cook something on the grill.  Also, every <span>day, chefs</span> distribute special dishes (for example, seafood) every <span>day</span> . </p><p>  In addition, guests of the 5 * Dreams Vacation Resort Sheikh can visit the restaurants working on the "a la carte" system.  There are two of them in the hotel.  One serves Asian (Chinese and Indian), while the other offers Mexican cuisine.  According to tourists, they cook in them very tasty.  So for a change it makes sense to visit these restaurants.  However, keep in mind that you should book a table in advance.  This can be done by contacting the administrator at the reception. </p><p>  In addition to all of the above, travelers staying at Dreams Vacation, during the day, can, if they wish, eat fast food in one of the hotel's snack bars.  They are located near the main pool and on the beach.  Here you can taste pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs, etc. Also, in the bars you can enjoy a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and ice cream. </p>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Having your own beach and its quality often becomes a key moment, forcing tourists traveling to Egypt to choose one or another hotel.  As for the Dreams Vacation we are considering, then, according to travelers, lovers of sea vacations here will not be disappointed.  So, this hotel complex has three beaches at once.  Two of them are suitable for a relaxed and relaxing pastime, while the third has an area for outdoor activities.  You can enter the sea along one of the three piers.  Their length is 4, 8, and 63 meters.  The last pier gradually goes under water and in this part it becomes quite slippery.  Therefore, it is recommended to use special shoes.  Also to the right of this pontoon is equipped with a zone designed for swimming with children and for those who are not confidently kept on the water.  Near the coast is a coral reef, inhabited by a variety of inhabitants of the Red Sea.  So do not forget to grab a snorkeling mask and flippers from home.  Indeed, many tourists were ready to swim over the reef for hours, watching colorful fish, crabs, shrimps and other amazing creatures.  By the way, if you did not take accessories for swimming from home, then experienced travelers are advised to buy them at the hotel, because outside its prices are often somewhat higher.  However, in any case, our compatriots advise you not to be shy and bargain with sellers, which will help you significantly reduce the cost. </p><p>  As for the sun loungers and umbrellas, there are a lot of them on the beach.  But still, according to some tourists, they had to get up early in the morning and go ashore in order to take a lounger.  Otherwise, in the afternoon it may not always be possible to find a free deck chair. </p><p>  There are several bars on the beach where you can enjoy a drink and a snack. </p><p>  As for the distance to the beach, it will depend on the location of the building where your room is located.  You can go down to the shore by stairs or take a minibus plying around the hotel.  You can also get to the beach by elevator, however, according to the guests, it is not very conveniently located, therefore it was rarely used and only if absolutely necessary. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Dreams Vacation Resort Sharm El Sheikh 5 * offers its guests wide opportunities for both measured and active recreation.  So, the hotel has several swimming pools.  Some of them have a water heating system, which becomes relevant in the winter.  Near the pools there are sun terraces with comfortable sun loungers and bars.  An animation program is held at the main pool and on the beach throughout the day.  Everyone is invited to do water aerobics, yoga, dancing, play beach volleyball, darts, and take part in fun contests.  In the evening, the hotel hosts entertaining shows with guest artists.  Our compatriots, they said, enjoyed visiting them.  After the evening performances, tourists can go to a disco. </p><p>  For those who care about their health and beauty, the hotel has a gym, spa and beauty salon. </p><p>  Not ignored here, and the youngest guests.  So, for them, the hotel has a mini-club, a children's pool is equipped, and in the evenings a mini-disco is held.  In addition, the main restaurant has a separate area for the youngest visitors.  There are small tables and chairs and there is a TV on which cartoons and children's programs are broadcast.  So in this hotel it will be very comfortable not only for adult travelers, but also for their children. </p>
