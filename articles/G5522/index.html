    <h2>  Report card </h2><p>  The Law on the sovereign service in Russia was published in 1722, and it was called the Table of Ranks.  The tsarist authorities reacted very responsibly to the preparation of this decree, spending about three years on the creation of this document.  The ranking table was a natural result of the radical <span>transformations of Peter I,</span> as a result of which the number of posts in the state and military apparatus increased sharply.  The basis of this document was similar orders issued in various Western European countries.  When compiling, those ranks that were already used in the state hierarchy were taken into account.  A register of new ranks and ranks was also compiled, which were subsequently actively used in the Russian Empire.  In total, the Table of Ranks had three large sections that were devoted to military, civil and court officials.  Among these new ranks was the rank, which was called the actual state councilor.  This is one of the fourteen ranks that belonged to the static (civilian) section of the Table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Nobility and Rankings </h2><p>  As can be seen from the text of the Table, the document did not give new ranks and titles to people who "did not serve the king and patronymic."  Thus, even the most noble nobles did not occupy any position until they were in the service.  On the contrary, a native of a non-noble family, who is in the public service, had the right to be called a nobleman and receive the corresponding rank.  Thus, the opinion that a truly state councilor is a hereditary nobleman has no foundation.  Theoretically, any free person in the <span>public service</span> could deserve this rank <span>.</span>  Later, this decree was also canceled, and ranks older than the fifth grade produced persons who deserved the favor of the emperor. </p><h2>  The list of civil servants </h2><p>  According to the original version of the Table, the first (highest) rank in the civil ranks was occupied by the chancellor.  He was followed by a real secret state adviser, and after him - a secret adviser.  The top three ranks held the highest government posts in Russia.  These persons completed the <span>internal policy of the</span> state.  And the state councilor and the current state councilor are civil servants of the fourth and fifth grade, respectively. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The title of State Counselor in the Russian Empire was held by persons holding the positions of vice-governors, vice-directors of various departments, the chairman of the treasury chamber and others.  In order to get this rank, you had to serve at least five years in the previous rank. </p>

    <h2>  What is a valid state advisor? </h2><p>  By a special decree of December 9, 1856, Tsar Alexander II tightened the rules for obtaining a hereditary noble rank in the civil department.  From that moment, hereditary nobility had the right to receive officials of at least grade 4.  And a valid state adviser - this is the state rank of 4 classes.  Unlike just a state councilor, a valid one had to serve ten years in the previous rank in order to receive this.  A typical position held by a full-time state councilor is the governor, department director, and town governor. </p>

    <h2>  Statutory appeal </h2><p>  According to the Table, each class was assigned to handle in a certain way.  The State Counselor was called "Your Highness".  For the third and fourth ranks, a different form of treatment was provided.  A full-time state councilor is the person who should be called Your Excellency. </p><p>  To summarize.  Thus, the question of who the real state adviser is is that the answer is that this is a fourth-class state official in pre-revolutionary Russia, entitled to a hereditary noble title.  As of 1913, there were 3,113 officials of 4th rank on the territory of the Russian state.  In 1917, by a special Decree of Soviet power, all ranks and ranks were abolished. </p>
