Aqaba is the only seaside resort in the country.  The city is famous for its centuries-old history, numerous attractions, a unique climate, beaches and coral reefs.  What rest should be expected in Aqaba?  You will learn this from our article. </p><p>  This resort is located in the very north of the Gulf of Aqaba of the Red Sea.  <span>Amman</span> is separated from the <span>capital of Jordan by</span> three hundred and thirty-five kilometers.  Aqaba has a border position on the political map of the world.  Very close is the Israeli resort of Eilat.  And through the waters of the bay you can see the Egyptian Taba.  But rest in Aqaba is not like a vacation in Israel.  There is no seal relaxation there, as in the hotels of Egypt with their "all inclusive".  Aqaba attracts young and active natures who prefer active recreation.  Since there are so many attractions that spending all days on the beach is simply a sin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan aqaba" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249250.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Aqaba </h2><p>  The easiest way to reach the resort is from <span>Eilat (Israel).</span>  To avoid any misunderstandings at the border, it is easier to get from Amman (Jordan).  Aqaba is located more than three hundred kilometers south of it.  You can overcome this distance on JETT state buses.  They are very comfortable and arrive in Aqaba at the Movenpick Hotel on King Hussein Street.  An alternative to the state carrier is the private company Trust International Transport.  Her buses arrive at Al Nahda Street.  Travel time (regardless of carrier) is four hours.  From Aqaba you can get to the city of Irbida, as well as to Nuweibu (Egypt).  In total, eleven flights depart from Amman to the southern resort: five for a state-owned company and six for a private one.  You can move around Aqaba in a taxi (they are yellow) or in minibuses.  Stops in the latter - at the request of the passenger, anywhere in the sequence.  The cost of a taxi should be agreed with the driver in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqaba city in Jordan" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249269.jpg" width="600"></div>

The mountains protect it from the north not only from cold winds, but also from the blow of the desert.  Therefore, the climate here does not look like arid and full of temperature contrasts, which Jordan is famous for.  Aqaba is attractive because you can swim and sunbathe here all year round, even in winter.  The water temperature in the bay never drops below + 22 degrees, which makes it possible to develop coral.  But we will talk about them later.  In the meantime, it should be noted that in the summer in Aqaba there is no extreme temperature.  The heat begins to strangle the city only in the afternoon.  Of course, cores and hypertensives should prefer winter vacations in the resort of Jordan.  The peak of the season is observed twice a year: in spring and autumn.  It is in the off-season that the weather is comfortable in all respects.  If bathing in the Red Sea attracts you the most, then choose autumn for your trip.  Water temperature on average fluctuates around + 27 degrees. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan aqaba reviews" class="if" height="355" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Aqaba hotels have their own specifics.  They rarely find the All Inclusive program.  This is not Egypt, but Jordan.  Aqaba Radisson Blu Tala Bay Resort 5, Intercontinental, Movenpike and other fashionable resort hotels offer their guests only a <span>buffet breakfast</span> included in the price.  About where to have lunch, dinner or just a snack - read below.  In Aqaba there is no shortage of budget hotels.  They do not amaze the imagination with oriental luxury and stucco molding in the rooms, but a clean room and a hearty breakfast are guaranteed.  For sea views here, as in other resorts, you have to pay extra.  But there is one caveat that summer tourists should consider.  The sea in Aqaba is located in the south.  Consequently, the sun will shine mercilessly all day in such expensive rooms, and no air conditioning will save you from the heat. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Jordan, Aqaba: prices </h2><p>  The huge hotel base gives everyone the opportunity to choose housing to their taste.  The Kempinski Hotel is probably the most expensive.  A night in a standard room at this hotel will cost eleven thousand rubles.  On average, the "five" ("Movenpick", "Double Three Bay Hilton", "Marina Plaza Tala Bay" and others) offer housing for six to seven thousand rubles a day.  A great option where value for money is perfect, these are four-star Aqaba hotels.  These are the Dise Inn Hotel and Suites (from 4,660 rubles), Golden Tulip (3,700), Yaafko (3,600) and others.  In the resort you can stay in budget hotels, which, of course, are not on the first line from the sea.  As an example, you can specify ‚ÄúPlaza Masvada‚Äù (2 800 rubles).  Aqaba is a city in Jordan declared a duty free zone.  This feature of the resort allows not only to make inexpensive purchases, but also to buy cheap cigars and alcohol.  The selection of these products in the city is really wide. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan aqaba sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249255.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Jordan, Aqaba: sea </h2><p>  What a sin to hide - mostly go to the resort to sunbathe and swim.  The beaches of Aqaba are sandy and pebble-rocky.  The former are located in the northern part of the city, and the latter in the southern part.  The lion's share of beaches are fully owned by hotels on the first line.  There are quite convenient coasts belonging to the municipality.  Entrance there is free, and ammunition (umbrellas, deck chairs and sun loungers) can be rented.  Aqaba is a city in Jordan where municipal beaches are well-equipped.  There is a shower, a toilet, lifeguards are on duty, there is a cafe, sometimes right on the shore.  If you are not an Islamophobe and you are not sick of the community of local residents, you will have a good time on such a beach.  If not - for a small bribe you will be allowed on the coast, which belongs to any hotel.  You will not find anything particularly gorgeous there.  Just in a cafe and a bar on the beach, the prices will be much higher.  The Red Sea is wonderful here.  The water is very clear with excellent visibility.  Low tides are not too pronounced.  In the south, coral reefs come close to the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan aqaba what sea" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Diving in the Gulf of Aqaba </h2><p>  The resort has six diving training centers, and they issue BS-AC, SSI or PADI diplomas.  In the immediate vicinity of the coast there are about thirty dive sites.  And this is attractive for lovers of scuba diving Jordan (Aqaba). </p><p>  What is the sea off the coast of the resort?  Between April and May, when plankton blooms, visibility under water decreases to twelve meters.  But if you come to Aqaba in the summer months, then the transparency of the sea reaches 50 m. Many coral reefs in the south of the city come so close to the coast that there is no need to rent a boat.  You can admire the <span>beauty of the underwater world</span> lightly - only with a snorkel and a mask.  But if you want to go diving seriously, there is nothing better than coming to The Royal Diving Center.  This center has its own sandy beach.  Beginners will be up to date at Sea Star Dive Center.  This school is located in the Al-Qazar Hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan excursions from aqaba" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249267.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to see in Aqaba </h2><p>  Mysterious Petra, Wadi Rum desert, the place of baptism of Jesus Christ - all this is the country of Jordan.  Aqaba is a young resort.  But he developed from a very ancient settlement, which is no less than six thousand years old.  At first, the Edomites and Nabataeans lived there.  Then the city was part of the Roman Empire.  In the Middle Ages, the path of pilgrims to Mecca went through it.  The Romans, Byzantines, Crusaders, Ottoman Turks - all left behind a cultural mark.  Here are the ruins of the oldest Christian church in the world.  The ancient city stood on a rocky cape, which is now called Tell al Khalifa hill.  There you can see artifacts recovered from archaeological excavations.  During the Crusades, a European fort was built by European knights.  It was maintained in a ‚Äúworking condition‚Äù for centuries, and therefore the Mamluk Fortress has survived to this day.  Next to this citadel is a historical museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Jordan Akaba Radisson" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1249271.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Interesting places near Aqaba </h2><p>  In the vicinity of the resort is the cave of Lot.  According to biblical tradition, it was from here that the righteous with his daughters watched the death of <span>Sodom and Gomorrah.</span>  In the cave of Lot, you can see the Byzantine church, decorated with mosaics and several ancient tombs.  Reviews recommend visiting Wadi Mujib, a gorge declared a national park.  The extreme southern position of the resort will not prevent you from getting to know a country called Jordan.  Excursions from Aqaba to Petra ($ 170 per group), Amman ($ 50), to the hot springs, the Wadi Rum desert or to the holy places where Christ revealed himself to the people, last only one daylight.  The border position of the resort makes possible trips to neighboring countries - to Israel (Eilat, the <span>Dead Sea,</span> Jerusalem), to the island of Pharaohs (Egypt). </p><h2>  Reviews on Aqaba </h2><p>  Travelers warn about the regional features of the holiday that Jordan offers.  Aqaba, reviews of which are always admired, is designed for tourists who love active pastime.  Do not be afraid to have lunch or dinner on the streets.  The resort is full of cafes and restaurants, both with local flavor and cuisine, as well as quite European.  There is even a real Italian pizzeria and several fast food outlets.  Which of the local dishes is on the mast-tray list (you need to try)?  First of all, traditional falyafel, hummus and mansaf.  A flat cake - ragyf will be served for the meal.  Of the amazing Arabian desserts, tourists recommend trying kataef, <span>sesame cookies</span> and pistachio baklava.  Coffee with cardamom and delicious ice cream will be a worthy end to the meal.  Prices at public places in Aqaba are close to European.  Dinner in a restaurant will cost twenty dollars per person, in a cafe - ten.  But lunch in fast food can be obtained for only 3-5 dollars. </p>
