Natura Park Beach Eco Resort & Spa 5 *</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dominican Republic is a distant, but very beautiful country, which is becoming more and more popular with tourists every year.  All its resorts are built up with luxurious complexes located on the white sandy beaches.  But tourists are attracted not only by them.  The Dominican Republic is also a historical monument of the colonial era and diving in an almost transparent sea.  If you want to stay in Punta Cana, then pay attention to the Natura Park Beach Eco Resort &amp; Spa 5 * hotel.  A detailed description of this complex, as well as reviews and photos you can see in this article. </p><h2>  Where is this hotel located? </h2><p>  The beach complex is ideal for people who love a relaxing holiday and solitude with nature.  It is located on a green area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe coast in the resort of Punta Cana.  Natura Park Beach Eco Resort &amp; Spa 5 * fully lives up to its name.  It is built in an ecologically clean area and is located away from highways.  Proximity to the beach is another important advantage.  The complex is located on the first line of the sea, so you can walk to the sea in just a few minutes.  But there is a drawback.  This is the distance from the center of the resort, where most restaurants, bars, cafes and shops are located.  The distance to it is about 13 km.  But for some, this flaw will seem to be an advantage, because because of the distance from the center, silence and calm reign in the hotel itself. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.6521922" data-lng="-68.36634649999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/1/2/4/17124.png"></div><p>  Conveniently, this resort complex is located quite close to the international airport of Punta Cana, which receives most of the flights from Russia.
