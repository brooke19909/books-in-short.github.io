    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  Kemerovo is located on both banks of the Tom River, at the confluence of the Iskitimka tributary into it.  Thus, it is geographically divided into two parts.  Initially, the settlement of the city began on the right bank.  The private sector dominates here with interspersed high-rise buildings.  In this part, two districts are located - Kirovsky and Rudnichny. </p><p>  On the left bank are such districts of Kemerovo as Central, Zavodskoy and Leninsky.  Here you will find many high-rise buildings, new buildings.  People flock here to relax and have fun.  The historical city center is very popular.  Factories and industrial enterprises operate here. </p><h2>  Kirovsky district </h2><p>  It is the same age as the city, although initially the construction of housing here was not planned at all.  It was assumed that industrial enterprises would be erected on the right bank.  In particular, here is the "Progress", engaged in the production of paints and varnishes.  In addition, it is here that the winds carry harmful emissions from chemical plants located in the Zavodsky district.  Therefore, the environmental situation leaves much to be desired.  However, the buildings arose spontaneously, after the war, the area was actively developing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now he is considered the most criminogenic in the city.  There is a special regime prison on its territory.  Transport support is poor.  All this leads to traditionally low housing prices. </p><h2>  Rudnichny district </h2><p>  It is the oldest, because it was here that the first coal mining enterprises of the city - mines.  Now they are not functioning.  Most residents of the district live in private homes, although construction is currently underway.  The center, built up by high-rise buildings, was called the "Rainbow".  It is located along the largest prospect of Miners. </p>

    <p>  The main attraction of this region of Kemerovo was a pine forest.  It is a patch of relic taiga, preserved in its original form.  In winter, ski resorts operate here. </p><p>  The Rudnichny district includes three remote residential areas: Promyshlennovsky, Kedrovka and Lesnaya Polyana.  On the territory of the first two, open-pit coal is mined.  The Lesnaya Polyana microdistrict was founded in 2007.  This is a satellite city with a developed infrastructure, located remotely from all industrial enterprises.  The ecological situation here is very favorable, the houses are mostly low-rise, special attention is paid to landscape design, walking areas, parks and squares. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Factory District Kemerovo </h2><p>  It is the largest in population and is located in the southwestern part of the city.  On its territory there are two large industrial enterprises - "Nitrogen" and "Khimprom".  However, the district got its name not for the abundance of plants, but for its location "for water", that is, on the other side of the Tomsk. </p><p>  All major transportation facilities are located here.  These include the airport, bus and train stations.  Like Rudnichny, the Zavodsky district includes remote residential areas: Pioneer and Yagunovsky.  Unofficial housing estates include FPK and Yuzhny.  FPK is a sleeping area.  South consists of the private sector and new quarters, where construction is underway, infrastructure is being developed. </p><h2>  central District </h2><p>  It is located in the central part of the city and is divided in half by the Iskitimka River.  The left bank is densely built up with five-story buildings.  This is the focus of the cultural life of the city.  It is here that the main square of Kemerovo, administrative buildings, museums, theaters, libraries, cinemas, the circus, the stadium "Chemist", sports complexes "Arena" and "Lazurny" are located.  On the right bank of Iskitimka, a one-story private sector has been preserved.  Now there is a gradual demolition of dilapidated housing, the construction of modern high-rise buildings begins. </p>

    <p>  The central district is a favorite vacation spot for citizens.  Many walkers can be seen in the evening on the main square of Kemerovo in front of the administration building.  Sovetsky Prospekt, the main street of the city, leads to it.  Kemerovo people like to walk along the beautiful Spring Street and enjoy the picturesque view of the Tom River from the embankment. </p><h2>  Leninsky district of Kemerovo </h2><p>  Its development began in 1979.  The new microdistrict became a twin city of the Hungarian city of Salgotarjan and was named after this name.  Gradually, the southeastern part of the city grew, large streets, avenues, boulevards appeared.  Now the Leninsky district includes an industrial zone and residential buildings with developed infrastructure, parks, lawns, roads. </p>

    <p>  Favorite place for walking is Builders Boulevard - the longest alley in the city.  Interesting sights are also the Holy Trinity Church and the Munir Mosque. </p><p>  As we see, each of the districts of Kemerovo has its own character, its own history and, hopefully, its own future. </p>
