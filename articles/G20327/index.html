    <p>  Philology is <span>a science</span> that studies the spirituality of different peoples, analyzes their written language, comprehends in detail the features of a particular language, and then collects the acquired knowledge into a single whole. </p><p>  It is known that written texts are one of the sources reflecting the history of the people.  The first of them appeared in the form of comments on complex words found in dictionaries, treatises and religious writings.  Homer was the first to be thoroughly analyzed. </p><p>  Philology includes many subjects, and each of them is engaged in its own industry.  Romano-Germanic philology, for example, is the most widespread in the world, as it analyzes Romance and Germanic languages. </p><p>  In this case, the Romance languages ‚Äã‚Äãinclude: </p><ul><li>  French; </li><li>  Italian; </li><li>  Spanish and others. </li></ul><p>  The German group, among many, is studying English and German, one of the most common today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of development </h2>

    <p>  Philological sciences appeared long ago, even in Ancient Greece.  First, their occurrence occurred, then development (throughout the Middle Ages), and already during the Renaissance - the heyday in full force.  The very concept of ‚Äúphilology‚Äù began to take shape in the 18th century.  Then it was only about the classical industry, after which the Slavic industry subsequently arose.  The founder of the Slavic branch is the Czech scientist Dobrovsky Yosef. </p><p>  It is easy to understand the reason why the development of philology began.  Europeans became interested in their national roots, sources, development trends.  This was facilitated by the design of a romantic worldview at that time, as well as the beginning of the struggle with the Turkish invaders. </p><p>  As for other types of science: each of them very deeply studies a certain industry and peoples related to it.  In the world there are many public organizations that are engaged in one common cause, from time to time gather and share their achievements. </p><h2>  Science complex </h2>

This science studies the manuscripts of antiquity, their forms, styles, time and place of creation. </li></ul><p>  As can be seen from this information, philological sciences study the language from all possible sides. </p><h2>  Famous Philologists </h2><p>  Who is a philologist?

    <p>  In the XVIII century, Lomonosov wrote two well-known books on the grammar of the language and the advantage of the church language, which continued the study of stylistics.  Until now, Russian philologists do not stop working, continuing to analyze various styles, dialects and phraseological units.  Only now these are modern figures who not only write works, but also share their discoveries with university students.  After all, most philologists work in higher educational institutions and research institutes. </p><h2>  Foreign philology </h2><p>  This <span>branch of science is</span> aimed at the study of foreign languages, their history and features.  The literary heritage and works are studied in detail, a detailed analysis of styles and dialects is made, the knowledge of which greatly affects a person's ability to speak and understand the native speaker of the language being studied.  A large role is given to translation practice. </p><p>  You can study the rules of spelling, grammar and phonetics for a long time, but without practical speech training you cannot speak and translate correctly. </p><h2>  How to become a philologist </h2><p>  You can become a philologist and devote yourself to the most interesting of sciences by entering the Faculty of Philology.  There are many educational institutions offering similar specialties.  Some of them have departments dealing with different branches of linguistics: it can be Slavic, Indo-European, Romano-Germanic philology. </p>
