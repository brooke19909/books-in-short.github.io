  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best e-book: popular models and modern requirements</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the advent of technology in our lives, with the active development of the Internet, reading from a computer screen, from the monitor of other electronic devices has replaced us with a regular book.  And there is nothing wrong with this: all technological innovations are created only for our convenience.  But, unfortunately, not every e-book model meets the requirements of a modern reader. </p><p>  What features of an ebook should I look for when buying?  What distinguishes the <span>best e-books?</span>  Let's try to figure it out. </p><p>  First of all, a good e-book should have settings that allow the user to increase the font if necessary, easily find the desired file in his entire electronic library.  In any model, recharging is enough for a month of use, if you read 1-2 hours a day. </p><p>  All electronic devices have a monochrome screen - black and white, for easy reading, without harm to eyesight.  But there are also models with a color screen and a backlight function (of course, you should not read long from such a book): Nexx, Fujitsu FLEPia, Explay. </p><p>  The best e-book reader reads all (or almost all) formats.  Connoisseurs relate to such readers: PocketBook, LBook eReader V3, Reader A6i.  Such models are equipped with a powerful processor that allows you to quickly flip through pages, open and close files.  The screen size should be sufficient for comfortable reading (6-9 inches).  Of course, the device‚Äôs memory is also important.  In e-books it is not so much: from 500 MB to 3 GB.  But the lack of memory can always be compensated for using removable media.  All models provide the ability to insert a memory card (from 2 to 32 GB). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Impact resistance is just as important as aesthetic characteristics: slim body, color, comfortable keys or touch screen. </p><p>  Readers differ in various technological characteristics.  There are simple e-books with a monochrome screen in various gradations of gray (up to 16).  And there are readers with Internet access, with the ability to listen to audio files, view videos and images.  Two-screen models are also on sale: a black-and-white reader and a full-color screen with an operating system.  If you definitely need a book with the ability to watch videos, you will be pleased that there is an affordable model on the market: Explay HD.BOOK with button control (4.5 thousand rubles).  Although many will prefer a more modern model: with a touch LCD screen (from 8 thousand rubles.) </p><p>  Not all models are actually suitable for all of the above criteria.  But technology is improving.  And if, according to experts, last year the PocketBook IQ 701 (as well as Orsio Boox A60S, Onext Touch &amp; Read 002) was a popular model, then, according to fans, today the best e-book is The Nook Simple Touch from Barnes &amp; Noble ( good for night reading).  Equally popular is Amazon's Kindle Touch.  The first allows you to store more than a thousand books in the library, if necessary, you can use a 32 GB memory card.  Specifications The Nook Simple Touch: a screen with an extension of 600 * 800 pixels, WiFi, touch screen.  The device recognizes the main formats of text documents and graphic images.  This compact and lightweight book can be carried with you.  And access to the Internet will not only allow you to upload new books, but also communicate on social networks. </p><p>  Amazon's best e-book reader is the 3G6 in the Kindle Touch series.  An expensive but multi-functional e-reader.  Unlike a competitor, it even reads the doc format, is equipped with speakers (mp3 audio format).  In addition to WiFi, there is also a built-in 3G receiver.  A powerful battery provides up to 2 months of operation without the need for recharging.  And there is enough memory to store 3 thousand books. </p><p>  And although quite specific models are named in this article, the best e-book is a safe and compact device that meets exactly your requirements (the ability to read at night and watch videos on YouTube, for example).  When choosing a book, remember that its value is increased by additional functions and brand affiliation. </p>
