Who says that they were invented in China, who believes that their homeland is Siberia.  But it is known for sure that in Russia, for example, they were sculpted in large quantities in winter and hung in linen bags in the cold.  This product was willingly taken on the road in the cold season, because in those days, in order to cook it on the way, all that was needed was a bonfire, a pot and melted snow, which might have been cleaner than modern tap water. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="electric dumpling" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9009/120111.jpg" width="375"></div>

    <p>  Manual production of dumplings is a very time-consuming process.  Therefore, it is usually timed to some kind of holiday.  In the same China, women gather before the New Year and jointly sculpt these small, tasty products in large quantities.  Simple dumplings with cells, which allow you to ‚Äúroll‚Äù up to forty small dumplings at a time, facilitate the work.  Fillings can be very diverse - vegetable, meat, cheese, fish, mixed, etc. </p><p>  For those who want to quickly and easily make this product in larger quantities, we inform that the home electric dumplings as a device that makes life easier for the hostess is currently almost absent.  The production process can be organized only on an industrial and semi-industrial scale.  That is, from a centner and more dumplings at ... an hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

The device operates in automatic mode.  It allows you to make dough products of different thicknesses with different filling volumes.  The principle of operation is based on the fact that the machine makes a pipe from the dough into which the stuffing is fed.  Then, semi-finished products in the form of a crescent are formed from the obtained preform, which are automatically sprinkled with flour.

    <p>  An electric dumplings brand DM 135-5A of the same company can produce 8100 dumplings per hour.  This is a fairly large unit weighing about 170 kilograms and measuring 0.97x0.47x1.15 meters.  The equipment requires a voltage of 380 W and has its own power of 1.1 kW.  Manufacturers pay attention to the fact that nozzles for one device are not suitable for equipment of another brand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dumpling production" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9009/120101.jpg" width="356"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the offers of equipment for the production of delicious semi-finished products include StarFood electric dumplings.  The sample produced by a Taiwanese company is characterized by lower weight (about 53 kg), low cost and "sculpts" 3,600 dumplings per hour.  It is small in size - up to half a meter in overall dimensions, has its own power of 0.55 kW.  All parts of the equipment in contact with food ingredients are made of stainless steel, which ensures the necessary hygiene of the process. </p><p>  Any of the electric dumplings listed above has already established itself on the Russian market as equipment for professional kitchens, which allows you to quickly make a large number of excellent semi-finished products.  In general, the quality of the final product is determined not only by its form, but also by its content, therefore, it depends on the good faith of the manufacturer. </p>
