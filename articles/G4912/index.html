His most famous journey ended in being able to go around Africa. </p><h2>  early years </h2><p>  The early biography of Bartolomeo Dias is almost unknown due to its unclear origin.  He was born around 1450.  The future mariner was lucky to get an education at the University of Lisbon.  In the main Portuguese monastery of knowledge, Bartolomeo Dias studied mathematics and astronomy.  These sciences were the main applied disciplines for sailors.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the young man connected his life with travel. </p><p>  The second half of the 15th century was a great time to become a navigator.  Bartolomeo Dias was in the first European generation, who was destined to start discovering distant countries.  Prior to this, in the views of Catholics, the world was limited to their continent and two more parts of the world - Africa and Asia.  In the Late Middle Ages, a technological leap occurred.  New ships and devices appeared that allowed the captains to keep their course on track. </p><p>  In his youth, Bartolomeo Dias worked in the port.  His first expedition took place in 1481.  At this time, the Portuguese just started exploring the west coast of Africa.  Bartolomeo Diash took part in the construction of an important fort of Elmina on the territory of modern Ghana.  This fortress became the main transshipment base for future Portuguese expeditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189572" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1189572.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  First travels </h2><p>  The Portuguese authorities closely followed the news from their sailors.  The European kings were obsessed with finding the shortest route to faraway India.  In this country there were many expensive and unique products.  A state that controlled trade with India would be an order of magnitude richer than its neighbors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main struggle in the XV-XVI centuries.  at sea unfolded between Portugal and Spain.  Their ships competed in the internal European markets and were now ready to go beyond the Old World.  <span>Portuguese King</span> Juan II personally oversaw a study project on the west coast of Africa.  The monarch wanted to find out how far this continent stretches south and whether it can be circled with the help of the fleet. </p><p>  In 1474, an expedition to Diogu Cana was organized at the expense of the state.  He was an experienced captain, whose partner and companion was Bartolomeo Dias.  Caen managed to get to Angola and open a new frontier for his successors.  During the trip, a brave explorer died, and the expedition returned to Lisbon. </p><h2>  Expedition to India </h2><p>  Juan II, despite the failure, did not want to give up.  He assembled a new fleet.  This time, Bartolomeo Dias became captain of the squadron.  The discoveries that he could make if the venture was successful would turn Europeans' views on the world around them.  Diash received three ships.  One of them was commanded by the navigator‚Äôs brother Diogu. </p><p>  In total, there were 60 people in the team.  These were the most experienced and sophisticated sailors of their time.  All of them had already been to Africa; they knew well the coastal waters and the safest route.  Peru Alinker, the most famous navigator of his era, stood out especially. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189571" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1189571.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  On the African shores </h2><p>  Diash sailed from his native country in the summer of 1487.  Already in December, he managed to overcome the milestone that did not submit to the last expedition.  Due to the storms, the ships had to go into the open sea for a while.  Throughout January, ships were stranded in the South Atlantic.  The waves were getting colder, and the team realized that she had lost her course.  It was decided to turn back.  However, by this time the current carried two small ships too far east. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Finally, on February 3, the sailors again saw the African land aft.  Because of the winding route, they sailed past the Cape of Good Hope - the southernmost point of the mainland.  Approaching the coast, the Portuguese saw mountains and green hills.  The bright and picturesque nature of these places inspired Diash to name the bay, which included his ships, Shepherd's Bay.  Europeans really saw the cows and their owners - local natives. </p><p>  Hottentots lived on the shore.  This tribe first learned of the existence of white people.  The expedition of Bartolomeo Diasha was carefully organized - the Portuguese took the Africans from Ghana with them (in case you need translators).  However, they could not find a common language with the Hottentots.  The natives were wary of strangers and attacked them.  Bartolomeo Dias himself shot one of them from a crossbow.  Africa turned out to be inhospitable.  The Europeans had to set sail and try to find a quieter landing place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1189637.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  Homecoming </h2><p>  All the travels of Bartolomeo Dias were unpredictable.  None of the sailors knew what awaited them on the new shore.  After the conflict with the natives, the Portuguese sailed about another hundred kilometers to the east.  In the modern city of Port Elizabeth, officers began to demand a return home.  Bartolomeo Dias did not agree with this.  The seafarer's biography was full of such dangers.  He wanted to continue east.  However, the captain still yielded to the requirements of the team, fearing rebellion.  In addition, officers and sailors faced the threat of an outbreak of scurvy on their ships.  The Europeans tried to replenish the reserves of drinking water on the shore, but in that era of the disease they could defeat the crew at any stage of navigation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the way back, the ships finally found themselves on the banks of the <span>Cape of Good Hope.</span>  Europeans first appeared in the southern point of the African continent.  Then this place was called Cape Storms.  This toponym was chosen by Bartolomeo Dias.  What did he discover in that distant 1488?  It was the shortest sea route to India.  Diash himself did not visit this distant and desirable country, but it was he who became the main harbinger of this Portuguese discovery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1189566.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  The importance of discovery </h2><p>  After 16 months of traveling, at the very end of 1488, Diash returned to his homeland.  His discoveries became a state secret.  Portugal was afraid that news of new lands would spark interest in Spain.  For this reason, there was not even documentary evidence of Diash‚Äôs meeting with Juan.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt that he was rewarded for his courage and professionalism. </p><p>  The scarcity of documents relating to the expedition, caused historians to find out which ships Diash received - caravels or other models.  At that time, even the Portuguese and Spaniards had too little experience in ocean exploration.  Many trips were organized largely at your own peril and risk.  The trip of Diash was not an exception. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1189567.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  Preparing a new journey east </h2><p>  Portugal has opened up incredible hitherto opportunities.  However, the crown pulled for a long time with the organization of a new expedition.  Joan started having problems with money, and projects to search for the eastern route were turned off for a while. </p><p>  Only in 1497 did the monarch finally send ships to India.  However, Vasco da Gama was appointed the head of that expedition.  Bartolomeo Dias, whose photo of monuments is in every geography textbook, received a different assignment.  The former captain began to supervise the construction of ships for the expedition of his comrade.  Diash, like no other, knew what the Portuguese would have to face in the eastern seas.  The ships created according to his project did not disappoint travelers who went to India. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189570" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1189570.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  Continuation of Service </h2><p>  When Vasco da Gama's expedition was ready to be dispatched, Diash was appointed commandant of the fortress on the Gold Coast (modern Guinea).  The navigator accompanied travelers to India until he was in the fort, in which he now needed to serve. </p><p>  Diash‚Äôs guesses about India were confirmed a few years later.  Vasco da Gama, following the instructions of his senior comrade, really got to the legendary country.  Soon, expensive Oriental goods flowed into Portugal, making this small kingdom one of the richest European states. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1189569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37650/1189569.jpg?1536249568"></div><h2>  Brazil discovery </h2><p>  Diash‚Äôs last trip was an expedition to Brazil.  If the Portuguese sought India following the eastern course, then their main rivals, the Spaniards, went west.  So in 1492, Christopher <span>Columbus discovered America.</span>  The news of a new uncharted mainland and islands in the west intrigued the Portuguese. </p><p>  The king sponsored several more expeditions to get ahead of the Spaniards.  At that time, a rule was applied in European politics, according to which the newly discovered land became the property of the country to which the ships that had discovered a hitherto unprecedented coast belonged. </p><p>  In 1500, Bartolomeo Dias managed the ship as part of an expedition that reached Brazil.  The ships of the Portuguese sailed south of the usual Spanish course.  The success of the trip was impressive.  The coast was opened, to which there was no end in sight.  Europeans still did not understand: the way is to India or to a completely different part of the world. </p><p>  Diash was not lucky already on the way back: on May 29, 1500 his ship fell into a terrible Atlantic storm, which European researchers were so afraid of.  The ship of the brave and experienced captain was lost.  He died in the waters that immortalized his name. </p>
