    <p>  The Kingdom of Prussia occupied a certain part of the territory of modern Germany.  The year 1862 was marked by the appearance on the world stage of a wise ruler - Otto von Bismarck.  The royal power at that time was in crisis.  The current ruler Wilhelm was a military man and was not preparing to take the throne, but because of the premature death of his older brother, he was forced to do so.  Finding a common language with parliament was not an easy task for him.  The military reform was planned: an increase in the service life from two to three years, as a result of which the number of employees would increase. </p><p>  At first, the parliament refused to accept the budget, and, of course, no money was transferred from the funds.  The threat of a coup looms over the state of the Second Reich.  Parliament could not remove the king, but William could easily disperse him.  But the ruler did not have that character, even despite all the requests of the Minister of War Albrecht von Roon, he did not want to do this.  The king was about to abdicate, but then he was recommended a person who could stabilize the situation in the country, even without the right to control the state budget. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, on September 22, 1862, this man took the post of Minister-President of the State of the Second Reich.  His name was <span>Otto von Bismarck.</span>  This man began his activity by declaring the representatives of the parliament not very smart people, and most importantly, he headed for the unification of all of Germany by no means through peaceful negotiations, but "with iron and blood."  The cowardly king doubted the necessity of these actions, but Bismarck convinced him of the correctness of the decision.  And he supported the words of his speech with actions, because in 1864 the Danes were already under the leadership of the King of Prussia.  And then other countries followed.  The state of the Second Reich lasted until 1917, and then it was replaced by the Democrats who established the Nazi dictatorship. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the Third Reich" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/60372.jpg" width="314"></div>

    <p>  Third Reich </p><p>  The history of the Third Reich is best known to ordinary citizens.  Its permanent leader A. Hitler literally lived on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconquering the world.  The Second World War showed how this faith was transmitted to German citizens.  Nazi troops reached Stalingrad.  But still, the collapse of this state after a turning point in the war was inevitable.  May 8, 1945, when Hitler had already committed suicide, Germany signed the act of surrender. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Art of the Third Reich" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10576/63972.jpg" width="418"></div>

    <p>  Despite the intensified development of heavy and military industries, art and literature also existed in this country.  How could one instill a utopian faith in an idea, if not with cultural works!  Only now all the themes of works and paintings were dictated, even an artificial trend in literature was created.  The art of the Third Reich also completely subordinated to Hitler's opinion: often the creations were related to military subjects, and those artists who depicted green sky and blue grass in the paintings were not recognized.  Everywhere the swastika was glorified. </p><p>  Each country has its own beginning, prosperity and sunset.  The powerful states of the Second and Third Reich played a significant role in world history, largely thanks to their leaders - Otto von Bismarck and Adolf Hitler.  Only strong people can rule a strong state. </p>
