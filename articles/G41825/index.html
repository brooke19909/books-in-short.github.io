Forgotten villages are empty, residents are fleeing in search of a better life.  It is hard to say how many such villages throughout Russia.  Why did the ancient settlements disappear, which forced the owners to leave their homes?  Each non-residential village has its own tragic story. </p><h2>  Problems of the Russian village </h2><p>  The village has always been the main symbol of the Russian spirit.  It is she who is the cradle of the great culture and best traditions of our country.  In our time, the forgotten villages of Russia are not uncommon.  More and more often you can see the abandoned villages that amaze with their sad landscapes.  Rural youth strives for a better life, in a <span>modern village</span> without the support of the state it is difficult to succeed.  A whole complex of measures aimed at improving the economy of agriculture will help to correct the deplorable situation. </p>

    <h2>  Causes </h2><p>  Sociologists have long been discussing the reasons for the extinction of the Russian hinterland.  Many small towns ceased to exist for similar reasons.  Many different factors contributed to the degradation of the Russian village: </p><ul><li>  depletion of natural resources (for example, the pond that local residents used for their needs is drying up); </li><li>  relocation of residents due to the proposed construction of important facilities; </li><li>  military operations (mobilization of men who subsequently did not return); </li><li>  the merger of small villages of the 60-70s of the last century (the goal of the Khrushchev program was to enlarge the collective farms); </li><li>  undeveloped infrastructure; </li><li>  lack of jobs (this is how old abandoned villages appear, from where people left in search of work and a better life); </li><li>  low prices at high costs for products that a <span>rural resident</span> can produce; </li><li>  villages that live their lives (a small number of local residents, mostly elderly: young people who have left to study in the city no longer return to their small homeland). </li></ul><p>  Each forgotten place has its own unique history, the 20th century in Russia was rich in events that for the most part negatively influenced the Russian village.  Lembolovo in the vicinity of the northern capital was destroyed to the ground during the Great Patriotic War.  After the victory of our troops, the settlement was moved north.  There was a new railway station, which was transferred to the historical name.  The small abolished village of Pitkyamaki, Leningrad Oblast, is now part of the larger settlement of Myaglovo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

There are people who move from big cities closer to nature.  What is it - a call of blood or a desire to escape from the bustle of the city?  Whatever the condition for the development of the abandoned villages, it is possible that thanks to these immigrants there will be a revival of the Russian village.

    <h2>  Cultural values </h2><p>  On the map of Russia there are regions where there are many abandoned objects of cultural heritage.  The old manor estates, hastily abandoned by their masters during the October Revolution, the most beautiful temples and monasteries where services were not held for many years.  The interior has been plundered for a long time, many objects left picturesque ruins.  The rich history and spirit of the past attracted local historians and connoisseurs of antiquity. </p><p>  In the vicinity of St. Petersburg there is the abolished village of Kummolovo, so ancient that the first mention of it is found in scribal books of the 16th century.  On an abandoned territory is the manor house of Blumentorst.  The once magnificent building of the architect Beretti is now guessed only thanks to the ruins.  The remains of an overgrown park with past plantings of fruit trees, swampy ponds where trout were bred, stony placers in the places of the former numerous buildings preserved the historical border of the settlement.  The reason for the destruction of the village was the occupation. </p>

    <h2>  Interest in the village nowadays </h2><p>  Now the uninhabited forgotten villages are of genuine interest from many travelers.  This direction can be a good resource for tourism development.  Some ancient churches and manor houses have survived to our times.  The desolation and gloominess of abandoned places especially attract extreme lovers and treasure hunters.  Do not forget that walking through deserted objects can be quite dangerous.  In addition to old wells and decrepit buildings, snakes and wild animals can expect a traveler. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the number of old abandoned settlements is growing year by year.  Perhaps someday this problem will be solved, and Russia will be proud of its prosperous villages.  And at the moment, forgotten villages can cause interest only among a group of enthusiasts and stalkers. </p>
