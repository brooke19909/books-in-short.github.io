    <h2>  Choosing a place for a child's summer vacation </h2><p>  Camp selection criteria: </p><ol><li>  Cost.  By the way, you can save on the price of a ticket by receiving compensation, or if the child wins it in the competition. </li><li>  Terms of delivery of the child to the place of rest.  It is necessary to determine in advance whether the transfer is included in the price. </li><li>  The place where the camp is located.  It is better if the camp is located in the same climatic zone where the child lives - then the adaptation period will not be required. </li><li>  Whether the child will be interested in the camp depends on the shift program. </li></ol><p>  Two camps ‚ÄúAlmaz‚Äù have been operating in Russia for a long time, which have proven themselves well.  One is located in the forests near Voronezh, the other is located on a river in the Ruze of the Moscow Region. </p><h2>  Camp "Diamond" in Voronezh </h2><p>  Located in a picturesque forest near Voronezh on the banks of the Usmanka River, the Almaz children's camp hosts 4 shifts of 170 people each in the summer.  Children from 5 years old are taken to the camp. </p><p>  Almaz begins work on June 1, the cost of vouchers for 21 days in 2017 was 15,800 - 28,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The camp has been operating for more than half a century; more than one generation of Voronezh residents has grown in it, and therefore the camp enjoys well-deserved love and popularity.  Indeed, for children who come here on vacation, there is an opportunity to express themselves creatively and realize their ideas and projects. </p>

    <p>  The address of the Almaz camp: Somovo village, 44 Dubovaya Street. </p><h2>  Camp infrastructure </h2><p>  Camp "Diamond" occupies a vast territory - almost 3 hectares.  Pine forest, clean coniferous air - all this is very necessary for urban children to recover. </p><p>  3 bedroom buildings are two-story brick houses surrounded by flowers.  But the guys have no time to sit in dormitories, they are waiting for: </p><ul><li>  playgrounds; </li><li>  paintball field; </li><li>  stadium; </li><li>  Volleyball Court; </li><li>  football field; </li><li>  a place for basketball. </li></ul><p>  In ‚ÄúDiamond‚Äù everyone is involved in sports, because the example of peers is so contagious. </p><p>  The guys go swimming to the beach by the river or to the pool.  In the concert hall, each shift is preparing their own creative program, and in the cinema you can watch new films.  In cozy gazebos gather noisy companies and lovers to read alone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The nutrition of children is a special concern of the staff.  Even a child who eats poorly at home likes a 5-time trip to the dining room.  After all, the cooks of "Diamond" deliciously cook healthy food. </p><h2>  Summer program </h2><p>  Where are the kids not bored?  Where fun!  Everyone is interested in the Almaz camp, because each shift becomes unique thanks to thematic programs that children implement under the guidance of counselors.  One shift can study the secrets of antiquities, another holds a theater festival, the third investigates an intricate detective. </p><p>  Not a single program is repeated either during the summer or in a year. </p><p>  This was made possible thanks to an experienced team of counselors, it includes experienced teachers, high school students and students who have been trained at the Leader School.  With such counselors it‚Äôs interesting to sit by the fire, sing songs, go camping, arrange discos, and hold competitions. </p><p>  Those reviews about the Almaz camp, which are left by children and adults, indicate that children are truly taken care of in this camp. </p><h2>  Children's camp "Diamond" in Ruza </h2><p>  Health Camp "Almaz" is located near Moscow on the banks <span>of the Ruza River.</span>  3 shifts of 400 people each annually rest in Almaz.  Children from 7 to 15 years old are admitted to the camp. </p>

    <p>  The cost of tickets in 2017 amounted to 35,700 rubles, discounts are provided for union members. </p><p>  The address of the Almaz camp: Moscow region, Ruza village, Sovetskaya street, 22. </p><p>  The fact that the camp is never boring is known to everyone who has been here at least once.  A whirlwind of events and activities captivates the child, immersing him in a friendly creative atmosphere. </p><h2>  Camp infrastructure </h2><p>  On 28 hectares of forest and beautifully located ponds, a children's camp ‚ÄúAlmaz‚Äù was freely located. </p><p>  To accommodate children in the camp there are: </p><ul><li>  1 brick building on 3 floors; </li><li>  3 buildings in 2 floors. </li></ul><p>  The rooms provide sleeping places for 2-4 people.  The rooms have new furniture and TVs.  One bathroom with 5 rooms. </p><p>  But children can rarely be found in a dormitory building, because there is so much interesting around.  The camp has everything that can make your vacation vivid and memorable: </p><ul><li>  computer classes; </li><li>  audiences for arts and crafts; </li><li>  sauna with fonts and bath; </li><li>  dance floor. </li></ul><p>  Children who are passionate about sports try their hand at various venues: </p><ul><li>  2 volleyball courts; </li><li>  city ‚Äã‚Äãarea; </li><li>  basketball; </li><li>  area for paintball; </li><li>  tennis court; </li><li>  2 football fields. </li></ul><p>  There are always a lot of people around table tennis tables, they also play billiards and badminton, and they ride horses from the camp‚Äôs own stable.  The climbing wall and the zoo "Diamond" are very popular. </p><p>  Tired of the abundance of impressions, children are fed 5 times a day. </p><h2>  Summer program </h2><p>  Of course, camp fires, discos and theatrical festivals are obligatory in the Almaz camp.  There are quests and contests, role-playing and adventure games. </p><p>  If a child likes to invent and create, creating something unusual, 5 circles work for him. </p><p>  If a child likes to relax actively, he will find something to do in the club of travelers, one of the many sports clubs or in the fitness room. </p>

    <p>  Each of those who visited the camp "Almaz" with pleasure recalls the obstacle course that he managed to pass.  It consists of a climbing wall, a ground and a high part located on trees with a height of more than 10 m. </p><p>  A child‚Äôs right summer vacation is a guarantee that he will overcome the upcoming school year without illness, with the energy and optimism that he will charge in the children's camp. </p>
