It should be said that now there is also a special snowboard park, where fans of this sport can enjoy skiing on the slopes with elevations of up to 120 meters.  There are jumps of different difficulty levels, for professionals and for beginners.  That is why snowboarders are so attracted to the Snezhniy ski resort. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the resort by bus or by personal transport.  Every day every two hours a bus departs from the <span>Parnas</span> or Ozerki <span>metro stations</span> , collecting everyone who wants to go to the village of Korobitsyno.  The trip takes 3 hours.  Estimated cost of the trip is 150 rubles.  You can get on your transport faster.  You need to move along the Vyborg highway to Michurinsky.  Next - turn onto the road to Korobitsyno.  And here you need to navigate by the signs and arrows leading to the resort. </p><h2>  Residence </h2><p>  Ski resort "Snezhny" (Korobitsyno, Leningrad region), as noted above, accommodates about 180 people.  Guests are accommodated in cottages for 4-6 people.  There are 30 such two-story cottages on the territory of the base. Those who wish can cook right in their house, or they can visit a local restaurant or cafe.  The houses are divided according to the level of comfort into three types. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort Snezhniy Korobitsyno" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/594645.jpg" width="600"></div>

On the second floor there are two separate bedrooms.  Near the house there is a barbecue area. </li><li>  <em>The house is standard</em> : in a house in this category, everything is almost the same as in the previous one.  But the bathroom is equipped with a washing machine, as well as a closed porch near the house.  This house has a bit more space. </li><li>  <em>Home comfort</em> : the equipment is practically no different from the previous ones.  The difference is that there is parking near the cottage. </li></ul><p>  The inside is very comfortable thanks in large part to the wooden stairs and walls.  From the windows of the cottages offers a beautiful view of the white snow slope.  The ski resort is good because here people can relax from the hustle and bustle of the city, enjoy the beauty of nature and clean winter air. </p><p>  There is also a small hotel in the resort.  True, it has only 7 rooms, but this only makes it more comfortable.  All numbers in it are executed in one style.  The rooms are clean, comfortable at home, the furniture is new. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  Of course, in addition to skiing or snowboarding, there should be other entertainments at the recreation center.  The ski resort "Snezhny" is waiting for guests all year round: in the summer and in the winter there is something to do. </p><p>  In winter, the main occupation is downhill skiing.  You can also go ice skating here.  The lake, next to which the base is located, freezes and turns into a beautiful spacious rink.  Skates, as well as skis and other sports equipment, are available for hire. </p><p>  Another fun is sledding or cheesecake.  Cheesecake is a round inflatable sled.  The speed on them develops decent, and sitting - soft and comfortable.  But there is always a danger of flying off of them.  Here special jumps are equipped for this. </p><p>  It is also interesting here in the summer.  For example, you can go fishing and then cook your own fish on a barbecue area near your cozy cottage.  On the lake, you can also take a romantic boat ride or ride a catamaran. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resort Snowy reviews" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/594646.jpg" width="350"></div>  For fans of sports entertainment, volleyball and badminton courts function on the territory of the recreation center.  Bike rental is also available.  Lifts daily deliver guests of the recreation center to the slopes of the mountains, where you can walk, pick up mushrooms and berries.
