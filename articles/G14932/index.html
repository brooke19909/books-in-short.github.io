    <h2>  To help nature </h2><p>  Since our crocheted dogs will be small, you should not buy new skeins of yarn for them.  Such knitted toys are also convenient because they consist of a huge number of scraps that have nowhere to be done, but it is certainly a pity to throw them away. </p><p>  Therefore, a crocheted dog, the scheme of which will be discussed later, will be made from all pieces of yarn that you have previously accumulated.  Thus, we will not only get rid of excess garbage, but also support the Year of Ecology in Russia, because this topic primarily affects us. </p><h2>  Infinity lists </h2><p>  Of course, in order to <span>crochet a dog, the scheme and description of</span> which will be discussed later, you need to prepare all the tools and materials.  You can find all of them in any store for creativity or needlework. </p><ul><li>  Hook.  It is worth choosing according to the size of your yarn, which will be discussed a little later.  In addition, when buying such an important part in knitting as a hook, pay great attention to securing the handle and base.  It is in this place that quick breakdowns occur, which subsequently interfere with work.  In addition, the crochet process should not cause any discomfort to your hand, much less leave prints on it. </li><li>  Yarn.  You can learn more about it later. </li><li>  Buttons and decorative elements.  They will be needed to create the dog's face.  It is best to choose options on a hidden mount that will not be visible on the front of the toy. </li><li>  Filler.  His choice is also yours, but it is worth considering that a crocheted dog, the scheme of which will be considered later, should remain soft even after washing, dry quickly and be easily cleaned of contaminants. </li></ul><h2>  Soft start </h2>

After all, only a soft toy, in fact, will attract people, forcing them to touch a pleasant knitted row again and again.  Also, pay attention to the colors.  They should not be sad and plain.  Prefer bright colors that will cheer you up with its richness and cheerfulness.  As we said, the use of old hanks is only welcome! </p><h2>  Secret signs </h2>

    <p>  Before crocheting a dog, you need to familiarize yourself with the terms.  If you are a skilled knitter who has already had years of practice behind her, then this acquaintance will probably not surprise you.  But for just beginning needlewomen, the information presented below will not be superfluous. </p><ul><li>  RLS is a single crochet column and the basis of the basics of any crocheted product.  Usually in toys do not use loops of a different kind, since these are most suitable.  They fit tightly to each other, thereby creating a single canvas through which the filler will not exactly knock out.  In addition, the toy will be durable. </li><li>  KA - Amigurumi ring.  It is also often used in the manufacture of small toys, where you just need to do everything carefully. </li><li>  PR - surplus loop. </li><li>  UB - reverse to the top, decreasing loop. </li></ul><h2>  How to crochet a dog: process description, work details </h2><p>  It's time to start directly to the process of making toys.  All actions will be considered in detail so that this lesson is useful for fans of knitting at any level. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  Let's start with the body: we collect 6 single crochet (RN) columns in the amigurumi (KA) ring.  In the second row in each column we knit two single crochet (RLS), thereby making an increase and getting 12 loops in the end. </li><li>  In the next row, an increase is made every second loop, at the end 16 finished columns are obtained.  Further, we continue according to the same principle, but we already do the increase of every third single crochet (RLS).  At the end of the row we get 24 loops. </li><li>  Next, change the color of the thread, continue knitting, making an increase every fourth single crochet (RLS).  The result should be 30 loops.  At the moment, the body has reached its widest point and is on the decline.  Every fourth loop needs to be reduced.  At the moment, it is also worth doing the stuffing of the body, carefully distributing the synthetic winterizer or any other filler. </li><li>  Having received 24 single crochet at the end of the row, we continue to make a decrease every third loop, and in the next row we need to decrease the loops every second loop.  When in the end there are only 6 single crochet, we reduce them all, fasten the thread and cut it shorter. </li></ol><h2>  Head and two ears </h2>

    <p>  How to tie a dog head and ears?  Pretty simple, follow the instructions. </p><p>  Knitting starts again according to the principle of the toy body: an amigurumi ring is made and 6 single crochet columns (RLS) are typed into it.  In the next row, an increase is made every second column, then in every third, and then in every fourth column without a crochet (RLS). </p><p>  In the sixth row, the increase must be done in every fifth column, and in the seventh - every sixth single crochet (RLS).  At the end of this row you should get 42 columns, which we will knit until the 14th row. </p><p>  Between the 14th and 15th rows, you need to place the eyes of our dog, leaving 5-6 single crochet (RLS) between them.  In the fifteenth row, every sixth loop needs to be reduced: 36 loops at the end of the row. </p><h2>  Mustache, paws and tail </h2><p>  Now we will connect the remaining elements of our toy: ears, paws and a muzzle.  They all fit in with the general principle, like a head with a torso, and begin with an amigurumi ring. </p><p>  We knit dog‚Äôs ears, like our head, up to the third row, when we get 18 loops, which we repeat three more rows.  Then we make a decrease every five loops, we get 15 single crochet stitches and we knit again three rows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted dog description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60098/2073630.jpg"></div>

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  When in the next row you make a decrease every fourth loop, knit two more rows.  At the end, cut the thread, fold the eyelet in half and stitch its open part with the rest of the thread. </p><p>  We create a muzzle from an ordinary amigurumi ring and surplus loops, thanks to which we get a flat circle, the thread from which must be left for further firmware. </p><p>  We knit four legs according to one principle.  We start again with an amigurumi ring with six single crochet (RN) columns.  Then in the second row we make an increase every second loop, and then every third.  We knit these 12 columns, and in the next row we make a decrease every third column. </p><p>  We change the thread, and then we knit seven rows in this way.  We stuff the paws very tightly so that they keep their shape, fold their beginning in half and sew them with a thread of yarn.  Cut the thread and thread it into the product. </p><h2>  Together </h2><p>  Now that we have a few different details, we will tell you how to tie the dog to the end.  If you pay attention to the structure of the bound body, it somehow reminds us of a hexagon. </p>

    <p>  So, the sides are occupied by the legs, and the lower ones remain free.  We sew the head to the upper sides, slightly shifting the center so that the dog‚Äôs face looks straight up.  Speaking of the head, we also sew on its face and ears to complete the look of the toy.  Do not forget to attach the tail. </p><p>  Now that the dog is ready, you can safely give it to friends and relatives, as the fashion for soft toys will never go away! </p>
