Light shades of the interior allow you to create a light airy atmosphere, and wooden floors - closer to nature.  Each room has a spacious balcony, ideal for a friendly evening conversation. </p><p>  Like many hotels in Limassol, the Harmony Bay hotel complex offers its guests a choice of two types of rooms: standard and family. </p><h2>  Standart room </h2><p>  A standard room of 20 square meters can accommodate up to three people.

    <p>  Once a week, hotel guests enjoy live music and evening animation.  To pay for additional services, it is not necessary to have cash, the hotel accepts credit cards. </p><h2>  Traveler opinions </h2><p>  Many three-star hotels on the island of Cyprus, whose accommodation prices vary during the beach season from 500 to 600 euros per week for a standard room with breakfast, offer their guests almost the same set of services.  Therefore, having familiarized themselves with the general information about the service of a particular hotel, potential tourists turn to web portals with reviews and comments about the resorts of Cyprus.  Here they are interested in the real opinions of already rested people. </p><p>  Travelers who have visited the Harmony Bay Hotel are mostly positive.  This is primarily due to the friendly staff who are ready to help at any time and the optimal list of services provided by the hotel. </p><p>  Tourists also note the hotel‚Äôs convenient location relative to the sea and city entertainment, comfortable clean rooms after renovation and a good buffet in the restaurant.  Cooks, according to guests, really try to surprise and diversify the assortment of dishes. </p><p>  Vacationers also enjoyed the pool with a large number of sunbeds and an excellent bar next to it under a canopy. </p>

    <p>  But their own dedicated area on the beach seemed to them not very convenient, since it is a stone slab with the entrance to the sea.  Therefore, many tourists preferred to go swimming in the neighboring beach with a more comfortable sandy entrance. </p><p>  Many guests were slightly upset because of paid Wi-Fi and the keys to an individual safe, due to the lack of a refrigerator in the room. </p><p>  In their reviews, tourists noted that a lot of Russian-speaking people have a rest in Harmony Bay Hotel 3 *. </p><p>  In general, if you evaluate the hotel on the basis of "price - quality", it justifies its value.  Many vacationers are ready to return here again.  Therefore, choosing the Harmony Bay Hotel for their stay, tourists will undoubtedly receive a comfortable and high-quality holiday on the island of Cyprus, and the prices for services will be very reasonable. </p>
