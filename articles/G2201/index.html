    <p>  The beach at the hotel, according to vacationers, is small, the entrance to the sea is on stones or from the pier, special shoes are needed, umbrellas are broken. </p><p>  Many people come here to save money, because the prices of this hotel are very attractive.  A voucher for two with a weekly stay and all-inclusive meals can be purchased for 25-35 thousand rubles along with a flight.  The Russians, vacationers here, compare their holidays with holidays in the Krasnodar Territory or in the Crimea and note that the time spent in this hotel reminds them of holidays in Russian resorts, only it costs much less. </p><p>  Otherwise, tourists express a lot of dissatisfaction with the <span>service</span> <span>Matiate</span> <span>Park</span> <span>Hotel 3 *.</span>  Many note that you have to wait a very long time to check in to the room, the rooms themselves are small, there are problems with the operation of the equipment, cleaning for the top three.  The road to the beach and to <span>Matiate 4 *</span> takes a lot of time.  There is nothing special to do in the hotel, only the warm sea and excursions save. </p><h2>  Excursions from the hotel </h2><p>  As for excursions, you can go anywhere from the <span>Park Hotel</span> .  In the village itself, in addition to the Mosque and the Wild Beach, there is nothing to see, but there are a lot of field trips here.  You can order them both at hotel guides and at street agencies.  The quality is the same, but the prices vary greatly. </p><p>  <em>Most popular tours</em> </p><p>  <span>Pamukkale</span> </p><p>  A pearl in the collection of Turkish excursions.  You will get acquainted with a natural monument, a slope with snow-white sediment travertine filled with emerald water, swimming in the Cleopatra basin and visiting the ruins of the city of Hierapolis.  The cost of the tour is 50 US dollars. </p>
