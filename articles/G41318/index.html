It is located at the intersection of two major directions: Moscow - Rostov-on-Don and Smolensk - Volgograd.  This leads to a large passability of passengers per day, which is approximately 6 thousand people. </p><p>  The station has three double-track electrified lines - to Yelets, Liski and Michurinsk - and one single-track, going to Povorino and serving only diesel locomotives, for which a change of locomotives is provided at the Gryazi-Voronezh station. </p><h2>  History of creation </h2><p>  The construction of the Gryazi-Voronezh station began at the very moment when the Ryazan-Kozlov line (today Michurinsk) was opened <span>on September 4,</span> 1866.  At the same time, the foundation stone of the future station was laid.  The construction of the first station was completed in January 1868, and at that time it was a wooden house with a class II mezzanine.  A wooden platform was built with a length of <span>90 and a width of 2.5 fathoms</span> , and the paths were located only on the north side.  The station was typical for that time: on the ground floor there were waiting rooms of the 1st and 2nd class, as well as a buffet, a kitchen, cash desks and a telegraph.  On the second floor was the apartment of the station manager. </p>

    <p>  The station worked for two months, and it became clear that the station building was too small, so it was necessary to reconstruct it.  In 1870, a one-story wooden building was added to it.  But due to insufficient funding, the construction of tracks on the south side began only by 1875.  At that time, a new <span>station</span> was being built <span>in</span> St. Petersburg, so construction began not on the site of the old station, but required redevelopment of tracks.  By 1883, work was completed, and the station became one of the best in the entire railway network of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Recovery after the war </h2><p>  For about 30 years, the station flourished and received its passengers, among whom were the famous writers L.N. Tolstoy, A.M. Gorky and I.A. Bunin.  But in 1919 the village was captured by the Mammoth residents, the station was damaged, the damage amounted to approximately 900 thousand rubles at that time. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the station was also bombarded by German soldiers and was completely destroyed, about 350 bombs were dropped on it, hundreds of people were injured.  According to some reports, 189 residents and guests of the village died. </p>

The emperor‚Äôs trip came in rainy autumn, and along the way it was so dirty that the stroller was mired in slush and the wheel broke.  Because of what, the king stopped here to repair his vehicle.  It was after this incident that a rumor spread among the people that Peter the Great ordered to name the village of Dirt. </li></ul>
