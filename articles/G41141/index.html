    <h2>  The meaning of the term </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that this is the name of the touch screen.  Such a monitor responds to light finger presses and does not have a physical keyboard.  Translated from English, the term means "multiple touches." </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The first experiments on creating touch screens were conducted back in the 1960s.  They later found their application at CERN.  They equipped the particle accelerator.  In the 1970s, a touchscreen screen was introduced at the University <span>of Kentucky.</span>  Modern technology, which once seemed fantastic, appeared in New York.  It was developed by Jeff Khan.  It happened eight years ago.  It can be said that new possibilities for creating touch-screens of ‚Äúmany touches‚Äù arose precisely at the beginning of the 21st century.  The inventor organized his own company, which he called the Perceptive Pixel.  Very quickly, she joined Microsoft and began to develop programs included in the Office suite. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What commands does the touch screen execute? </h2>

The first is able to recognize the coordinates of the point of one touch, and the second - the set.  This circumstance allows you to make working with an electronic device more comfortable and productive.  Developed many special gestures to control the device.  If you have a smartphone, you must remember that with just two fingers that converge or diverge on the monitor of an electronic gadget, you can set the command to reduce or enlarge the image.  They also allow you to open folders, files, collapse, move them, rotate, scroll pages.  You can enter text using the virtual keyboard.  Manufacturers of mobile electronic devices (in particular smartphones) indicate that their screen is capable of recognizing up to twenty touches.  To check the multi-touch screen for the accuracy of this statement, there is a special test program.  It is free and is freely available on the Internet.  It is often used by owners of devices with the Android operating system.

The most popular resistive technology.  It was designed by Sam Hurst.  Its biggest plus is the low cost of production.  This continued until 2008.  Other options for creating such displays: optical, strain gauge, inductive touchscreens.  Now create <span>projection-capacitive touch screens.</span>  They are used by Apple in their iPhones and iPads.

A capacitive monitor is a glass panel that covers a resistive layer.  At the corners of the display are four electrodes.  Through them passes an alternating voltage.  When a finger touches the touch screen, a leakage current occurs.  Large multi-touch screens support multi-touch tracking of multiple users at once.  Displays created by various technologies may possess it.  Infrared frames are being developed and launched into production - screens with different diagonals, using infrared illumination and a camera.  Special sensory films, as well as glass, are in demand among electronics users.  They cover the displays, their sizes can range from seventeen to fifty inches or more.

Even the children know that this is part of the interface of the best electronic innovations.  It is considered a big plus if the device is controlled by touch.  Developments are being carried out very actively, which are designed to improve this popular technology.  In everyday life, <span>touch panels</span> can be found in shopping, medical centers, universities, schools, and train stations.  They are used as a means of advertising services and informing customers.  Moreover, the visitor of the institution can choose, view the catalog of goods, rotate, move files.  Similar panels are produced by Philips.  Such a multi-touch system is equipped with speakers and a microphone.  The monitor is characterized by high contrast, its surface is resistant to damage and scratches.  The panel works in two modes: streaming (video, flash graphics, animation) and interactive (online control).  For a company that uses such devices, this is a great opportunity to increase their prestige in the eyes of partners and customers.

As a result, gadgets equipped with touch screens have gained great popularity among buyers.  Microsoft uses multitouch on the desktop of its operating systems and considers this area the most promising.  If you use devices with a multitouch display, what is it and what is its advantage, you will soon be able to answer on your own.  First of all, it is the convenience of controlling a few finger touches.  As a rule, the screen of electronic gadgets is large.  Their lack of physical buttons does not interfere with their operation.  On the contrary, this allows you to make electronic devices the most comfortable, it is a pleasure to use the Internet, to launch audio or video files.  In the presence of special programs there is the possibility of simultaneous operation of the device by several users.  A similar interface makes management intuitive.  Therefore, touch screens are suitable for children, and for advanced youth, and for the elderly.

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  Touchscreen electronics users have only the best impressions of communicating with it.  After all, such a monitor allows you to expand the ability to manage files, gadget functions.  Apple launches a tablet that, in addition to a host of positive features, also has a screen that is protected from fingerprints.  This is facilitated by <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  Therefore, the device is not only comfortable, but also beautiful.  Having talked once with him, the buyers no longer want to look for something else.  Capacitive multitouch for game fans is very convenient. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="multitouch system" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5349/407463.jpg" width="320"></div></h2><h2>  Future technology </h2><p>  Jeff Khan, the inventor of touch screens, believes that today there are several areas in which this technology can develop.  Developers have yet to create giant-sized displays that are controlled by touch.  This will make them available to multiple users at the same time.  Perhaps a touch multi-touch with a pen will be connected.  This will solve problems that require a more subtle approach.  After all, human fingers sometimes act quite rudely.  And with the help of a special subject it will be possible to draw on the display.  In this case, both hands of a person will be involved.  So, with the left you can influence the image scale, resize windows, move them, and write with the right pen.  Existing tablets equipped with touch screens do not meet the requirements listed above and are still not adapted to make it convenient to work with the pen and the touch of your fingers at the same time.  First of all, their monitors are not large enough, it is inconvenient to work with both hands on them.  The combination of the two options for managing files (touch and pen) is not yet available.  At the same time, the interfaces respond very slowly to the impact of a special subject.  When the first multi-touch touch screen appeared, many users had a feeling of discomfort when operating devices equipped with such a display.  Many lacked a physical keyboard.  Another step in the development of technology is the development of icons, objects, the relief and texture of which can be felt.  Undoubtedly, we can conclude that the future is with touch displays.  They embody the face of modern electronics. </p>
