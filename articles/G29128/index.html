  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do-it-yourself bezel. Bezel Tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Do-it-yourself rim is not so difficult.  Not only is this a beautiful and stylish accessory, it also supports hair and transforms the hairstyle.  Depending on what materials you will use to create the accessory, such complexity will be work.  For example, it is easiest to work with ribbons, beads and glue, felt, fabrics, harder with clay and beads - you will need at least some experience or a gift for needlework. </p><p>  <em>Features</em> </p><p>  In ancient times, the headband was rarely made in the form of a ring, more often in the form of a semicircle.  Today, these accessories are so popular that they are worn not only by children, but also by adult wealthy women.  Each designer creates his own collection of original rims.  This hair accessory is decorated with sequins, feathers, bows and bows, rhinestones, ribbons and much more - the manufacturers' imagination is endless.  The big plus is their low cost, especially rims without decorations, simple, which can be used as a basis for creating your own original masterpiece.  In addition, due to the low price, you can purchase several copies that differ from each other in color and style.  Since the rims are suitable for almost any face, both students and business ladies can wear them, he will completely complete the image chosen by the woman. </p><p>  <em>How to wear and choose headbands</em> </p><p>  The rim should fit like a hat; it should not press or be too loose.  You need to choose an accessory of such a size that it fits well on your hair and does not cause any inconvenience.  But if you didn‚Äôt succeed in choosing a product of a suitable size, you can always move the overly pressing bezel, and which slides off, fasten it with invisible hairpins on the head. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Products come in various colors and styles, for study and work, a thin rim of strict classic colors - black, white, gray without any decorations, is perfect.  You can use colored accessories made of plastic and metal with rhinestones, as well as many others, the range is simply immense.  In addition, you can always make a bezel with your own hands, so that it is guaranteed to fit your outfit.  After all, you always need to have accessories that complement the image. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself rim of ribbon and artificial flowers </p><p>  We need a simple bezel of medium width, a ribbon of a suitable color (it is better to choose a satin green width of about one centimeter).  A bouquet of small artificial flowers, the main thing is that the flowers are divided into twigs, and at the same time, the tip of each of them is long.  Additionally, you need a needle and thread to match the tape, colorless glue.  First we take the rim and gently glue the tape from the very tip so that it does not show either the beginning of the rim or the ends of the tape.  Then we begin to gently wrap the ribbon around it, somewhere at ear level under the ribbon we lay out branches with flowers in a chaotic order.  The tips should completely hide under it.  We do this to the very end, where the ribbon is carefully hemmed with a needle and thread.  The bezel is ready! </p><p>  In fact, making a <span>hair band for</span> your own hands is not so difficult, in addition to materials, you will need hands and good imagination.  It‚Äôs not necessary to have a gift for decoration, because you can do the work according to the sketches of other people, and the product will turn out no worse, just change a little the overall composition and color scheme, you can add something from yourself, for example, beads and ribbons, some decor, you can ready.  And for the craftswomen, for example, it will not be difficult to fashion flowers from clay and place them on the base, such an accessory will be one of a kind, hardly anyone will be able to repeat it exactly.  A handmade bezel is the best decoration of your hair! </p>
