It was Herodotus who approved the Greek reading of the name of the pharaoh - Cheops.  The scientist believed that the ruler was known as a tyrant and despot.

    <h2>  The heyday of ancient Egypt </h2><p>  The reign of Pharaoh Cheops is supposedly 2589-2566 BC.  e.  or 2551-2528 BC  e.  He was the second representative of the fourth royal dynasty.  The reign of Pharaoh Cheops is the heyday of the country.  By this time, Lower and Upper Egypt had already merged into one strong state.  The king was considered a living god.  That is why his power seemed absolutely limitless.  The power of the Egyptian pharaohs directly influenced the development of the economy.  The economic expansion has contributed to the progress of political and cultural life. </p><p>  Despite this, there is not much information about Pharaoh.  The main sources are the works of the ancient historian Herodotus.  However, this work is most likely based on legends, and not on historical facts.  And therefore, this work, in fact, has nothing to do with reality.  Nevertheless, several sources about the life of Cheops are fairly reliable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Photo of the pharaoh Cheops, unfortunately, could not be saved.

    <h2>  Activities of the ruler </h2><p>  The reign of Pharaoh Cheops lasted more than two decades.  He was considered the second sun and had a rather severe character.  He had several wives and, accordingly, many children. </p><p>  He was also known for the fact that during his reign, new cities and settlements were constantly being built on the banks of the Nile.  So, the pharaoh founded the famous fortress in Buchen. </p><p>  In addition, many religious sites appeared, among which, of course, the Cheops pyramid.  But we will return to this issue a little later. </p><p>  By the way, according to Herodotus, the ruler closed the temples.  He saved, and all resources went to the construction of his pyramid.  However, judging by Egyptian sources, the pharaoh sacrificed generously for religious objects with enviable generosity and was still an active temple builder.  In many ancient drawings, the pharaoh was depicted precisely as the creator of villages and cities. </p><p>  As a statesman, Pharaoh Cheops was periodically forced to send his army to the Sinai Peninsula.  His goal is to destroy the nomadic tribes who robbed local merchants. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also in this territory, the ruler tried to control the deposits of copper and turquoise.  It was he who first began to develop deposits of alabaster, which are located in Khatnub. </p><p>  In the south of the country, the pharaoh carefully monitored the extraction of Aswan pink granite, which was going to construction. </p>

    <h2>  Tomb architect </h2><p>  In history, the name of this ruler is primarily associated with his pyramid.  She is recognized as one of the seven wonders of the world.  The tomb is located in Giza.  It is next to modern Cairo. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Cheops was not at all the first pharaoh for whom a pyramid was erected.  The ancestor of such constructions was still the ruler Joser.  Khnum-Khufu erected the largest tomb. </p><p>  The pyramid of Pharaoh Cheops was built around the year 2540 BC.  e.  The construction manager and architect was one of the ruler‚Äôs relatives.  His name was Hemiun.  He served as a vizier.  Another Egyptian official who participated in the construction of the pyramid, Merrer, is also known.  He kept diary notes, with the help of which modern scientists learned that this figure often came to one of the limestone quarries.  It was there that they produced blocks for the construction of the tomb. </p>

    <h2>  Construction progress </h2><p>  Preparatory work went on for several years, as the workers first had to build a road.  Material for construction was dragged along it.  The construction of the pyramid lasted almost two decades.  According to some sources, about one hundred thousand workers were involved in the construction process.  But at the same time only 8,000 people could build the facility.  Every 3 months, workers replaced each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Peasants also took part in the construction of a monumental structure.  True, they could only do this when the Nile spilled.  During this period, all agricultural work was curtailed. </p><p>  The Egyptians who built the pyramid were given not only food and clothing, but also salaries. </p><h2>  The appearance of the tomb </h2><p>  Initially, the height of the tomb was almost 147 meters.  However, due to a series of earthquakes and the onset of sand, several blocks collapsed.  Thus, today the height of the pyramid is 137.5 m. The length of one side of the tomb is 230 m. </p><p>  The tomb is composed of 2.3 million stone blocks.  However, no binder solution was provided at all.  The weight of each block varies from 2.5 to 15 tons. </p><p>  Inside the tomb are burial chambers.  One of them is called the Queen‚Äôs Chamber.  At the same time, the representatives of the weaker sex have traditionally been buried in separate small tombs.  In any case, at the foot of the pyramid are the tombs of the women of Cheops and the nobility. </p>

    <h2>  Sun rooks </h2><p>  Near the tomb, archaeologists discovered the so-called "sun rooks" - these are ceremonial boats.  According to legend, the ruler makes their voyage to the afterlife. </p><p>  In 1954, scientists found the first ship.  <span>Lebanese cedar</span> was used as the material <span>.</span>  Construction did without nails at all.  The length of the structure is almost 40 m, and the width is 6 m. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the researchers were able to identify that there are traces of silt on the boat.  Perhaps, during his lifetime, the ruler moved along it along the Nile and the coastal waters of the Mediterranean.  On the boat, steering and rowing oars were found, and superstructures with cabins were placed on the deck. </p><p>  The second ship of Cheops was discovered relatively recently.  It was in the cache of the pyramid. </p>

    <h2>  Empty sarcophagus </h2><p>  However, the body of the legendary pharaoh was not found.  In the ninth century, one of the caliphs was able to penetrate the tomb.  He was surprised that no signs of looting and breaking were observed.  But there was no Cheops mummy, only an empty sarcophagus remained in her place. </p><p>  At the same time, the construction was interpreted precisely as a tomb.  Perhaps the ancient Egyptians deliberately erected a false tomb to trick potential robbers.  The fact is that at one time the burial place of Cheops mother was robbed, and her mummy was stolen.  The thieves took the body, so that later in a calm atmosphere to remove jewelry. </p><p>  At first, the mummy was not reported to Cheops.  They told him only about the fact of plunder.  After this, the pharaoh was forced to order the reburial of her mother‚Äôs body, but in fact, it was necessary to conduct a ceremony with an empty sarcophagus. </p><p>  There is a version that the mummy of the ruler is buried in another, modest tomb.  And the pyramid itself was the posthumous abode of the spirit of the powerful king. </p>

    <h2>  Descendants of the Pharaoh </h2><p>  When Pharaoh Cheops (the years of rule - 2589‚Äì2566 BC or 2551‚Äì2528 BC) did not become, the son of the great ruler became the ruler of the state.  His name was Jedefra.  There are very few facts about his rule.  It is known that he reigned only eight years.  During this time, he managed to build the second highest tomb in this territory.  Unfortunately, even in those ancient times, the Jedefra pyramid was also not only plundered, but also partially destroyed. </p><p>  In addition, a number of historians believe that it was this offspring of Cheops that at one time was able to build the Great Sphinx.  This statue was erected in memory of the father.  Egyptologists believe that the body of a mythical creature is made of solid limestone.  However, his head was made later.  Note that many scientists claim that the face of the Sphinx looks very much like the appearance of Cheops. </p><p>  Subsequent rulers of the dynasty also continued to build pyramids.  But the last king of the fourth dynasty named Shepeskath did not build monumental tombs, since the heyday of Ancient Egypt came to naught.  The state was in decline.  The descendants of Cheops no longer allowed themselves to spend resources on colossal structures.  Thus, the time of the great pyramids remained in the distant past.  But the great tomb of Cheops, which is considered one of the <span>Seven Wonders of the World,</span> has survived to this day. </p>
