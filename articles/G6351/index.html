  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to find out the details of a bank card and make a money transfer to it?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many payment card users are well aware of how to use them to pay for goods in a store or withdraw <span>cash.</span>  However, these are not all the possible operations that can be performed using this piece of plastic.  There are also non-cash transfers.  True, for this you need to have data about your own account.  We must say right away that the problem of how to find out the <span>details of a bank</span> card is solved quite simply.  Let's figure it out in order. </p><p>  <strong>Information Ways</strong> </p><p>  To begin with, you do not need to look for the card number anywhere - it is on its front side.  But more complete information can be obtained in several ways. </p><p>  The first and most elementary way is to take the rest of the information from a bank service agreement.  The institution was to issue one copy of this document with the card.  The card account is definitely there, but here are some key data, most often it is the BIC and the <span>correspondent account of a</span> banking institution, may be missing. </p><p>  Then you should visit the bank‚Äôs website, select your region, and in the ‚Äúdetails‚Äù section there you will find all the missing information.  In case of difficulty <span>,</span> you can ask how to find out the details of a <span>bank card</span> for free by calling the hotline.  Be prepared to go through identification with a secret question, the answer to which you yourself left in the bank when you received the card. </p><p>  The second way is already connected with a personal visit to the bank branch.  And only the one that issued the card.  Such an action may be necessary in case of loss of securities with details.  With all the inconvenience, this is the most reliable option.  By presenting the card and passport, you will receive detailed information back, the reliability of which there is no doubt.  If you know your account, then you will not even need an identity card to provide the exact name of the bank, correspondent account and BIC. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And finally, the third method works if you have Internet banking or mobile banking services connected from the very beginning.  You must enter a password, and here they are - the long-awaited details. </p><p>  As a result, it turns out that there are no new ways to find out the details of a bank card.  Inquisitiveness and perseverance lead to the desired result. </p><p>  <strong>How to transfer money to a card?</strong> </p><p>  The information received will greatly expand the list of operations performed with the card.  The most important thing - now you can transfer money to the card in several ways. </p><p>  Prior to this, you could replenish your account in only one way - to deposit cash to an ATM.  From this moment, in addition, you can do the following: </p><ul><li>  provide details to the employer or business partner so that he transfers the earned money here; </li><li>  transfer money from another account or bank card, including another financial institution; </li><li>  deposit funds at the bank cash desks; </li><li>  accept <span>money</span> from your electronic wallets Yandex.Money, WebMoney, QIWI and others. </li></ul><p>  In the last paragraph, by the way, a separate explanation is required on how <span>to transfer money</span> to a card.  The fact is that each of these systems has developed its own methodology for protecting customers.  As a result, the list of documents confirming the identity of the recipient can be very original.  There are times when you need to submit color images of your card and several pages of your passport. </p><p>  As a rule, the transfer is accompanied by a commission fee.  It is noteworthy that inside one bank it is small and amounts to no more than 1%, or even not at all.  For operations with third-party institutions, you will have to pay from 2 to 4%. </p><p>  As a result, starting to solve the problem of how to find out the details of a bank card, you go much further: the whole process ends with the creation of a full-fledged payment instrument. </p>
