    <p>  Time of Troubles: briefly on the reasons </p><p>  So, what were the main reasons?  Probably, one cannot help but recall the <span>reign of Ivan the Terrible.</span>  The tyrant and despot with his guardian and unnecessary <span>Livonian war</span> did not just ruin the country, he brought <span>social tension</span> into it <span>.</span>  <span>This feeling was</span> reinforced by the Anglican drama when the heir to the throne was killed.  But still there are other reasons that undoubtedly arise from the above assumptions.  Firstly, this is a crisis of dynasty and power (the same Uglich drama);  secondly, these are aggravations in the social sphere that were caused by a new decree on the five-year investigation of runaway peasants (the decree further strengthened the enslavement of this segment of the population);  thirdly, the beginning of a troubled time, the events of which will be discussed briefly below, was marked by hunger;  fourthly, the great claims of Poland to the Russian throne.  Thus, a large "bunch" of factors in their entirety gave a huge impetus, which led to a kind of collapse of the state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the beginning of troubled times brief" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218576.jpg" width="600"></div>

Oddly enough, the population blamed the then tsar - Boris Godunov, who allegedly angered God with his "unnaturalness," that is, the throne should not be in his hands.  One way or another, but this ruler is dying, and the difficult time for Russia begins.  The country is undergoing several uprisings, after which False Dmitry the First appears.  This figure will become legendary later.  Surprisingly, the army of the monarch also goes over to the side of this impostor, but this does not save him from death.  Now comes the era of the boyar king.  Under him, the civil war deepened in the country.  Vasily Shuisky ruled during the uprising of Ivan Bolotnikov, during open intervention, and also during False Dmitry II.  The Tushinsky thief, as he was called, was also popular among the people, but he did not receive the proper support: a conspiracy was organized, the result of which was the murder of the impostor.  But the boyar king is overthrown.  Next comes the reign of the Seven Boyars.  During this time, two <span>popular militias</span> save the capital of Russia and free it from the invaders.  Later there will be nationwide executions, as well as peace treaties with Poland and Sweden, which will secure for some time the country's borders. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="consequences of troubled times briefly" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10508/218575.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Time of Troubles, which was briefly described above, led to the fact that a new dynasty was established on the Russian throne, whose name is the Romanovs.  Thanks to the <span>Zemsky Sobor</span> , a young king was chosen who, through hard work, led the state to stability.  Thus, the consequences of the Time of Troubles (briefly about them can be found in textbooks and manuals) became questions for reflection of the new government. </p>
