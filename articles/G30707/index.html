    <h2>  about the project </h2><p>  <span>LCD "Stolichnye Polyany" ("Morton") is a new complex of 5 panel buildings located in the south-west of Moscow.</span>  <span>According to project documentation, the first floors will be reserved for commercial premises: shops, cafes and restaurants, organizations that provide various services to the population.</span>  <span>The design feature of the project will be high ceilings and designer decoration of the entrances, as well as two entrances: from the courtyard and from the street.</span>  <span>The complex may become one of the best in New Moscow, therefore, naturally, it attracts the attention of buyers.</span>  <span>The developer promises to build social infrastructure facilities on the territory of the complex, a multi-level parking, saving yards from congestion of cars.</span> </p><p>  <span>Those who have already visited the construction site and purchased an apartment complain about the density of the buildings: the houses are so close to each other that the neighbors see each other from the windows.</span>  <span>Dark courtyards-wells create permanent twilight, and the complex is not enough to accommodate all the necessary infrastructure.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>Many residents complain about the lack of infrastructure: the complex does not yet have its own kindergarten, school, only a few shops, playgrounds and sports grounds.</span>  <span>But according to the plan of the developer, the residents of the complex will be able to use the school, kindergarten and clinic located within walking distance from it.</span>  <span>The project includes the construction of a kindergarten, which will help save young parents from a number of difficulties.</span>  <span>It is also planned to build a comprehensive school for 450 students, but it is not yet known in what form its activities will be carried out: budget or commercial.</span> </p><p>  <span>Underground parking guarantees the comfort and safety of the car owner and eliminates the already cramped courtyards from the accumulation of vehicles.</span>  <span>The "chip" of the project was the spacious pantries provided for use by each tenant.</span>  <span>This is an additional space outside the apartment where you can store bicycles, prams, blanks.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Documenting </h2><p>  <span>Almost all equity holders expressed their concerns.</span>  <span>As soon as most of them bought an apartment in the residential complex "Capital Glades", the construction literally froze.</span>  <span>But, as it turned out, the lull was due to the takeover of Morton Group of Companies by PIK.</span>  <span>In April 2017, after all the necessary documents were completed, construction at the facility was resumed, with an unprecedented scale.</span>  <span>Residents of the district note that the work does not stop, either day or night.</span> </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  <span>LCD "Stolichnye Polyany" is an excellent option for those who are not ready to say goodbye to the developed metropolitan infrastructure, but are tired of the hustle and bustle, the rhythm of life, the dust of the metropolis.</span>  <span>The buildings are being built in the ecologically clean <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNew Moscow,</span> in South Butovo.</span>  <span>The developer tries to preserve the forest as much as possible in order to provide each resident with a place to relax in the fresh air.</span> </p><p>  <span>Of course, the project is not without a number of drawbacks.</span>  <span>First of all, this is the building density.</span>  <span>Potential residents would like to see more space.</span>  <span>The developer also needs to work on the infrastructure of the complex: equip recreation areas, walking and bicycle paths, build a kindergarten and a school on the territory.</span> </p>
