  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY collage with Publicher</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On some sites, the ability to upload only one image is determined.  At the same time, it so happens that the user simply needs to present the reader several photographs or drawings.  This happens if in the article the author shares ways of making something and has step-by-step photographs.  And sometimes I want to lay out for comparison a couple of shots nearby. </p><p>  It seems that the situation is creating just the same stalemate.  However, a method that helps the user to provide several in one image exists.  For this, you just need <span>to make a collage of</span> photos.  What is it? </p><p>  The uninitiated should be explained: this is a mixture of photos located in one picture.  But how to create a collage? </p><p>  More recently, only professional designers did this.  But today there are a huge number of web services that help to realize this desire for the most inexperienced user. </p><p>  The easiest for those who want to <span>create a collage</span> with their own hands should be called the program Publicher, which is a component of Microsoft Office. </p><p>  First you need to create a document in Publicher, then open it.  Now you need to decide on the size of the future collage.  The phrase “resize page” is located in the frame on the left.  It is necessary to point the <span>mouse cursor</span> to the frame and click the left button on the mouse.  A page opens with the dimensions of the future image. </p><p>  For sites it is best to choose A4 (landscape).  But if in the form of a collage an amateur designer wants to create printed materials: a postcard, a book - a baby or a family photo album - then A5 (book) is suitable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, the user who decided to create a collage with his own hands, decided on the size of the future picture, hovered over it and clicked the left mouse button. </p><p>  Now on the rectangle of "publication" you need to put the necessary material.  After copying the picture, paste it into the area of ​​the future collage.  “Take” the corners and either increase the <span>size of the photo,</span> or reduce it. </p><p>  We also drag the image with the cursor to the place that seems more convenient.  And if you wish, it’s quite possible to tilt the picture, flip it (there is a green circle at the top of the inserted material - moving the picture behind it with the cursor, you can achieve the desired effect). </p><p>  The "table littered with photographs" looks very nice when the images are scattered, as if by corners "bumping" into each other, partially covering the lower pictures. </p><p>  If you want to take the top photo, which suddenly turned out to be from below, then such a function is also provided.  From above you need to find the button, which is depicted as several squares, standing one after another.  You need to hover over it and click the left mouse button - the inscription "to the foreground" will appear.  Then the cursor should be moved to the image that you plan to bring to the fore. </p><p>  You can make a collage with your own hands not only on a white background.  The program also provided for this moment.  Let's say a user made a decision: place pictures on a red background.  Along the left edge of the monitor you need to find a rectangle, hover over it and left-click.  Then move the cursor to the sheet field - a cross should appear.  Left-click - a square appears on the sheet. </p><p>  It needs to be “stretched” over the entire area of ​​the sheet so that its edges coincide with the edges of the future collage.  Then on the top line we look for the button “fill color”, click on the small arrow next to it - a palette of fill colors appears.  You can take advantage of the already presented shades, or you can click on the inscription “other colors” in the palette and select your favorite. </p><p>  Of course, the background is best done before posting photos.  Just do not be scared when images after dragging to the background disappear.  They must be placed in the foreground in advance - this was mentioned earlier. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself collage creation in this program is also convenient because, if necessary, the designer can place inscriptions next to the images or make a beautiful headline. </p><p>  The title font is selected after pressing the button on the left edge of the monitor, which has an image of a capital letter “A” in blue, standing at an angle. </p><p>  After the work on the collage is completed, left-click on the “file” button at the top, select the phrase “save as ...” in the list </p><p>  In the window that appears below we find the line “Publicher files”, click on the arrow and scroll through the new window until the line “JPEG picture” appears, and select “save”. </p><p>  That's all - the image is ready for placement: you can use it as wallpaper on your desktop, you can upload to any site. </p>
