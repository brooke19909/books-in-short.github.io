Holidays in Turkey</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Turkey has long been a favorite vacation spot for many of our tourists.  Here, fabulously beautiful nature, beautiful beaches, many comfortable hotels.  It's no secret that lovers of exceptional service tend to take tours to the "five" or, in extreme cases, to the "four".  But there are many people looking for a quality and at the same time inexpensive vacation in Turkey.  Do not think that this is impossible, because, in addition to hotels with five stars, which have luxury spa facilities, private beaches and ultramodern rooms in chic buildings, Turkey has simpler hotels where the living conditions are a bit more modest.  But for a good holiday, everything is provided there, and the staff is trying hard to create its guests the maximum possible amenities and a great mood. </p><p>  Among these inexpensive hotels, Britannia Hotel Villas 3 *, located in the center of Kemer, is well-deserved by the love of tourists and highly popular.  Some tourists, planning a <span>vacation in Turkey,</span> come here every year, because they like the almost homely atmosphere prevailing here, a good location, delicious food prepared by a top-level chef.  Of course, evening shows with lights are not arranged here, <span>foam parties</span> are not held <span>,</span> there are no tennis courts and golf courses.  The rooms here do not surprise with luxury; the territory does not delight with large-scale exotic gardens.  This hotel can offer only an economical vacation in modest rooms with tasty, but only three meals a day.  But those who buy a tour here can fully enjoy the beauty of Kemer, have a wonderful time on its best beaches, conveniently make any excursions and shopping, have fun and fun in nightclubs and discos, because all this is nearby, just a few steps away .  Of course, there are tourists who did not like this hotel.  The reason for this is purely subjective sensations, as well as some inconsistency between the way this place is in reality and the way tour operators draw it.  We offer you hotel detailed and truthful information based on the reviews of people who have a rest here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Britannia Hotel 3" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421308.jpg" width="522"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Kemer is a beautiful city and, perhaps, the most popular <span>resort in Turkey.</span>  It is located in the province of Antalya, on the shores of the Anatolian Gulf, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea.  The provincial city center of Antalya is just under 45 km from here, and the popular resort of Tekirova is only 11 km away.  Britannia Hotel Villas 3 * is located in the central district of Kemer on Anafartalar Cd., Stretching parallel to the coast.  You need to walk about 300 meters to it from the hotel, bypassing the street at number 124 and the rather lively Deniz Cd.  According to the reviews of most tourists of different ages and different physical fitness, it takes up to 5 minutes of leisurely walking.  Approximately the same way takes to the best in Turkey nightclubs ‚ÄúCrystal‚Äù, ‚ÄúAura‚Äù, ‚ÄúInferno‚Äù, since they are all on the same Deniz Cd.  Even closer, namely 3 minutes, to the guests of the Britannia Hotel 3 * to another major street, in our name Liman.  It always reminds Muscovites of the Arbat, because this street is only pedestrian, designed for a leisurely promenade.  And also because here the windows of the best boutiques and jewelry shops, exclusive restaurants and cozy cafes sparkle alluringly in Kemer, they quietly rustle with palm branches and the many fountains are relaxing.  On this street you can not only enjoy walking, but also come to the port. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  The nearest airport, where planes fly from Russia, is located 10 km from Antalya and 55 km from Britannia Hotel 3 *.  Vacationers are delivered to the hotel by transfers of travel agencies, where vouchers were purchased. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many tourists who have already been to Turkey more than once come to Kemer without using the services of intermediaries.  They can get from the airport to Britannia by taxi for about 150 cu  Or take bus number 600 (stop immediately at the exit from the terminal) and for 5 lire drive to the bus station in Antalya, and then take a bus ticket to Kemer.  The price depends on the class of the selected bus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in Kemer" class="if" height="348" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421316.jpg" width="521"></div>

    <p>  Another way to get to the hotel on your own is to rent a car directly at the airport.  Even if this is your first time in Turkey, getting to Kemer is very easy, as there are many signs along the road.  Upon reaching the fork, you will have a choice where to turn.  The road to the right passes Antalya, the road to the left lies through its center, but ultimately both lead to Kemer. </p><p>  If you arrived in Turkey with a large company, you can order a transfer (regular minibus) to the hotel at the airport, which costs from 50 to 90 cu  for the whole car.  One caveat - this service is possible when pre-ordering via the Internet. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  It can be said that Britannia Hotel 3 * seems not particularly noticeable at first glance.  Turkey is a country located both in Europe and in Asia, which leaves a peculiar imprint on the architecture of buildings, on street planning, on the entire Turkish mentality.  All this to a large extent applies to the described hotel.  Although it is located in the central area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, there are very few other hotels in the immediate vicinity, only the private sector is around.  On the one hand, this is a plus, as guests are not disturbed by noise, for example, from disco neighbors.  And on the other hand, this arrangement brings unforeseen variety to the rest in the form of sonorous roosters singing in the mornings and voices of other domestic animals.  Do not be surprised, this is exactly the center of Kemer.  Here light, stylish, ultramodern skyscrapers and houses of local residents peacefully coexist nearby with orange gardens, vegetable gardens, poultry houses and other attributes of subsistence farming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hotel in question fits perfectly into the overall picture of the city landscape.  Note that nearby (on the common territory) there are villas belonging to the same owners as Britannia 3 *, namely to three brothers.  In the sign of that part of their possessions where the villas are located, the words and Villas are added, but this is the same hotel.  Its central buildings are located directly on the road, which is convenient for arrival and departure, but there is no parking as such.  The hotel area is small, only about 0.7 hectares.  It has a nice and slightly unusual design.  So, there are a lot of habitual for Russians and exotic plants - palm trees, huge ficuses, rhododendrons, jasmine is blooming everywhere, bright flowers are fragrant, pillars are wrapped around grapes, but all this is located on two levels connected by stone stairs. </p><p>  Pools are also located on two levels, with one of the ponds beautifully decorated with stones and a waterfall.  On the territory, the designers successfully entered into the landscape two three-story buildings, two-story cottages, several small villas, two spacious pools and one small, stepped.  In the fresh air, under the canopy of trees, there is also a restaurant terrace and a bar.  The hotel reception is open all day and is located in a separate place in the fresh air.  Here, tourists can hand over their suitcases to the luggage room, valuables in the safe, order a taxi, call a doctor, exchange currency. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Britannia Hotel Villas 3" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421167.jpg" width="528"></div>

    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  Britannia Hotel 3 * can offer guests 110 rooms.  Tourists in their reviews note that they are far from equivalent and differ not only in category, but also in the presence of a balcony (not everywhere), views, equipment and area. </p><p>  There is only one category of rooms in the buildings - the ‚Äústandard", but they are small-sized and truly spacious, separate and combined (a common interior door, consists of two bedrooms and one hygiene room).  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at what ‚Äústandards‚Äù options await tourists at this hotel.  If the rooms are located on the ground floor, they do not have a balcony or a veranda, and the view from the windows will only be on the nearby territory or infrastructure.  This is not a bad placement option, as there are a number of rooms located on the floor, which can be called "minus the first", but in a simple way - a basement.  These rooms offer tourists a view from the windows of concrete structures, and in addition, almost constant dampness.  The most optimal accommodation option is the rooms on the second and third floors, since they are more spacious, almost all of them have a balcony, and the views from the windows will pleasantly surprise you with beautiful views of the city.  According to numerous reviews of tourists, these best rooms are provided after the purchase of procedures in the spa.  It costs 20 cu  for one person. </p><p>  In Britannia Hotel 3 * very comfortable villas.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rooms is up to 150 squares.  The layout includes a living room, kitchenette, three bedrooms, two hygiene rooms.  Villas are intended to accommodate 8 people. </p><p>  The equipment of any room is very simple - minimal sets of furniture, air conditioning, not a new TV, paid safe, telephone for communication with the reception, a small refrigerator (not all rooms have it).  In the hygiene rooms there is a shower, toilet, washbasin and hairdryer.  Personal hygiene products are issued on the day of arrival. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Britannia Hotel 3 Turkey" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421172.jpg" width="523"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The three-star Britannia is a city hotel, close to which you can find dozens of cafes and restaurants to your liking.  This option is for those guests who do not like the cuisine of the "British".  Travel agencies sell here all-inclusive vouchers, which includes breakfast, lunch and dinner, where some products (salads, slices, bread, side dishes) can be taken independently in unlimited quantities, and the employee gives meat and fish dishes, soups, chicken on distribution portionwise.  According to tourists, those who wish can ask for an addition.  Meals are organized in the hotel restaurant, which is located both indoors and on the outdoor terrace, which allows you to comfortably eat in any weather.  Drinks: beer, local wine, brandy, coffee, tea, cocktails - you can take in the bar, and alcohol is given free of charge only from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and only in small plastic cups.  Snacks during the day are not provided in this hotel.  Tourists note that the food in the hotel is very tasty, because a talented and diligent chef works here, but the range of dishes is not very diverse, repeating from day to day.  Another, one might say, nutritional deficiency is that many products, such as sausages, sausages, goulash and others, are prepared from soybeans. </p><p>  An approximate breakfast menu here is: drinks, bread, sausages or sausages, sliced ‚Äã‚Äãvegetables and all kinds of salads based on sour cream, mayonnaise, ayran, side dishes (usually two kinds), boiled eggs, cereals.  For lunch, soup (one kind), meat or fish dish, chicken, side dishes (usually rice or pasta), fresh and cooked vegetables, fruits (one or two kinds), dessert, baklava are offered.  For dinner, it‚Äôs about the same, but without soup. </p><p>  It is nice that the hotel restaurant is always clean, the waiters work quickly, so there is never a pile of dirty dishes on the tables, and there are practically no queues for food. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Britannia 3" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421173.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <h2>  Service for kids </h2><p>  Millions of tourists of all ages and economies like Turkey.  Inexpensive with children you can relax here if you choose a decent hotel.  In the three-star Britannia for babies there is a separate shallow, completely safe pool, in the rooms cots are available on request.  There is no animation and a special platform with swings and slides, a separate children's menu is not provided.  Nevertheless, it is good to relax with children in this hotel, since it is always very calm here, noisy discos are not arranged until the very morning, other events that disrupt the night's sleep are not held.  A plus to these advantages is the nearby wonderful parks and beaches. </p><h2>  Sea, weather in Kemer </h2><p>  If you are going to Turkey for a vacation, it does not hurt to know in advance what the weather is like.  This country is located in the Mediterranean, and the climate here is mostly warm, especially in Kemer.  The city grew on the seashore.  In summer, it slightly reduces heat, and in winter it helps to keep the air warmer.  Containing the flow of cold air and the Taurus Mountains, encircling Kemer from the north and covered with dense coniferous forests.  Therefore, in March during the daytime in sunny weather, the thermometer can give numbers above +20, but at night it is still very cool, often near zero, and the water temperature even on the coast is not higher than +16.  April is even warmer.  Even at night in Kemer, the air temperature does not drop below +9, but swimming in the sea is still cold.  But starting in May, the beach season can be opened, since the water by the end of the last spring month has time to warm up to +22.  The beach season lasts until mid-October.  The weather in Kemer in the summer is mostly hot, on some days the thermometer can fly up to the level of +40 and above, but the fresh sea breeze and the aromas of pine needles help not to notice such high temperatures. </p><p>  The hotel in relation to the sea is located quite convenient.  Although you need to go to the beach for a few minutes, but the guests' path does not tire, as it lies in a beautiful shady area.  The Britannia has no beach.  But its owners have an agreement with the Olympus Hotel, which has its own, and a very good stretch of coast.  In addition, tourists can relax on the city beaches.  The coating on most of them is pebbles of various fractions, but entry into the water is convenient.  Sun beds and umbrellas are everywhere paid, from 1 cu  for all day. </p><p>  A lot of beach lovers in Turkey prefer to go to Kemer in September.  The high season at this time has already been certified, so the prices for tours begin to fall significantly, and in hotels and on the beach there is not a large influx of people.  The weather in the first month of autumn is still excellent, there is almost no rain, the water in the sea is up to +24, and the air warms up to +30 and even higher.  Shopping lovers will especially enjoy their vacation in September, since at this time, prices for goods are reduced by 2-3 times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey inexpensively with children" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421171.jpg" width="526"></div>

    <h2>  Leisure at the hotel and beyond </h2><p>  In the "Britannia" guests can have a wonderful time at the pools, of which there are two - one large, the other smaller.  The hotel has a good spa, which offers a variety of face masks and massages.  In addition, there is a hammam.  All the pleasures are paid.  That, in principle, is all that you can do at Britannia.  I would like to note that the situation is the same in many hotels with only 3 stars. Turkey, Kemer, especially, are remembered by many tourists not for organizing leisure activities in the hotel, but for having fun and interesting time spent outside its walls.  So, the guests of ‚ÄúBritannia‚Äù have a lot of opportunities every day to have fun in one of the three best Turkish nightclubs, as they are all located on Deniz Cd., Which can be reached in a few minutes. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a road along which minibuses quite often go.  They can be used to quickly and cheaply get to the Geynuk canyon, <span>Takhtaly mountain</span> with a lift, Cirali beach with colorful sand, the ancient city of Fezalis, and Antalya is also very close.  So you can entertain yourself outside the walls of the hotel wonderful.  And those tourists who like others to take care of their leisure can buy excursion tours in multiple travel agencies located throughout Kemer.  If the departure for the excursion will be early, the hotel restaurant will either offer breakfast before the time set by the administration, or they will give food on the road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive holidays in Turkey" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1421302.jpg" width="512"></div>

    <h2>  Additional information about Britannia Hotel Villas 3 * (Kemer, Kemer Center) </h2><p>  The year of construction of this hotel is 1988, and the last time reconstruction was carried out here in 2009.  Over the past 7 years, the rooms are somewhat worn out and require at least cosmetic repairs.  Therefore, tourists who bought a tour here should be prepared for the fact that interruptions in the work of plumbing and electrical appliances can occur, but if this happens, everything is quickly fixed by the maintenance staff. </p><p>  The second feature of the hotel is the cleaning schedule, which is carried out every three days, and not necessarily before lunch. </p><p>  Officially check in at the hotel from 14-00, but if you have prepared rooms, check-in is carried out immediately upon arrival of tourists. </p><p>  This hotel is considered a budget.  Tour prices here are from 31,632 rubles for 6 nights, and last minute trips can be bought at a discount - from 28,000 rubles for 7 nights. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Hospitable Turkey gives all its guests a great vacation.  <span>Kemer, the sea</span> in which is perhaps the warmest in this region of the Mediterranean Sea, attracts a huge number of tourists every year.  Those of them who are not particularly whimsical and want to save money on living conditions in order to spend them on interesting excursions or something else, can be recommended to stay in a cozy hotel, more like a guesthouse and called in the Russian version of "Britannia".  Its advantages: </p><p>  - very convenient location with respect to all objects of urban infrastructure; </p><p>  - low prices for the tour; </p><p>  - delicious food in the restaurant; </p><p>  - the presence of clean and comfortable pools; </p><p>  - working throughout Wi-Fi; </p><p>  - relative peace and quiet reigning in the hotel; </p><p>  - friendly and welcoming staff; </p><p>  - Nice beaches within walking distance. </p><p>  Shortcomings noted in the reviews: </p><p>  - almost no territory; </p><p>  - the rooms require repair, hence the problems with appliances and plumbing; </p><p>  - poor-quality cleaning in the rooms; </p><p>  - lack of service for children; </p><p>  - All-inclusive meals are only three meals a day and only in a narrow period of time; </p><p>  - portioned distribution of dishes at the buffet. </p>
