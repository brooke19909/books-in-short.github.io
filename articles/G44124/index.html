Many buyers very often consider this option when selecting a new phone.  But is he really good?  In general, LG offers a decent, high-quality and durable technology.  But the phones are not as good as we would like.  Maybe the time has come when this moment is fixed with the LG Optimus G E975?  Let's try to understand this difficult question.  To do this, you will have to study the main characteristics of the model and the opinions of customers, as well as some experts.  Usually there are several basic criteria that help potential customers decide on the final choice. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg optimus g e975" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968314.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  For example, the first moment is the screen.  A modern telephone is not only a means of communication.  Often, this gadget is used for entertainment.  This requires a large space.  And the LG Optimus G E975 screen, according to many buyers, is quite a normal size.  It is 4.7 inches diagonal.  This is enough to play quite a few games, as well as comfortable reading books, watching videos and surfing the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The resolution of the LG Optimus G E975, reviews of which we have yet to fully explore, is also very good.  It is 1280 by 768 pixels.  Quite acceptable performance for a modern smartphone.  You can see a clear and bright picture that will not have the so-called broken pixels.  The LG Optimus G E975 display is also equipped with a special protective glass that prevents the device from quickly getting damaged.  The phone conveys over 16 million colors and shades.  Even in the most clear or cloudy weather, you can see a clear and rich picture on the display. </p><h2>  Dimensions and Weight </h2><p>  Many buyers also pay attention to the size of the device with its weight.  If you choose a model for an adult, then these indicators are not so critical.  But when buying a <span>phone for a child</span> or teenager (or for women with small hands), large sizes and heaviness can be a huge problem. </p><p>  And the LG Optimus G E975 has pretty overall specifications in this regard: 68.9 millimeters wide, 131.9 millimeters long and 8.44 millimeters thick.  Honestly, such a device is not very convenient to hold.  Yes, and wear, for example, in a pocket of trousers, too.  After all, LG Optimus is a rather overall and thick phone.  It weighs 145 grams.  In principle, when compared with other analogues, this is not so much.  In any case, you can feel that the smartphone <span>LG E975</span> Optimus G is always with you. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg optimus g e975 specifications" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968313.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Nevertheless, this model is still, according to some customers, is quite compact.  Especially when you compare it with Samsung.  Indeed, after such a phone, using the LG Optimus will be easy and simple.  So do not abandon the model because of the rather large dimensions.  Perhaps, in fact, it will be more than convenient for you. </p><h2>  System and processor </h2><p>  The LG Optimus G E975 specifications are on top.  And therefore it is worth paying attention to several key points.  For example, the operating system and processor.  Without these two points, you cannot imagine making a normal phone purchase.  Indeed, depending on them, you will be able (or not able) to run certain programs and applications.  And this is in most cases very important. </p><p>  Fortunately, the smartphone LG E975 Optimus G reviews gets quite positive in this sense.  After all, the operating system here, as in many modern models, is the Android familiar to everyone.  And the version is far from the latest - 4.4.  If necessary, you can use the special menu item to update it.  But as practice shows, buyers are not very keen to complete this process.  Indeed, on ‚ÄúAndroid 4.4‚Äù you can run a lot of useful applications and games. </p><p>  The processor at LG Optimus G is considered quite powerful.  It is quad-core with a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz.  On the one hand, it may seem that this is not enough.  But in practice it is clear that there is no point in buying a smartphone with 4-8 cores at 2.1 GHz.  This only "winds up" the price of the model.  But in fact, you will not need so much power at all.  It is also noted that AlG Optimus is very fast and stable.  And all this is due to the harmony of the operating system with the processor.  But just do not think that the proposed smartphone has no more advantages.  On the contrary, there are a lot of them.  And all of them are the main characteristics of the model.  So, now we will recognize them fully. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Operative memory </h2><p>  The next important point that you constantly have to consider is the phone‚Äôs RAM.  The thing is that it should be enough.  If this condition is not met, then even the <span>most powerful processor</span> will not be able to provide gadget performance.  Fortunately, the smartphone LG E975 Optimus G in this regard is a fairly powerful and modern device.  Although sometimes you can find more RAM. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lg optimus g e975 or iphone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968312.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The thing is that AlG Optimus has 2 GB of memory.  As practice shows, this is enough to work normally and quickly with the device.  Of course, some buyers will prefer models with 3-4 GB.  Just remember that the LG Optimus G E975, whose photos are presented to our attention, is not a gaming smartphone at all.  Rather, it is more suitable for the category of "universal."  And a lot of RAM on it should not be.  According to customers, 2 GB for Optimus is a pretty good indicator.  This amount is perfectly combined with the processor, which allows to increase the speed of the operating system.  This point is important for many users.  After all, any phone should work pretty quickly.  Otherwise, it will cease to be popular, and it will not be considered quality. </p><h2>  Built-in memory </h2><p>  Also, many buyers pay very much attention to such a characteristic as free space on the phone.  And we are talking about the so-called built-in memory.  She is responsible for how much data can be stored in the device.  In this regard, the LG E975 Optimus G, a review of which is presented to our attention, receives quite good reviews.  After all, there is more than enough memory here. </p><p>  The buyer will be offered 32 GB of free space for personal data.  As practice shows, in fact you will receive only 30 gigabytes.  The remaining volume is occupied by the operating system and phone resources.  But often this is more than enough.  30 GB of space is a lot.  Especially if you take into account the fact that we are not dealing with a gaming, but with a more versatile phone.  So, for several games and applications, as well as personal data, LG Optimus G offers a completely normal amount of free space.  But sometimes there are exceptions.  After all, the needs of all customers are different.  And often, "AlG Optimus" becomes a real gaming smartphone.  Then more space is needed. </p><p>  In this case, the situation cannot be corrected.  After all, a review of the LG Optimus G E975 smartphone always emphasizes one small nuance - you cannot insert an additional memory card into this phone.  So you have to somehow distribute the proposed 30 GB of space.  Note that you should not completely fill the space with data.  AlJ Optimus has a variety of system crashes and malfunctions after filling 29 GB of space with data.  This fact repels many buyers.  Yes, most smartphones have not recently supported memory cards.  But this does not mean that it is worth buying such a model.  You can always find a more universal analogue. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg e975 optimus g" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968311.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Of course, the camera became an important moment when choosing a modern phone.  If it is not, then it makes no sense to give money for a particular model.  Fortunately, in this sense, the LG Optimus G E975 is on top.  After all, he has as many as two types of cameras. </p><p>  The first is frontal.  It is located near the screen on the front panel.  Used for video calls and selfies.  Its quality, to be honest, is not particularly pleasing to customers.  "AlGi" offers only 1.3 megapixels.  This is pretty small.  Although enough for a virtual call.  True, if you take into account the price of the device, then you could offer a better quality of shooting. </p><p>  The second type of camera is the rear.  It is located on the rear panel.  And due to it we get good shots and videos.  In this regard, the LG Optimus is really good.  After all, the quality of shooting is 13 megapixels.  In addition, there is the possibility of capturing video in Full HD.  If you do not take into account how much space it will take, then buyers are satisfied with this feature.  In addition, at ‚ÄúAlG Optimus‚Äù pictures and videos will be obtained high-quality and clear due to autofocus, face and smile recognition, as well as flash.  So if you are looking for a phone that can easily replace a camera or a camera, then this is quite a worthy option. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  Not every buyer pays attention to the support of communication with a particular smartphone.  Although, this is a very important point.  The thing is that the LG Optimus G is almost a universal model in this regard.  After all, she offers a lot of types of communication. </p><p>  For example, you can easily use 2G and 3G networks.  In addition, if necessary, you can activate GPS and GPRS.  In general, these types of communications should be supported on all modern phones.  But AlG Optimus is a new generation smartphone.  So, it has some peculiarity.  And this is nothing more than support for a high-speed network called 4G.  This feature is available only for a small number of phones. </p><p>  In addition, LG Optimus G E975 allows you to use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth version 4.0.  This helps to quickly receive and transmit data wirelessly.  Also, the model is easily synchronized with a computer and other devices.  True, you can use only 1 SIM card in this smartphone.  But this is not such a big problem for modern buyers.  Many do not pay attention to the number of SIM cards available for use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lg optimus g e975" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968310.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Battery and runtime </h2><p>  It is important that the phone works for a long time.  To be honest, the smartphone LG E975 Optimus G reviews in this sense gets average.  This is not to say that this model works too little or poorly.  Rather, the flaw lies elsewhere. </p><p>  The thing is that the AlG Optimus has a non-removable battery.  And this is often not very convenient.  It's no secret that the phone‚Äôs battery is vulnerable.  So, sometimes you need to change it.  Without the help of professionals, LG Optimus G can not cope. </p><p>  But the rest of the smartphone pleases buyers.  For example, the battery capacity is 2100 mAh.  It allows you to lie down models in standby mode for about a month, with long conversations - 2 weeks.  In active use, you can only rely on 4 days of work without recharging.  And if you decide to see how much the AlJ Optimus G can work in ongoing negotiations, you will be pleasantly surprised.  Indeed, in this "state" the battery will be discharged already after 15 hours.  Most smartphones require recharging after 8 hours of conversation.  The difference is visible to the naked eye. </p><p>  In addition, the phone LG Optimus G E975 charges very quickly - about 1.5 hours.  In principle, not so long.  Many smartphones are quickly discharged, and replenish battery energy for a long time - from 2 hours or more.  So in this regard, buyers express their sympathy precisely LG Optimus G. </p><h2>  Does it require repair </h2><p>  Phones tend to break.  And in order not to have to choose a new smartphone, you have to give the old one for repair.  The better the model, the better the reviews about it.  And in this regard, LG Optimus G holds a pretty good position.  Buyers like that the problems in this model practically do not arise.  And some failures can be resolved without much work on their own. </p><p>  Repair LG E975 Optimus G is often needed only in relation to the panels.  After all, when they fall, they can break.  However, such cases are rare.  The screen of the smartphone is protected by a special glass called <span>Gorilla Glass</span> 2, which prevents the display from being scratched, cracked or damaged.  The case is also quite durable.  And this means that you have to try pretty hard to break it to such a state that you need a visit to the service center for mobile assistance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lg e975 optimus g reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968309.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  But most often problems occur in the operating system.  As a rule, after updating.  In this case, it may also be necessary to repair the AlG Optimus smartphone.  In order not to provoke crashes and malfunctions once again, users simply refuse to download the latest updates to the Android operating system.  In this case, the probability of repair due to system problems is almost zero. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, today we met with a smartphone such as the LG Optimus G E975.  And now a logical question arises as to whether it is worth paying attention to this model.  Of course, everyone decides for himself.  For example, based on your own requests for characteristics, as well as on the price. </p><p>  The price tag of "AlG Optimus G" is not so small - about 18,000 rubles.  But the characteristics are very attractive.  So if the budget allows, then you can safely buy this smartphone.  Otherwise, you will have to find cheaper and universal options.  Although for 18 thousand rubles you can now purchase a full-fledged gaming phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone review lg optimus g e97" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/968308.jpg" width="556"></div>

We can only say that lovers of new products from LG will really like this phone.  This is a very worthy model of the latest generation of smartphones.  Think what to buy - LG Optimus G E975 or iPhone?  Then it is better to give preference to "AlGi".  Cheaper and more practical. </p>
