After all, here travelers can relax on the seashore, enjoying all the benefits of modern civilization. </p><p>  Of course, on the coast there are a huge number of hotels of all sizes and categories.  And one of the good options for spending holidays is considered the hotel complex Island Beach Resort.  Of course, before booking, you need to try to collect the maximum amount of useful information.  So what does the hotel complex look like and can a traveler count on quality service? </p><h2>  Hotel complex Island Beach Resort (Corfu): location and information about the territory </h2>

    <p>  Of course, the location is an important point - each tourist has his own priorities here, because someone wants to live in the thick of events and city bustle, while other people prefer silence, peace and unity with nature.  Where will the travelers who chose the Island Beach Resort 3 * hotel complex have to live?  Corfu, the picturesque coast of the resort town of Kavos - this is where many tourists prefer to spend time.  There are only a few steps to the seashore, and there are many shops, bars, nightclubs and other entertainment venues nearby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, the distance to the island's capital, the city of Corfu, and, accordingly, to the airport is about 45 km.  Tours already include the cost of a convenient transfer, and you can get to the hotel after the flight quickly - in no more than 40 minutes. </p><p>  It should be said right away that Kavos is a lively town full of discos and night clubs.  That is why young people mainly gather here, lovers of fun and noisy parties. </p><p>  <span>Island Beach Resort</span> is a small <span>hotel</span> and is a traditional island-style building.  The territory is also small, but very cozy - there is a swimming pool, terraces, and places for outdoor activities.  By the way, the hotel opened not so long ago, namely in 2009. </p><h2>  What rooms will the tourist live in? </h2>

    <p>  This is a small but comfortable hotel - on its territory there are only 16 rooms.  What conditions should a tourist staying at the Island Beach Resort expect?  Superior and Deluxe are the categories of rooms offered by the hotel.  Reviews of former guests confirm that the rooms are bright and spacious, cleanliness and order are maintained here.  By the way, you will have at your disposal a private balcony with furniture, which offers a wonderful view of the sea, mountains and courtyard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not worry about technology - the necessary equipment is present here.  Here you can use air conditioning (in the summer heat it is difficult to do without it), a TV (for the most part English-speaking channels, but there are also several Russians), and a telephone.  Guests will also enjoy the fully equipped kitchen - there is a refrigerator, gas stove, microwave, kettle and, of course, dining and kitchen utensils. </p><p>  Tourists also find the bathroom clean and comfortable - there is no bathtub here, but you can always take a shower.  There is a toilet, washbasin, as well as a set of soaps, shampoos and towels. </p><h2>  Do travelers have food? </h2>

    <p>  Nutrition is an important aspect of travel, so consider this question in advance.  Immediately it is worth saying that the Island Beach Resort hotel does not provide such a service.  True, there is a bar in the hotel area - here visitors are offered cocktails, chilled soft drinks and spirits, as well as sandwiches and other light snacks. </p><p>  In this regard, do not worry.  Firstly, each room has its own kitchenette with the necessary utensils and appliances - tourists can cook on their own, because there are also grocery stores nearby.  Secondly, there is just a huge number of cafes, restaurants and traditional island taverns nearby - you can eat delicious food, and the prices are quite affordable. </p><h2>  Water activities and amenities on the beach </h2>

    <p>  Beaches and beautiful landscapes are just what Corfu is famous for.  As already mentioned, the Island Beach Resort 3 * hotel is located almost on the seashore, in a matter of minutes you will reach the beach.  It is worth saying that this is a public site, so from time to time there are many vacationers, including residents of the island.  In the reviews, travelers say that the coast here is very beautiful, the sea is calm, and the entrance is very convenient.  The rescue team works daily. </p><p>  For a few euros, guests can rent a sun lounger with an umbrella.  There is a bar on the beach where you can skip a glass or even have lunch.  And of course, tourists can count on outdoor activities - you can rent a canoe or a boat, pay for a boat trip, enjoy a vivid experience, riding a banana and water skiing, surf and scuba diving.  And often parties are organized right on the seashore. </p><h2>  Hotel Island Beach Resort Superior 3 *: amenities for guests </h2>
