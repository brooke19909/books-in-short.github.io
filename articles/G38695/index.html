Pros and cons, reviews about banks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The decrease in mortgage rates led to the fact that Russians began to apply more often for refinancing loans.  Banks do not satisfy these requests.  In July 2017, the average loan rate was 11%.  This is a new record in the history of the Central Bank.  Two years ago, mortgages were issued at 15%.  How do citizens achieve favorable credit conditions? </p><h2>  Essence </h2><p>  Refinancing is a program with which you can pay off an old loan by issuing a new loan.  The service is divided into two types: </p><ol><li>  Internal re-issuance of a loan under new conditions by drawing up an additional agreement. </li><li>  External reissuance - is obtaining a loan at another bank.  In this case, the client will have to go through the process of completing the contract.  The process involves the issuance of a new loan account and its provision in the presence of documents confirming ownership. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Is mortgage refinancing profitable? </h2><p>  It makes sense to deal with the renewal of the contract if the size of the regular payment is reduced or the rate is reduced.  For example, a client received a mortgage in the amount of 200 thousand dollars, which he must repay in 30 years.  The contract is serviced at 12% per annum.  The monthly payment will be $ 2,057. Is mortgage refinancing profitable if the loan rate drops to 9%?  Yes, this will allow the borrower to save $ 488 per month.  Over thirty years, savings will amount to 16 thousand dollars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Experts advise refinancing a mortgage if the interest rate drops by at least 2 pp. The average market rate on the market today is 10%.  Accordingly, it is more profitable to deal with the issue of refinancing to customers who issued a mortgage in 2015.  Then the average market rate was 12%.  Those who purchased housing just a year ago need to wait until rates are reduced to 9%. </p><p>  Is mortgage refinancing profitable if the agreement provided for annuity payments?  No, according to this settlement scheme, the first payments will be sent to pay off interest.  If more than half of the period has elapsed since the conclusion of the contract, then re-credited only will bring losses. </p><p>  You can check whether it is profitable to arrange mortgage refinancing at VTB Bank as follows: </p><ol><li>  You need to take the current payment repayment schedule and add up all the remaining payments under the contract. </li><li>  Next, you should enter the initial conditions in the loan calculator on the bank‚Äôs website: the period remaining under the current agreement, the calculated balance of the debt. </li><li>  The calculator will calculate the monthly payment amount. </li><li>  This amount should be multiplied by the number of months corresponding to the validity period of the new loan. </li><li>  It is necessary to compare the results.  If the difference is significant, then refinancing will be profitable. </li></ol>

If the application is approved, the borrower should be provided with documents for the property, certificates with the balance of the debt and the absence of restructuring, a letter with the details of the account from which the repayment is made. </p><h2>  Application preparation </h2><p>  As soon as the client receives the consent of the bank to renew the contract, the process begins.  The borrower will receive funds to repay the previous loan.  The property will be transferred as collateral to a new banking institution. </p><p>  The client should immediately prepare for the additional costs.  If the insurance company is not an accredited partner of the bank, then it will have to be replaced.  Otherwise, the lending rate will increase.  At Sberbank, a refusal to provide life crediting will be offset by an increase in the rate by 1 pp, at Absolut Bank and even more - 4 pp </p><p>  If the insurance was issued at the conclusion of the contract with the first bank, then in the document you just need to change the beneficiary.  Also, during the period of execution of a new contract (until the old one is paid off), an overstated rate (1-2 pp) on life insurance is charged.  It lasts no more than a month. </p><h2>  What is going on in the market? </h2><p>  Sberbank lowered the mortgage refinancing rate to a historical level in two hundred <span>residential complexes.</span>  Housing in a new building can be purchased at 7.4-10% per annum, in the secondary market - at 9-10%.

    <h2>  Problem </h2><p>  Is mortgage refinancing profitable for credit institutions?  In most cases, no.  Amid falling market rates, banks seek to maintain interest income, which is of great importance in an unstable system.  Therefore, they refuse to change lending conditions.  Clients are not even given formal reasons for rejection. </p><p>  By law, the borrower has the right to refinance the loan, if the contract does not contain a direct ban on this transaction.  However, today banks are increasingly including this item in the contract.  This has already attracted the attention of the regulator. </p><p>  Customers have the only chance to change the decision of the bank.  It is necessary to provide a letter of guarantee or a preliminary contract from another credit institution, under the terms of which the bank is obligated to prematurely close the loan and issue a new mortgage to the borrower under the same conditions, but at a reduced interest rate.  In this case, the lender will meet the client, because early repayment of the contract will greatly reduce its interest income.  The transaction will become unprofitable. </p><h2>  Is mortgage refinancing profitable: cons </h2><p>  It is almost impossible to achieve a revision of the terms of the contract if part of the debt was paid by maternity capital, the property is made into shared ownership of parents and minors.  To realize such an object is very difficult. </p>

    <p>  The revision of the terms of the contract may affect the requirements of the Bank of Russia.  According to the regulatory standards, a financial institution must form a reserve for each loan issued.  This entails a freeze of funds and may affect compliance. </p><p>  Is it beneficial to do mortgage refinancing?  Not always, because you will have to pay money for the procedure for re-issuing documents.  The first payments on the new loan will be used to repay reduced interest.  And finally, the main drawback is that the borrower will lose tax benefits.  In the case of refinancing, a loan agreement secured by real estate is no longer issued as a mortgage.  Therefore, borrowers lose tax deductions. </p><p>  When is it profitable to do mortgage refinancing?  Such an operation is economically justified only in one case: if the new creditor has a rate of at least 2 pp lower than the previous one.  Therefore, there are so many who want to receive refinancing. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The cost of the loan issue is of great importance.  Is mortgage refinancing profitable?  Customer reviews confirm that no renewal fee is charged.  However, the original bank may take money for issuing each of the certificates.  The average cost of such documents is 1 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The borrower will have to pay for notarization of the transaction and services of the appraisal company on his own.  The cost of processing the first document is 1.5-2 thousand rubles, and the second - 4 thousand rubles.  Only after completing all the documents the encumbrance is removed and it is registered under the new agreement in the Regpalat. </p>

    <h2>  Other types of refinancing </h2><p>  Re-lending is provided not only on a mortgage, but also on a credit card, cash loan or car loan.  The fastest way is consumer loans, and the longest - mortgages.  Collateral must be re-registered and insurance dealt with.  In general, the advantage of the service is that a new loan is issued on more favorable terms, and the monthly payment is reduced.  The borrower can even change the currency. </p><p>  The service mechanism is very simple.  The bank transfers funds to the account from which the debt was debited.  The borrower needs to make an early repayment in the first bank and this should be done before the deadline for making a new payment. </p><p>  Typically, the first two months, the loan rate at a new bank increases.  However, another scheme may apply.  40-50 days are allocated for the repayment period of old loans.  After this period, the rate increases.  So, for example, they act in Alfa-Bank.  When refinancing a loan, the owner of the salary card is served at a preferential 11.99%.  He can draw up a new contract for 7 years and refinance debt in the amount of 3 million rubles.  For non-payroll customers, the limit is reduced to 2 million rubles. </p><h2>  Market situation </h2><p>  Refinancing is one of the key services of the bank.  Therefore, serious competition has formed in the market.  Some financial institutions provide online services.  Alfa-Bank customers just need to fill out a questionnaire through the Internet bank and receive answers to all questions in the chat. </p><p>  For preliminary calculations, online calculators are placed on the sites.  When re-applying for a loan, you can increase the loan amount and receive a cash balance.  Clients can pay off debts through online banking. </p>

    <p>  Permission from a financial institution to conduct an operation is not required.  Banks are reluctant to accept the decision of customers to be serviced at other credit institutions.  Nobody wants to lose profitable customers. </p><p>  Banks themselves offer this service primarily to legal entities in order to obtain a client for comprehensive servicing and not only on a <span>loan program.</span>  Individuals are more often credited on consumer loans.  Re-issuance of secured loans is extremely rare. </p>
