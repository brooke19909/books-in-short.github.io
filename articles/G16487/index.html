    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  The location of the shooting must be planned in advance, which directly depends on the time of year.  Each season has its own special charms and charm.  For example, if in the autumn or summer you can create a unique picture in the forest, then in winter it seems difficult because of the large amount of snow and the difficult movement along the forest paths.  However, it is in winter that it is possible to take excellent photographs on the ice of frozen rivers and lakes, which is impossible to achieve in the summer.  The place of work can be absolutely any place, including parks in which trees, fields, seas, lakes and mountains bloom. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Thanks to natural whiteness, snow is able to hide all the flaws of the area, masking dirt, dust and debris.  The winter photo shoot makes it possible to create vivid images that include frames where the characters are wallowing in the snow, throwing themselves at it and eating icicles.  In spring, blooming greens and flowers allow you to create rich and fresh photos.  Make memorable pictures against the backdrop of the sea or other body of water allows a photo shoot in nature in the summer.  Poses and pictures on the beach are always unique and special.  Rain and red-yellow <span>colors of autumn</span> give photographs a special genre and zest, allowing the author to create an unusually beautiful plot.  Photos amid thunderstorms and sparkling lightning mesmerize your eyes and are remembered for their enchanting nature.  It is necessary to focus on nature and choose the right posture.  Photoshoot of pregnant women in nature is an excellent opportunity for solitude and relaxation with the whole family.  And as a result, you will get unique pictures. </p><h2>  What to wear for a photo shoot? </h2><p>  First you need to think through the images and poses for a photo shoot in nature.  Emphasis should be on the costumes and clothing in which the shooting will take place.  Depending on the season, you can use a lot of things and clothes in the wardrobe.

    <h2>  How to pose in the frame? </h2><p>  Regardless of the fact that the poses for a photo shoot in nature vary from the place and purpose of shooting, clothes, souvenirs and moods, the rules for posing poses remain unchanged. </p><ol><li>  Stoop and humpback should be avoided.  This can be achieved by placing one leg so that it supports the spine. </li><li>  All postures should be comfortable. </li><li>  Shoulders and shoes should not point in one direction.  This will lead to the addition of extra visual kilograms in the frame. </li><li>  In the process of posing, asymmetry should be observed.  For example, if one leg is straight, the other needs to be slightly bent, thereby creating the effect of relaxation and comfort. </li><li>  Relaxation and calm during posing is the key to a successful and effective shot. </li><li>  If you need to take a picture in which hands will be near the face, make sure that fingers are free of tension. </li></ol><p>  Natural situations include basic posture for a photo shoot.  Freedom, lightness and naturalness are the main keys to creating a successful photo. </p><h2>  Posing on the background of nature </h2>

    <p>  The process of constructing a <span>frame composition</span> in nature begins with the choice of location.  There are many variations in positions and settings that express the mood, character and behavior of the model.  There are both simple poses for a photo shoot in nature, and complex, including various performances, tricks and special effects. </p><p>  Successful to convey the beauty of the surrounding nature is a standing pose.  Here, the main emphasis is on scenery, sprawling trees and river spills.  The characters are given a secondary role, for example, nature occupies 70% of the frame, and the model, located in the center or side, fills with itself only 30%. </p><p>  If you plan to take a picture on a winter field or in a forest strewn with autumn leaves, and you need to convey a state of sadness or sadness - the best position would be a half turn to the photographer and hands folded on his chest.  You can tilt your face to your chest, open your eyes and look down or just above the horizon. </p><p>  The position, when the model is standing near some object, allows you to achieve ease.  The technique is simple: you need to rely on a standing object, which can be played by trees, poles or rocks.  In this case, the legs are crossed, one hand lies on the hip, the other is relaxed.  In summer and spring, emotions are positive and pronounced.  In this case, pictures with grass, greens and flowers are good.  For example, you can sit comfortably on the field, take grass with you so that it does not cover the model, and pick up an armful of wildflowers.  A woven wreath and a gentle smile in such a picture will not leave indifferent any connoisseur of the photo. </p><p>  In the case when it is necessary to focus on the person, portraiture poses are most often used.  Be sure to slightly look away or raise your head up, and not look directly into the lens.  A pose with a slight inclination forward always visually makes the figure softer and more slender.  Sitting, hands can be folded on your knees, and hair tilted back to one side.  There is also a way to create a frame from behind - the head and waist are half a turn from the photographer.  A look directed into the distance will give an image of mystery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="basic poses for a photo shoot" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/514388.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>How to avoid</span> posing <span>errors</span> ? </h2><p>  Choosing poses for a photo shoot in nature, you need to make sure that they are simple and easy to perform.  To avoid shadows, the sun shining brightly on an open space should be behind.  Often the smiles in the frame look taut and artificial.  To avoid this, models must remember the happy and joyful moments of life.  This technique allows you to create a sincere and unrealistic joy.  These tips will help to avoid a lot of unforeseen situations and damaged personnel. </p><p>  Summing up, it is worth noting that shooting in nature is a storehouse of ideas and new images.  The main thing is the right choice of place and posture for the photo. </p>
