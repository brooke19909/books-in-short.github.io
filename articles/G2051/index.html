  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pyramids in China - the mysteries of mankind</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The pyramids of China</span> to this day remain a mystery to humanity.  No one has yet been able to solve their riddle.  The whole world learned about the existence of these pyramids relatively recently.  Only in the middle of the 20th century, photographs of this miracle were taken from space.  It was then that mankind learned that the pyramids in China exist.  Even today, these treasures of world culture are strictly protected by the government of this country. </p><p>  However, the pyramids in China are of great interest to many scientists and archaeologists.  According to the legend existing in this country, the pyramids are the creation of alien creatures who visited the earth.  Nobody knows the exact age of these unique structures.  The first information about them was discovered more than five thousand years ago.  Therefore, their age remains a mystery.  Even the ancient emperors of China, called them "the creations of the sons of heaven." </p><p>  In China, about a hundred pyramids were discovered.  At the moment, the state of some pyramids leaves much to be desired.  The fact is that they are made of clay and earth.  The peasants use this material in their subsidiary plots and in the fields.  Naturally, they gradually sorted out these creations of world architecture.  The pyramids in China remained completely unexplored.  The government is not very willing to give permission to conduct excavations.  But still, some information was released. </p><p>  It is known that the pyramids in China have a height of 25 to 100 meters.  The exception is the Great White Pyramid.  She is truly huge.  Its height is approximately 300 meters.  It can be considered the most important among all the pyramids.  But recently, it has been banned from visiting the locations of this pyramid, since the Chinese government is building a launch pad for <span>launching rockets there.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  China is a great country, full of mysterious and unknown.  Its amazing landscape suggests the presence of the mysteries of history and antiquity.  Many masterpieces of architecture, which still amaze with their beauty, are created by human hands.  So, for example, Mount Tigris, created by people and is a beautiful and huge earthen mound.  It symbolizes the masculine and feminine.  Perhaps in Europe such symbols would not be given much significance, but in China they are credited with a special meaning. </p><p>  The presence in China of pyramids that are larger in size than the famous pyramids in Egypt is not accidental.  The fact that there is a ban on a thorough study of these structures also makes sense.  One of the official versions of the ban is the reluctance of Chinese scientists to change the concept of humanity about life on earth. </p><p>  Not many scientists, but rather rather units, managed to touch this riddle.  Archaeologist Hartwig Hausdorf is the only foreigner who has visited the valley where the famous pyramids are located.  But he was not allowed to conduct research.  The location of the pyramids in China testifies to the knowledge of the ancient inhabitants in the fields of astronomy, mathematics and geometry.  It corresponds to all the canons of Feng Shui.  Perhaps someday our descendants will solve the riddle of the pyramids in China.  So far, the information collected about them is not sufficient to judge their origin and structure. </p><p>  The remains of <span>ancient civilizations are</span> found in different parts of our planet.  Many speculations have been advanced regarding Atlantis.  In connection with the research of the ancient Vostok Lake, located in Antarctica, many scientists spoke about the possible location of Atlantis on this continent.  They believe that it was not always covered by glaciers.  Perhaps the ancient civilization was located there, and soon they will find the pyramids in Antarctica, belonging to that time.  Mankind will have to make many more discoveries that may become a sensation. </p>
