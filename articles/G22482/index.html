Walks in St. Petersburg</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In a series of endless everyday life, we often cease to feel the fullness of life, its colors lose their color, become faded and dull.  Home-work-supermarket-home.  For most of us, this route has become familiar and permanent.  But relaxation often has no place in our lives.  We cut out too little time on it.  We are waiting for the vacation, then to come off to the fullest.  But after paraphrasing the words of a famous classic, we can say with confidence: "There is always a place for rest in life."  Are you ready to argue with the truth of this statement?  And completely in vain.  Try to rush to St. Petersburg for the weekend - and your opinion will change dramatically. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to go on a weekend in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/783381.jpg" width="375"></div>  And if you live in this wonderful city, then just look at it with different eyes - the eyes of a curious tourist.

    <h2>  What is attractive vacation in St. Petersburg? </h2><p>  Many of the Russians have long had time to get acquainted with Turkey and its luxurious bazaars, which have absorbed the spicy aroma of spices and incense, learned to dance flamenco while traveling in fiery Spain, even tried to conquer Kilimanjaro and explore almost all the lagoons in the Maldives.  But in Peter, alas, they did not bother to get out.  Why?  But because this is Russia, everything is familiar and familiar here, and I want to spend the long-awaited vacation on visiting something exotic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is some logic and common sense in this.  Then why not spend the weekend in St. Petersburg?  Yes, during this time it will not be possible to thoroughly explore the city.  However, a lifetime will not be enough to solve all his secrets.  But a change of scenery, a full baggage of new experiences, <span>positive emotions are</span> provided to you.  After all, a vacation in St. Petersburg promises exoticism, magnetism, a conversation in the same language with the past, and an introduction to the beautiful, and a powerful drive.  Do not believe?  Then buy tickets to Northern Venice (that is how the old woman Europe calls this city in recent years) and see for yourself. </p><h2>  You have one hundred forks, one hundred roads ... </h2><p>  Have you already collected the necessary luggage and are going to meet with the cultural capital of Russia?  That's just the question tormenting you: "Where to go on a weekend in St. Petersburg?"  Do not despair, it torments not only you, many Petersburgers also often ask them. </p><p>  The main thing here is to first decide what you would like to do in the first place, and then the cultural program will become obvious. </p><h2>  Aesthetes note </h2><p>  Art ... How much such a short and familiar word contains ... It‚Äôs especially acutely understood in St. Petersburg.  After all, here you are waiting for: </p><ul><li>  Hermitage.  A museum that occupies a worthy place among its western counterparts.  For example, the British or the Louvre.  Knowledgeable people say: if you look at every exhibit at least a minute, it will take up to 8 years.  Everything conquers here: picturesque canvases and sculptures, numismatics and porcelain, the Jordanian staircase and the Malachite hall. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Tsarskoye Selo.  Today it has a different name - the city of Pushkin.  It was here, in the spacious halls of the Lyceum, that the one whom we were talking about with pride and aspiration once said: "This is our everything." </li></ul><h2>  Romantic weekend </h2><p>  Are you in love, happy, and decided to rush into the city of <span>white nights this</span> weekend?  Great choice!  After all, Peter is rightfully considered a city of love.  Even ordinary walks in St. Petersburg will charge you with a positive and give you a <span>romantic mood.</span>  This is a place where every street is saturated with a special aura.  Even the usual knock of heels on the pavement sounds music for happy couples, and the narrow courtyards-wells seem to be a paradise in a hut where you can hide from prying eyes. </p><p>  Where to go on weekend in St. Petersburg for lovers?  Both locals and visiting couples will be interested to visit: </p><ul><li>  Kisses the bridge.  All lovers seek to get here.  They say a kiss on this bridge connects people forever.  Historians and linguists are trying to dispel all the myths associated with this name, stubbornly insisting on the version that the bridge is named after the merchant Potseluev, who lived near him and had a restaurant there.  But is it worth paying attention to them if you feel good together ?!  Follow the ancient tradition, and let it become one more strong union. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Elaginsky island.  For some time, the previously unattractive island has attracted more and more visitors.  There, near the Elaginsky bridge, a monument recently appeared - 2 hearts on stilts.  Many argue that soon this place will become a new attraction of the city and will fit into all excursion programs.  This is how the ordinary turns into the eternal. </li></ul><h2>  Children is our future </h2><p>  But do you want to walk around the amazing city with the whole family?  Where to go on a weekend in St. Petersburg with children?  There are many options.  You can choose: </p><ul><li>  Any of the city parks - Tauride or Alexander Gardens, Yekaterinhof Park.  Each of them has playgrounds.  Why not visit Divo Ostrov?  The variety of rides is simply breathtaking. </li><li>  Acquaintance with land and sea inhabitants.  Leningrad Zoo and Dolphinarium at your service.  But if you want to meet the inhabitants of the underwater depths, it is better to head to the Oceanarium. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Walks in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Walking along the streets of Peter's glorious creation means greeting hand in hand with a unique city that you usually fall in love with at first sight and forever. </p><p>  Choose for yourself what you prefer: </p><ul><li>  A walk along Nevsky Prospekt is the heart of St. Petersburg.  It is unlikely that Kazan Cathedral or <span>Anichkov Bridge, the</span> Lutheran Church and the graceful spire of the Admiralty will leave you indifferent - the very needle pointing upward. </li><li>  Cruise on the Neva River.  Those who do not like hiking can ride on the city‚Äôs waterway.  This can be done on water buses or motor ships.  Admire the friendly community of bridges, appreciate the Peter and Paul Fortress, Kronstadt, and other attractions from the side of the river. </li></ul><h2>  Peter's nightlife </h2><p>  The weekend is the best time to have fun until the morning.  And in St. Petersburg, it is doubly pleasant and tempting, because the <span>nightlife</span> in the city is in full swing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weekend in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12993/783386.jpg" width="392"></div>  At your service:
