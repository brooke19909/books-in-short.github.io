  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to tie a knot on a thread with a needle. Types of Nodules</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Hand sewing has been minimized by the latest technology in the manufacture of sewing machines.  But sometimes there are such cases in which it is simply impossible to do without it - joining parts with a blind seam, sweeping away pieces of fabric, stitching in places that are inconvenient for processing with a machine;  decorative decoration and much more.  Both temporary and permanent can be hand seams. </p><p>  On the finished product remain constant.  They are used at the final stages of sewing clothes - from invisible joints on the front side of the seam sections to the bonding of the ends of the gum to complete the hemming of the product.  Temporary ones include basting and copy stitches (snitches), which should be removed after completion of the product. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rgbstock.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blue threads" class="if uuid-2871813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2871813.jpg"></div><h2>  Thread fastening </h2><p>  Before starting sewing, it is important to know how to tie a knot on a thread with a needle in order to properly fix the ends, otherwise all the work will go down the drain.  At the end of the seam you need to do the same, especially if it is permanent.  The basting should also be fixed firmly if the product is repeatedly tried on.  At permanent seams, the reinforcing stitches should be small, they are laid from the inside. </p><h2>  How to tie a knot on a thread with a needle correctly </h2><p>  It is worth figuring out how to tie a temporary knot when laying a basting so that it can then be easily untied. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  The thread for sewing is threaded into the needle.  At the end, you need to form a simple loop.  To do this, two threads are folded together, while the short one is located behind the loop. </li><li>  A short thread must be pulled through the loop, and a second one will be formed.  But you need to do this so that the end of the short thread does not slip there.  Holding the ends of the threads and a new loop, tighten the knot.  In order to pull the thread, you should pull on the short end, the knot will thus be untied. </li></ol><h2>  Rolled up bundle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="metaphysicalquilter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="black and white image" class="if uuid-2871815" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2871815.jpg"></div><p>  This is another way to tie a knot on a thread with a needle.  To do this, wrap a thread around the finger to make a loop.  Then, as if rolling, it is necessary to remove the loop from the finger and, holding it between two fingers, pull the long end of the thread, the bundle will thereby be formed. </p><h2>  Fastening the thread with a knot and stitch back </h2><p>  To begin with, a knot is knitted, then the needle is stuck into the tissue and removed from the knot in three millimeters.  Then again the thread is stuck near the knot and the stitch is made back.  Further sewing continues as needed. </p><h2>  Double stitch back </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="skein of thread" class="if uuid-2871822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102644/2871822.jpg"></div><p>  If the seam starts with a double stitch back, it will be smoother and stronger than in the case of a simple knot.  The needle is stuck into the fabric and the thread is removed, but in such a way that it remains in the fabric.  Then a stitch is made back three millimeters and the thread is displayed in the place where the first needle was inserted.  The stitch is repeated, and then everything is sewn as usual. </p><h2>  Reinforcement stitches </h2><p>  To make the completion of the permanent seam durable, a few stitches are made through a few threads in the opposite direction, but so that a small loop remains.  In the same place, another stitch is made and the needle is pulled through the loop of the first stitch.  Tightened on. </p><p>  So, we figured out how to tie a knot on a thread with a needle.  For a beginning seamstress, this issue is very important, since correct and high-quality sewing begins with the basics. </p>
