    <h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  The first mention of these lands dates back to 1500. Then they belonged to the Orekhovsky district, according to the salary census book of Vodskaya Pyatina.  But as a geographical object, the Bugras took shape recently, at the beginning of the nineteenth century. </p><p>  The toponym "Bugry" is associated with the relief features of the area - here the transition to the elevation of the Karelian Isthmus is very clearly manifested.  The estate was located on a hill surrounded by marshy and woodland. </p><p>  In the 30s.  of the last century, the People‚Äôs Commissariat decided to create the ‚ÄúBugry‚Äù collective farm, after which the construction of 2- and 3-story wooden houses, as well as six barracks, begins.  Here they are engaged in the cultivation of fruits and vegetables, expanding a livestock farm and apiary.  Since 1934, the collective farm was renamed the state farm. </p><h2>  Bugry village: transport accessibility </h2><p>  At the intersection of the Ring Road and Kultury Avenue, the village borders on St. Petersburg.  If someone who is going to go to the village of Bugry, the map will be interesting, then we can say that in this place there is a good transport interchange.  Another, larger intersection with the Ring Road, is located to the north - at the meeting point with Engels Ave. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the vicinity there are several metro stations: in Murino, on the territory of the northern capital - "Prospect of Enlightenment", "Civil Prospect", as well as "Parnas", which distinguishes Bugry (Leningrad region).  A map of the area will help you get to the desired point.  The stations can be reached by public transport (the journey takes about fifteen minutes).  Buses and minibuses go here, since the Ring Road passes near the village.  A free bus runs to Auchan store from Bugrov, which is often used by residents. </p><h2>  Bugry, Leningrad region: shopping in the village </h2><p>  There are no shopping problems: near the Ring Road there is Auchan hypermarket, and the Mega-Parnas shopping center is located at the intersection with Engels Ave.  In the village there are small convenience stores with a mandatory set of manufactured goods and products.  It is worth noting that with infrastructure the situation is the same as in rapidly developing neighboring areas: one school, while there is not enough for everyone who wants it.  Consequently, some of the students take the school bus daily to the New Devyatkino, where a new educational institution appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="n hillocks Leningrad region" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/464308.jpg" width="377"></div>

So, there is only one outpatient clinic. </p><p>  The convenient location of the village of Bugry (Leningrad region) almost on the border of St. Petersburg and the region attracts a huge number of real estate buyers.  From this place it is easy to get to the center, the infrastructure is developing very quickly, all conditions for comfortable living are created.  It is surprising that even though the village can be called part of St. Petersburg, the cost of housing here is much lower than in the city.  At the moment, buying real estate under construction here is a great opportunity to profitably invest your money. </p><h2>  The road to St. Petersburg </h2><p>  To get to St. Petersburg, just go to the ring road, passing just a kilometer from this village.  By shuttle buses and regular buses, which run quite often in Bugry (Leningrad Oblast), you can get to Prospekt Prosvescheniya station in ten minutes.  From here, you can get to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city without any problems.  In addition, it is easy to drive your own car to the regional center.  The proximity of the Ring Road makes the village, one might say, an ideal place of residence if you plan to live here and work at some of St. Petersburg's enterprises. </p>

    <h2>  Buying Property in Bugra </h2><p>  At the moment, the <span>social infrastructure of the</span> village is still not very well developed.  Although, as already mentioned, construction is being carried out at a rapid pace, and by the time the housing complex or house is commissioned, everything necessary already appears next to it - pharmacies, shops, hospitals, kindergartens and schools. </p><p>  The main advantage of new buildings is considered to be excellent opportunities for a good rest in the village of Bugry (Leningrad region).  The area near each building under construction includes park areas that are designed for children and adults.  In addition, the famous ski resorts ‚ÄúIgora‚Äù, ‚ÄúOkhta-park‚Äù, ‚ÄúNorthern Slope‚Äù are located near the village. </p><p>  The settlement of Bugry is perfect for permanent comfortable living.  Therefore, buying an apartment here is a great solution for everyone who is looking for high-quality and inexpensive modern housing near St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hillocks Leningrad region map" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/465612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Metro Expansion </h2><p>  It is worth noting that soon the road from the house in Bugra to the northern capital will become more accessible and convenient.  So, the city authorities are supposed to improve <span>transport infrastructure</span> in order to connect the metropolis and the developing suburbs.  Light rail trams and a subway should appear here.  It is planned that the development of transport may entail an increase in the volume of construction in the village of Bugry, Leningrad Region.  The most anticipated event in the field of regional transport will be, without a doubt, the opening of a metro station. </p>

    <h2>  The emergence of a new mode of transport - light rail </h2><p>  In addition to the appearance of the subway, the village of Bugry (Leningrad Region) and the nearest settlements are waiting for another innovation.  These are light rail trams.  So, the management plans to open new lines of transport: from Sertolovo to Suzdal, from Kolpino to the Rybatskoye station, from Vsevolozhsk to <span>Ladoga station.</span>  Kolpino and Rybatskoye will tentatively be connected <span>by tram routes</span> this year.  On Vsevolozhsk the route will pass along the avenues of Mentors, Kosygin, Irinovsky.  At the same time, new lines will already be laid to Vsevolozhsk from the latter. </p><p>  Infrastructure development, expansion of exit methods at the borders of St. Petersburg, of course, will contribute to the intensive development of the region.  At the same time, new ways of communication will greatly facilitate the life of a huge number of people.  The road from work home will be made more affordable and comfortable.  The village will develop along with the big city. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bugry village map" class="if" height="237" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2647/466126.jpg" width="270"></div>
