This can be done using both wired technologies (for example, HDMI or USB), and wireless (Wi-Fi, DLNA, Bluetooth).  This article will discuss Wireless Display technology and how to "connect" the aforementioned devices using this function. </p><h2>  WiDi Xiaomi - what is it? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, Xiaomi did not integrate support for MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link), video output via wire, into its devices.  So, using the USB Type-C to HDMI adapter or Micro USB to HDMI adapter, you won‚Äôt achieve anything: you will have to be content with other methods to output multimedia content from your phone to your TV.  It‚Äôs inconvenient to constantly watch full-length films on a six-inch screen.  One of the ways to comfortably connect your smartphone to a TV is WiDi (Wireless Display) technology.  Translated into Russian, this expression means "wireless display". </p><p>  Since 2006, many popular equipment manufacturers have been thinking about wireless audio and video transmission.  At Intel, it seems, it turned out better than the others to implement this function: in 2010, according to one edition, WiDi was called "the most breakthrough technology." </p><h2>  Technology work </h2><p>  How does Xiaomi WiDi work?  For data transfer, Intel‚Äôs built-in Wi-Fi adapter with 802.11n support is used.  The original photos / videos are compressed and transmitted by the graphics chipset.  On the TV or computer side, the signal is received and processed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Connection requirements </h2><p>  Most modern Xiaomi devices support this technology for exchanging data from a smartphone to a PC.  Using WiDi, it is possible to broadcast from the screen of a mobile device to a TV or laptop.  Different media content is synchronized: pictures, films, games and so on.  The huge advantage of Wireless Display is the ability to transfer 1080p video (Full HD) and surround sound (Dolby 5.1) between paired devices.  Unlike DLNA technology, WiDi not only transfers multimedia content, but also provides the ability to duplicate the main screen.  Starting with Wireless Display 3.5, there is support for Miracast (in Russian, mirror means "mirror image", and cast - "broadcast"), which allows you to duplicate any video, for example, the person you are talking to on Skype, to the TV and computer screens.  Miracast is based on Wi-Fi Direct.  That is, the devices do not need a separate access point to communicate with each other.  The developer of this technology is Intel Holding, as a result of which there are some conditions for using this function.  The requirements are as follows: </p><ul><li>  A computer with an Intel processor and Intel HD Graphics.  The network card must also support WiDi technology. </li><li>  A smartphone or tablet with a RockChip chip.  Of course, you need support for <span>Wireless Display</span> and Android 4.2+. </li><li>  TV with Intel WiDi support. </li></ul><p>  If the TV is old and does not support this function, then you need a wireless external Wi-Fi adapter that can be connected via HDMI.  So, software requirements are not the easiest.  And if our TV does not have a built-in Wi-Fi receiver, you will need to "shell out" and buy additional items to connect - a console or adapter.  Moreover, it is desirable that the TV supports the Smart TV function.  That is, it should be acquired not so long ago (the technology of "Smart Television" began to be introduced approximately since 2008).  Then the likelihood of a connection increases significantly.  How to use Xiaomi WiDi?  Since the connection is wireless, understanding the principle of connection is not difficult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  WiDi Xiaomi.  How to use this technology? </h2><p>  On the desktop, select "Settings" - "Wireless Networks" - "Advanced Features" (or "More").  There we will find the ‚ÄúWireless Display‚Äù option (Wi-Fi display) we need. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is the function located on Xiaomi" class="if uuid-3091150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3091150.jpg"></div><p>  It remains only to click on the checkmark, activating this function.  If there is no such option in the settings, then, unfortunately, your device does not support such technology. </p><h2>  WiDi Xiaomi.  How to connect to a computer? </h2><p>  It should be noted that, in addition to the above requirements, there is one more thing: to connect both devices must work from the same Wi-Fi network.  So, on the smartphone, the function is turned on.  How to use Xiaomi WiDi when connecting the phone to a PC?  This technology will work on computers of Windows 7 version and higher (for users of version 7 and 8 of Windows, a special program is required, as shown in the photo below). </p><div class="photo" data-original="mi-box.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="WiDi when connected to a computer" class="if uuid-3091201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3091201.jpg"></div><p>  On the computer in the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù you need to find the section ‚ÄúWireless Networks‚Äù - in it you will need to enable Wi-Fi Direct or WiDi Miracast (depending on which version of Windows is installed on the PC).  After pairing the devices on the computer, the display from the phone should appear.  How to connect a smartphone to a TV using this technology? </p><h2>  Connecting a smartphone to a TV </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mi-box.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Connect xiaomi to TV" class="if uuid-3091185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3091185.jpg"></div><p>  How to use Xiaomi WiDi to connect to a TV?  If this function is enabled on a mobile device, then in the Settings on the TV, you need to pay attention to the name of the Intel's WiDi section. </p><div class="photo" data-original="miwiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="When connected to a TV" class="if uuid-3091160" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3091160.jpg"></div><p>  Below is the name and model of the device.  Then you need to "tap" on the box, activating a checkmark.  After that, you just need to confirm the pairing on the TV and phone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="miwiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Wireless Display" class="if uuid-3091161" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49229/3091161.jpg"></div><p>  If the connection is successful, the name and model of the equipment used to exchange the files will be displayed in the Xiaomi menu.  Now you can watch photos and movies on TV, play toys and so on. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs clear what Xiaomi WiDi is and how to connect a smartphone to the TV.  Wired technologies take precedence over wireless technologies by minimizing (or even not having) glitches and brakes.  After all, Wi-Fi connection technologies can still slow down due to unstable speed on the Web, weather and any other mechanical problems.  There may be slight delays during signal transmission, as well as image distortion.  But connecting without wires is much more convenient: you do not need to take them with you on the road, and you do not need to look every time where the socket of the connector is located in the device.  Yes, the purchase of an HDMI cable will cost much less than the purchase of a set-top box or adapter.  But for Xiaomi device users, there are practically no options for connecting a phone to a TV, except for using WiDi technology. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Wireless Display offers a cool thing, not only to play audio and video on a TV or computer, but also to duplicate what is happening on the screen, to have, so to speak, a second monitor.  One of the positive elements of this technology is its easy connection.  But the conditions for the software are tough, and if you decide to use this feature on your smartphone, be sure to check if the device meets the technical requirements for connecting to WiDi when buying new equipment. </p>
