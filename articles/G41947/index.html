Its history goes back over 300 years.  The current appearance of the garden was laid back in the 19th century. </p><p>  The greenhouse has many unique plants from around the world.  The Botanical Museum, the only one in the country, stores herbariums and collections that have been collected and brought here by famous travel scientists. </p><h2>  History of the creation and development of the Botanical Garden </h2><p>  The Botanical Garden was founded on February 11, 1713 by Peter I. At first it was called the Pharmaceutical Garden, as medicinal plants for pharmacies were grown here.  The place for the garden was chosen on Voroniy Island, later this island was renamed Aptekarsky. </p>

    <p>  Gradually, the garden expanded, new buildings were built.  Peter the Great Botanical Garden served as a scientific platform for scientists and researchers, there were lectures and classes on botany.  The plant collection was gradually replenished by traveler scientists. </p><p>  Under Alexander the First, the garden began to be rebuilt and improved.  From the Pharmaceutical Garden, it was renamed the Imperial Botanical Garden.  And although plants for pharmacies continued to be grown here, the main task of the garden was scientific activity.  In the Garden, classes were held for students, gardeners studied.  The number of plants in the greenhouse has reached 15,000. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Under Nicholas the First, purely scientific activity began to be carried out in the garden, student classes were abolished, the cultivation of pharmaceutical herbs was first reduced, and then completely stopped. </p>

    <p>  In 1913, the garden was renamed the Peter the Great Botanical Garden. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, it was almost completely destroyed.  The war virtually destroyed the Peter the Great Botanical Garden, whose history spanned more than 200 years.  Many plants from the collection of hard work of scientists died.  Only a small part has been preserved.  After the war, the greenhouse was restored, all the buildings were rebuilt, a collection of plants was collected, much more than the previous one.  A major role in the restoration of the garden was played by director Sergei Sokolov. </p><h2>  <span>Botanical garden</span> today </h2><p>  Now the Peter the Great Botanical Garden consists of 26 greenhouses, where various plants of the tropics and subtropics are collected.  There is also an arboretum in which open ground plants grow.  Excursions and exhibitions are regularly held in the garden. </p>

    <p>  And although during the war most of the buildings were destroyed, from the surviving photographs they were restored.  The image of the park that you can now observe was laid back in the nineteenth century. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main objective of the Botanical Garden is still scientific activity.  Garden staff conduct research on the study of plants.  The garden collaborates with many botanical gardens in the world.  Regular exchange of seeds and plants. </p><p>  The arboretum is open for free access and inspection daily from 10 to 18 hours from April to October.  You can get to the greenhouses from Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. as part of tour groups.  About once a month, exhibitions are held in greenhouses, and those who wish can get there already without a guide. </p><h2>  What you can see in the Botanical Garden </h2><p>  Many different plants grow, bloom and bear fruit in the garden, only about 1000 in the arboretum park, and about 9.5 thousand in greenhouses.  This is a unique place in its diversity and beauty.  Only here you can instantly find yourself in the hot tropics and subtropics from the center of the metropolis, stroll along the winding paths of the greenhouses and the park, and admire the flowering flower beds. </p><p>  Blossoming sakura in the Japanese garden, huge leaves of Victoria lilies, tall palm trees and exotic succulents will not leave anyone indifferent.  Many flowering plants - orchids, camellias, azaleas and others - are covered with colorful carpet in the flower beds of the garden. </p><p>  Citrus trees during fruiting are a very beautiful sight: bright green leaves and large orange and yellow fruits pleasantly contrast with each other. </p>
