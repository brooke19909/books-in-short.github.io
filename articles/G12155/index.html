Today, payments in almost all areas of life are made using bank cards.  The benefits of such changes are obvious: </p><ul><li>  Unlimited access to your own finances.  You can withdraw money from your account using a card at any time of the day and in almost any corner of the world. </li><li>  No need to carry cash when shopping in stores. </li><li>  The ability to pay taxes, fines, utilities and other <span>obligatory payments</span> without leaving home <span>.</span> </li><li>  Transfer of wages and other income to a bank card, thereby eliminating the risk of receiving fake paper bills. </li><li>  Convenience and security when performing settlement operations with large sums of money. </li><li>  Protection from all sorts of scammers.  Even if the card is lost or stolen, you can immediately block your account by calling the bank hotline. </li><li>  Cost planning.  Removing from the card exactly as much as is necessary for a specific purpose, it is easy to cope with the temptation to spend all the money on a spontaneous purchase. </li><li>  Convenience of making payments while traveling to another country. The presence of a payment card eliminates the need to purchase local currency.  It is enough to conduct a cashless conversion operation. </li><li>  The absence of unnecessary problems with customs and the preparation of a declaration when traveling abroad.  The maximum allowable amount of cash for export is $ 10,000, and the limit on the card is not limited. </li><li>  A simple and quick way to make a purchase in the online store. </li><li>  The provision of a number of additional services: informing the bank about operations on the account, accruing annual interest on the balance of funds, bonus programs, one-time promotions. </li><li>  The control.  At any time, you can get information about the status of your account. </li></ul><p>  We will consider the last point in more detail using the example of the largest participant in the Russian banking system. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, how to check an account with Sberbank? </p><div class="photo" data-original="awards.brandingforum.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank cards" class="if uuid-2648647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648647.jpg"></div><h2>  SMS message </h2><p>  When you open an account, you will be prompted to attach a mobile phone number to it, which will make it possible to control any operations carried out on the card without leaving your home, and also, if necessary, check the status of the account in Sberbank.  To do this, just send a message consisting of the words: balance / balance, the last 4 digits of the card number.  The response letter will indicate the available amount.  Remember that you can use this method if you have enough money on your phone account to send an SMS message. </p><h2>  Hotline call </h2><p>  You can just call the bank hotline: 88002003747. </p><p>  In this case, it is important to adhere to the following algorithm of actions: </p><ul><li>  call the number and wait for an answering machine response; </li><li>  dial the lattice, card number and again the lattice; </li><li>  enter the code word in numbers. </li></ul><p>  After these manipulations, the main menu opens, in which you need to select the desired line and form a request for information about the balance of funds on the card. </p><h2>  Terminal </h2><p>  An easy way to check your account with Sberbank is to use the nearest terminal.  To do this, you must: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  insert a card and enter a PIN code; </li><li>  select the appropriate section in the menu that opens; </li><li>  receive data (display or print as a check). </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="sfour.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATMs of Sberbank" class="if uuid-2648671" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648671.jpg"></div><h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  The most convenient way to check your account on a Sberbank card is to go to your personal online account, where all the information about your accounts is located.  You can activate this service by registering in the bank's customer service system.  The functionality of the program is rich and diverse.  Here you can find information about the bank‚Äôs services, it provides opportunities for transferring funds, replenishing the account, and making payments. </p><p>  The algorithm for checking the account of a Sberbank card via the Internet is as follows: </p><ul><li>  authorization in the system; </li><li>  code entry (from SMS); </li><li>  receiving information on all current accounts. </li></ul><h2>  Mobile app </h2><p>  Another simple way to check your account with Sberbank is to download a special mobile application.  This can be done after registering on the bank‚Äôs website and receiving a code that will open access to the system. </p><p>  Instructions are given below: </p><ol><li>  Connection to the Mobile Bank system. </li><li>  Registration on the website. </li><li>  Downloading the application. </li><li>  Authorization in the program. </li><li>  Checking accounts. </li></ol><h2>  Bank branch visit </h2><p>  If modern methods of checking the account balance in Sberbank do not suit you or you do not have the opportunity to do it remotely, then take a walk to the nearest bank branch, taking your passport and card with you.  Contact the manager.  He identifies your identity by checking with the data entered in the database of Sberbank, and checks the savings account, providing him with all the necessary information. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="themoscowtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Operating room" class="if uuid-2648657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648657.jpg"></div><h2>  Checking the account of the savings book of Sberbank </h2><p>  The good old passbook is almost never used for calculations.  But the older generation still trusts her more than a plastic card. </p><p>  To check your <span>personal account with Sberbank,</span> you must use one of the following methods: </p><p>  Contact a bank employee with a passport and savings book. </p><p>  Go to Sberbank Online and get the necessary information.  To activate this service, you must write an application at a bank branch.  After that, the manager will provide you with a username and password from your personal account, instructing how to check your account with Sberbank via the Internet.  In this program, you can not only control your balance, but also pay taxes, fines, utility bills and other services. </p><p>  Of course, it‚Äôs easier for an older person to go to the bank and take the help of a real person. </p><p>  Help your loved ones learn new technologies by checking money in the Sberbank account in other ways.  These skills will save them time and eliminate the need to stand in line. </p><h2>  Why is it worth abandoning the passbook? </h2><p>  Savings books - an old banking tool, gradually fading into the past due to the low degree of protection and inconvenient service.  Starting from the middle of this year, a partial cancellation of savings books is planned.  However, their individual types, for example, for transferring pensions, will be valid for now. </p><p>  For the older generation, modern innovations logically arouse suspicion and fear.  In fairness, it is worth noting that many of them are quite reasonable.  For example, the following disadvantages of payment cards are often noted: </p><ul><li>  Technical difficulties in using the terminal.  At a considerable age, it is difficult to remember a new algorithm of actions, and even in an automated system.  In addition, all banking devices work differently. </li><li>  The need to constantly remember or store the PIN code of the card in written form. </li><li>  The presence of a commission when maintaining an account and making certain purchases. </li><li>  Periodic malfunctions in ATMs, for example, card retention.  The situation is unpleasant, and if this happened not at the bank branch, but on the street, then it is almost catastrophic. </li><li>  The abundance of scammers, every day honing and improving ways to deceive unsuspecting citizens. </li></ul><p>  How to calm the older generation?  Only patience and care.  Explain, show the necessary actions step by step.  Help the elderly relatives get a pension from the card.  Show the old man in line how to knock out a ticket in the terminal to take a place among other customers.  Explain to your neighbor's grandmother how to check the money in Sberbank's account using an SMS message. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Bank employees" class="if uuid-2648689" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648689.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do if the ATM does not give out the card? </h2><p>  There are situations when the ATM captures the card and does not return it back.  Why is this happening? </p><ul><li>  The program classified the operation being performed as suspicious (for example, you enter the amount absent on the account several times). </li><li>  The client forgot the PIN code and entered the wrong numbers a certain number of times using the ‚Äúpoke method‚Äù. </li><li>  The client hesitated and did not have time (forgot) to remove the card from the ATM in time. </li><li>  Card is blocked or expired. </li><li>  The card is damaged. </li><li>  There was a communication failure or technical malfunction in the ATM itself.  In this case, the corresponding message appears on the monitor.  Wait ten minutes.  It is likely that the device will recover and your card will be returned. </li></ul><p>  In all these situations, you should immediately contact the employee of the nearest department, following his instructions further. </p><p>  If there are no Sberbank branches nearby, you must use one of the proposed options: </p><ul><li>  Call the bank support service and report what happened.  Then proceed according to the operator‚Äôs instructions. </li><li>  Contact technical support.  Her number must be indicated on the device.  You will be informed when the work will be done with this ATM, as well as where and how you can pick up the card. </li><li>  Even if a technical service specialist promised that they would remove the card and give it away tomorrow, it still needs to be blocked.  Because when you move away from the ATM, it can earn and give a card to the person who approached after you. </li></ul><p>  If your card is ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù by a terminal of another bank, proceed according to the same scheme: </p><ul><li>  contact the bank servicing this ATM and find out how to collect your card; </li><li>  call your bank to block your account. </li></ul><p>  Remember the three main actions that guarantee the safety of your funds in any force majeure situation: </p><ol><li>  Keep in the notebook the phone number of the bank where your card is open and never use an ATM if it does not contain information about the service organization. </li><li>  What to do if you lost a card or stole it?  Do not panic!  Try to calm down and remember all the circumstances and small details.  If you are sure that the card was in your wallet and did not stay at home, then immediately block it!  To do this, just call the bank hotline.  In addition, you can use the service "mobile bank" by sending an SMS message, as well as block from the official website of the bank. </li><li>  Within a couple of days you need to come to the bank and write a statement about the loss of the card.  You should have a passport or driver‚Äôs license with you. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="en.crimerussia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM Keyboard" class="if uuid-2648684" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648684.jpg"></div><h2>  Card recovery </h2><p>  Having completed the procedures for blocking the card, it is necessary to proceed to its restoration.  The term for the release of a new instance will be from two days to a week.  For early reissue will have to pay 200 rubles. </p><p>  If you are far from the branch in which you issued the card, you can contact any nearest branch.  The staff will forward your application to the correct address.  Do not forget to indicate the place of receipt of the new card. </p><h2>  How to withdraw money from the account if the card is lost? </h2><p>  The card is not ready yet, but money is needed.  What to do?  Contact your bank and write a statement on the issue of funds without a card.  In such situations, banks meet their customers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="haberrus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cash" class="if uuid-2648694" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648694.jpg"></div><h2>  General recommendations </h2><p>  Some more useful tips: </p><ul><li>  Do not leave the card unattended.  To copy your data from it, a lot of time is not required. </li><li>  Do not tell anyone the PIN code, and most importantly, do not store it with the card. </li><li>  If you have several cards, it is very difficult to remember all the codes without confusing them.  Encrypt the combination of numbers in a certain way, for example, add 1 to each digit (your code is 1234, you get 2345).  The source code can be written to the card.  You know that when entering, one should be subtracted from each digit.  And if the card falls into the hands of fraudsters, they will begin to dial the original combination, and the ATM will block it.  Encryption options may vary.  The main thing is that you yourself remember them. </li><li>  Save the bank hotline number in your telephone directory. </li><li>  Before you withdraw money, make sure that there are no extra cameras and overhead keyboards.  Also check that the general information about the bank and its telephone number are posted on the ATM. </li><li>  If you plan a long trip, notify the bank in advance.  Since transactions performed in another region may be considered suspicious, which will lead to the blocking of your account. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="ktovkurse.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank sign" class="if uuid-2648651" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94115/2648651.jpg"></div><p>  Follow these recommendations in order to easily check your account with Sberbank, using the capabilities of modern technology, and at the same time not be afraid for the safety and security of your own funds. </p>
