This combination gives tourists a sense of comfort.  In order to get to the hotel, it is necessary to overcome a fairly large distance.  The fact is that Side does not have its own airport, so you can get to <span>the Side</span> West Park Hotel 4 * only through Antalya.

There is also the opportunity to take advantage of a special service that is provided by the hotel.
