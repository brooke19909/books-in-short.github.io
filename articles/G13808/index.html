There should be no flammable materials nearby (including on the wall itself).  Furniture, in turn, must be located at a safe distance.  Damage to the infrared heater if installed incorrectly can be significant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The last type of installation is called floor.  It is most common because it is the simplest.  As a rule, a tripod or a small stand is included with an infrared heater.  With it, you can easily adjust the height of the device.  You can also quickly rearrange the infrared heater to any other place.  And wall and floor installations require reliable installation of the device using brackets.  Additionally, metal hooks and dowels can be used. </p><h2>  Cons of infrared heaters </h2><p>  Of course, any infrared heaters have disadvantages, and in some cases even can harm human health.

It is very harmful to look at radiation for a long time.  This can result in damage to the retina.  The last problem is the low installation of ceiling heaters.  The distance between the device and the person‚Äôs head can be critically small.  In this case, exposure to <span>infrared rays</span> often leads to headaches. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>
