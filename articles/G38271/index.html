    <h2>  General: financing </h2><p>  The history of secret societies around the world is quite different.  They had a different influence, structure, goals, financing.  However, some common features can be highlighted. </p><p>  Secret society is a group of people united by a common goal, having common views.  They are hidden from the world and try not to betray their existence.  For the life of the group funding is needed.  Ancient history and secret societies are closely related, because secret associations like the Templars had a serious impact on the political life of Europe.  Medieval <span>chivalric orders</span> received money from the church, gave loans, received funds by robbing the "infidels" during the Crusades.  Left-wing underground organizations were funded by their members: everyone had to make a contribution to a common cause.  Islamic gangs often receive money from the treasury of the powers of the East, who are trying to use them for their own purposes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Secret Societies History: The Yakuza </h2><p>  Yakuza is the common name for the Japanese mafia.  Using their example, one can comprehend the essence of secret criminal organizations in the best possible way.  The first yakuza appeared in the eighteenth century.  An impoverished samurai was looking for a better life in the underworld.  They organized gambling houses, brothels, engaged in blackmail.  At the same time, the top of the gangs eventually woven into the establishment of feudal Japan.  They bribed officials and police, for which they turned a blind eye to their activities.  Often, the authorities themselves resorted to the services of bandits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of secret yakuza societies" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19718/1329868.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  With their help, competitors were eliminated, peasant riots were suppressed.

    <p>  By the beginning of the twentieth century, the Yakuza almost completely controlled the entire <span>black market in</span> Japan.  They were engaged in smuggling, drug dealing, robbery, gambling, pimping and other unpleasant affairs.  In the thirties, after the onset of the economic crisis, they became close to the authorities.  With the outbreak of World War II, many Yakuza members were drafted into the imperial army.  After the surrender of Japan, the mafia world has changed forever. </p><p>  In the fifties, members of the "new" yakuza worked closely with the US military.  In port cities, which the Americans used as rear bases, entire entertainment districts were created.  There were restaurants, drug dens, brothels. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Structure </h2><p>  The history of secret societies has many references to certain symbols that the conspirators used to identify each other.  In Japanese Yakuza, these are tattoos on the body.  They can cover only those places that are not visible under clothing - to the hands and to the ankles on the feet.  The hierarchy of tattoos and their semantic meaning is a separate science.  Often in general photos you can see naked gangsters demonstrating their tattoos.  The larger the tattoo, the higher the status of their wearer.  The first Japanese samurai conspirators used tattoos to identify each other. </p><p>  The gang structure is very clear and tough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of the orders of secret societies" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1461836.jpg" width="600"></div>  It is based on unquestioning execution of orders and recognition of the absolute correctness of the boss.  To some extent, the yakuza hierarchy reflects patriarchal relations in Japanese society.  At the head is oyabun - the boss.  He is the head of the gang and single-handedly makes decisions.  Next are two verticals - administrative and combat.  The first is headed by Saiko Komon - the "administration" of the clan.  They are advisers to the boss and his closest friends.  They are subject to lawyers and accountants.  The second branch is commanded by two people - vaka-gashira and satei-gashira.  They give orders to the “elder brothers”, and they can resort to the help of the “younger brothers”.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Medieval Secret Organizations </h2><p>  The history of secret societies in the form in which they exist today originates in the Middle Ages, when there were a lot of all kinds of unions and orders.  The most famous and popular in popular culture are Masons.  The name of this clan often appears in various conspiracy theories and generally among conspiracy theorists.  Almost any dramatic or great event that influenced the development of human civilization, someone connects with the Masons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of secret societies occult Nazi organizations" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1461855.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Society of Free Masons appeared in the Middle Ages.  Formed among the people who built the temples.  In that era, majestic Gothic castles could be built for more than a hundred years.  Therefore, the masons settled at the place of their work.  Such close cohabitation over the years has led to the need to create special social institutions. </p><h2>  The history of the orders of secret societies: Masonic lodges </h2><p>  After many years, these societies, or artels, gained considerable power in connection with the wealth of their members.  Over the next centuries, <span>Masonic lodges began</span> to open around the world and already had no connection with the construction.  The rituals and instruments of the first free masons (literal translation from French) began to play a symbolic role.  The complex hierarchy and structure of Masonic lodges allowed the brotherhood to be kept secret.  Each lodge controlled a certain territory.  The structure of society was accepted by scientists, financiers, politicians and other people who play a significant role in public life.  At different times, they used their influence, changing, according to conspiracy theorists, the course of historical events.  However, one cannot say for sure how strong this influence was.  Representatives of religious and anti-capitalist organizations regularly accuse Masons of conspiracy to control the political life of the world. </p><h2>  Secret societies in Russia </h2><p>  In 1810, the birth of Decembrism began on the territory of the Russian Empire.  The ten-year history of secret societies, an essay about which was written by Nikolai Danilevsky, was begun in the highest circles of Russian society.  The revolutionary mood was formed primarily among the nobility and the military.  One of the main reasons was the dissatisfaction with the rule of Emperor Alexander.  In addition, many soldiers who participated in the campaign against Napoleon, appreciated the way of life in Western countries.  Understanding the danger of open opposition, the conspirators created a whole network of secret societies.  Groups were divided on a territorial basis.  <span>Southern society,</span> Northern and so on.  After some time, they got in touch with the Polish intelligentsia, who wanted to achieve independence or broad autonomy for the Kingdom of Poland. </p><h2>  Insurrection </h2><p>  In total, up to ten large secret organizations operated before the uprising.  Their views were very different in both methods and requirements.  But the main goals of revolutionary Russian societies of the nineteenth century can still be distinguished: the abolition of autocracy, the abolition of serfdom, the abolition of fifteen-year military service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the birth of Decembrism a ten-year history of secret societies" class="if" height="353" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1461858.jpg" width="550"></div>  After the death of Alexander the First, there was a difficult situation with the choice of the heir.  The Decembrists took advantage of this and raised a rebellion in St. Petersburg.  However, it was brutally suppressed, and the instigators were executed.

    <h2>  Secret societies in the East </h2><p>  After the journey of the famous explorer Marco Polo, the eastern history of secret societies was revealed to the world.  Assassins became widespread in Western mass culture, although Polo wrote not only about them.  Assassins are assassins who have been active in the Middle East since the sixth century.  Secret society was built on the principle of a religious sect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of secret societies assassins" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1461865.jpg" width="360"></div>  According to some reports, suitable candidates of a young age were secretly drunk, and then transferred to a beautiful garden.  When they woke up, they saw a magnificent place in front of them with exotic plants, seductive virgins, delicious food and other things.  They spent one day there, after which they were again seared and taken home asleep.  After that, they were sure that they had visited paradise, and were ready to serve the one who promised to get there after death.  Assassins were professional killers, the services of which the rulers of the northern principalities of Iran resorted to.

    <h2>  Secret Nazi Societies </h2><p>  After the end of World War I, Germany was in extreme decline.  In 1918 in Munich begins the German history of secret societies.  The Nazi occult organizations made a significant contribution to <span>Hitler's rise to power.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient history and secret societies" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1461867.jpg" width="600"></div>  The most famous esoteric secret society is Thule.  Its members were wealthy and respected Germans.  Their meetings were held in expensive hotels.  The structure and method of organization quite noticeably copied the Masonic style.  Members of Thule actively studied Germanic mythology.  Based on Greek myths, they believed that the ancient Aryans lived in a certain northern country.

    <p>  And the Nazis considered themselves the descendants of these people.  They were racists, but initially positioned themselves as an apolitical society.  It was to them that Hitler came when he created his party.  With the help of money and connections, Hitler managed to popularize his party.  But occultism repelled many workers on whom the Nazis relied.  Therefore, gradually the Workers Party began to seize power.  First, they completely subjugated the newspaper, published on the money of Tula, and after coming to the Reichstag they planted many prominent occult figures. </p><h2>  Overthrow </h2><p>  How strongly the top of the Third Reich was connected with Thule is unknown.  In the film “The History of Secret Societies,” Bruce Burgess partially reveals this topic, but from a conspiracy point of view.  For many decades, there have been myths that the Nazis allegedly patronized a certain group of researchers who were looking for ancient artifacts to exalt Hitler's power. </p>
