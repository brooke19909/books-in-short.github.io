It is carried out on the basis of the buffet.  All rooms have a truly homely atmosphere and delight the eye with their interior. </p><p>  Gelendzhik, whose recreation facilities are located in a special climate zone, cannot but attract a large number of tourists.  For example, in the area where Grace is located, there are a lot of volatile products in the air.  They positively affect the human condition.  Allergies and asthmatics can improve the health here.  Ambrosia does not grow on the territory, which complicates life for some. </p><h2>  "Black Sea and Co" </h2><p>  To the sea from this recreation center is only 500 m, to the central region - 740 m. The institution is located near the forest, along with the coast of a large water area there is a mountain river.  Thanks to her, on especially hot summer days, the weather does not seem so tiring - the air quickly cools due to the close proximity of the water stream. </p><p>  The houses are designed for 2, 3 or 4 inhabitants in one room.  You can come with animals;  nearby is a children's area, so it is safe to bring children.  There is a parking lot, each room has air conditioning.  There is also a sports field. </p><p>  Gelendzhik is striking in its nature.  Recreation facilities (each price is specified) are always located in flowering meadows or beautiful pine forests.  "Black Sea and Co" is located in a place where evergreen trees have been standing for several thousand years.  For two there is a fee of 1200 rubles per day. </p>
