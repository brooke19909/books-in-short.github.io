  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trends in a further fall in prices on the Moscow real estate market</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Modern economic realities and constant confrontation with the West have affected the real estate market of the capital and other cities of Russia.  She finally began to get cheaper.  But when will it fall to the maximum bottom before it starts to grow again?  To get an answer to this question, you need to delve into a more complex analysis. </p><p>  <strong>How big is the price difference</strong> </p><p>  Today <noindex>  <span>real estate in Moscow</span> </noindex>  in dollar terms is cheaper one and a half to two times compared with the same period in 2014.  If we compare this indicator in ruble terms, then the numbers will not be so great, but nevertheless, a drop in prices in some cases can reach even 20% compared to last year.  At the same time, there are no natural factors that contribute to reducing the cost of apartments and houses in megacities, such as the outflow of the population or the invention of a more affordable construction technology. </p><p>  <strong>Cause and effect</strong> </p><p>  What is the real reason for such a rapid fall?  Many perplexedly looking for the answer to this question.  After all, if there are no natural, regular factors affecting the fall in housing prices, it follows that all financial disasters related to sanctions and oil will soon end and then again the cost will grow to disgrace.  But the main question at the moment is not finding the reasons for the fall, but when will the price of real estate in megacities of Russia reach its maximum bottom before the start of further growth.  Indeed, while the insightful investors did not begin to buy apartments in bulk and did not increase their value with their own demand, which means that the decline is still ongoing. </p><p>  <strong>Adequate cost for a long time</strong> </p><p>  The conflict with the West, the global depreciation of oil, the devaluation of the national currency, the decrease in consumer ability and other tests faced by the modern Russian Federation seem to many economists not just another round of the crisis of the capitalist architecture of the world, but a global redivision of the generally accepted order of existence on the planet.  In previous crises, real estate became cheaper and more expensive, so in 1998 it fell to the deepest bottom in the summer of 1999, in 2008 - in the summer of 2009.  So, accordingly, many are waiting for the summer of 2015 to start the global purchase of apartments and houses in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.  But on the other hand, it is not far-sighted to compare cyclical crises with the prevailing global conflict and perhaps real estate will never be the subject of various speculations, but will simply become housing for people with a fair price. </p></div></article>
