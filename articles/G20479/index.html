    <p>  There are rumors and legends about the culture, life and the unusually broad knowledge of the Mayan tribe.  So why is this mysterious and mystical <span>ancient civilization</span> so attractive <span>?</span> </p><p>  Today, the Mayan tribe is one of the Indian tribes that lives in South America (in the territory of Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and Belize).  And starting from about 2000 BC, this was the name of an ancient civilization that settled in Central America.  Maya obeyed all the tribes and peoples who lived there at that time. </p><p>  For almost 12 centuries, the domination of this civilization lasted.  The peak of prosperity falls, according to historians, in 900 AD, after which a long period of decline sets in, the causes of which are still reliably unknown. </p><p>  The Mayan tribe, whose history to this day is of greatest interest among scientists, inextricably linked its life with heaven.  The Indians relied on the legacy of the Olmecs, an earlier civilization, and achieved striking successes for that time in astronomy, in hieroglyphic writing, and calendar systems.  Moreover, the life of these people was very primitive. </p><p>  The main occupation of these Indians was agriculture, for which they used the simplest tools and devices.  But, despite this, they were excellent farmers - the Mayan tribe carefully cleaned large areas of tropical forests, they built underground storage facilities to collect rainwater.  In addition, civilization also engaged in pottery and weaving.  And thanks to the paths cleared by them, passing through swamps and jungles, the Indians established trade relations with other, distant peoples. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ancient Mayan tribes, according to historians, did not even know what a wheel is.  Meanwhile, the fact that during its heyday this civilization created temples, palaces, observatories, wonder cities, tombs and other richly decorated architectural monuments remains striking and inexplicable.  And all this, by the way, was built without the help of any metal tools. </p><p>  In those days when the colonizers of the Old World set foot on the east coast of South America, the Mayan tribe was already in deep decline.  The conquerors reacted barbarously to all those architectural monuments and works of art that were created by this ancient civilization.  The colonialists saw in them only the legacy of paganism, which must be ruthlessly destroyed.  But even what remains of Mayan knowledge and culture, to this day excites the imagination of scientists. </p><p>  Over time, the Mayans began to simply leave the cities they built in droves.  To date, there are several theories about this, but nobody knows the real reason.  And today it remains a mystery to the entire scientific world - what kind of civilization it was, where its representatives came from and where they went ... </p><p>  One of their main and amazing achievements is the calendar, which was based on astronomical calculations, the accuracy of which continues to delight modern experts. </p><p>  In general, the Mayan tribe used its observations in the field of astronomy both to solve various pressing problems (for example, in the field of agriculture), and to explain more global puzzles.  So, the priests very accurately calculated the life cycles of the Earth, which are confirmed by modern knowledge.  The horoscopes that astrologers make, guided by the calendar of the ancient tribe of the Indians, still have not lost their relevance.  Well, and perhaps the most popular prediction is the end of the world, which should, according to forecasts and calculations of this Indian tribe, come in 2012.  Believe it or not is everyone‚Äôs personal business, however, despite a considerable number of skeptics, there are quite real reasons to believe the prophecy. </p>
