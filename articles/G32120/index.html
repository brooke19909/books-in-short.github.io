Rhine Pact</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Locarno Conference was one of the most important diplomatic events in Western European history.  On the one hand, it consolidated the existing situation that was established after the signing of the world, which determined the post-war structure of Europe, and on the other, it significantly changed the situation of the parties that took part in it and signed a number of agreements in the course of its work. </p><h2>  The situation in Germany </h2><p>  The Locarno Conference was held as a result of the desire of leading Western European countries to come to an agreement on a number of controversial issues regarding territories, borders, trade and weapons after the end of the First World War.  The situation on the continent in the first decade was quite tense, despite the fact that the warring parties came to an agreement and established a new political order.  Germany, which was among the losers, was in a very difficult situation. </p>

    <p>  The country was actually disarmed, limited in economy and trade, demilitarized the Rhine zone.  Under these conditions, the revanchist mood in the country was quite strong: nationalist political forces insisted on revising the conditions of the Versailles peace and removing the state from the disadvantageous situation in which it found itself.  Finding itself virtually internationally isolated, Germany went on a rapprochement with the <span>Soviet Union</span> , having concluded the Rapall Peace Treaty with the Bolshevik leadership.  This agreement turned out to be beneficial for both parties at that time, since these states almost did not enjoy recognition on the world stage and therefore needed each other. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Poland and Germany" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1301574.jpg" width="579"></div></h2><h2>  The situation in Europe </h2><p>  The Locarno Conference was held on the initiative of other Western European powers.  Great Britain was interested in creating for its longtime rival, France, some counterweight on the mainland.  The fact is that after the war ended, the latter, as the most affected party, received great benefits and was in a privileged position compared to its neighbors.  In the League of Nations, this state occupied a leading position, which could not but worry other European governments. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="france italy" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1301568.jpg" width="327"></div></h2><h2>  Security issue </h2><p>  France, Italy pursued interests of a slightly different kind.  The first concerned primarily with the security of its borders.  The territory of this state, as mentioned above, was most affected by the German attack during the war.  Now it wanted to maintain the status quo.  The Italian government felt impaired as a result of the establishment of a new order, and by its participation in the work of this diplomatic meeting increased its international prestige.  Poland and Germany, in fact, ended up in opposite camps.  The first sought to ensure the security of its eastern borders, and the German government, on the contrary, did not exclude the possibility of armed conflict. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lokarn conference of 1925 and its results" class="if" height="447" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1301566.jpg" width="450"></div></h2><h2>  Goals </h2><p>  However, despite the marked difference in approaches, all participants were somehow united by one common feature: this is an anti-Soviet orientation.  Many European leaders were concerned about the signing of an agreement between the Bolshevik leadership and the German government.  The Locarno Conference was largely designed to include Germany in the system of European relations and, if possible, to bring discord into its relations with the Soviet regime.  However, the German Foreign Minister skillfully maneuvered between the two European diplomats, trying to extract the greatest benefit from the current situation.  He did not want to finally break with the Soviet government, but at the same time sought to enlist the support of European countries in order to ease the economic and <span>military situation of</span> his state.  The main goal of the European bloc was to include Germany in the League of Nations to tie it up with such conditions in order to remove it from cooperation with our country. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="borders of European countries" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1301563.jpg" width="330"></div></h2><h2>  Conversation </h2><p>  The work took place from October 5 to 16.  The following states took part in it: Great Britain, France, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Germany.  Before that, the German leadership presented two statements to the European authorities, which were to be read out during the conference.  The first point concerned a very painful and controversial issue of responsibility for the outbreak of war.  The German government insisted that the international community withdraw the wording that the German people were the culprit of the war, while asserting that there were other participants and stakeholders.  The second question concerned the evacuation of Cologne, but the German leadership was refused on both counts. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhine Pact [" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40481/1301560.jpg" width="358"></div></h2><h2>  Anti-Soviet orientation </h2><p>  Poland and Germany, in fact, found themselves in a rather difficult situation: the first - due to the fact that it failed to achieve guarantees of protection of its eastern borders, and the second - due to the fact that it was forced to maneuver between the two sides.  She was required to accept the condition of article 16 of the charter of the League of Nations, which provided for the implementation of active measures against the aggressor country, the violator of the world.  By this intruder the USSR was very explicitly meant.  The German leadership had to either participate directly in hostilities, or let troops through its territory, or, finally, join the economic blockade.  In response, the foreign minister of this country stated that, being demilitarized, economically disadvantaged, it would not be able to fully fulfill its obligations.  In response, the ministers objected that even under the current situation, the state could be a full party. </p><h2>  Territorial issue </h2><p>  The borders of European countries were the focus of attention of the participating countries.  In the course of their work, the French and Belgian delegations managed to secure their eastern borders, and the British and Italian governments acted as guarantors.  However, the Polish leadership failed to achieve the same success: although it concluded an agreement with the German leadership, it did not achieve guarantees.  As a result, this country found itself in an extremely difficult situation, since it had every reason to fear for its territorial integrity.  France, Italy also could not put the results of the conference among their successes.  The situation of the first was greatly undermined after the German side participated on equal terms in the negotiations, and then was introduced into the League of Nations and became a member of its permanent council.  The Italian delegation only blunted one of the agreements.  The signed Rhine Pact can be attributed to one of the most significant treaties, since, in addition to guarantees of the inviolability of the French and Belgian borders, it confirmed the fact of dimilitarization of the zone of the same name. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The conference significantly changed the alignment of forces on the European continent.  First of all, this concerned the position of Germany, which has achieved significant concessions for itself.  She emerged from a state of international isolation and spoke at the negotiations as an equal party.  Secondly, French positions were undermined.  Great Britain achieved its goal by contrasting it with a new force.  The Locarno Conference of 1925 and its results, despite the anti-Soviet orientation, nevertheless temporarily stabilized the situation, but the inevitability of a new war was obvious. </p>
