Reforms of Alexander 1: table</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the years of the reign of the new emperor, a fairly large number of reforms were undertaken, which were designed to change the management system, improve the education and life of the people as a whole.  They were partially effective and played a significant role in raising the cultural level of the state.  The reforms of Alexander 1 are briefly described in this article. </p><h2>  Reign of Alexander 1 </h2><p>  In the history of Russia, like many other states, the new ruler often came to the throne through a series of intrigues, conspiracies, and even deaths.  Emperor <span>Pavel 1, the</span> son of Catherine the Great and Peter Fedorovich (who was the grandson of <span>Peter 1),</span> was killed in 1801 by the conspirators.  A palace coup took place, and the throne was occupied by Alexander Pavlovich, who became Alexander 1. With the advent of the new monarch, there was hope for the departure of despotic methods that were practiced in full force under the reign of Paul 1. The liberal reforms of Alexander 1, briefly indicated in the table, did not cause everyone support.  More on this later. </p>

    <h2>  Reforms of Alexander 1 - summary </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century the autocratic-feudal system and the search for a new way of political and socio-economic life were characteristic.  Alexander 1 got the state in a difficult external and internal situation.  Upon coming to the throne, he abolished the Secret Chancellery, forbade torture and corporal punishment (for nobles and merchants).  Many prisoners held in the Peter and Paul Fortress were also released. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If to speak about Alexander 1‚Äôs reforms briefly, from the beginning of the reign long-awaited hopes were justified - Russia saw liberal undertakings.  In the same year, a <span>Secret Committee</span> was formed <span>, the</span> task of which was to discuss the vital issues of the life of Russians, in the center of which - serfdom, the spread of education, and state transformations.  According to the royal decree, a project is being developed to abolish <span>serfdom,</span> but real actions contradict these intentions. </p>

The table contains the bulk of them.  A memorable personality during the <span>reign of Alexander 1</span> was Speransky.  However, his project on state reforms that could radically change the life of the state, namely, the involvement of society in the government of the country, did not please the emperor and the ruling elite.  In 1812, Speransky was expected to be removed from office and exiled.  Speaking about the reforms of Alexander 1 briefly, it is also worth mentioning that they were not ready to allow a radical change in lifestyle. </p>

    <h2>  Educational changes </h2><p>  Since the 20s of the 19th century, radical actions begin in relation to educational institutions.  In 1821, previously created universities were destroyed - Kazan, Moscow.  The professors suffered the dismissal and the court.  Created in 1817, the Ministry of Spiritual Affairs controlled all institutions of upbringing and education.  The permission to import books and the creation of printing houses gave impetus to the development of education. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ministerial reforms of Alexander 1 were a significant step. Their summary: thanks to the creation of central government bodies, a strictly subordinate chain appeared, which was characterized by sole authority.  Ministers came to the place of the collegial meetings, each of which obeyed and accounted for the Senate for its activities.  It was an attempt to rebuild the management system as a whole.  This measure was partially effective - the central control was strengthened, however, the greedy nature of man took up.  Again embezzlement, the irresponsibility of senior executives, bribery.  Ancient human vices found for themselves moves in the new system. </p>

    <h2>  Military settlements </h2><p>  In 1816, Alexander 1 came up with a way, thanks to which he was going to reduce expenditures on the army - military settlements.  People in these settlements were obliged to simultaneously carry out military service and cultivate the land.  The place was chosen quickly - the state lands of the provinces of Mogilev, Novgorod, Petersburg and Kharkov.  If we describe the military reforms of Alexander 1 briefly, we can say that the situation of the army has worsened. </p>

    <h2>  The importance of reform </h2><p>  During the reign of <span>Alexander 1</span> , the first steps were taken towards the restructuring of state administration, but they were characterized by uncertainty.  However, thanks to transformations in enlightenment, changes that occurred in the second half of the 19th century and went down in history under the name of ‚Äúgreat reforms‚Äù became possible.  The cultural level of society has risen, and the number of educated people in the state who understand how much change is needed has increased. </p><p>  One can describe the state reforms of Alexander 1 briefly as follows - a large number of entities took place in the country, and the new ruler acted more deliberately than his predecessor.  The emperor and his entourage pursued two goals - they tried to equalize the estates in the eyes of the law, and also sought to unite them in joint activities.  However, the difficult time during which wars and changes in the political system came, put pressure on the financial condition of the country, which, in turn, was reflected in the amount of quitrent asked from the people.  In order to improve the improvement of the state, new laws were introduced that lowered the well-being of ordinary people. </p>

    <h2>  Board ending </h2><p>  Alexander 1 perfectly understood that dissatisfaction with his policy was growing, and it did not lead the state to the desired hurry.  Meanwhile, the international situation is beginning to heat up.  The emperor moves away from affairs and worries about the country, devotes more and more time to traveling.  He died in the 48th year of his life in Taganrog while traveling. </p>
