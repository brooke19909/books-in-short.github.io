During the existence of the award, it almost did not undergo external changes.  The criteria by which the award was awarded did not change either - the rod was handed to the generals who brought victory to the country with their military talents. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Marshal‚Äôs wand is a symbol of military distinction, a sign of belonging to the field marshal or marshal‚Äôs rank.  Externally, it is a cylinder with a length of 30 to 40 centimeters and a diameter of up to 5 cm. The rod is usually elegantly decorated: covered with rich fabric, encrusted with precious stones or decorated with metal and made of precious wood (less commonly - precious metal).  Most often, the wands were made personally for a particular person and had an individual design.  There was no single requirement for the manufacture of this insignia, but most often the marshals' wands of the army were red, the fleet was blue, and the aviation was purple or white. </p><p>  During the parades, as well as in official portraits, the rod was supposed to be held in the right hand or raised above itself in greeting to the soldiers.  After the death of the owner, the rod became a heirloom and was guarded by heirs. </p><h2>  Symbol origin story </h2><p>  For the first time, the marshal‚Äôs wand as a symbol of distinction, a sign of gratitude and favor to the commander from the ruler began to present in ancient Rome.  The Senate envoy handed the rod, toga and a wreath to the triumphant commander who brought victory to Rome. </p><div class="photo" data-original="papodehomem.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sculpture of Julius Caesar" class="if uuid-2754157" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754157.jpg"></div><p>  The rod was made of white ivory and decorated with scenes of military victories.  At the top of the rod was a golden eagle - a symbol of courage in Rome.  During the victorious procession, the commander raised the rod above himself, thereby reporting victory and saluting the people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.romanoimpero.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Caesar's Regalia" class="if uuid-2754156" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754156.jpg"></div><p>  In the future, Byzantium took over the tradition.  In this empire, the wearing of a marshal's baton was a sign of the highest military power. </p><p>  The tradition of presenting the rod was adopted by France, which became the cultural heiress of the Roman Empire.  From France, the custom of rewarding top military commanders who proved themselves in battle has spread to other European countries, including Russia. </p><h2>  How did you get this distinction symbol in Russia? </h2><p>  Wands are assigned to the military in a marshal or field marshal rank.  The history of the marshal‚Äôs wand in Russia began during the reign of Peter the Great.  During this period, this title was awarded to only four people - Sheremetev, Menshikov, Repnin and de Croa.  All of them received the marshal‚Äôs rod, not out of the tsar‚Äôs mercy, but as a reward for military talent and valor in battle.  A similar tendency - to reward only glorified and brave warriors, continued in the future, during the rule of other members of the Romanov dynasty, however, during the period of favoritism, more and more honorary insignia went into the hands of those who were not related to military service. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.scoopnest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Alexey Razumovsky with a rod" class="if uuid-2754177" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754177.jpg"></div><p>  So, for example, Alexey Razumovsky, the favorite of Elizabeth Petrovna, received his marshal‚Äôs rod.  A little earlier, this brotherhood was also awarded to his brother, 22-year-old Kirill Razumovsky, who was in the public service under the monarch‚Äôs person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the era of favoritism, civil servants could also claim to receive such a reward - the rod could be received by special order of the monarch, both the military and officials and managers who held high government posts. </p><p>  Thus, the marshal‚Äôs rod was received by the valiant military, distinguished themselves in many battles (often serving from the lowest ranks) and the highest dignitaries.  They were awarded for bravery in battle and many years of service for the benefit of the state. </p><h2>  Who gives the marshal's baton? </h2><p>  The decision to assign this insignia is made by the ruler of the country - the president or the monarch.  Therefore, funny things happened: for example, the Russian emperor Alexander I was forced to sign a decree on awarding the marshal‚Äôs wand to himself - for services to the state and under pressure from his brothers who had received the wand earlier. </p><h2>  How is the award process? </h2><p>  As a rule, the rod was handed after a decisive battle directly on the battlefield or at a parade in front of the troops.  Sometimes the wand was presented during a reception at the monarch or president.  In any case, the award was held in a festive atmosphere. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deduhova.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Awarding at Nicholas 2" class="if uuid-2754190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754190.jpg"></div><p>  During the parades, the marshal, who received the marshal's baton, was supposed to greet the soldiers with a raised baton, thereby showing unity with the army and joy for the general military achievements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Differences in appearance </h2><p>  The first marshal's wands, as already mentioned, were made in Rome from ivory.  They were decorated with military scenes and gold. </p><p>  The most ancient wands preserved in France had a symbol of the ruling dynasty in decoration - golden lilies and a symbol of the house of the Bourbons.  He was covered in blue velvet. </p><blockquote><p>  ‚ÄúThe horrors of war are a shield of peace‚Äù </p><p>  - the inscription on the French marshal's baton. </p></blockquote><p>  Under Napoleon, the rod was made of wood, covered in blue velvet.  Imperial eagles were embroidered on the fabric, and on the tips on one side there was an inscription, and on the other - the name of the owner.  In the XX century, instead of eagles, the rod began to be decorated with stars. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coulot.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="marshal's baton in france" class="if uuid-2754224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754224.jpg"></div><p>  In Russia, the rod was made of gold and decorated with diamonds and laurel branches - a symbol of victory.  Imperial eagles were engraved on the tops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.museum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Suvorov with a rod" class="if uuid-2754264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754264.jpg"></div><p>  The British rod was covered with red velvet with lions embroidered on it, and on the top they depicted George the Victorious. </p><div class="photo" data-original="deadbees.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="British Rod with GP" class="if uuid-2754263" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754263.jpg"></div><p>  In general, most often the wands of different countries (for example, Austria and Prussia) were covered in velvet with images of symbols of the state. </p><h2>  Famous Owners </h2><p>  Throughout the history of the existence of this symbol, many commanders from different countries have been awarded the distinction with a rod.  It is almost impossible to list them all in one article. </p><p>  The most famous holders of the rod in Rome were Gaius Marius, Octavian Augustus, Julius Caesar. </p><p>  In France, the most famous representatives of the owners of the marshal‚Äôs wand were Prince Conde, who invented new tactics of warfare and successfully proved himself in the Thirty Years War, Napoleon Bonaparte, Murat, Davout and Ney. </p><p>  In Russia, the most famous holders of the rod were Rumyantsev, Kutuzov, Suvorov, Barclay de Tolly and other prominent military leaders and statesmen. </p><p>  The most famous wand holder in the UK is Marshal Wellington, who glorified his name in World War II in the battles against Napoleon. </p><p>  In the XX century, this symbol of distinction was forgotten by many countries.  For example, in Russia it was canceled in 1917 when the Bolsheviks came to power. </p><p>  A new round of development of the wands was received under Hitler - in just a short period of the Third Reich, 27 people received them.  Goering's marshal‚Äôs rod, made of ivory and inlaid with gold, is particularly rich in jewelry. </p><h2>  Symbol in the culture </h2><p>  The rod is present in photographs and portraits awarded with this insignia.  The phrase of Napoleon about a marshal‚Äôs wand in a soldier‚Äôs satchel became widespread.  Having become winged, it literally means that each soldier with his valor and courage can earn himself a high rank and a high award.  This item has always been a symbol of the unity of the military elite, army and people, expressing the common joy of victory. </p><blockquote><p>  Every French soldier carries in his satchel the rod of the Marshal of France. </p><p>  Napoleon. </p></blockquote><p>  Karpov‚Äôs book ‚ÄúMarshal's Wand‚Äù is popular in Russia and the CIS.  The epigraph to it is a quote that each soldier has this distinction symbol in his satchel.  Contrary to the name, the book ‚ÄúMarshal's Wand‚Äù does not tell about the life of the military elite, but about young soldiers who are experiencing all the hardships and tragedies of the war for the liberation of their homeland. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><ul><li>  The quote, usually attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte, stating that the soldier‚Äôs hiking bag already holds an honorable baton, was actually first said by King Louis XVIII. </li></ul><blockquote><p>  Remember that among you there is nobody who would not have in the knapsack of the marshal's baton the Duke of Reggio. </p><p>  The appeal of King Louis XVIII to the pupils of the military school. </p></blockquote><ul><li>  Most of the recipients of this symbol of distinction began their military careers with the lowest ranks and achieved awards thanks to their military or administrative talents. </li><li>  In Nazi Germany, more than 20 such insignia were made and presented. </li><li>  The imitation of marshal's wands is a fairly common occurrence.  In everyday life, as a rule, a copy was used, while the original was taken with them to solemn awards and parades. </li></ul><h2>  Symbol today </h2><p>  Nowadays, Marshall's wands are almost out of use as rewards.  You can find them in museums. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.totls.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Goering's white rod" class="if uuid-2754269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45880/2754269.jpg"></div><p>  For example, the baton of Marshal Davout is in the Hermitage, and two Goering rods are preserved in the National Museum of Infantry in the USA. </p>
