The archipelago consists of more than 1000 islands, most of which are still uninhabited.  At the same time, the entourage here is primitive: the charm of a simple life, where there is no place for inflation, mortgages and loans, but there is everything for a comfortable stay. </p><h2>  Holidays in the Maldives </h2><p>  The tropical nature pleases with its proximity to the azure ocean, coconut palms and the literal absence of signs of civilization, apart from air-conditioned apartments with all the necessary amenities.  However, you will have to fork out for the exclusive described above: the flight will take at least 9 hours (the cost of tickets is appropriate) - this is only to the capital, and from there you can still get to the atoll. </p><p>  In addition, the paradise town is ‚Äúplanted‚Äù with 4 * and 5 * hotels operating exclusively on the all-inclusive system.  The Maldives also created the conditions for the maximum spending of money.  But in a different way!  Therefore, if you consider yourself among the romantics or hedonists who, without batting an eye, are ready to lower half the cost of an average car, then a stunningly beautiful state is waiting for you.  Frustrated, no one has left yet! </p><h2>  Olhuveli Beach &amp; Spa Resort 4 * </h2><p>  The luxury SPA hotel is located at the very end of the archipelago - on the southern atoll Male.  It features a white sandy beach and two infinity pools.  The hotel complex itself is built on the territory of a beautiful tropical garden, in which there are 4 restaurants, 3 bars and a scuba diving school with all the necessary certificates. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It offers spacious air-conditioned apartments with wooden furniture.  Each villa is equipped with a TV (cable TV), minibar and DVD player.  Some have an outdoor hot tub with ocean views and a private terrace for sunbathing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="holidaycorp.co.za" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="4 * Olhuveli Beach &amp; Spa Resort" class="if uuid-2533229" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34480/2533229.jpg"></div><p>  Olhuveli Beach is an hour boat ride from the capital's international airport. </p><p>  Sun Spa offers all types of relaxing body massages, beauty treatments and flower baths.
