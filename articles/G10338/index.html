  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a professional speaker system</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No entertainment facility can do without a high-quality speaker system.  Be it a concert hall, a puppet theater, a restaurant, a bar, a snack bar.  Pleasant music and a good design of the room, a modern repertoire will attract more visitors. </p><p>  An acoustic system is equipment consisting of a body with built-in speakers that reproduces sound. </p><p>  In order to choose the right speaker system, you should first determine the working conditions and purpose of the room.  If the equipment is necessary for a regular disco or cafe, then a 2 - 3-way system will be enough, but for a concert hall a multi-way is already purchased <noindex>  <span>professional acoustics</span> </noindex>  which reproduces a rich and beautiful sound. </p><p>  Speakers are passive and active, that is, they already have a built-in amplifier, and for a passive system, the sound amplifier must be connected separately. </p><p>  In the active system, a separate amplifier is intended for each frequency band (speaker), which allows you to get sound quality at the highest level and a wider range of frequencies.  Active acoustics are also equipped with a volume control, which is convenient during operation. </p><p>  A passive system requires the connection of an external amplifier, but in this case, you can increase the sound reproduction power only by replacing the amplifier, and not the entire expensive speaker system. </p><p>  For a small room, built-in or suspended acoustic kits, which are mounted on special racks, are quite suitable.  But for an expensive restaurant or club, floor systems are needed that provide high-quality, clean and powerful sound thanks to the voluminous body. </p><p>  The price of floor systems is much higher than suspended systems, since large sizes require stiffness of the body.  To do this, stiffeners and partitions are equipped inside the structure, and the case itself is made of chipboard of increased thickness, which not only adds weight to the system, but also increases the cost. </p><p>  When choosing a professional speaker system, it is recommended to pay attention to branded equipment, which has long been popular and is of high quality.  It is advisable to purchase goods in a store where they fill out a guarantee for service, as this is another confirmation that the products are of high quality, and the manufacturer is responsible to the consumer for his goods. </p><p>  But, whatever the brand of the speaker system would be, the sound will be heard, moreover, in different frequency ranges and at different sound powers.  The sound of the speakers is also heard without timbre correction, that is, when all the controls are turned to ‚Äú0‚Äù, since in this case the real sound of the system is produced. </p><p>  It should not be forgotten that new acoustic systems from any manufacturer require running-in, that is, during the period from 2 days to 3 months, the speakers will "get used" to reproduce sound, as a result of which the sound quality is always slightly worse than at the initial stage.  Therefore, initially the sound of the speaker system should be ideal for the buyer. </p></div></article>
