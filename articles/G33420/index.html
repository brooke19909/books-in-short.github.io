  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aryan race and its physical attributes</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the 20s of the last century, during the stay of Adolf Hitler in Munich, he read E. Blavatsky's book The Secret Doctrine.  A Russian immigrant who lived in America at that time was engaged in spiritualism and the <span>occult sciences.</span> </p><p>  <strong>Blavatsky Theory</strong> </p><p>  In her book, Blavatsky talked about how she deduced a special theory, thanks to <span>spiritualistic sessions</span> and experiences of communication with otherworldly forces.  The Aryan race formed its basis.  The Aryans included mystically <span>enlightened people who</span> once inhabited our Earth.  This race was considered special, dominant.  According to Blavatsky, the ancient Aryans were the ancestors of the Germans, and the first place where the Aryan race settled was Atlantis or Fr.  Thule.  The death of Atlantis was the reason that the Aryans moved to Tibet and to the foothills of the Himalayas. </p><p>  <span>Elena Blavatsky</span> called the Aryans a God-chosen people who is called to rule all the people living on Earth.  Adolf Hitler immediately accepted this theory and decided that it was the Germans who should rule the whole world, since they had been endowed with this right from antiquity.  Hitler laid the foundation of his ideological beliefs that raised him to the pinnacle of power, legends that describe the secret history of the Earth. </p><p>  <strong>Legends</strong> </p><p>  The first legend says of two races that once lived on Earth.  One had dark skin and possessed extraordinary power, a highly developed culture and science.  The cities of this race were located mainly in the south.  People with white skin lived in the north, but their development was weak, so they strictly obeyed the "black masters."  However, among the white race appeared the wise and brave Aryan Ram, who rebelled in the northern lands.  The Aryan race led by Rama defeated the "black gentlemen" and overthrew them.  Ram, on the other hand, created a superpower empire that united many nations.  The death of Rama caused a bloody feud between the heirs, the arias, as a result of this, were defeated, and all the revolutions that followed, the utopian teachings and the loss of spirituality by people were the result of this. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another ancient legend remains that somewhere high in the mountains of Asia, on the border of Afghanistan, India and Tibet, is the country of Agarti-Shambhala, inhabited by wise mediums who managed to survive in that internecine war.  This is the same Aryan race, hiding laboratories, warehouses, libraries in inaccessible caves, which store all the scientific experience of <span>ancient civilizations.</span>  According to legend, one who can negotiate with the people of Shambhala and become the owner of the key to secret knowledge will be able to take over the world and reveal all the secrets of the universe! </p><p>  <strong>History</strong> </p><p>  Hitler, relying on the alleged locations of Shambhala indicated by Blavatsky, becomes simply obsessed with the desire to find secret knowledge.  Later, he tells this to Heinrich Himmler and asks for help in the search.  Archeological expeditions are being organized, including scientists and SS staff trying to find the city. </p><p>  Himmler invited Heydrich, whom he considered a true Aryan, to lead the service, which became a new program for the search for ancient knowledge, called "The Legacy of the Ancestors."  The secret structure began to search in culture, history and science for evidence that the Aryan race is the God-chosen and called to rule the world people in the person of the Germans.  What the Germans managed to find in the Middle and Middle East and in Tibet will remain a mystery forever. </p><p>  Many scholars to this day are eager to find out what information the Heritage of the Ancestors group owned and to understand what the Aryan race is.  There is evidence that this group was able to understand the essence of the energy information system and the single energy information field of the Earth.  This is not known to the end. </p><p>  <span>Reinhard Heydrich</span> died under strange circumstances, after the expedition sent to Tibet returned and brought in very valuable information, which Reinhard was the first to familiarize himself with.  According to some sources, all members of the Tibetan expedition died under unusual circumstances, and the materials that were delivered disappeared without a trace. </p><p>  There is also the so-called Slavic-Aryan race, which belongs to our modern civilization, but this is a separate story. </p><p>  <strong>Signs of the Aryan race</strong> </p><p>  Nazi ideologists believe that true Aryans are tall and slender.  They have a narrow face and a long skull.  They have a narrow forehead, a narrow back of the nose, slightly curved eyebrows, a narrow chin. </p><p>  The color of the skin of the Aryans is pinkish-white, blood reflects through it.  The skin of the Aryans is not harmed by sun exposure.  They have thick hair, men have a magnificent beard.  Hair color is usually light, with variations from completely white to yellowish and golden. </p>
