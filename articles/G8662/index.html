But most tourists prefer to have lunch and dinner in some colorful cafe or bar in the city.  Sanya has an impressive selection of interesting establishments with a decent assortment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.57023.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Soluxe Hotel Resort Sanya 5 *" class="if uuid-2958567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2958567.jpg"></div><h2>  Accommodation options </h2><p>  Located in the city of Sanya (China) Grand Soluxe Hotel Resort Sanya Bay 5 * has an impressive number of rooms.

They are, for the most part, positive.  Here are some of the most common comments: </p><ul><li>  Numbers in reality look the same as in the photo.  Tourists vacationing at the hotel recommend taking one that overlooks the sea. </li><li>  The apartments are cleaned daily, they also bring coffee, tea and cosmetics (nail files, hair caps, combs, toothbrushes, shampoos, etc.), and towels are changed.  All rooms also have mosquito protection. </li><li>  The food is varied and tasty.  Lunches and dinners are much more impressive than breakfasts.  On the tables, why not. </li><li>  The pools located on the territory are chic - large, beautiful and always clean, with a minimum content of bleach.  And the water in them is refreshing.  Although there are heated pools, they are surrounded by oases. </li><li>  The wellness center at the hotel is magnificent.  They do everything - free diagnostics, a variety of massages, cosmetic procedures, etc. Moreover, it is 3 times cheaper than anywhere else. </li><li>  The sea is wonderful, the beach is with nice sand, but there are few sun loungers.  Therefore, it is worth taking a towel with you before you go there. </li></ul><p>  In general, people who were vacationing in China, in Sanya Bay, at the Grand Soluxe Hotel Resort Sanya 5 *, had mostly positive impressions about the time spent here.  Nobody will leave without impressions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grand-soluxe.hotel-in-sanya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="grand soluxe hotel resort sanya 4 china sanya" class="if uuid-2958566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2958566.jpg"></div><h2>  When is it better to go on vacation? </h2><p>  It should be noted that the beach season in Sanya lasts almost the whole year.  The climate here is mild and pleasant.  In high season temperatures reign up to +30.2 ¬∞ C.  The sea is warmed up to +25.9 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  It is cooler here during low season.  Temperature indicators of air and water do not fall below +22.6 ¬∞ C.  But it rains often. </p><p>  It is best to go here in November, March or April.  And by the way, at this time it is often possible to purchase a ticket at a bargain price, since vacations for all, as a rule, fall in the summer months. </p><p>  Who better to go here?  Definitely for those people who crave an impression and dream of a fruitful acquaintance with a new culture for them.  This is not a place for relaxation and unity with nature.  Sanya is a city for emotion seekers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.sina.com.cn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="grand soluxe hotel resort sanya 5 china sanya bay" class="if uuid-2958563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13639/2958563.jpg"></div><h2>  Voucher cost </h2><p>  Much has been said above about Grand Soluxe Hotel Resort Sanya 5 * (Sanya, China).  In the end, I would like to talk about prices. </p><p>  The approximate cost of a voucher for two people is 140-150 thousand rubles.  This amount includes: </p><ul><li>  Stay in a deluxe room overlooking the garden for 11 days (10 nights). </li><li>  Return flights. </li><li>  Group transfer from the airport to the hotel and back. </li><li>  Medical insurance. </li><li>  Payment of fuel surcharge. </li></ul><p>  It is important to make a reservation that the price is approximate.  A ticket to the hotel can be purchased for both a smaller and a larger amount.  It all depends on the chosen tour operator, city of departure, the presence or absence of discounts, as well as the season.  By the way, in our time you can buy a ticket in installments. </p>
