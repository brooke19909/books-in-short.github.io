    <p>  <span>Currently, Svetlanovskaya Square in St. Petersburg has somewhat changed.</span> </p><p>  <span>Her architectural ensemble was supplemented by a high-rise building along Zelenogorskaya Street.</span>  <span>He immediately made it civilized and modern.</span>  <span>At the same time, it caused discontent among many human rights defenders who advocate the preservation of the historical appearance of the Northern capital.</span> </p><p>  <span>But many still like Svetlanovskaya Square in St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>The Vyborgsky district in which it is located considers it to be its decoration.</span> </p><h2>  Square on Engels Avenue </h2><p>  <span>This place in St. Petersburg is well known because of the conflict between local residents and developers that arose in 2007.</span>  <span>It was planned to build a <span>shopping center</span> with a restaurant in the green zone near house No. 28 on Engels Avenue.</span> </p><p>  <span>The residents of the neighboring houses who opposed this project found a lot of violations during the execution of permits for work.</span>  <span>For example, the developer was trying to begin the illegal <span>development of the pit.</span></span>  <span>The officials responsible for issuing these permits partially admitted their mistakes.</span> </p><p>  <span>As a result, the consequences of illegal work were eliminated.</span>  <span>And in 2009, a square was destroyed at this place.</span>  <span>Svetlanovskaya Square of St. Petersburg, the photo of which is in this article, this square, of course, adorns.</span> </p><p>  By the way, the square was named after Dmitry Medvedev, who at that time was the president of the country. </p><p>  In 2009, an initiative appeared to establish a memorial sculpture "Blockade Madonna" in the square, the project of which was prepared by the St. Petersburg sculptor Mikhail Zvyagin.  She was supposed to recall the most difficult months in the life of the city during the Great Patriotic War.  But the project has not yet been implemented. </p>
