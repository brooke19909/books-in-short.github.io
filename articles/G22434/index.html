    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  You can always visit the hospitable city of Orenburg.  The airport was previously called "Central".  Unofficially, since 2011 it has been named after Yuri Gagarin, but at the federal level it continues to be called the ‚ÄúOrenburg‚Äù.  It has existed for a long time, but despite this it is not inferior to more modern international airports.  High throughput and excellent technical equipment makes it possible to serve more than 400 passengers every hour. </p><p>  Among the 183 Russian airlines, Orenburg Airlines occupies the 15th place in terms of the number of passengers carried (12th place in international traffic). </p><h2>  Airport Codes </h2><ul><li>  ICAO: WHY; </li><li>  IATA: OEL; </li><li>  internal code: OEL. </li></ul>

This is the most convenient way to get the necessary information.  But if the Internet is not available, then you can use the phone.  To call the Orenburg airport information desk, dial +7 (3532) 67-65-44. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  In 1925, it was decided to build an aerostation in the city of Orenburg.  The airport was already launched by 1930.  In the fall of this year, a six-seater airplane on a Moscow-Tashkent flight landed on its territory.  This event was the birthday of the airfield. </p><p>  In 1931, it was decided to improve the air traffic of such a city as Orenburg.  The airport "Nezhinka" lasted from 1931 to 1987.  After a series of reorganizations, the airport was able to serve up to 400 passengers per hour, and in 1978 a special commission issued a certificate giving the right to operate the airport at the ICAO meteorological minimum of the first category. </p><p>  In the near future, new changes awaited Orenburg.  The airport received international status in 1992 and the first flight abroad was sent.  Until 2000, there was an active accumulation of the base of aircraft and helicopters.  Since 2009, a complete reconstruction of the facility began, and a year later we had a modern, competitive airport with excellent equipment. </p>

    <h2>  Airlines flying to Orenburg Airport </h2><p>  This is the largest and most famous company in Russia, Aeroflot, the base airport for it is Sheremetyevo, and a large number of flights pass through Orenburg.  Somon Air, Open Air, East Air airliners also land here. </p><h2>  How to get to Orenburg Airport </h2><p>  Interestingly, but such a question arises quite often.  Theoretically, a bus number 101 runs to him from the bus station. In practice, it is very difficult to see it.  At the bus station information desk, the dispatchers reply that there is no such flight, but airport employees suggest that it exists, but the movement takes place only from 8:30 to 16:30 with an hourly interval.  If you do not want to risk that the plane will fly away without you, then it is better to use taxi services.  They are not cheap, about 500 rubles, but you have to go for it.  The second option is to ask for help from friends and relatives with a private car, if any. </p><p>  If you decide to come by personal transport, then the airport has paid parking.  For 200 rubles a day, employees guarantee the safety of your transport.  Have a look at the city navigator called Orenburg in advance.  The airport, whose address is limited to the indication - the <span>Orenburg district,</span> is not difficult to find, but it is worth deciding on the direction. </p>
