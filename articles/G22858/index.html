Several streets lead here at once, near the Dzhubga water park.  Reviews bathers warn that there are always a lot of people, and life does not stop for a second.  In the daytime, they spend time energetically under the sun, and at night enchanting shows are organized. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  "Coast of dreams" </p><p>  A comfortable exit, a large number of spots for the installation of tents and parking places for tourists.  On the Web you can find a lot of encouraging reviews about Dzhubga and, specifically, about this place for those who decided to settle in the open air.  Moreover, there are arbors, showers and bathrooms, and the shore with a lot of shady trees and log descents to the water.  This coastal stretch of 1 km is easier to get from the A-147 highway. </p><p>  "Dzhubga" </p><p>  The small pebble beach of the sanatorium of the same name, which is almost a kilometer stretches to the southwest.  The road here is the path of the boarding house itself, and its employees monitor the cleanliness of the territory.  There are walkways, umbrellas, deck chairs.  There are two zones - abandoned and functioning. </p><p>  "Blue Bay" </p><p>  The coastal strip, covered by a colorful hilly territory, is located in the west of Dzhubga.  Guest reviews are quite flattering, they note a comfortable bathing area and a small distance.

The impregnable cliff of the mountain of the same name works as the landmarks of this site.  From the views the coast is isolated by turning.

Their characteristic feature is the fact that they all differ significantly between themselves in volume and configuration.  An equipped path leads to them, which runs through a magnificent forest, and then a chain of bridges and stairs begins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pvdshka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colonel Waterfalls, Dzhubga, Krasnodar Territory" class="if uuid-2455257" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/83790/2455257.jpg"></div><p>  Low waterfalls dry up in the summer months and for this reason experienced travelers recommend choosing a spring in order to admire them at will.

For this reason, they have another name - "Bzhidsky".  The gloss of snow-white limestone through the layers of water forms the impression of the presence of silver.  For a thorough inspection, the path is equipped with a ladder. </p><p>  Tengins </p><p>  Cascades of water up to 8 m high are located on the Shapsuho River.  The most beautiful and popular is the lower waterfall.  Above the river, their number reaches 20. A bicycle and cable trail leads to them. </p><p>  Bigusky </p><p>  Nature placed them close to the settlements of Bzhid and Teshebs and therefore they were given two more names "Gebius" and "Teshebsky".
