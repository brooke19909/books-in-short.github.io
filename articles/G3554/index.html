Obviously, its appearance was caused and directly related to the first astronomical and other calculations, one way or another using <span>natural numbers</span> and arithmetic operations.  The history of the emergence of algebra is confirmed by similar original records found among the writing patterns of the earliest civilizations.  For example, the Egyptians and Babylonians were already able to solve the simplest equations of the first and second degrees, <span>quadratic equations.</span>  But their calculations were strictly practical.  The history of the emergence of algebra, as a theoretical science, leads us to ancient Greece.  It was here that in the IV century the first work appeared, which was a direct study of abstract algebraic questions.  It was a treatise by the thinker Diophantus.  Here, the simplest algebraic axioms are clearly indicated: the rules of signs (minus minus minus plus, and so on), examples of fairly complex problems, the study of numerical degrees, the solution of problems related to <span>number theory</span> and so on.  Unfortunately, this is the only work that has come down to us from the grave ancient times, and even then not in full. </p>

    <p>  With the collapse of ancient civilization under the onslaught of barbarian peoples, many of its achievements are lost.  Including the history of algebra interrupts its development among European nations for a millennium.  Since the 7th century, the center of many sciences, and especially mathematics and medicine, has become the Muslim East.  Actually, the word "algebra" itself, as it is believed today, comes from the name of the treatise of the Arab scholar Al-Khwarizmi, "Al-Jabo-al-Mukaballa," which translated as "the doctrine of relations, permutations and decisions."  Interestingly, on behalf of this mathematician, some scientists derive the etymology of the word "algorithm."  Be that as it may, but it is the <span>Arab world</span> for centuries that has become the beacon of science.  However, the Eastern followers, obviously, relied on some Greek achievements.  In any case, it is well known that they knew the works of ancient mathematicians.  On the one hand, Muslims really do merit </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of algebra" class="if" height="275" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/273544.jpg" width="460"></div>  preservation of the <span>ancient</span> algebraic heritage for the <span>world</span> , but at the same time, over several centuries, they have not made new significant discoveries in the development of this science.  Mathematics was studied, but not improved.

    <p>  Mathematics and other civilizations </p><p>  Interestingly, the history of the emergence of algebra is not at all limited to Europe and the Arab civilization connected with it.  So, the significant results in this science were achieved by Indian mathematicians.  In particular, it was they who introduced the concept of ‚Äúzero,‚Äù which later came to Europe through the Arab world and began to be used by scientists.  The Chinese completely independently, even at the dawn of our era, learned to solve equations of the first degree.  They knew irrational and negative numbers. </p><p>  Europe returns leadership </p><p>  The interrupted history of the development of algebra again begins its countdown already in modern times.  The first work after the treatise of Diophantus is considered to be the work of a merchant from Italy Leonardo, who became acquainted with arithmetic and algebra, traveling in the east.  The gradual decomposition of feudalism, and with it church scholasticism and dogma, the leisurely tread of capitalism and the desire for territorial discoveries led to the revival of all scientific branches on the continent.  And after a couple of centuries, Europe is once again becoming a scientifically and <span>technologically advanced</span> region. </p>
