Unexpectedly, even for Samsung itself, the result of this experiment showed that the line is in demand in the smartphone market.  The second generation of the line was marked by the acquisition of the status of flagship devices.  At the same time, the lineup is becoming the most real separate direction.  The number of sales of precisely various Note models is growing. </p><p>  One of the flagships is <span>the Samsung Galaxy</span> S. The other flagship is rightly considered <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> Note.  The company said in 2013 that the largest percentage of technical innovations will be involved in the design of the Note range. </p><p>  It is worth noting the fact that if at the beginning the Note line played the role of a kind of testing ground for various experiments, now it is a key product.  As time goes on, the popularity of the Galaxy S is gradually fading, while the Galaxy Note continues to be in great demand.  Perhaps the main trump card of this line, which has the buyer to purchase a product, is its filling, which provides excellent graphic characteristics.  Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the characteristics of which will be given in this article, is one of the representatives of the line. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  <span>Samsung</span> believes that the Note line should be the most expensive.  In this article, we will consider the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 model, the design characteristic of which has many positive aspects.  The body is made up of plastic.  It is worth noting that one of the positive qualities in this case is the resistance to operation.  He is very unpretentious, which, of course, contributes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The appearance of Note 4 resembles Note 3. At first glance, the models can easily be confused, since there are not so many differences.  Design, by the way, is not bad.  Especially when you consider the fact that when creating Note 4 there was a definite breakthrough in the use of materials to create a smartphone case.  Around it there is a frame made of metal, which may resemble the Galaxy Alpha model. </p><p>  In daylight, metallic faces will play, reflecting the light.  They have a slight bevel.  However, the sides of the smartphone are painted in the color in which the body itself is painted.  It is interesting, in what ways did the product developers try to make progress in this direction in order to overcome the abrasion of paint from a metal surface? </p><h2>  Durability </h2>

    <p>  The body coating is strong enough, it will not work, for example, with keys.  Therefore, lovers of carrying the phone in their pockets along with other items can, without any fear, continue to do this business in their best traditions.  It is possible, with the targeted use of nails and other sharp objects, to scratch and succeed, but this is not an accident, but damage to the device. </p><p>  The design flaws include the fact that the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 after deformations can become deformed, and its side face still loses color after some time.  This will be most pronounced one year after the start of use. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strength Testing </h2><p>  Crash tests showed that when falling to the floor from a height of one and a half meters, Samsung Galaxy Note 4 does not receive noticeable damage.  With asphalt, everything will be much more complicated. </p><p>  As for color solutions, then everything is quite simple.  Standard solutions include white and black, as well as pink and gold colors.  All of them look original and bright. </p><p>  The back cover will not quickly jam.  Even if it is made in white.  It snaps into the bottom, and this process must be monitored more closely.  The thing is that the case has a slight bend, and it is precisely because of this that the lid does not always immediately fall into place.  In principle, there‚Äôs no need to inflate a big problem from this, but it‚Äôs worth paying attention to this. </p><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  As you know, Samsung is engaged in the manufacture of its own screens.  And not only them, but it doesn‚Äôt matter.  Due to the creation of its own components, the company in the smartphone market for a rather long time occupies a leading position.  Its competitors are often not able to get the right to use the company's innovative developments.  Suffice it to recall that Apple has already made an attempt to replace the components of the company.  However, they did not succeed, and the ‚Äúapples‚Äù simply had no other choice but to return to the purchase from Samsung. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now the race to improve screens has many parameters.  Companies are striving to improve the quality of the pictures displayed on the display, increase the <span>screen resolution,</span> and at the same time reduce the amount of energy that will keep the screen in working condition. </p><p>  This task was also done by Samsung several years ago.  And most importantly, they managed to achieve this goal.  Their devices under the same loads last longer than competitors.  The screen plays a direct role in energy efficiency. </p><p>  So, what about the characteristics of its screen about Samsung Galaxy Note 4?  The diagonal of the display remains the same size and is 5.7 inches.  At the same time, the screen resolution has increased.  Now it is 1440 by 2560 pixels.  There are 515 dots per inch.  According to experts, if the screen resolution is more than 4 hundred pixels per inch, it can be considered excellent by default.  At the same time, other criteria have a great influence.  These include the quality of the picture, as well as the convenience of working with the display and the quality of color reproduction. </p><p>  During the presentation of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, company representatives said that fonts will be displayed more correctly due to the fact that the resolution has increased.  In fact, users who have experience with this model note that with long work with a smartphone, their eyes get tired much less. </p><p>  Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910H has enhanced color accuracy.  The display of this model has flexible settings that allow you to adjust the screen to the desired level.  Galaxy S5 screens are much worse.  Bypassed Note 4 and Galaxy Tab S. </p><p>  Pictures are clearly visible even in sunlight.  It is worth saying that you can work with the display even with gloves on.  To do this, just start the function using the settings in the menu. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>

    <p>  The battery belongs to the lithium-ion type.  Capacity, when compared with Note 3, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has almost not changed: it grew by only 20 mAh and now is 3220 mAh.  The manufacturer made repeated statements that the operating time also did not change.  In standby mode, the smartphone can withstand 850 hours, you can talk continuously for 16 hours.  If the video is playing, the phone will work for 10 hours, and you can listen to music up to 50 hours. </p><p>  Purely theoretically, the new generation chipset increases the operating time.  However, in practice, due to the activation of a powerful graphics processor, this growth is actually canceled.  An ordinary user will be able to use the device without recharging for two days.  The battery shape of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 has changed compared to the batteries of other devices in the line. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  Just by looking at this parameter, you can immediately note the high level of performance of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Its performance in this regard is impeccable. </p><p>  The smartphone has 3 GB of short-term memory.  For the Android operating system, this amount is currently the maximum.  The OS can be organized in various ways.  If in memory, for example, a browser with many pages is opened, you can return it to working condition in a couple of seconds. </p><p>  Built-in memory is 32 GB.  At the same time, about 24 GB is available to the user.  To use for their own purposes such a volume is quite enough.  If you need even more memory, you can install a flash card.  Differences in operating speeds will not be noticeable.  Here, the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 demonstrates absolute identity. </p><p>  ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù remains two-channel.  But at the same time, its <span>throughput</span> increased. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Note 4: specifications, photos </h2>

    <p>  What the device boasts of is its Bluetooth technology version 4.1.  It contains all the protocols of previous versions.  The company managed to achieve some changes.  For example, now BT does not work at much greater distances, up to several tens of meters. </p><p>  USB 2.0, Wi-Fi, which works in five standards at once, as well as NFC and infrared, are all that Samsung Galaxy Note 4 stands out in terms of <span>communications</span> . The phone's characteristics in this regard remain positive.  Using infrared technology, you can control household appliances. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera module is inherited from the Galaxy S4.  However, in terms of software, it has been slightly modified and improved.  In this area, Samsung was also able to bring its components to mind and abandon the use of Sony cameras. </p><p>  The optical stabilization system clearly went in favor of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The camera features are at a high level, as in many cases. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Note 4: specifications.  Conclusion </h2><p>  The price for this phone is currently about 35 thousand rubles.
