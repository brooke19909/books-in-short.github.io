After all, the revolution organized by him radically transformed not only Russia and its neighbors, but the whole world.  Even the West, the former for a long time the main </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="when Lenin died" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/209919.jpg" width="460"></div>  paradoxically, the ideological adversary of the USSR positively changed under its influence.  So, for example, in 1917 a socialist revolution takes place in Russia, a year later the Social Democrats establish rule in Germany.  Under the threat of a revolutionary wave, already in 1919, the <span>International Labor Organization was</span> created in Geneva to optimize the dialogue between capitalists and workers.  Then the universal convention on an eight-hour working day is accepted.  This is just one example, but there are many of them - concessions made by capitalist governments and corporations to the masses under the threat of a <span>permanent revolution.</span>  The entire 19th century, especially its second half, and the first quarter of the 20th century were marked by the struggle for civil, human rights and <span>social justice</span> both in the east and in the west, not least thanks to the ideologists of socialist ideas.  When Lenin died, the whole country idolized its leader for almost 70 years.  Yes, and today it is difficult to find a person who did not hear this name.

Great achievements here were replaced by terrifying disasters.  This also concerns the first stage of the existence of the Union.  <span>War communism</span> made it possible for the Bolsheviks to defeat the civil war, mobilizing all its forces for it.  However, the same policy launched the masses against the new government, especially the most numerous layer then - the peasantry.  The New Economic Policy was called upon to restore the country destroyed in battle - a significant weakening of state control in the direction of a market economy.  Lenin became one of the key figures of this decision in the spring of 1921.  However, it became one of the last significant initiatives of the Soviet leader.  He became seriously ill a year later.  Lenin died in January 1924.  However, he spent the last 1.5 years of his life in a quiet estate near Moscow.  The causes of the leader‚Äôs illness were never fully understood either by contemporary doctors or by later research.  It was believed that severe congestion and many years of nervous tension led to the disease.  When Lenin died, this news was announced on the same day at the Congress of Soviets on January 21, 1924, and after that throughout the whole country.  Mourning ceremonies have acquired colossal proportions.  According to some researchers, only on January 23-26 the number of pilgrims to the tomb of the state leader exceeded half a million people.  And on January 27, the coffin with the body was finally placed in the mausoleum on Red Square.  However, subsequently a lot of rumors appeared about when Lenin died: supposedly this happened earlier and was hiding for some time (after all, he‚Äôs almost 1.5 years <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what year did Lenin die" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/209918.jpg" width="411"></div>  was in public), and some did not want to believe that he had died, spreading the rumor about the leader‚Äôs departure from the country.

    <p>  <strong>Stormy Twenties CPSU (B.)</strong> </p><p>  When Lenin died, the party began a serious struggle for power between the remaining leaders.  But I must say that he had many talented likely successors.  Even before the leader‚Äôs death, the persecution of <span>Leo Trotsky began,</span> which was charged in January 1924. Already in 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev fell into disgrace, and a little later Bukharin.  The purge, which began with a gentle removal from power of the Bolsheviks dangerous to Stalin, led to tremendous casualties in the 1930s. </p>
