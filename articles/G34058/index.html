So <span>what is a tablet for</span> and how is it used? </p><p>  Thanks to compactness and mobility, the device can be taken with you on a trip.  A tablet is not only a tool that is used for work, for example, for creating presentations, but also a great tool for all kinds of entertainment.

To make the right choice, pay attention to the following tips.  By design, tablet computers are of two types - "transformer" and "slate".  In the first case, the device resembles a laptop, but when you turn the screen around its axis, you get a familiar tablet.  This is convenient for entering text on the keyboard.  But the disadvantage of such a device is its greater weight in comparison with the "slate".  The latter does not have a keyboard, and information is entered using the stylus or finger.  ‚ÄúSlates‚Äù have a very thin body, light and compact, but at the same time they are more expensive in price than ‚Äútransformers‚Äù. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the size of the device, it is better to choose between ten and seven-inch tablets.  The latter are so small that they fit easily into the back pocket of jeans.  On the ten-inch screen of the tablet it‚Äôs convenient to view PDF files and surf the Internet.  The matrix must be taken Super AMOLED Plus or IPS. </p><p>  The recommended optimal resolution of the seven-inch screen is 1280 x 800. Although many parameters are individual.  The main indicators that you should focus on are a dual-core processor with a frequency of about 1 GHz, a video accelerator, 16 gigabytes of internal memory. </p><p>  There are a lot of programs for the tablet.  First, before making a choice, you should familiarize yourself with the free version.  In general, the selection of programs depends on what the tablet is for <strong>, the</strong> purpose of its use.  For example, for the Internet you need a browser - Chrom, Mozilla Firefox.  To view the video - media player "MX Player". </p><p>  In addition, there are still graphic tablets.  Their varieties and functions are also impressive.  The question of why you need a <span>graphics tablet is</span> quite simple.  Of course, for drawing.  It is a necessary device for designers, photographers, artists.  Thanks to a special electronic pen, which is sensitive to pressure, it picks up an electromagnetic signal, you can work with images, process photos using the device‚Äôs monitor like paper.  Most often, a graphics tablet is attached to the computer, and the result of the work is visible on its monitor.  When choosing a device, it is important to pay attention to the resolution, which for fans will be sufficient 1000 by 1500 dpi, for professionals it is worth focusing on indicators of 5000. </p><p>  To decide what a tablet is for, the main thing is to figure out for yourself what you intend to do with this device.  For drawing, a graphic compact computer is perfect, for work and entertainment - a tablet. </p>
