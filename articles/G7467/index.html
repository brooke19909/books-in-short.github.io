To choose the right device, you need to know what functions the user will need and focus on the cost.  The modern market of mobile devices offers too many options for different price categories, which is why many have their eyes widen.  Let's figure out how to make the right phone choice, and give some examples of good devices. </p><h2>  The first criterion: price category </h2><p>  The first and probably the main characteristic of the device is its cost.  Most buyers are guided by the named factor.  At the moment, the most developed budget segment, which is not surprising.  And, of course, Chinese manufacturers prevail in it. </p><p>  To choose a good mobile phone for little money, you need to decide on the brand.  Do not rely on cheap offers from poorly known companies.  Now there are a small number of "Chinese" who have emerged as leaders in price and quality.  Of course, we are talking about Xiaomi and Meizu.  There are few differences in the devices, and they are chosen according to the preference of the Android shell. </p><p>  For example, you can bring the entire line of Redmi.  In 2018, 4 and 5 generations are relevant.  Buying this device for 10-13 thousand rubles, you get a powerful battery that lasts for a couple of days of a single charge, a high-quality screen, a convenient shell and a camera that is good for its price.  Requiring sky-high performance from a smartphone for 13 thousand is not worth it, so Xiaomi and Meizu are too good for a budget device. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to choose a phone" class="if uuid-2422965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39808/2422965.jpg"></div><p>  In the middle price segment, everything is more complicated and confusing.  To understand which inexpensive and high-quality phone to choose, you first need to decide on the operating system.  If we are talking about iOS, then the choice is limited to models iPhone SE, 6 and 6s.  True, you can get a used 7 Plus, but this does not apply to the topic of conversation. </p><p>  Android devices are much larger.  If you take the category from 20 to 30 thousand rubles, then it‚Äôs difficult to dwell on several devices.  Here are OnePlus, Xiaomi flagships, A-series Galaxy from Samsung, Huawei Honor and many others.  Typically, such devices have similar camera modules and processors.  There is no shortage of internal memory and RAM in this price category.  Most smartphones are equipped with fashionable fingerprint scanners, NFC chips, dual cameras, etc. Separately, it is worth highlighting the OnePlus 5T model, which stands out with a powerful processor and good test results. </p><h2>  Expensive smartphones </h2><p>  The premium category, if not strange, is the most limited in choice.  Here you will find the new flagship iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel 2 and another 2-3 similar devices.  With a price tag of over 50 thousand, the user gets the best hardware, camera, etc. iPhone lovers stop at the eighth generation if they like the classic design, and on the iPhone X if they prefer the latest technology. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Google Pixel is the fastest operating system updates, advanced camera, clean Android and unusual design.  For many years, the Samsung Galaxy has been a good flagship with a curved screen and one of the best cameras on the market. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thenextweb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Choosing a phone for a child" class="if uuid-2422970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39808/2422970.jpg"></div><h2>  Second Criterion: Use </h2><p>  The choice of phone does not rest only in the amount.  If you don‚Äôt need most of the device‚Äôs functions, then why spend 30-40 or more thousand rubles on it? </p><p>  If you are an avid gamer and constantly install games, then you need to choose a device according to technical specifications.  Large display, powerful processor, RAM and optimization.  It is also worth paying attention to the heating of the device and autonomy.  Here, again, the Chinese come to the rescue with their 4000 mAh.  Agree, on the iPhone without recharging for a long time do not play toys. </p><p>  But if you need a good camera, almost all Chinese smartphones disappear.  Choosing a phone with a good camera and camcorder implies a higher price tag than <span>a gaming phone.</span>  Among the inexpensive camera phones, OnePlus 5T can be distinguished.  On Xiaomi (even on the flagship ones), taking high-quality images is rather difficult.  And if we are talking about night time, it is almost impossible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dromabuzz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Which inexpensive and high-quality phone to choose" class="if uuid-2422968" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39808/2422968.jpg"></div><p>  A good mobile phone with high-quality shooting is the iPhone SE and all subsequent models.  If photos are important to you and don‚Äôt care about the screen size, choose SE, since newer models will cost you much more.  Among the flagships on Android, we can distinguish the Galaxy and Pixel line. </p><p>  If you need social networks, the Internet, calls and communication, then the choice of phone falls on inexpensive devices running Android.  The already mentioned Xiaomi, Huawei or Meizu will do just fine. </p><h2>  Choosing a phone for a child </h2><p>  In the case of buying a device for a student, the selection criteria are somewhat different.  It makes no sense to get a child an expensive flagship.  Focus on his needs and build on this. </p><p>  If the phone is used only for calls to parents and friends, then take a device with high autonomy.  For games, devices from the middle price category are suitable.  Remember that a child‚Äôs mobile phone will most likely have to be changed after a year or, at best, repaired.  Therefore, stay on the budget Redmi lines, which allow you to play games and sit on the Internet, and will not be discharged in a few hours. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.proandroid.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Good cellphone" class="if uuid-2422966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39808/2422966.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  To summarize the foregoing and highlight several key devices.  In the budget category, Xiaomi Redmi, Mi and Note series are unconditionally leading.  Sales of these devices must speak for themselves. </p><p>  One of the <span>best</span> mid-range <span>Android phones</span> is the OnePlus 5t.  For 30 thousand rubles, the user receives a powerful device with a good camera.  A compact alternative is the iPhone SE. </p><p>  There are no restrictions in the category of expensive phones.  For 50 thousand or more, you can buy a smartphone with the best camera and performance, which does not have to be changed for several years.  It's about the iPhone X, Pixel 2 and Galaxy S8. </p>
