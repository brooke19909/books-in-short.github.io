Unlike Antalya and Alanya, here the mountains come close to the village.  And this means that you will be surrounded by the fragrance of pines, as well as citrus and <span>pomegranate gardens.</span>  In the past, a modest fishing village, Kemer has now become a major resort.  He acquired satellite towns.  These are Kirish, Camyuva, Tekirova, Goynuk, Beldibi.  If you want to ensure your relaxation in the highest class, you should choose a hotel of the same category - five stars.  Please note that in Kemer hotels can be located on the second or even third line from the beach.  And in satellite villages stretched along the sea, often consisting of one street-embankment, all hotels are built on the front page. </p>

    <p>  City hotels have a smaller territory than those located in the surrounding area.  But the proximity to the tourist center has its advantages.  If you are looking forward to a fun pastime in Turkey, choose a city, and if you want a quiet and measured rest - villages.  In this article, we will provide a list of the best 5 star hotels in Kemer and its environs.  The rating is based on the reviews of tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Kemer specifics </h2><p>  This resort can be described in one word: diversity.  There are mountains and secluded coves, each of which has its own microclimate.  Kemer's beaches are pebbled.  But some hotels in the front page made sure to bring soft sand for their guests, or at least built solarium platforms for entering the sea.  By the way, hotels in Kemer 5 stars (1 line) are also very diverse.  There are both hotel complexes, which are multi-storey buildings, and a scattering of bungalows among the greenery of the park.  The latter type includes Robinson Club in Camyuva, Amara Wing Resort, Marco Polo Club and many others.  In five-star hotels in Kemer and its environs, you will find everything: all-inclusive meals, incendiary animation, water parks, pools with sea and fresh water, spa complexes, shopping centers, free sightseeing programs. </p>

    <p>  Some hotels are even included in the ranking of the best - not only on the scale of Turkey, but also the whole world.  They are recommended by Trip Advisor, a recognized expert in the field of good relaxation. </p><h2>  Turkiz, 5 * </h2><p>  We will now begin to consider <span>Kemer hotels 5 stars (1 line)</span> with city hotels.  Most of them were built in the eighties of the last century.  Over time, they have lost or lowered their stardom.  Only those who carried out a global reconstruction to meet the modern standards of a comfortable stay were afloat.  Among them: ‚ÄúMaxim Resort‚Äù, ‚ÄúSantopia Hydros Club,‚Äù ‚ÄúFame Residence‚Äù.  Among the reviews of tourists about the city hotels of Kemer, Turkiz 5 * was awarded the most praise.  Immediately make a reservation that young people should look for noisy entertainment in hotels nearby.  "Turkiz" enjoys the love of Western Europeans for forty.  Huge rooms with large balconies have everything you need.  The food is just excellent.  However, as the reviews warn, one cannot count on ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù.  Half board is practiced here.  But the hotel has its own thalassocenter. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer 5 star hotels 1st line" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1012774.jpg" width="500"></div>

Such is the Club of Salim.  Four-room houses stand in the middle of a beautiful pine forest.  The vast territory determines that from some bungalows to the sea the path is not close.  However, it is so pleasant to walk here that reviews call this circumstance more advantage than disadvantage.  The beach at the hotel is pebble, so guests are invited to descend into the water from the pier.  On the territory there are several pools.  There are slides.  They might disappoint extremists, but for the children they are just right.  Reviews say that the hotel offers a lot of sports fun.  Animation - as well as food - are at the proper level for a five-star hotel.  Children will be crazy about the mini club. </p><h2>  Amara Dolce Vita 5 * </h2><p>  We continue to consider Kemer hotels on the first coastline.  Turkey is loved by our tourists for the Ultra: All Inclusive system.  This concept was introduced at the Amara Dolce Vita Hotel.  Here, vacationers are really waiting for a sweet life.  The hotel‚Äôs own beach is marked with the Blue Flag for cleanliness.  There is also a saltwater pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer 5 star hotels 1st line Tekirova" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1012814.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Fantasia Hotel Deluxe</span> Kemer 5 * </h2><p>  City hotels in Kemer 5 stars (1 line) have the advantage that they are located in the heart of the tourist infrastructure.  This hotel (previously it was called Ceylan Intercontinental Resort Deluxe) is no exception.  Nearby is the Simena Hotel, a smaller star.  The guest's bracelet opens the doors to all the establishments of both hotels.  Guests note only one minus - a pebble beach.  But the small pebbles have many fans, so you can not call this a drawback of the hotel.  Reviews assure that gourmets here expect a true paradise.  And here imported alcohol is poured.  Dinner is accompanied by live music.  The spacious rooms are excellent soundproofed.  This hotel is for lovers of a calm and measured rest.  For fun, you need to go to the neighboring "Simena" (Kemer). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer beachfront hotels turkey" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1012798.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  5 star hotels, 1st line: Tekirova </h2><p>  In this satellite village, Rixos Hotel Tekirova leads the way.  He enjoys special love among Russian tourists, who leave the most favorable reviews about him.  But European guides give him the best recommendations.  Peacocks walk through a large and well-groomed territory, which enhances the feeling of the Garden of Eden.  This hotel has its own water park.  And immediately five restaurants with specialized cuisine.  If Rixos is a hotel for families, Coralia Club Palmariva Tekirova will appeal to foodies.  The food here is exquisite.  For evening meals offer all kinds of exotic things like <span>frog legs.</span>  The beach is pebble, the bottom is pretty steep.  But the hotel is located in a secluded bay, so that wind and big waves are not observed here.  Tekirova is located only twelve kilometers from Kemer.  Therefore, vacationers in this village can enjoy peace and tranquility, and if desired, be in the midst of noisy fun. </p><h2>  Camyuva </h2><p>  If you make a rating for the entire Kemer resort ‚ÄúBest 5 Star Hotels, 1st Line‚Äù according to reviews of tourists from Western Europe, then Robinson Club Camyuva will be in first place.  This hotel is located in Camyuva.  Travel guides include this Robinson Club in the top 100 hotels in the world.  This is the best recommendation.  However, our compatriots warn, they don‚Äôt speak Russian here.  You need to go here with at least minimal knowledge of English.  The hotel is not cheap, but you will never regret the money spent.  Everything is on top here: the decoration of the rooms, and the food, and the service staff, and entertainment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer the best 5 star hotels 1st line" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1012801.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Kemer, Kirish: <span>5</span> star <span>hotels</span> (1st line) </h2><p>  The specificity of this resort village is that here you can chic rest at the price of "four".  From Kemer, Kirish is only separated by a cliff, so all the city‚Äôs attractions are within walking distance.  Reviews note beautiful rooms that are cleaned daily and very carefully, excellent variety of food, thoughtful animation and many other entertainment, services and facilities.  Basically, the concept of Ultra: All Inclusive has been introduced here.  As the best of the best tourists called the hotel "Acca Alinda", "Daima Resort" and "Sailors Beach Club". </p>
