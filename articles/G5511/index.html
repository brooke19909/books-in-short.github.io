Thermal imaging systems NPO "AMB"</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nowadays, in the Russian Federation there are several manufacturers who are engaged in the manufacture of thermal imagers.  However, the leader in this industry can be safely called the company NPO AMB.  It produces thermal imagers of the most diverse orientation.  Such devices are used both in everyday life and in the military sphere.  Today, such systems can most often be found in various enterprises that are involved in monitoring the penetration of objects. </p><p>  The movement of people, as well as any technology, is capable of fixing modern systems.  In addition, thermal imagers can show objects even under water.  Thus, their installation on the coastal site is very appropriate.  According to their characteristics, Russian-made thermal imagers are not far behind foreign analogues.  Specifically, the system "AMB" are able to boast of good tightness of the case.  Sensors, as a rule, are installed on the basis of a cooled matrix. </p>

    <h2>  Constant Focus Thermal Imagers </h2><p>  Constant focus thermal imagers are mainly manufactured by the Titan company.  However, the NSA recently also presented its model.  These devices differ primarily in high thermal sensitivity.  Their emissivity coefficient is on average 1.2.  The spatial resolution of the NSA model is at 4 mrad.  Thermal imagers are made with displays for visualization. </p><p>  Such devices are not suitable for isometric analysis.  However, they are able to do automatic search.  This process takes place according to previously entered parameters.  There is no temperature correction mode in the devices.  If we consider the model of the company "Titan", then it has an extensive memory slot.  Thus, these devices are well suited for storing documents.  Targeting with a thermal imager can be done.  To this end, the company "Titan" has developed a red laser pointer at 2 kV. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  High Precision NSA Models </h2><p>  High-precision thermal imagers of the Russian production "ANB" are distinguished by a small measurement error.  However, they also have shortcomings and should be taken into account.  First of all, experts note a low temperature range of devices.  In this regard, the indicator of thermal sensitivity suffers.  Their emissivity coefficient is in the region of 1.3.  Lenses for such models are most suitable for permanent.  Viewing angles can vary quite a lot. </p><p>  The average spatial resolution parameter is 4 mrad.  The scaling function in such devices is available, however, the imager is not suitable for isometric analysis.  Automatic search can be turned on by the minimum and maximum temperature.  At the same time, far from all modifications possess target indicators.  On average, these thermal imagers (market price) are in the region of 240 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Features of Variable Focus Thermal Imagers </h2><p>  Thermal imagers of this type are very compact and can be used in various industries.  Detectors in this case are used with a focal plane matrix.  The spectral range of such devices is 6-13 microns.  Temperature sensitivity is in the region of 25 degrees.  Thanks to this, the frame refresh rate is quite high.  If we consider the models of the company "AMB", then they have high-quality viewfinders.  At the same time, the device is powered exclusively by the batteries that come with the kit. </p><p>  The manufacturer's protection system is provided for by the IP67 series.  At full charge, such a thermal imager can work for about 120 hours.  The model can be used at a temperature not exceeding 50 degrees.  The humidity of these devices withstand no more than 40%.  Extenders in the ANB thermal imagers are installed the most diverse.  Signal processing in this regard can be time consuming.  The average cost of the NSA model of this type is around 310 thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Models "AMB" on a rotary basis </h2><p>  Russian-made thermal imagers on a rotary basis are excellent for protecting large objects.  The palette in this case is white hot.  Digital signal processing in them is fast due to high-quality extenders.  The devices are designed for the spectral range from 5 to 15 microns. </p><p>  Detectors in this case are used with a focal plane.  Viewfinders are present in some models.  Such devices are resistant to shocks, they are able to withstand falling onto a concrete surface from a meter height.  Humidity devices do not tolerate well.  Their temperature sensitivity is in the region of 25 degrees at 50 microns.  An average thermal imager of this type costs around 240 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Uncooled Devices </h2><p>  Russian thermal imagers of this type are distinguished by the fact that they are capable of processing the signal very quickly.  However, they also have flaws.  First of all, it should be noted the small spectral range of such devices.  Additionally, they are able to work only with a white-hot palette.  The protection system of such thermal imagers is pretty good.  The company "Titan" has been producing such models for a very long time. </p><p>  In general, they are in good demand because of their cheapness.  At the same time, they are ideal for security agencies.  Humidity of these devices carry no more than 50%.  However, they are very susceptible to shock, and this should be taken into account.  In terms of dimensions, uncooled thermal imagers are quite different.  If we consider the model "Titan", then the average mass of the device is 800 g. </p>

    <h2>  Stationary systems </h2><p>  Such systems are used in large areas where a wide viewing angle is required.  Tricks for such devices are more suitable for a permanent type.  In this case, the matrices are most often installed with a resolution of at least 160 to 120. Thermal sensitivity - no more than 30 degrees.  The main manufacturer of such systems is considered to be the company "AMB".  She offers customers in this regard a large selection.  In particular, it is possible to choose models with detectors, as well as with designators. </p><p>  There are still modifications that are capable of performing isometric analysis.  For the military industry, these devices are in demand.  The automatic search function is set according to the parameters.  The average image rate varies around 50 Hz.  There is a model of this type on the market in the region of 400 thousand rubles. </p>
