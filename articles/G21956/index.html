    <p>  <strong>Dear modern coins of Russia.</strong>  <strong>Who and why are they valued?</strong> </p><p>  There are some instances of coins that were issued in small print runs.  And, as you know, everything that is rare is expensive. </p><p>  A small amount of certain coins is determined, as a rule, by trial, jubilee circulations or ordinary marriage.  Such money is highly valued among collectors, it is they who are ready to give large sums for some 50 modern cents.  These copies can also be sold to a state bank. </p><p>  <strong>Dear modern coins of Russia: the older - the better?</strong> </p><p>  Here, this rule, unfortunately, does not work.  You may have coins of 1996, 1997, but they are not valuable.  All because many were released. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most expensive coins of modern Russia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10478/282898.jpg" width="600"></div>  But if you saw that years were printed on your money, for example, 2001 or 2003, you can do a more detailed study of a possible source of profit.

Just do not rush to faint: there is an important detail.  Under the hoof of a horse on an eagle, they always indicate where exactly the coin was issued.  If there is the letter "m", then you are very lucky.  And if it is in good condition, it can be really expensive to sell. </p><p>  But the most expensive modern coins of Russia are, of course, 5 rubles of the 1999 issue.  Some even call it the "numismatist dream."  Surprisingly, so far only one instance has been found.  It happened back in 2009, and since then no one was lucky enough to become the owner of 250,000 rubles.  Yes, yes, this is the price set by competent collectors. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of expensive coins of modern Russia" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10478/282899.jpg" width="484"></div>

    <p>  This coin has, in addition to the year of issue, several more distinguishing features.  For example, the leaf of a plant on the tails touches the edging.  In the word "rubles" the lower parts of the letters are pointed.  And in figure 5, on the contrary, the upper left corner is rounded. </p><p>  It is unlikely that the circulation was limited to one copy, so everyone has a chance to get rich. </p><p>  However, finding such 50 kopecks or 5 rubles is very difficult.  They are not present in circulation, and they can be found only by chance, on earth.  But do not despair, because you can earn on other, less rare money. </p><p>  <strong>List of expensive coins of modern Russia</strong> </p><p>  In circulation there is a very small batch of 2-ruble coins.  They were released in 2001.  It is not known exactly how many of them are in total.  However, the fact that an average of 40,000 rubles can be obtained for a two-ruble coin in good condition is absolutely true.  Important: it should not be anniversary. </p><p>  In 2001, a batch of ruble coins was also minted.  The price for it also depends on the state, but can reach up to 30,000 rubles.  And for 10 thousand you can sell 2 rubles, cast in 2003. </p><p>  We have listed the most expensive coins of modern Russia.  Examine carefully your little thing: who knows, maybe you will become richer by several hundred thousand. </p>
