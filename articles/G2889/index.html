  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ermak's campaign</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Ermolay Timofeevich (1537-1585) was the great Russian discoverer of Siberia.  In history, he is known as Ermak.  Ermak‚Äôs campaign helped the Russian people to conquer the vast expanses and riches of Siberia.  He was a brave and purposeful person who knew how to lead.  His <span>leadership qualities</span> helped him not only leave a huge mark in the history of a great country, gain the respect of his opponents. </p><p>  Ermak‚Äôs campaign lasted from 1582 to 1585, and he died during the battle with Khan Kuchum.  The people composed many heroic songs about him.  Scientists have not been able to find out the real name of the hero.  People called him Ermolai or Ermak Timofeev, since at that time many Russians were given names by father or nickname.  He also had another name - this is Yermolay Timofeevich Tokmak.  He possessed tremendous physical strength, truly heroic. </p><p>  At that time, there was famine and devastation in the country, so the future hero was forced to move to the Volga and there he hired a handyman to work for an elderly Cossack. </p><p>  It was in peacetime, and during military campaigns Yermak was a squire.  He studied military affairs and even acquired his own weapons.  Soon, thanks to his physical and mental abilities, Yermak becomes an ataman. </p><p>  At that time, about 250 thousand people lived in Siberia and it was of considerable interest to the Russian state.  This territory was famous for its wealth and pristine beauty. </p><p>  But there was a huge problem associated with Siberia.  In those years, <span>Khan Kuchum</span> severed all relations with Russia and periodically raided the Urals, which impeded its development.  By order of Ivan the Terrible, the eastern border was to be strengthened, where the chieftain was sent for this.  Thus began the conquest of Siberia by Yermak. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The chieftain's army consisted of 600 soldiers who had excellent training.  The purpose of the campaign was the conquest and <span>development of Siberia.</span>  Ermak made every effort to achieve the task. </p><p>  In those conditions, only an unexpected attack could ensure success.  The main battle took place on October 26 on <span>the Irtysh River,</span> where Yermak defeated the Tatar troops of a relative of Kuchum and entered the city of Kashlyk, the capital of the <span>Siberian Khanate.</span>  Khan Mametkul managed to escape, fearing reprisal, but Yermak‚Äôs campaign did not end there. </p><p>  Ataman conquered the Principality of Nazym and reached with his army the Kolpukolsky volost, where a battle took place with Prince Samar, which was destroyed.  A little later, Yermak concluded a truce with the prince from the Lower Ob.  This prince began to rule in this territory on behalf of Yermak. </p><p>  Later, Mametkul himself was captured and delivered to Siberia. </p><p>  The conquest of Siberia continued.  Cossacks fought with the Tatars, one after another the people of Yermak were killed, who in this situation had to send 25 of their Cossack soldiers to Moscow to ask for help. </p><p>  History knows the fact when all the soldiers marching to Siberia were awarded the king.  The tsar also pardoned all criminals acting against the state, and made a promise to send 300 archers to the aid of Ermak‚Äôs army. </p><p>  The death of Tsar <span>Ivan the Terrible</span> confused all the plans of the chieftain, the royal promises were not fulfilled for a long time.  The development of Siberia by Yermak was in danger, acquired an unpredictable character. </p><p>  Help arrived too late.  Cossack detachments were destroyed by this time, and the main staff of Ermak‚Äôs troops, along with soldiers arriving to help from Moscow, was blocked in Kashlyk on March 12, 1585.  Food was not delivered.  There are very few people left.  Ermak‚Äôs army had to independently procure provisions.  Having selected the right moment, Kuchum killed the people of Yermak, then killed the chieftain.  Such a tragic end ended the campaign of Ermak. </p><p>  A lot of songs and traditions have been written about his feat.  His heroism has been repeatedly described in various literary works.  Artists painted his image, creating great canvases.  Many outstanding places of that time were named after Yermak. </p><p>  The results of the <span>conquest of Siberia</span> were invaluable to the Russian state.  In its vast expanses, peasants began to live, new cities were erected, and in the Russian treasury there appeared more monetary duties - taxes.  Ermak‚Äôs campaign contributed to the development of new rich lands located beyond the mountains of the Urals. </p>
