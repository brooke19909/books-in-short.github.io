The harsh climate of the Ural Mountains does not suit everyone.  Therefore, immigrants from other regions of the country are not so much seeking here.  Due to the fact that Yekaterinburg is the largest industrial center, its residents increasingly prefer to move to housing outside the city in order to live in more favorable environmental conditions.  Such an opportunity is offered by Nikolin Klyuch, a cottage village at some distance from the metropolis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="One of the houses" class="if uuid-3190816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/3190816.jpg"></div><h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  Yekaterinburg takes its place in the top five largest cities in Russia in terms of population.
