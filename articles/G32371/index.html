Methods and recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Portable electronics has firmly entered our lives and become its daily attribute.  Devices accompany us everywhere: at work, at home, on vacation.  Even going to bed, we do not part with them.  And no matter what you use, phone or tablet, devices require care. </p><p>  This is necessary even because a large number of bacteria that can cause various diseases accumulate on the screen and body.  Also, dust, fingerprints and other pollution significantly spoil the appearance of the device and degrade the sensitivity of the sensor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.electronicproducts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean the phone screen yourself" class="if uuid-3182787" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3182787.jpg"></div><h2>  Can I clean my phone screen? </h2><p>  It is possible and even necessary.  Knowing some of the nuances of how to clean the phone screen at home, it is not difficult to do this job.  A similar procedure must be performed on a switched off or locked device in order to avoid accidental clicks, and so that dust can be better seen on the dark surface of the display.  First you need to clean the surface of dust to prevent scratches.  Further, if you use liquid cleaners, they must be applied not to the screen itself, but to a clean cloth. </p><p>  Such cleaning is recommended at regular intervals, but not daily.  For everyday protection of the device, it is recommended to use protective glasses and covers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What can I use to wipe the screen? </h2><p>  The choice of tools and fabrics for cleaning the smartphone should be approached with special care, since the final result will depend on them.  Household dirt can be handled with distilled water, a cleaning spray or wet screen wipes.  If you are dealing with a glass display, you can use a polish for glass.  A lint-free cloth is recommended for wiping and applying the cleaning agent so that there are no streaks on the cleaned surface.  Cotton napkins or microfiber cloths are best suited for this.  How to clean the phone screen?  Following the instructions, it is better to use less aggressive products first. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clean the phone screen at home" class="if uuid-3182784" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3182784.jpg"></div><p>  Liquid cleaners need to be applied to the fabric, since when sprayed onto the screen, they can fill the speaker and other technological holes, and then disable the device.  Wipe the screen with smooth movements, adhering to one direction, so as to prevent the appearance of stains. </p><h2>  Can I use alcohol? </h2><p>  Since the cleaning process consists not only in how to clean the phone screen from stains, but also in disinfection, alcohol-containing products are actively used in it.  If there are none at hand, you can use ordinary ethyl alcohol.  With the reservation that it is advisable to use it only on glass screens.  The method of application is the same as for conventional liquid cleaners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before cleaning the phone screen, you need to get information about what material the display is made of.  You can do this on the manufacturer‚Äôs website in the technical specifications section of your model.  Also, the disinfection of the smartphone screen must be carried out before applying a protective film or glass. </p><h2>  Removing minor screen scratches </h2><p>  Without the use of additional protection for the screen, in the process of active use of the device, small scuffs and scratches inevitably appear on the surface, which, although they do not affect the functionality, significantly damage the appearance.  Thanks to the simple tricks described in this article, you will learn how to clean the phone screen from scratches using the tools that are in almost every home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean your phone screen with a cleaner" class="if uuid-3182788" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3182788.jpg"></div><p>  The following remedies are best for removing scratches from the display: toothpaste, baby powder, tea soda, or vegetable oil.  Toothpaste, in fact, is a good abrasive, which is what is required for easy polishing of the display.  A small amount of the composition must be gently rubbed on the screen with a soft cloth until the defects completely disappear.  After that, the excess must be removed with a damp cloth. </p><p>  Powder and soda act on the same principle.  Grinding occurs with the help of small grains present in them.  Before using soda or powder, you need to make a paste from them, mixing with water in a ratio of 2: 1.  After that, apply to the damaged surface and polish with smooth movements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.komando.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to clean the screen" class="if uuid-3182789" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/3182789.jpg"></div><p>  Of the four options presented, oil is considered the least effective.  To return the surface of gloss, it is necessary to rub a drop of vegetable oil with a soft cloth. </p><p>  Of course, these methods are not suitable for removing deep scratches.  If the tips on how to clean the phone screen from scratches in this article didn‚Äôt help, you can use special polishes.  But it is better to entrust this to professionals from the service center, who, having assessed the damage, will polish the parts on specialized equipment or put a new screen. </p>
