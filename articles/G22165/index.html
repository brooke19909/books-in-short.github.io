Rules and Secrets</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No one will argue with the statement that knitting is not only a form of creativity, but also a wonderful vacation.  The craftswoman sits quietly, knits, as if by chance creating not only things that are useful, but also simply elegant and beautiful.  But before starting this interesting work, the knitter should do a rather boring calculation.  How to calculate the amount of yarn per product?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Why is math needed in this matter? </h2><p>  It is convenient to engage in knitting if the photo is taken from some source - a magazine or a book.  Indeed, in this case, almost nothing needs to be calculated, since everything is already indicated in the description: the number of knitting needles or hook, the number of yarn, thread, and what size should result in a sample.  But here lies a small pitfall.  There are practically no ladies with standard sizes: someone has a chest higher, someone has a non-standard waist, someone has hands either long or short.  Therefore, when sewing dresses, skirts and blouses, seamstresses have to adjust their patterns.  Similarly, knitters in some cases need adjustments to yarn consumption when they work with knitting needles and crochet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fracademic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to knit a product" class="if uuid-3041345" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3041345.jpg"></div><p>  And this is if you do not mention the cases when the craftswomen knit something by eye, or "from the head."  There is certainly no way to do without minimal preparation.  How to calculate the amount of yarn per product?  First things first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Little secrets </h2><p>  Before learning the rule by which everything can be calculated, it is necessary to tell some ‚Äúsecluded‚Äù secrets that not every knitter knows even with experience: </p><ol><li>  When the front surface is knitted, the thread leaves much less than the patterned one. </li><li>  The thicker the thread, the less it will be needed. </li><li>  Openwork will require less yarn than facial knitting. </li><li>  If the thread for knitting has a weak twist, it will be more economical than a thread with a strong one. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ideaexchange.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting" class="if uuid-3041350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3041350.jpg"></div><p>  With the same yarn thickness, consumption will be much more economical if you work with thick knitting needles.  But they can not always be used.  Most often, such knitting needles are used if the yarn is fleecy or fluffy. </p><p>  So it turns out that even before the knitter begins to work, she should decide not only on the general appearance of the future model, but also on the details - yarn, knitting needles and patterns. </p><h2>  What to say about bobbin yarn? </h2><p>  How to calculate the amount of bobbin yarn per product?  Consumption is its advantage.  On bobbins indicate numbers, for example, 20/4.  This is the metric length of the thread: 20 is the number, and 4 is the number of threads of which, in fact, the yarn consists.  When dividing the first by the second, the length of the thread in one gram of yarn is obtained.  For example, if the designation is 30/2, then in one gram it is 15 m, i.e. 1,500 m per 100 g. Of such yarn, as a rule, they are knitted in three additions using 3,5 knitting needles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="gmaellenscraftycorner.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Circular knitting" class="if uuid-3041366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3041366.jpg"></div><p>  Now you can tie the sample, wash it and see the result.  The bobbin yarn has a special impregnation that leaves after washing, and the thread can reveal its beauty. </p><p>  How to calculate the amount of yarn per product?  We take a ruler and measure how many rows and loops are in a piece of 10 * 10 cm.  Now the trial product needs to dissolve and measure the length of the thread.  To calculate the meter of yarn that will be required per product, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe entire product in square centimeters should be multiplied by the length of the thread per sample in meters.  Now divide the number that happened by the square of the resulting sample in square centimeters. </p><h2>  We calculate thread consumption </h2><p>  Each knitter - both experienced and beginner - must know how to calculate the amount of yarn per product.  Indeed, it is undesirable to make mistakes in choosing the number of skeins, and it is better to purchase a little more - suddenly it will not be enough.  In addition, if the yarn purchased is not enough, and you have to rush to the store again, you can miscalculate the color scheme, because this color may no longer be.  Often this happens if the yarn is white (the shades in the two released batches often do not match. </p><p>  How to calculate the amount of yarn per product?  Knitting a knitted thing turns out to be very convenient.  To make it work as intended, you should use the tips. </p><p>  First you need to write the number of knitting needles and the name of the yarn at home.  It is advisable to add a label and a sample of thread - then this can come in handy. </p><p>  Tie a sample of a pattern of 30 x 30 cm. Measure the number of rows in 30 cm and how many in one loop.  Counting is not difficult.  You just need to multiply the number of loops in one row by the number of rows.  The result can also be written to a notebook. </p><p>  By the way, some of the experienced craftswomen are sure that the result will be more accurate if we take a 10 x 10 cm sample. For example, if it is determined that a sample of 10 x 10 cm produces forty loops and thirty-seven rows, then four centimeters are obtained eyelets and 3.7 rows. </p><p>  If the knitter has already prepared a pattern, according to which she will create the product, and she knows how to make the necessary calculations, you can calculate the number of rows and the number of loops in the knitted product according to the pattern.  So it will be much more accurate with the choice of the number of skeins. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt feel like counting, you can use the tips that include the average amount of yarn: </p><ol><li>  Dress for the girl (size 30).  Thread in 4 additions - 300 g. </li><li>  Hat and scarf.  Thread in 6 additions - 200 g. </li><li>  A suit of sweaters and trousers.  Thread in 6 additions - 450 g. </li><li>  Women's sweater (size 38).  Thread in 8 additions - 700 g. </li><li>  Long vest (size 38).  Thread in 8 additions - 500 g. </li><li>  Men's pullover (size 50).  Thread in 4 additions - 550 g. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ru.zipy.co.il" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet" class="if uuid-3041353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3041353.jpg"></div><p>  And if a hook is used in the work, how to calculate the amount of yarn per product?  <span>Everything must be checked empirically.</span>  <span>Craftswomen assure that one skein of yarn (about 110 meters, weight 350-400 g) will be enough for a basket whose bottom and height are 17 cm. Or a square napkin 36 x 36 cm in size, a small bag or an average clutch.</span> </p>
