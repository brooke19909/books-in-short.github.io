The sufficiently high quality of construction and affordable prices make the apartments in these new buildings attractive for many who decide to invest in real estate.  In this article, we will talk in detail about this microdistrict, its developer and provide feedback from residents. </p><h2>  About the complex </h2><div class="photo" data-original="avaho.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Deadline for LCD Amber" class="if uuid-3079955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079955.jpg"></div><p>  LCD "Amber" in Balashikha - this is 20 economy class houses built from a gas-silicate block.  The technology that was applied during the work is monolithic frame.  The houses are insulated with mineral wool. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the new buildings in the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha have different floors - from seven to 25 floors.  The developer provides ground guest parking and underground parking for local residents. </p><p>  Although the apartments are rented without finishing, they are able to attract many with additional space, since the ceiling height in them is three meters. </p><h2>  Readiness </h2><div class="photo" data-original="balashikha.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews holders about LCD Amber" class="if uuid-3079957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079957.jpg"></div><p>  The construction of the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha was carried out in two stages.  In the first, it was planned to put into operation 19 buildings, in the second - another eleven. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The deadlines for the delivery of the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha for the last houses were set in 2017.  In its second quarter they were commissioned.  Currently, the remaining unsold apartments are being sold.  They are available from the developer, and there are also resale options on the market from individuals or real estate agencies. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8207904" data-lng="37.87830180000003" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/4/3/8/3/14383.png"></div><p>  Located immediately at several addresses of the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha. </p><p>  Part of the buildings are located on the street.  Ring, 3, bldg.  1-26, part on blvd.  Youth, 1, 4/5, 5/3, 6-8, bldg.  29a-29b, as well as on Akulovsky passage, 2-6 </p><p>  It is convenient to get here both by public and by private transport.  Drive by car from the Moscow Ring Road to Schelkovskoye Shosse.  New buildings are located in close proximity to the highway, not reaching the Akulovsky water utility. </p><p>  There are many options for how to get to the residential complex by public transport.  To do this, it is recommended to use buses No. 338, 396, 889. Alternatively, you can use minibuses 396k and 889. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><div class="photo" data-original="balashikha.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about LCD Amber" class="if uuid-3079956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079956.jpg"></div><p>  A separate emphasis should be placed on the transport accessibility of the quarter.  The residential complex was built in the Shchitnikovo microdistrict on the territory of the city of Balashikha.  It is located just two kilometers from the Moscow Ring Road along the Schelkovo Highway, in close proximity to the borders of the Russian capital. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can get to new buildings using the metro.  By public transport, you can reach the Shchelkovskaya station in about a quarter of an hour.  It is also possible to use electric trains.  True, the nearest railway station "Gorenki" is located relatively far away - at a distance of about three kilometers. </p><h2>  Description </h2><div class="photo" data-original="advancerealty.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Developer LCD Amber" class="if uuid-3079954" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079954.jpg"></div><p>  In the description of the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha, the developer necessarily notes that the apartments can be selected in a wide variety of layouts.  There are twenty houses in the residential complex, so anyone is guaranteed to find something to their liking.  The big plus is that the houses are already partially inhabited and inhabited.  In addition, you can know in advance what to expect from this property, based on the feedback from real estate investors who have already moved to this microdistrict. </p><p>  As already noted, the number of storeys in the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha is different.  You can buy an apartment in a seven-story building, or you can stay right away at level 25.  Houses are being built using monolithic brick and panel technologies, all depending on the building you have chosen.  Apartments are distinguished by a large number of individual projects. </p><p>  One of the main advantages of this residential complex is that its construction is carried out in parallel with infrastructure facilities.  This is a kindergarten, school, convenience stores, parking, cafes, offices.  Due to this, residents are able to guarantee maximum comfort, as well as an attractive opportunity to receive all the necessary services without leaving the territory of their quarter, which is good news. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The developer guarantees that the apartments that are for sale in this residential complex are fully consistent with the ideas of customers about modern and high-quality comfortable housing.  There are many typical layouts within which you can make standard repairs to feel really comfortable, and everything you need was at hand.  The main advantage of these apartments is thoughtful design decisions and spacious footage. </p><p>  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe premises differs depending on the chosen building.  Initially, the apartments are rented in a gray manner, but buyers have the opportunity to order a final repair from the developer. </p><h2>  Ecological state </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.novostroy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Residential complex Amber" class="if uuid-3079952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079952.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth recognizing that the environmental situation in this microdistrict is extremely ambiguous.  On the one hand, many potential shareholders and investors are scared by the proximity of the Shchelkovo highway and the Moscow Ring Road, which are located literally within walking distance.  In addition, in the immediate vicinity there are several industrial zones with harmful production. </p><p>  On the other hand, it is leveled by the nearby Losiny Ostrov national park and Gorensky forest park.  In these green areas you can spend time with health benefits, take a break from working everyday life and the bustle surrounding you. </p><p>  In addition, low prices also attract many. </p><h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  On the territory of the residential complex, one-, two- and three-room apartments are for sale.  Their layouts in the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha are the most diverse. </p><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãmost one-room apartments is about 33 square meters.  At the same time, two-room apartments can be selected in the range from 58 to 65 m¬≤. </p><p>  Also on sale there are three-room apartments from 86 square meters.  Such an apartment can now be purchased for 7.3 million rubles. </p><h2>  Developer </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Amber Balashikha" class="if uuid-3079951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079951.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that in the residential complex is a difficult situation with the developer.  In the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha, the construction company Morton initially carried out all the work.  This is a group of companies created in 1994 by Alexander Ruchevov.  Initially, the company was engaged in the overhaul of houses in the city of Klin, Moscow Region.  Then she received several contracts for the decoration of the facades of houses.  Over time, the company's interests expanded significantly.  Morton began to specialize in large-scale projects, to comprehensively develop territories.  In addition to housing, infrastructure facilities were erected everywhere.  In particular, projects were implemented in Putilkovo, Butovo. </p><p>  By 2013, the company managed to commission more than one million square meters of housing.  In 2016, all structures and assets of Morton were acquired by the PIK group of companies, which integrated it into its structure.  As a result of the merger, the Morton brand was decided not to be retained.  On its basis, a new company was created under the name "Basis".  She began to specialize in smart home development.  Also engaged in investing in high-tech projects, managing commercial real estate.  Perhaps the brand was decided to change, since Morton has recently developed a negative reputation.  The company was accused of the fact that during the construction of each object, it creates a new legal entity, so that in case of failure to meet the deadlines for the delivery of houses, and this arose regularly, hide behind a small company. </p><p>  At the same time, PIK took over the completion of work on all new buildings.  This is one of the largest development companies in the country, which implements projects not only in the capital and the Moscow Region, but also in other regions of the Russian Federation.  It has been present on the market since 1994, specializing in the construction of houses in the affordable housing segment.  At the moment, builders have already commissioned almost 20 million square meters. </p><p>  PIK's new buildings can be found in ten Russian regions; the company's investment portfolio is quite large and diverse.  It is noteworthy that since 2015 the company entered the market with fundamentally new products.  In particular, she began to implement plans for monolithic and industrial housing construction, fundamentally changing the approach to the formation of domestic housing among most areas of complex development. </p><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pik.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Amber in Balashikha" class="if uuid-3079953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/3079953.jpg"></div><p>  Summing up, we can note: houses are being built in the immediate vicinity of the forest park zone.  Although the apartments are rented without finishing, they do the full wiring of all utilities. </p><p>  At the same time, getting to the meters is very problematic.  Instead of the 15 minutes promised by the developer, the bus has to be driven at least 40 in the morning, and in the evening due to traffic jams you have to spend more than an hour. </p><p>  The route has a great influence, houses stand right on its border. </p><h2>  Impressions of residents </h2><p>  You can find a lot of positive reviews about the Yantarny residential complex in Balashikha.  Interest holders note that, despite the proximity of busy roads, industrial enterprises, there is an attractive forest nearby, where you can enjoy the whole family relaxing in the fresh air. </p><p>  In addition, it is very close to Moscow from here, so those who work in the capital should have no difficulty in getting to the right place.  On the territory of the complex and in its vicinity developed infrastructure - a large number of grocery stores and supermarkets, there are pharmacies, beauty salons. </p><p>  Many are happy that the microdistrict is very small, so there will not be a large flow of people.  The residential quarter is comfortable and comfortable for living. </p><p>  At the same time, after the PIK group of companies began to finish building their homes on time, even though many real estate investors were preparing initially for delays. </p><h2>  Negative </h2><p>  At the same time, some residents are concerned about the lack of infrastructure in sufficient quantities.  For example, instead of the promised school on the territory of the residential quarter, it was still decided to build a residential building.  There is a serious lack of recreation areas and parking lots. </p><p>  Also, newcomers have to deal with a large number of imperfections at the stage of acceptance of houses.  For example, some windows turned out to be single-pane, besides there were no handles.  These are the most glaring shortcomings, not counting the curved walls and various other shortcomings.  However, to the credit of the developer it is worth noting that the company promptly responded by correcting all the shortcomings. </p><p>  In general, in numerous forums, residents regularly complain about the low quality of construction. </p>
