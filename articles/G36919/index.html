    <h2>  Material Properties and Capabilities </h2><p>  Foamiran is a sheet material about 1 mm thick with a soft silky texture.  It is used in various types of needlework, and also as a basis for decoupage and painting with acrylic, gouache, and is well covered with pastel.  The color scheme has more than 20 shades, including black and white.  Sheets are easily cut, molded, subject to cutting by curly composters and hole punchers, and are also used for stamping.  The ability of the material to stretch and deform under the influence of elevated temperature (heat from the hands, iron or hairdryer) allows you to create amazingly beautiful floral arrangements.  In this article you will read about how to make an orchid from foamiran (MK below), but by the same principle you can make any object, both floral and other. </p><h2>  How to work with foamiran </h2><p>  Actually it is very simple.  Even a beginner will master such a technique.  Typically, the desired objects are cut with scissors, for example, geometric shapes, hearts, flowers or petals.  A special <span>figured hole punch is used</span> to create an openwork edge or holes.  Volumetric parts are formed by fingers due to the stretching of the material and its subsequent conservation of this configuration. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sheets are plain.  If you need to get color transitions, you will need to make them yourself.  Dry pastel is well suited for this purpose.  If you follow all the steps below sequentially, you will get a magnificent orchid from foamiran.  A master class with a step-by-step photo will show how everything is done.  According to the ready-made instructions, it is not difficult to complete the product. </p><h2>  Technology for making flowers </h2><p>  Usually, the desired number of blanks in the form of future petals is cut from a whole sheet.  For convenience, you can first cut a small strip, and already from it to execute patterns of individual parts.  Color transitions, if necessary, are created using pastels.  At the next stage, flat parts are given volume, they are glued together.  Connecting parts is only possible with a hot glue gun or a strong fixation.  Normal PVA will not work. </p><p>  As for the volume, you can create it simply by pulling the material in the right place with your fingers or use special molds.  They are forms (blanks) of plastic in the form of petals or leaves, repeating not only the form, but also the texture of the natural part of the plant.  In this case, the template will first have to be heated (with a hairdryer or iron), and then applied to the mold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself orchid from foamiran master class" class="if" height="428" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/825111.jpg" width="570"></div>

In the next section, you will read about how to create an orchid from foamiran.  The master class was prepared specifically for this flower, since to create a realistic object, both molds and pastels are used to obtain the desired shade, and even acrylic paint for processing the core.  Having mastered this technology, you can make any other simpler flower, where the petals are monophonic and their shape is created simply by hands by stretching the sheet. </p><h2>  Tools, fixtures, consumables </h2><p>  To successfully master the master class "Orchid from foamiran", prepare everything you need in advance and do the work sequentially.  You will need the following: </p><ul><li>  sheets of foamiran of the desired shade (white, yellow - which one do you like); </li><li>  <span>floristic wire</span> for the stem (if you are going to make a flower for a vase); </li><li>  molds for petals; </li><li>  cardboard for blanks; </li><li>  dry pastel and fixative for it (hair spray is suitable); </li><li>  acrylic paints and brush; </li><li>  cotton bud for making a pestle (middle of a flower); </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  iron; </li><li>  thermal gun. </li></ul><p>  If you are engaged in needlework, most likely you already have all this.  In the case when you first decided to try to make flowers from this material, you will have to purchase foamiran.  Both sets of different shades, and separate sheets are on sale.  Their dimensions are always indicated, for example, 60x70 or 30x35.  Molds are also presented in assortment.  Since you are preparing to study the master class "Foamiran Orchid", you will need a form for this flower.  If you want to get a realistic texture, you have to buy them.  You should also order special glue if you do not have a heat gun.  <span>Acrylic paints</span> and pastels can also be sold not only in sets, but also individually.  Take only the shades that you need for the sample. </p><h2>  How to make an orchid from foamiran with your own hands: a master class </h2><p>  <em>Stage One: Creating Petals</em> </p><p>  First make all the individual elements of the flower. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class orchid from foamiran" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/825123.jpg" width="231"></div>  The sequence of work will be as follows:

This is done sequentially from the core to the framing the petals.  First, each of them sticks together at the base, then all the details come together, tightly to one another or around a cotton swab pestle.  You can choose any option.  The finishing touch will be drawing a pattern of dots or thin lines with acrylic paint on the petals at the center of the flower.  All is ready. </p><p>  You got a magnificent foamiran orchid.  The master class is over.  Now you can choose a suitable place for your decoration, as well as perform a few more.  Subsequent instances will be even better, as you have already gained experience.  Now you can use other color shades and make compositions with a large number of flowers on the stem. </p><h2>  What can be decorated with your flower </h2><p>  Such a thing is perfect for decorating any items.  Use the made orchids for <span>the wall panel</span> as a brooch or hair clip.  A spectacular flower will look gorgeous on the box cover or on the cover of a <span>family album</span> or postcard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class orchid from foamiran" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26390/825026.jpg" width="500"></div>
