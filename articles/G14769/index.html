Its territory included the lands of glades and drevlyans along the Dnieper River and its tributaries - Pripyat, Teterev, Irpeni and Ros, as well as part of the left bank. </p><h2>  Principality of Kiev: geographical location </h2><p>  This territory was bordered by Polotsk land in the north-western part, and from the north-east was Chernigov.  The western and southwestern neighbors were Poland and the Principality of Galicia.  The city, built on the hills, was ideally located militarily.  Speaking about the features of the geographical location of the Principality of Kiev, it must be mentioned that it was well protected.  Not far from it were the cities of Vruchiy (or Ovruch), Belgorod, and Vyshgorod - all of them had good fortifications and controlled the territory adjacent to the capital, which provided additional protection from the west and south-west.  From the southern part it was covered by a system of forts built along the banks of the Dnieper, and nearby well-protected cities on the Ros River. </p>

    <h2>  Principality of Kiev: characteristic </h2><p>  This princedom should be understood as a state formation in Ancient Russia, which lasted from the 12th to the 15th centuries.  Kiev was a political and cultural capital.  It was formed from the separated territories of the Old Russian state.  Already in the middle of the 12th century.  the power of the princes from Kiev was of significant importance only within the borders of the principality itself.  The all-Russian significance was lost by the city, and the rivalry for control and power lasted until the invasion of the Mongols.  The throne passed in an incomprehensible order, and many could claim it.  And also, to a considerable degree, the possibility of gaining power depended on the influence of the strong boyars of Kiev and the so-called ‚Äúblack hoods‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Social and economic life </h2><p>  Location near the Dnieper played a big role in economic life.  In addition to communication with the Black Sea, he led Kiev to the Baltic, which was helped by the <span>Western Dvina</span> and Berezina.  The Desna and the Sejm provided communication with the Don and Oka, and the <span>Western Bug</span> and Pripyat - with the Neman and Dniester basins.  Here was the so-called path "from the Varangians to the Greeks", which was a trade one.  Thanks to fertile soils and a mild climate, agriculture developed intensively;  cattle breeding, hunting were widespread, residents were engaged in fishing and beekeeping.  Crafts were early divided in these parts.  "Woodworking" played a rather significant role, as well as pottery and leatherwork.  Due to the presence of iron deposits, the development of blacksmithing was possible.  Many types of metals (silver, tin, copper, lead, gold) were delivered from neighboring countries.  Thus, all this influenced the early formation of trade and craft relations in Kiev and its neighboring cities. </p><h2>  Political history </h2><p>  As the capital loses its all-Russian significance, the rulers of the strongest principalities begin to send their henchmen - "helpers" to Kiev.  The precedent of <span>1113,</span> in which Vladimir Monomakh was invited to the throne bypassing the accepted order of succession, the boyars subsequently used to justify their right to choose a strong and acceptable ruler.  The principality of Kiev, a characterization of the history of which is accompanied by civil strife, turned into a battlefield, in which cities and villages suffered significant damage, were ruined, and the inhabitants themselves were captured.  Kiev saw a time of stability during the <span>reign of Vladimir Monomakh,</span> Svyatoslav Vsevolodovich Chernigov, as well as Roman Mstislavovich Volynsky.  Other rapidly replacing princes remained more colorless for history.  The principality of Kiev suffered greatly, the geographical position of which enabled it to defend itself well for a long time, during the Mongol-Tatar invasion in 1240. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Fragmentation </h2><p>  The Old Russian state initially included tribal principalities.  However, the situation has changed.  Over time, when the local nobility began to be supplanted due to the Rurik family, principalities began to form, which were controlled by representatives from the younger line.  The established order of succession always caused strife.  In 1054, Yaroslav the Wise and his sons began to divide the Principality of Kiev.  Fragmentation was an inevitable consequence of these events.  The situation worsened after the Lyubechensky Princes Cathedral in 1091.  However, the situation improved thanks to the policy of Vladimir Monomakh and his son Mstislav the Great, who managed to maintain integrity.  They were able to once again bring the principality of Kiev to the control of the capital, the geographical position of which was quite favorable for protection from enemies, and for the most part only internal feuds spoiled the state's position. </p>

    <p>  With the death of Mstislav in 1132, political fragmentation ensued.  However, despite this, Kiev for several decades kept the status of not only the formal center, but also the most powerful principality.  Its influence did not disappear completely, but significantly weakened compared with the situation at the beginning of the XII century. </p>
