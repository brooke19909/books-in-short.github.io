    <h2>  Address, general information </h2><p>  The park was built (and continues to be built to this day) at the expense of Sergei Alexandrovich Kushnarenko - a local entrepreneur, the head of the Prestige Holding company, who often does charity work.  Surprisingly, in the place of the park there used to be a real dump.  But the place is very picturesque and convenient.  Now it has blossomed in all its glory.  The park is located on the outskirts of the village of Stanitsa, in the suburbs of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe park is 16 hectares.  The abundance of places of recreation, even in the midst of the tourist season, allows you to have a great time in the landscape corner of Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky).  It was immediately known who the owner of this institution was, since the philanthropist did not hide his generosity.  In this wonderful place you can find a huge number of rare plants, all kinds of fountains, sculptures, streams, lakes, mini-mountains and much more.  The designers of the park clearly tried to keep this place in the memory of visitors for a long time.  It is amazing that such beauty can be done at the landfill site.  Well, now about everything in order. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Sculptures </h2><p>  The park has a huge number of original figures and statues.  They depict fairy-tale heroes, representatives of the local fauna and other colorful compositions.  At the entrance to the Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky), visitors are greeted by figures of a Cossack and Cossack.  Walking along the central avenue, you can see deer, wolves, wild boars, moose, gnomes, ents, the hut of Baba Yaga, Yaga herself with Koshchei, goblin and other characters. </p><p>  At the entrance to the brazier zone there is a large stone, on top of which an eagle sits proudly.  By the way, in this zone all the conditions for a comfortable picnic are created.  There are benches with tables and barbecue facilities.  And another important aspect is the shadow.  It is natural, created by trees.  Mangal zone is located on the outskirts of the park, so the smoke does not bother anyone. </p>

    <p>  There are so many statuettes that it‚Äôs even difficult to remember everything.  It is noteworthy that each of them fits perfectly into the landscape and complements the unique atmosphere of the park.  All sculptures are made manually of wood or stone. </p><h2>  Stones </h2><p>  Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) pleases its visitors with a small but very interesting rock garden.  All sculptures in this garden are made of local stones.  At first glance, you can‚Äôt even say that all this beauty is created from such a solid material.  Before entering the rock garden, a traditional index stone awaits visitors with the inscription: ‚ÄúIf you go to the right, you will find a friend, if you go to the left, you‚Äôll be full and happy, you will go to the right and you‚Äôll gain the will, and if you come with a sword, you‚Äôll fall from that sword.‚Äù </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ponds </h2><p>  Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) welcomes guests with several ponds, around which there are cozy wooden arbors.  Here you can relax and hide from the scorching summer sun.  Lovely water lilies bloom in the pond and floating birds live.  According to reviews, in clear, mirror-clear water you can see how colorful exotic fish splash.  And here there is a <span>water mill.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Zoo </h2><p>  Well-kept animals and birds walk in the spacious and surprisingly clean enclosures of the landscape park.  Here visitors are met by mouflons, deer, peacocks, parrots, partridges and swans.  Regular visitors note the zoo is constantly updated.  And in general, Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky) is rapidly developing, building and expanding.  Therefore, it is possible (or rather, surely) that soon more interesting places will appear in it. </p><h2>  Little Switzerland </h2><p>  Residents of the village of Staraya Stanitsa did not in vain give the park such a promising name, which the tourists happily approved behind the scenes.  This <span>Garden of Eden</span> really looks like the best European landscape parks.  Refined flower beds, Alpine hills, an ideal lawn - all this is arranged very competently.  The park has a peaceful atmosphere.  The cleanliness and order are carefully but unobtrusively monitored by the guards.  They culturally take out the territory of those who consider alcohol to be the key to a good rest.  The benefit of those in the park a bit.  You will not meet a person with a cigarette here either, since smoking is prohibited on the territory.  Fancy ashtray figures with <span>sad faces</span> look very original.  Around it is very quiet, and the only thing that breaks this silence is the birdsong and the voices of visitors. </p><p>  Many visitors are wondering what the name of the park is associated with.  The park received its unusual name ‚ÄúLoga‚Äù for a reason.  The fact is that it is located in the Log Beam.  Everything is simple.  By the way, the ‚Äúlog‚Äù, according to Dahl‚Äôs dictionary, is the beam. </p><h2>  Curved mirrors </h2><p>  Another highlight of the Logopark was the territory with curved mirrors.  There are about 15 of them here.  Around the mirrors are distorted animal figures that add fun to this place.  Loud laughter is constantly heard near the mirrors. </p>

    <h2>  For children </h2><p>  For the youngest visitors in Logopark there is a children's town.  It has everything that kids need: slides, carousels, swings, a <span>sports ground</span> and a sandbox.  All inventory is made of wood.  The flooring is soft and pleasant to the touch.  Everything is thought out so that children play as safely and conveniently as possible. </p><h2>  Fortress and church </h2><p>  More recently, a huge fortress has grown by leaps and bounds in the park.  It is not yet known what will be inside, but its beauty and scale are simply mesmerizing.  And on the hill near the entrance to the park a church was built.  Both designs are made in the ancient style using beautiful stone and wood. </p>

    <h2>  A restaurant </h2><p>  There is a cozy Teterev restaurant right in the park.  Reviews about this place are extremely positive.  Here you will find an interesting old Russian interior, a warm welcome, Russian and European cuisine.  The interior of the restaurant is fascinating: luxurious curtains, paintings on the walls, ancient porcelain figurines and other elements.  It can be seen that everything, even the smallest details, is thought out by professionals.  The level of service and the price of the food are also impressive.  For a thousand rubles in this restaurant you can have a great dinner for a family of three.  Given the professionalism of the staff, the quality of the dishes and the chic interior, this is simply nonsense. </p><h2>  Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky): price </h2><p>  Many, having learned about all the advantages of this park, thought that the entrance to it was probably expensive.  Not at all.  Entrance to the park is free, as is the use of toilets.  By the way, there are a lot of restrooms here, but they are not striking, because they are made in the same style as everything else.  Near each toilet there is an original signpost and a bench for waiting. </p><p>  Near the entrance to the park there is a fairly ample parking, which is also free.  But the most amazing is the free Segway rental.  By the way, renting these electronic self-balancing scooters in other places is several times more expensive than renting rollers, bicycles and other equipment.  And here is completely free. </p><p>  Evil tongues say that the lack of payment for all this beauty is due to the fact that the complex is still under construction.  Well, time will tell.  But given that there is a huge amount of security going around the territory, and more and more entertainment is appearing in the park, now there is something to pay for. </p>

    <h2>  Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky): how to get there </h2><p>  From Rostov you need to go along the M4 "Don" highway, which runs directly to Kamensk-Shakhtinsky.  Next, you have two options.  The first one is to drive through the town along Karl Marx Avenue (the town is not very busy, there are practically no traffic jams) and cross the <span>Seversky Donets River</span> via the <span>pontoon bridge</span> (crossing is paid: passenger car - 20 rubles, SUV - 30).  Next, you need to turn onto Budenny Street, and from it to Bolshevik.  It remains only to turn right.  This option is faster.  The second is longer, but it's free.  On the M4 Don highway, you need to go to the roundabout, which is located behind the Seversky Donets.  One turn - and you will see Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky).  The address of the park is: Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, s.  Old Village.  The street is not indicated, apparently due to the size of the park.  It can be seen from different angles. </p><p>  By public transport, everything is also very simple.  Bus number 25 takes you from Kamensk-Shakhtinsky Train Station to the park.  As you can see, it‚Äôs not at all difficult to get to Logopark (Kamensk-Shakhtinsky).  The park is open 24 hours a day. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Guest reviews unanimously call this park a wonderful place for families.  People come here again and again and each time they are surprised at something new.  The park is growing rapidly, so it is always interesting.  Children are crazy about him, because this is not just a park, but a whole fairy-tale world.  Particularly surprising, as reviews show, is the fact that everything is free in the park. </p>
