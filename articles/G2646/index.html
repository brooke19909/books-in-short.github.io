  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Structure of consciousness</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The structure of consciousness is quite complex - due to the fact that the phenomenon of consciousness itself is ambiguous.  This circumstance was first noticed by Sigmund Freud.  The thinker first coined the term “preconsciousness” to establish a mutual relationship between unconscious processes caused by mental activity and human consciousness.  However, Freud then abandoned this concept.  In his subsequent work, he proposed a new <span>structure of the psyche: the</span> unconscious - consciousness - superconsciousness. </p><p>  Its foundation (according to Freud) consists of unconscious processes, which are certain impulses of the psyche energy, specific aspirations and desires of people.  The structure of consciousness does not include all of these factors.  They, in turn, have an intention, that is, they strive to be immediately satisfied.  Unconscious processes, being beyond consciousness, have no contact with the outside world.  Such processes, as a rule, include sensory experiences and sudden impulses of knowledge, which are displaced from the structure of consciousness.  Freud believed that all these phenomena depend on the expression of the psychic energy of sexual desire - libido.  Thus, the thinker came to the conclusion that the unconscious is the cause of spiritual slavery of people. </p><p>  Mental activity, according to Freud, also includes the "I" - the part that a person is able to regulate and control.  The structure of consciousness allows you to design different programs of behavior, anticipate the end results, reflect the outside world. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In a way, “I” is a mediator between “It” (unconscious) and the outside world, between passions and attraction on the one hand and their satisfaction on the other.  In this case, the realization mechanism is not a person’s desire, but his moral duty. </p><p>  Freud considered the third component of the psyche to be superconscious (“Super-I”).  These are products that are developed by the culture for consciousness.  In particular, they include <span>social norms,</span> traditions, a certain system of prohibitions and rules.  A person assimilates all this, he is forced to reckon with all this when carrying out his activities.  According to Freud, the “superego” in consciousness manifests itself in the form of conscience.  That is, this component causes a person to <span>feel guilty,</span> ashamed, etc. </p><p>  As a result, Freud came to the conclusion that excessive pressure of the “Super-I” (as a moral public censor) contributes to the formation of an inferior personality, deforms it, leading a person into an illusory world.  The pressure exerted by the “Super-Self” from the side provokes to some extent the strengthening of the power of the unconscious.  In this case, the unconscious begins to go beyond the conscious influence on him from the "I".  In this regard, Freud believed that one should look for the optimal form in which “It” and “Super-I” will be combined. </p><p>  <strong>What is the structure of consciousness proposed by other authors?</strong> </p><p>  A number of researchers highlight four aspects. </p><p>  The first is related to <span>human activities,</span> on the basis of which primary knowledge about the world around arises.  In this case, such <span>forms of cognition</span> as representation, perception, sensation are used. </p><p>  The second aspect is related to rational thinking.  The main focus in this case is the comprehension of the essence of material reality.  For this, conclusions, concepts, and judgments are used. </p><p>  The third aspect is considered to be the sphere of subjective-psychological, personal experiences.  The emotional component in this case does not have direct connections with the outside world. </p><p>  The fourth aspect is the value-motivational element.  Under it is understood the highest motives, spiritual ideals of a person, his ability to creatively comprehend reality in the form of intuition, imagination, fantasy. </p><p>  The epistemological system of consciousness provides that the views of subjects are knowledge that reflects, to one degree or another, different aspects of human activity, including those related to power.  In this case, various issues are considered.  The structure of <span>political consciousness</span> includes such elements as ideology and psychology of power.  In addition, each component has its own special meaning. </p>
