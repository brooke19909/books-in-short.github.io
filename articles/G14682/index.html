  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Japan, hot springs (onsen): types and description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Recently, tours to Japan are becoming increasingly popular.  This country with a long history attracts the attention of tourists from all over the world.  However, special interest today arises in the hot springs of Japan. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Hot springs in Japan - this is a common vacation spot for locals and visitors.  As you know, this island state has a high level of volcanic and seismic activity.  This, in turn, leads to the creation of various faults in the soil and the formation of improvised reservoirs in them. </p><p>  Some of them have thermal water, which first attracted animals, and then humans.  An interesting fact: in Japan, monkeys in hot springs like to spend quite a lot of time, especially in winter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.insidejapantours.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monkeys in a hot spring" class="if uuid-3224175" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224175.jpg"></div><p>  In a country known for its cool climate, especially in mountainous areas, hot springs are of particular importance and value not only as hot spots, but also as complexes of wellness procedures.  Small settlements immediately began to form around them, or people began to live as close to them as possible.  The thermal springs in Japan have developed a special relationship, and a whole culture of their use has appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Onsen </h2><p>  Currently, there are more than 2,000 bathing springs in Japan.  Onsen in Japan, also called onsen, has long been used for heating and wellness bathing.  In the sources, the water is saturated with hydrogen sulfide, iron, saline solutions and carbonated with carbon dioxide. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jw-webmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Indoor hot spring" class="if uuid-3224164" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224164.jpg"></div><p>  They are divided into two types: open, when hot water is used in the same reservoir in which it was formed, and closed.  In the latter version, thermal water is served in special indoor rooms, in bathtubs, which are called ofuro.  The main difference between onsen and ordinary Japanese baths - sento (sento) - is that in the first only thermal mineral water is used.  In ordinary baths, simple water is heated with boilers. </p><p>  Today, a whole infrastructure is being formed around such sources, starting from changing rooms, hotels and ending with entire specialized centers, where a wide range of medical and preventive and other services is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jw-webmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Open hot springs" class="if uuid-3224163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224163.jpg"></div><h2>  Device </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the volcanic nature of the Japanese islands influenced the formation of thermal springs.  Traditionally, in the Land of the Rising Sun, onsen is especially revered, not only because the Japanese honor their history, but also because of health concerns.  Initially, women and men bathed in different thermal springs, today you can also find mixed baths.  However, it is worth noting that the most common practice of visiting sources is by men and women at different times.  Young children can come to the baths without any restrictions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Among the Japanese, invitations are often quite common among friendly companies, families for spending time together or even celebrating a honeymoon in these places. </p><h2>  Visiting Rules </h2><p>  In Japan, hot springs have their own rules and culture of visiting.  Before you dive into the source, you must thoroughly wash your whole body with soap and then swim in the shower.  Special washing places or showers are located in the immediate vicinity of the onsen. </p><p>  After all the necessary hygiene procedures, you can go to the source.  According to the rules, during immersion in water it is necessary to use a special towel to cover the nudity, at least when entering and leaving the water. </p><p>  Traditionally, Japan's hot springs are considered a place for a quiet, relaxing holiday and enjoy the surrounding nature.  However, in modern onsen (in a large part intended for tourists) you can find noisy companies. </p><h2>  Takaragawa onsen </h2><p>  This is a traditional classic thermal spring.  It is located in Gumma Prefecture, in the small village of Minakami.  Takaragawa is translated from Japanese as ‚Äútreasure river‚Äù.  This is one of the most famous and largest hot springs that are located in the open. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelswithnano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Takaragawa Onsen" class="if uuid-3224165" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224165.jpg"></div><p>  Tours to Japan offer a visit to this onsen, as well as booking a hotel in the immediate vicinity.  In total there are four thermal pools.  Three of them are for general use, and one is for women only. </p><p>  Mineral water in the sources, containing various substances that are healing for the body.  This place has long been popular and known throughout Japan, as Takaragawa onsen waters help with diseases such as: </p><ul><li>  circulatory disturbance; </li><li>  problems with the gastrointestinal tract; </li><li>  disorders of the nervous system; </li><li>  skin problems </li><li>  muscle and ligament sprains. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="travelswithnano.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel in Takaragawa onsn" class="if uuid-3224167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224167.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to medical and preventive measures, this complex offers other services.  In summer, you can go kayaking, go rafting and even paragliding (flying on a special guided parachute).  In winter, you can go skiing and snowboarding. </p><h2>  Onsen in the capital </h2><p>  Hot springs in Tokyo are located on the island of Odaiba.  This artificially created bulk island is located in Tokyo Bay.  Onsen Monogatari, built here, is one of the most popular places not only among the Japanese, but also among many tourists.  After a high-tech modern metropolis, many are delighted to immerse themselves in the history of the old traditional city.  This is easy enough, because the interiors of this onsen are made in the old Japanese style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tokyo.for91days.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Onsen Oedo Monogatari" class="if uuid-3224172" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224172.jpg"></div><p>  The attitude to visitors here is at the highest level, from the very entrance everyone is given serious attention here.  Customers are invited to dress in an old-style kimono and proceed to the bathing rooms in the interiors, whose interiors are designed in the style of the XVI-XVIII centuries. </p><h2>  Onsen Services </h2><p>  In addition to the thermal springs themselves, which originate at a depth of about 1,800 meters, a theme park has been created here that can transfer visitors to old Japan.  Various types of onsen are available in it both in the open and closed.  In total, visitors will be offered 14 types of bathtubs.  In this institution, the list of services is so diverse that it is simply impossible to use them in one day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tokyo.for91days.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://tokyo.for91days.com/the-ooedo-onsen-monogatari-spa/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Inside the Onsen Monogatari" class="if uuid-3224171" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3224171.jpg"></div><p>  In Monogatari onsen you can swim in the thermal springs, for which water is supplied to a variety of bathtubs made from various types of wood or types of stone.  It is believed that, for example, a bath of cypress wood has a beneficial effect on the respiratory system, and from cedar it perfectly copes with skin problems. </p><p>  Other wellness services, such as massage or aromatherapy, are also offered here.
