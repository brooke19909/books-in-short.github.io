One of the most popular varieties are collectible card games.  As a rule, each of these games can be played in two formats: draft and concredited.  Finding out what a draft is and how it differs from a Constructed is very simple.  Let's pay attention to the main points. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a draft" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3239/349387.jpg" width="540"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Draft and Constructed.  What is the difference? </h2><p>  The process of playing a collectible card game involves the use of a deck assembled in a certain way.  To play in Constructed tournaments, a deck that has been collected in advance is used, cards for which you can buy separately or exchange with other players.  But to understand what draft is, we turn directly to the meaning of this word.  If we translate into English the English word “draft”, then we will get nothing more than a “draft” or “draft”.  That is, you do not think over the composition of the deck at home in advance, but rather you collect it directly during the tournament. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The general principle of the draft tournament </h2><p>  In most games, draft tournaments are held in approximately the same pattern.  First of all, we note <span>that such a tournament</span> consists of two stages: collecting the deck and the game part itself.  In order to start collecting cards in a deck, players are usually placed at the same table in the amount of 6-8 people.  Each of them has acquired packs with cards.  The number of these packs and their composition depend directly on the game.  For example, in the most popular card game Magic: the Gathering, each player needs three packs of cards of 15 pieces each.  After seating, players open one pack, select the best card from it, and transfer the rest in a circle to a neighbor.  Accordingly, then you have to choose a card from what the neighbor has transmitted, and so on until all the cards are taken apart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is draft in maps" class="if" height="293" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3239/349385.jpg?1394215518148" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After all the packs are opened and disassembled, the draft in card games does not end.  It is necessary to collect decks from the resulting set of cards in order to play the deck in the most efficient way.  As a rule, after the process of “rapping” the cards, the player will have more than is necessary to draw up the deck, so you need to choose the best and use them for the game. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Benefits and Difficulties of Draft </h2><p>  Many players very conditionally know what draft is.  Of course, the vast majority know the rules, but the point is different.  The draft format requires a player to have slightly different skills than constructed.  First of all, you need to learn how to correctly evaluate the power of cards, as well as their interaction with each other.  After all, it is not always enough just to take the strongest card and put it in the deck.  Sometimes a weaker card can be extremely strong in a particular “in a vacuum” deck.  Among other things, you need to notice what cards you give to your neighbors in order to be ready for future matches and have answers to possible threats in the deck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="card game pick" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3239/349386.jpg?1394215620631" width="500"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Beginners and draft </h2><p>  From the point of view of a beginner, it is difficult to say which format is more effective for studying all the intricacies of the game.  Perhaps, it is more advisable to start studying the rules and the basic mechanics of the game with the abstract, and then go on to study what draft is.  A sufficient number of games played in Constructed will allow at least an initial idea of ​​the strength of the cards, so that in the future the player has the opportunity to make the right and reasonable choice from the opened set.  In addition, for holding a draft tournament, you must have at least 6-8 people, and you can just play with a finished deck with at least a friend in the kitchen. </p><p>  Now you have a general idea of ​​what draft is.  In cards, as you know, the influence of luck is great, and collectible card games are no exception.  However, experience and work on the quality of the game will allow you to defeat the most sophisticated rivals in any kind of tournament. </p>
