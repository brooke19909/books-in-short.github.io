    <p>  In order to well imagine the location, it is better to know the exact address of the complex.  Not far from St. Petersburg is located the Aurora Club (recreation center): Vyborg district of the Leningrad region, the city of Zelenogorsk, the village of Polyany.  This is the so-called Semiazerye district.  Here, very close to the recreation center are several reservoirs of different sizes.  The Aurora Club itself is located on the shores of <span>Lakes Long</span> and Horseshoe.  And a little further there are two more large freshwater sources - Polyanskoye and Gladyshevskoye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Coming to this place is very simple.  To do this, you can use both personal transport and public.  Aurora Club is a recreation center that can be reached from St. Petersburg from <span>Finland Station.</span>  To do this, you need to get to Zelenogorsk by train, and from it to the Avrorovets stop by buses No. 401 or 483. You can also use the K-827 minibus, which leaves from the Grazhdansky Prospekt metro station to the village of Polyany.  If vacationers are more comfortable with a personal car, then they will need to drive along the Primorsky highway.  Then, after the bridge, turn right near the Polyana sign.  Continue along the A-125 highway until you see a turn to the base. </p><h2>  Aurora Club: description and photo </h2><p>  Surely all the guests of the recreation center will be interested to know that in the Soviet years this place was a stunning health camp for children called "Aurorovec".  Over the years, namely in 1999, over the vast territory of the complex of 17 hectares, they began to make a complete transformation of the infrastructure. </p>
