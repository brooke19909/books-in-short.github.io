It can be special needles for embroidery or <span>for beadwork, machines for</span> weaving baubles from elastic bands, beads or threads, cutters of various shapes for woodcarving or mold. </p><p>  Today we will consider such a tool as mold: the meaning of a word, why it is needed, and how to make it with your own hands - all this you will learn from the article.  We will also find out which molds exist and in which crafts they are used. </p><h2>  Mold: definition, concept </h2><p>  Mold is translated from English as "cast".  Therefore, one can already guess from the name that it can be used as a form for obtaining one or another figure or drawing. </p><p>  Such tools are peculiar little ones, like those of which children make Easter cakes, but often they are smaller and made of other material.  This is what mold is. <br><br>  However, with the help of molds, it is possible not only to cast figures from liquid material, but also to squeeze a pattern or even some object out of a substance like polymer clay, mastic or plasticine. <br><br>  Without molds, it is very difficult and even almost impossible to achieve maximum realism of the product, so if you want to put your work up for sale, then you can not do without these forms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="molds silicone application" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1491914.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is silicone sealant mold </h2><p>  In order for the part to be easily removed, the mold must be made of plastic and easily bendable material.  If this condition is not met, then when removing the finished product may crack or break. <br><br>  The cheapest material suitable for making molds with your own hands is silicone sealant.  For a very small amount, you can buy a sufficient amount of material from which you can make a lot of silicone molds. <br><br>  You can buy silicone sealant in any hardware store located nearby.  An acrylic-based sealant is not worth buying, since when hardening it loses its plasticity and can crumble.  A neutral or acid base is what you need.  Also pay attention to the heat resistance of the material you have chosen, since you will bake it, it must withstand at least 200 degrees Celsius. <br><br>  In addition to silicone sealant (how to make a mold, we will describe a little later), you will need a few more tools: </p><ul><li>  Special gun. </li><li>  Starch, the amount of which should be equal to the amount of sealant (it is needed to thicken the mass). </li><li>  Soap solution. </li></ul><p>  When preparing a mold for mold, mix the sealant with starch in equal proportions. <br><br>  Remember that the sealant dries very quickly, so when working with it, do not waste time in vain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Silicone molds "Moment" </h2><p>  Making molds in this way will be justified only for products that do not have to be baked, for example, for soap.  Also, under no circumstances use such silicone for molds with which you want to make edible figures, since it is quite toxic. <br><br>  You need to work with Momento silicone in the same way as you would with sealant. <br><br>  By the way, this silicone is much more expensive than our first option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="epoxy resin" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1491912.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Special silicone mold </h2><p>  There is a special, two-component silicone for the manufacture of molds.  As you know, it is best suited for this purpose, but it also costs more than all the options presented above. <br><br>  Molds made from such a material can also be used for food products. <br><br>  If you follow the instructions indicated on the package, the relief on your mold will turn out beautiful and clear. <br><br>  Just before starting to create your personal form, you will have to mix both components of a special silicone.  And after the end of work, the drying time of the product will be from 3 to 6 hours. </p><h2>  Polymer Clay Molds </h2><p>  We suggest you familiarize yourself with how to make molds with your own hands!  Everyone can cope with such a process. </p><p>  Before we outline how to make molds from polymer clay, it‚Äôs worth noting that this is the most expensive and not justifiable way, because polymer clay is non-plastic, toxic, so you can‚Äôt use molds made from it for figures from mastic . </p><p>  Of course, if you do not have a single suitable material at home, and you need a mold very urgently, you can use polymer clay. <br><br>  In addition to her, you will need more petroleum jelly and water. <br><br>  Mix polymer clay with a small amount of petroleum jelly, after mashing it well.  Before making the print you need, moisten the mixture of clay and petroleum jelly crushed into the formation with water.  When the mold takes on the form you need, bake it in the oven at a temperature of 100 degrees (about 20 minutes). </p><h2>  Read more on how to make polymer clay mold </h2><p>  Since this method is the most difficult, we decided to talk about it separately.  Let's look at how to make such molds using the example of a birch leaf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is mold" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32960/1491905.jpg" width="384"></div>  Tools and materials you need:
