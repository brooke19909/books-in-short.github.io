Despite the fact that tourism in a country lost in the jungle is under development, the flow of travelers does not dry out.  And one of the main types of recreation in the kingdom, located on the Indochina peninsula, is the inspection of monuments. </p><h2>  Ancient city with a rich history </h2><p>  Siem Reap (Cambodia) located in the province of the same name is rightfully recognized as the most picturesque city.  Having the status of a historical relic, it attracts vacationers with a huge number of attractions.  The ancient Siem Reap plays the role of a conductor connecting the modern world with past eras. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.independent.co.uk" data-author=": Garrett Ziegler, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Colorful town" class="if uuid-2537400" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2537400.jpg"></div><p>  In the XIX century, Siem Reap in Cambodia was a tiny and unremarkable village.  However, after French scientists discovered the ruins of a unique temple on its territory, everything changed.  A small settlement has grown and turned into a cozy tourist center with comfortable hotels.  The Vietnam War and the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian Nazis, who killed 3 million people, led the country to close its borders to foreigners.  And only about 20 years ago, the city, which began to develop actively, gained its present appearance, delighting guests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Priceless treasure </h2><p>  The main attraction of Siem Reap in Cambodia is considered the archaeological zone of Angkor, on which towers an ancient temple dedicated to the god Vishnu.  The historical and religious monument, surrounded by a moat, was seriously affected by the vandalism of the terrorists, but local residents reconstructed religious monuments, the beauty of which is breathtaking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sinhcafetravel.com.vn" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Architectural wonder" class="if uuid-2537378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2537378.jpg"></div><p>  The center of the ancient Khmer empire is the largest temple complex in the world, on the territory of which more than 200 places of worship are built.  However, its main pearl is the grand Angkor Wat, erected by Suryavarman II - the ruler of the kingdom, who lived in the XII century. </p><h2>  Architectural wonder </h2><p>  Few places on our planet can be compared in size with the priceless architectural masterpiece, claiming the title of one of the wonders of the world.  The temple ensemble, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã200 hectares, symbolizes the sacred mountain Meru, which served as the home for the formidable Vishnu, and five powerful towers at each structure are the high peaks of the peak. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.internationaltraveller.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Archaeological Area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAngkor" class="if uuid-2537392" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2537392.jpg"></div><p>  The largest religious building of mankind, left to us as a legacy, was not intended for the assembly of believers.  Built as the dwelling of the gods, it has become the burial place of kings.  Angkor Wat was later abandoned by people under mysterious circumstances.  Shrouded in legends and keeping many secrets, it is taken under the protection of UNESCO.  And hundreds of thousands of tourists who dream of wandering around the open-air museum and enjoying the amazing creation of human hands, rush to the original Siem Reap (Cambodia) every year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reviews of tourists about the temple </h2><p>  Guests of a colorful country admit that this is a real miracle that you need to see with your own eyes.  A visit to the mysterious corner is reminiscent of a breathtaking adventure.  It is so easy to touch antiquity, once in a wonderful temple, where everything is saturated with a mystical atmosphere.  Travelers feel the fabulous aura emanating from ancient buildings, and admit that this is a wonderful place where it is so easy to relax and forget about the problems. </p><h2>  <span>Tonlesap Lake</span> and floating villages </h2><p>  After exploring a priceless work of architectural art, you can go to Lake Tonle Sap - the largest on the Indochina Peninsula.  But the main attraction of the "internal sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe country" are floating villages, whose population is from several tens to five thousand.  They were founded at the end of the last century by migrants from Vietnam, who fled to Cambodia and Siem Reap in particular.  However, according to the law of the country, only indigenous people can live on its territory, and refugees got out of the situation by constructing wooden houses standing on pontoons. </p><p>  In floating villages there is everything that people need: children go to schools, adults go to temples, go to shops, go to the market, plant a garden on the water, and a cemetery is arranged in the coastal thickets.  Every family has a boat with which men fish.  But tourism brings the most tangible income to the inhabitants of "Lake Venice", and local entrepreneurs organize excursions for people who are not afraid of Spartan living conditions. </p><h2>  What do tourists say? </h2><p>  Vacationers in Siem Reap in Cambodia note that all the buildings look rather primitive and look more like sheds, and unsanitary conditions reign around.  All the trash in the villages is dumped into the water they drink.  Children bathe right there, and women wash their clothes. </p><p>  There are many floating villages, and they all differ from each other, but the life of the poorest people in Cambodia is the same everywhere.  Tourists are surprised how a person can adapt to any living conditions and not be very sad about this circumstance.  Locals are happy about what they have and do not want to change anything. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cambodia-hotels.com" data-author=": Kushch Dmitry, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tonlesap Lake and floating villages" class="if uuid-2537410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/2537410.jpg"></div><p>  Siem Reap in Cambodia (photos only confirm this) is a colorful corner with a rich historical past.  Its unique attractions impress even a lot of tourists.  It is very simple to get acquainted with the culture of a distant country - just visit its main pearl. </p>
