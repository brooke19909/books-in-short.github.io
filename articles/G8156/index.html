This company was a pioneer in the field of photographic equipment.  The quality and innovation of Pentax technology has been mind-blowing.  However, in 2008, due to the crisis, the company was absorbed by the giants Ricoh and Hoya.  And although now there is no such company as Pentax, photographic equipment is produced under this brand. </p><p>  It is worth noting that Rioch hold the brand.  Pentax is still synonymous with the word quality.  Nevertheless, the popularity of this brand is at a rather low level.  What is the reason?  The fact is that the camera market was actually divided between the giants Nikon and Canon.  Less popular brands are not in demand.  But such an outrage will not last long.  Indeed, relatively recently, a new DSLR called Pentax K-50 was announced.  What is so special about this camera?  How are Rioch going to attract a buyer?  You can find answers to these questions in this article. </p><h2>  Pentax K-50 review </h2>

    <p>  The modern consumer is pretty hard to surprise.  Nevertheless, the Pentax K-50 SLR was able to do this.  He made a splash.  But what is so special about this camera?  Perhaps this device has transcendental specifications?  Or maybe it's all about the ergonomics of the device?  No, everything is much simpler.  The main advantage of the Pentax K-50 is its design.  Specialists from Rioch resorted to a rather interesting and non-standard solution, which you can read about below. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Design </h2><p>  At the first glance at the camera, it becomes clear that the manufacturer relied on the design of the device.  Compared to the K-30, the body lines are smoother.  The matte case is made of high quality polycarbonate.  On the front of the camera you can see rubber pads that provide additional ergonomics.  Thanks to them, the camera lies very well in the hand and does not even try to slip out.  The main disadvantage is the weight of the device.  With prolonged use of the camera, your hands get tired and numb.  Anyway, the mass of Pentax K-50 is the largest among cameras of the same price category. </p><p>  The housing consists of 81 rubber seals that perform a protective function.  Thanks to this, the camera mechanism is completely protected from water, snow, rain, dust, etc. Therefore, you can use the DSLR even in adverse conditions.  Of course, it is not worth taking pictures in the pouring rain (and the photos will come out of poor quality due to low visibility).  However, the camera will survive light rain.  In addition, the camera can be safely taken to the beach.  After all, the case is almost airtight, and this, in turn, means that not a single grain of sand will penetrate inside.  This feature is quite rare in cameras of this level.  Doubt the stability of this camera?  Rollers walk around the net, in which Pentax is covered with fine sand, after which the camera is doused with water.  Even after such bullying, the camera remains in working condition. </p>

    <p>  But, perhaps, the main thing in the new Pentax K-50 (photo can be seen above) is a huge number of color variations.  What is most interesting, the buyer has the opportunity to independently determine the design of his gadget.  Six different colors of the handle and twenty colors of the case together allow you to collect about 120 combinations.  And this is an interesting, albeit rather risky undertaking.  Thus, you can assemble a unique camera that can emphasize the individuality, the inner world of the owner.  In addition to design, the device has a couple of interesting features, which you can read about below. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Functionality </h2><p>  Most features went to the K-50 from its predecessor, the K-30.  Thus, the new camera still uses a 16.28 megapixel matrix (APS-C size).  Thanks to her, the camera takes pretty bright and as close to reality pictures. </p><p>  However, the K-50 is not a pale copy of the K-30.  The new device boasts improved processing algorithms.  This made it possible to increase the maximum <span>ISO sensitivity</span> threshold as high as 51200. In addition, the Pentax brainchild received a new autofocus module called SAFOX AF IXi +.  It provides increased accuracy and faster focusing speed. </p>

    <p>  The <span>image stabilizer is</span> worthy of attention <span>.</span>  Thanks to him, the clarity of the image during shooting is significantly improved even without the use of a tripod.  Thanks to good software, the camera turns on and focuses quite quickly.  It is also worth noting that the burst speed is as much as 6 frames per second.  For amateur equipment this is a pretty good indicator. </p><h2>  Modes </h2><p>  The <span>Pentax K-50</span> camera boasts a huge number of shooting modes.  Among them there is an automatic, and manual, and stage (about 19 options), and video.  Manufacturers have not forgotten about the classic Tv and Av.  Moreover, Sv (priority is given to sensitivity) and Tav (priority is given to shutter speed) were added to them.  There is also a couple of user modes. </p>

    <p>  Optical viewfinder gives 100% field of view.  And the three-inch screen has a rather large resolution (approximately 921,000 pixels).  Thanks to this, you can evaluate the quality of the photo immediately after shooting.  The camera takes photos with a resolution of 4928 x 3264. Images are saved in RAW and JPEG formats. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  In addition, the Pentax K-50 provides the ability to shoot in HDR.  This allows you to significantly expand the dynamic range.  It is also possible to configure HDR (indication of activity, etc.).  You can shoot directly from your hands, there is no need for a tripod.  However, there is a rather significant minus here - gluing and processing the photo takes quite a lot of time (about 13 seconds).  Although it is worth noting that this is much faster than the speed of the same K-30. </p>

    <p>  The Pentax K-50 has a proprietary stabilization system called ShakeReduction.  It compensates for the negative effects of vibration of the device, which makes the photo more clear.  It is also worth noting that the camera is able to correct <span>chromatic aberration</span> and distortion.  Among the interesting little things you can mention the possibility of interval shooting.  Thanks to it, you can get from 2 to 999 images in a period of time from 3 seconds to 24 hours.  In this case, you can accurately indicate the beginning and end of shooting. </p><h2>  Pentax K-50: reviews </h2><p>  The public warmly received the new SLR camera.  Many people liked the idea with different color options (thanks to this, the Pentax K-50 is especially popular in Europe).  Among the advantages, buyers notice the presence of various shooting modes, the stylish design of the device and resistance to external conditions. </p><p>  However, there were some minuses.  The weight of the device significantly reduces its ergonomics, which upset many users.  Also, discomfort brings long-term photo processing with HDR shooting. </p><h2>  Total </h2>

However, in addition to design, the camera boasts extensive functionality, a good protection system.  Also, the price, which is an order of magnitude lower than that of competitors, cannot but rejoice. </p>
