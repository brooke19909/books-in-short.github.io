    <p>  The hotel is located quite far from the sea - about 700 m. It takes about 15 minutes to go to the beach for its guests.  The exact hotel address is India, Goa, Near St.  Anthony's Chapel Gauravaddo, Calangute, Bardez. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, despite the fact that this hotel is not on the first coastline, it is located quite conveniently.  The street on which Osborne Holiday Resort 2 * is built is very quiet.  And therefore, it is absolutely nothing to interfere with the comfort of its guests, including at night.  With all this, all kinds of cafes, restaurants, markets and massage rooms are just a short walk from the hotel. </p><h2>  What is a hotel </h2><p>  The rooms in this hotel are rented in several cozy three-story buildings.  All buildings have modern, but at the same time quite original architecture.  The walls of the buildings are painted white and blue-gray, which gives them a noticeable and unusual look.  On one of the facades, beautiful southern seascapes are painted to the full height.  The hotel is pretty old.  It was built in 1999.  Perhaps that is why, and also due to the considerable distance from the sea, the rooms here are very inexpensive.  The price of a tour to North Goa with accommodation in this hotel is only about 60 thousand rubles.  for two adults. </p><p>  The hotel courtyard is paved with paving tiles over the entire area and looks quite presentable and beautiful.  Some of it is occupied by a large, clean, rectangular-shaped pool.  The decoration of its bowl (blue tile) pleasantly harmonizes with the shades of the facades of the buildings.  There are a lot of greens in the Osborne Holiday Resort complex.  Almost the entire courtyard of the hotel is a small tropical garden where you can take evening walks.  Of course, there are comfortable benches and gazebos at the hotel.  In the evening, multi-colored lights are lit around the pool, which creates a romantic and very cozy atmosphere in the courtyard. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are few domestic tourists in this hotel.  Its main guests are German pensioners.  Many of them have never seen Russians.  And therefore, sometimes the Germans examine our compatriots somewhat unceremoniously.  For some Russian guests, and especially for women, this can cause embarrassment.  But in any case, no special conflicts between hotel residents from different countries, of course, never happen. </p><h2>  Hotel Room Categories </h2><p>  In total, Osborne Holiday Resort 2 * hotel <span>(India, North</span> Goa) offers tourists who have chosen Calangute to relax, 135 comfortable rooms.  If you wish, you can book a Standard with air conditioning or a ceiling fan.  In the second case, accommodation will be cheaper.  The hotel also has Superior rooms with air conditioning.  In these rooms, among other things, there is a TV.  All rooms have fairly spacious balconies.  This, according to most tourists, is actually very convenient.  The fact is that due to the damp climate, beach items in Goa manage to dry out only when they are hung out on the balcony. </p>

The service here is offered really pretty good.  Many tourists express the opinion that on some points Osborne Holiday "pulls" even three stars. </p><p>  The furniture, according to most of the guests, is set in the rooms a bit old, but not loose and, most importantly, not dirty.  Unfortunately, sometimes household appliances, including fans, in this hotel sometimes break.  But any such problem is resolved by the staff pretty quickly.  It is only necessary to inform the administrator about the breakdown on time.  This hotel has earned good reviews, including for the absence of any insects in the rooms.  The exception is only mosquitoes.  Mosquitoes practically do not interfere with rooms with fans.  But for the residents of the air-conditioned rooms they can ruin the evening rest.  Therefore, experienced tourists advise beginners to take some repellent with them on a trip to Goa. </p><p>  Actually, the rooms themselves in this hotel are very spacious and, judging by the reviews, quite comfortable.  Using a shower at Osborne Holiday Resort 2 * is also quite convenient.  Tourists consider only a disadvantage of the hotel that sometimes there is no electricity in the rooms.  But hot water, unlike many other hotels in North Goa, always has Osborne Holiday.  The fact is that water showers are installed in showers.  Therefore, you can wash off the salt in your room even in the absence of hot water in the area.  To do this, just turn on the heater and wait 5-10 minutes. </p>

    <p>  One of the problems of Indian hotels is, unfortunately, theft.  The fact is that the population in this country is mostly poor.  Therefore, it is not recommended to leave all kinds of valuable items in Goa hotels in the room.  Nothing is known about the theft at the Osborne Hotel.  But still, its guests should be more attentive.  Many tourists advise in Russia to purchase a small <span>bicycle lock</span> and hang it on the door of the room.  However, the administration may not allow using such a device.  In this case, to keep documents worth using a safe at the registration. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  All sorts of amenities at the Osborne Holiday Resort, reviews of which are generally quite good, there are, unfortunately, not so many.  But the owners still tried to make the life of guests at the hotel as comfortable as possible.  So, for example, if you wish, you can wash your soiled clothes and bath accessories soaked in salt water in a room specially equipped for this purpose.  True, you will have to pay for visiting the laundry separately.  But tourists have the opportunity to freely use sun loungers and umbrellas by the pool.  Other facilities offered at the property include luggage storage and a currency exchange. </p><p>  There is a safe at the hotel reception.  If desired, values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be stored here for a fee.  There is a Wi-Fi network in the hotel.  But, unfortunately, most of the guests prefer not to use this service.  Wi-Fi in Osborne Holiday Resort 2 *, judging by the reviews of tourists, very slow.  In addition, the Internet is not cheap at the hotel. </p>

This place is located in the courtyard of the hotel, and the dishes here are served, according to many guests, fresh and quality cooked. </p><p>  Breakfast at this hotel, according to most tourists, is too scarce.
