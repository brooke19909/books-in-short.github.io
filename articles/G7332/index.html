According to the authors of the reviews, through the windows the room is very hot - so much so that even the curtains become hot.  Therefore, rooms without windows have a big advantage - they are not so hot. </p><p>  All rooms have very good audibility (insufficient sound insulation).  Future guests are invited to choose rooms with mountain views.  They are quieter, in addition, from their windows a beautiful view.  According to many guests, it is better to choose rooms with a view of the mountains or the airport, rather than a Vietnamese construction site, which is quite noisy.  Many people like the rooms on the 10th floor - quiet, with great views. </p><p>  According to guests, the ‚Äústandards‚Äù without balconies, the numbering of which ends with ‚Äú3‚Äù (403, 303, 203, etc.), are unrealistically small, consisting of one small room and a bathroom.  The windows from the bathroom usually go to some kind of dump, but in the distance you can also see the sea.  Rooms with a balcony overlook the wall of the neighboring hotel.  The balconies are very small, according to the authors of the reviews, about the width of a human foot.  The rooms of these rooms are not as cramped as standard without balconies - in contrast to them, there is even a place to place suitcases.  The room numbering ends with the numbers ‚Äú4‚Äù and ‚Äú5‚Äù (704, 805, etc.). The rooms, the numbering of which ends with ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú2‚Äù (701, 802), overlook the sea. </p><h2>  About living experiences </h2><p>  According to reviews, the hotel is located in a cozy nook, which is a big plus, since it is not as noisy as in establishments built along the road.  The beach is located across the road (2-lane), in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, on the first line.  It can be reached in 3 minutes, crossing the road, quite busy.  Traffic in all of Vietnam, according to tourists, is extremely busy, but after a few days you can get used to it.  For those who fear, travelers recommend joining any of the Chinese groups (from 20-30 people), usually stopping the flow of cars. </p><p>  All rooms in this hotel are quite small, equipped with a wardrobe, a nightstand, beds, air conditioning (quite old, but working), a desk, a mirror, a flat-screen TV (Sharp with one Russian channel), a hairdryer, a safe, a refrigerator, and chairs.  Residents call the rooms livable, although the walls in them are dirty in some places.  According to reviews, the bathrooms in the rooms are quite ordinary, with windows, a shower and a floor drain. </p><p>  Clean the rooms daily.  According to guests, cleaning is done carefully: they clean the table cleanly, sweep and wash the floor, and clean the bathroom.  Cups in the rooms do not change or wash, which is the norm for Asia.  Towels can be provided with stained towels that do not wash.  They can be changed to clean by contacting the maid. </p><p>  The restaurant provides good breakfast buffet: eggs (scrambled eggs, fried eggs, boiled), sausage, toast, porridge, bacon, butter, stewed fish or meat, fruits, vegetables (fresh), sweets - everything is cooked quite tasty and served in in sufficient numbers, none of the guests remain hungry.  Many people like the coffee here.  The staff at Golden Time guests are called responsive, polite. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.priceline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Breakfast provided" class="if uuid-3099053" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3099053.jpg"></div><p>  Residents recommend choosing this hotel not for a permanent stay, but exclusively for an overnight stay. </p>
