Rest in Anapa</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Over the past six months, the foreign exchange rate has spoiled the mood of more than one Russian tourist.  Due to the growth of the dollar and the euro, <span>vacation abroad has</span> ceased to be affordable for many.  Travelers decided not to despair and not put an end to summer vacation, but turned their attention to the resorts of the Black Sea. </p><p>  Modern hotels, sandy beaches and continuously developing infrastructure - holidays in the south of Russia can now be safely compared with the popular Cyprus, Greece or Turkey.  Moreover, the main advantage is the price, which is not affected by any exchange rates.  ‚ÄúGrand Cruise‚Äù (Anapa) is one of the best hotel complexes, which has repeatedly confirmed its high level of service. </p><h2>  Dzhemete </h2><p>  Fans of the ‚Äúlazy" holiday should definitely pay attention to Dzhemete (Anapa).  Youth and families with children - here everyone will find entertainment to their liking.  The resort offers a huge selection of boarding houses, home hotels, modern hotels, resorts with a medical base and even car campsites. </p><p>  Not the least role is played by the location of the village of Dzhemete.  Anapa is within walking distance, and the train station and the airport can be easily reached by car. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand cruise anapa" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/871536.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Most tourists are attracted by the clear sea and the ‚Äúgolden‚Äù beaches, which stretch for ten kilometers.  The swimming season starts in late May and continues until early October. </p><h2>  Hotel Grand Cruise" </h2><p>  Anapa is a fairly popular destination, and, as noted by travel agencies, demand for it is growing steadily.  Cozy guest houses and modern hotels are equally demanded in the resort.  If you value comfort and are used to a foreign level of service, then you should pay attention to a hotel with a developed infrastructure, for example, Grand Cruise (Anapa). </p><p>  Reviews of vacationers note its excellent location, friendly staff and all the necessary conditions for a vacation with children.  This is a great option for a vacation! </p><p>  The Grand Cruise Hotel first opened its doors in the summer of 2012.  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã8,000 square meters, four five-story buildings were built.  The total number of rooms includes 219 comfortable rooms: 16 luxury, 187 - standard and 16 - economy (for single occupancy). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grand cruise anapa reviews" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/871525.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The hotel‚Äôs own sandy beach is just 80 meters away.  It features a canopy and comfortable sun loungers.  The territory of the Grand Cruise complex (Anapa) has bars and restaurants, an outdoor pool with a plunge pool for kids, a sauna and a gym, a playground and a small park. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The Grand Cruise Hotel (Anapa) offers a choice of two dining options: breakfast and all-inclusive.  In addition, upon check-in, you can pay separately for lunch or dinner. </p><p>  Full board is a traditional buffet.  Every year, chefs improve their skills, so guests enjoy delicious dishes of French, Uzbek, Portuguese and Italian cuisine.  According to information on the official website, for the new summer season, the children's menu was maximized. </p><p>  If your choice is only breakfast, then there should not be any food problems.  Outside the hotel there are many small eateries and cafes, and the center of Anapa is only five kilometers away.  Not far from the Grand Cruise Hotel is the Dzhemete Market. </p><p>  As for the quality of food at the hotel buffet, the opinions of the guests were divided.  Some lack variety and meat dishes, others are completely satisfied with delicious and fresh food.  It is difficult to assess the objectivity of such reviews, because people have different preferences.  The only thing that most tourists agree on is the need to increase the time for lunch and dinner. </p><h2>  Cheap rooms </h2><p>  As we have already said, the Grand Cruise Hotel offers four accommodation options, the cost of which varies depending on the season. </p><p>  Economy rooms are designed for one guest.  In mid-July, for example, accommodation will cost 3,100 or 3,700 rubles.  The first option includes one breakfast, the second - full board. </p><p>  Air-conditioned room with a safe, fridge and telephone.  In addition, all guests are provided with toiletries, as well as sets of bath and beach towels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anapa Dzhemete Grand Cruise" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/871541.jpg" width="550"></div>

Prices primarily depend on the season.  Most of all who want to bask in the golden sand in Dzhemete appear in July-August, but with the beginning of the school year, the wave of tourists is reduced due to families with schoolchildren. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Grand Cruise Hotel Anapa" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/871540.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The management of ‚ÄúGrand Cruise‚Äù every year develops promotions and special offers, thereby attracting new guests.  For example, in August 2015, when booking a stay of 8 nights or more, guests receive one day as a gift. </p><p>  Special prices apply when paying extra bed.  For an adult, you need to pay 40% of the cost of the main place, for a child from 5 to 12 years old - 30%, and children under 5 can stay at the hotel for free. </p><p>  Another special offer concerns regular guests of the Grand Cruise Hotel, Anapa.  All who rested in Dzhemete from 2012 to 2014 receive a fixed discount of 5%.  When booking through the official website, you can take advantage of this offer.  However, when buying a tour through a company or online system, no hotel discounts apply. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  The Grand Cruise Hotel can be called partly family, and rest with a child is always fraught with a lot of difficulties.  With kids, many try to travel around Russia for several reasons: </p><ol><li>  <em>Climate</em>  Not all young children tolerate extreme heat equally well. </li><li>  <em>Food</em> .  Familiar products are not found abroad, and the children's menu in large hotels has little to do with the home ration. </li><li>  <em>Medical care</em> .  Despite the insurance, getting medical care in Russia is much easier. </li></ol><p>  Additional services offered by ‚ÄúGrand Cruise‚Äù (Anapa) will make your vacation with your baby more comfortable: </p><p>  - The children's playground is equipped with swings and slides.  Well-groomed area for classes with the teacher and the ability to watch cartoons will certainly please young guests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel grand cruise reviews" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/871535.jpg" width="550"></div>
