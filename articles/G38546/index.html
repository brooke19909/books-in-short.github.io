    <h2>  What is this resort </h2><p>  This is a very small area, but very interesting for tourists.  Forest covered hills occupy about 30 square kilometers.  These ridges tower several hundred meters above the surrounding steppes.  Composed of massive crystalline rocks, crowned by ridges and peaks, they form an interesting landscape.  For many centuries, wind and water, like skillful artists, turned mountains into the likeness of castles and fortresses, and individual peaks became like fairy-tale heroes or animals.  In the lowlands are numerous lakes. </p><p>  This is a unique place of amazing beauty, which is why people come to Borovoye from Omsk with great pleasure, despite the proximity of the <span>Altai Mountains, the</span> birthplace of waterfalls and rare plants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Independent road trip </h2><p>  If you want to significantly save on vacation, then you can go on vacation by car.  This is especially convenient, because the way to Borovoye from Omsk is very close, about 400 km;  Having left in the morning, by dinner you will already be there.  There are three options for getting to the place.  The first lies through Petropavlovsk and Kokshetau.  Often, tourists do not use this route, because not everyone likes a trip to rest through several large cities.  Although the road is good. </p><p>  The second route lies through Odessa and Kokshetau.  This road is a little shorter and is the most popular among those traveling to Borovoye from Omsk.  There is another option - to cut off after Odessa, but the road there is bad, so you are unlikely to save time. </p>

    <h2>  Travel itinerary </h2><p>  It is not difficult to get to Borovoye from Omsk by car.  Oriented by the navigator, exit through Odessa and follow directly towards the border.  Usually this stretch of road runs quickly and without any problems.  If there are no queues, then you need to provide a car for inspection, and then go through passport control in full force of all crew members.  This can take from 30 minutes to several hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This is followed by a segment of the path between the two borders, there is practically no road here, you have to ride a snake between the pits.  Crossing the Kazakhstan border is practically no different, then the road goes in segments not bad, somewhere there are pits.  Nearby laid an alternative route through the fields.  A good track starts only 20 km to the resort area.  So, without incident, you get to Borovoy. </p>

    <h2>  pay special attention </h2><p>  Of course, this is the most comfortable way to travel, you can go around the entire resort area, and if you get tired of relaxing in the lap of nature, take a ride on a luxurious autobahn to Astana.  But you need to keep in mind that when traveling by car, unlike a regular bus, you can seriously linger at customs.  In addition, compare the cost of the ticket in public and private transport in advance.  In addition to fuel, you will need to pay insurance, about 300 rubles for 2 weeks.  In the event of a breakdown, the need to search for a car service and pay for the work of the masters will fall on your shoulders.  Another nuance: before entering the territory of Kazakhstan, you need to stick a pre-purchased RUS sticker on the rear window.  And be sure to carefully follow all the rules of the road, otherwise you will have to part with your rights for a long time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Camping </h2><p>  If you do not apply to travel agency services, then you will have to look for housing on your own.  A lot of options are provided, because there are many tourists, and where there is demand, there are offers. </p><ul><li>  The most popular and cheapest option is to rent a summer house on the lake.  Almost every resident of the private sector has such facilities on its site with a minimal set of furniture, an outdoor shower and amenities in the yard.  Meals on request, depends on the culinary abilities of the owners.  The price is quite affordable - 300 rubles per person. </li><li>  Numerous pensions and cottages are scattered along the shores of the lakes.  Accommodation here depends on your needs.  Economy class rooms will cost 400 rubles per day, "luxury" - from 1000 to 6000. </li><li>  Hotels for accommodation are rarely used by Russian tourists, because they cost about 2000 rubles / day. </li><li>  Comfortable, comfortable apartments are not difficult to rent, and they will cost about 1000 rubles per day. </li></ul><p>  But none of these options will not convey all the colors of relaxation in the lap of nature.  If you arrived in Borovoye from Omsk savages, then find out from the local ranger where you can put up a tent, and enjoy.  There are specially designated places for this.  The hotel will not be able to give you the joys of spending the night under the stars, the aroma of food cooked at the stake.  It is such a vacation, and not accommodation in a comfortable hotel, you will remember for many years to come. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the most economical option is a trip to Borovoye by train, followed by rest in a tent.  But you need to take into account that from the place where the minibus drops you off, you will need to go a considerable distance with heavy luggage (tents, clothes, blankets, provisions) in order to reach the camp site.  Therefore, such a trip is best done on your car.  After spending the night, you can collapse the tent, close it in the car and take a quiet walk around the area. </p>

    <h2>  To Borovoye on a tourist tour </h2><p>  This option is the most comfortable and convenient.  You do not need to worry about anything if you chose <span>Borovoe</span> when planning your <span>vacation.</span>  A special bus will pick you up from Omsk; upon arrival, they will check in one of the recreation centers (depending on which tour operator advised you).  Already organized meals, tours, a program for the upcoming holidays.  It only remains to relax and rest. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As already mentioned, there are quite a lot of lakes.  This Shchuchye, Borovoe, Big and Small Chabachye, Kotyrkol.  These are only the largest ones, from the mountain you can clearly see many more small ones: Svetlye, Karasye, Swan and others.  To sunbathe on a soft sand, Lake Borovoye is suitable.  The views of it are just wonderful, the beach is also wonderful, but the purity of the water leaves much to be desired, so for swimming it is better to cross to the shore of the Big Chebach Lake.  Take warm towels with you, in June and August it is better to refrain from swimming, because all local lakes are quite cold.  They hit underground keys.  Only in the hottest month can the water temperature near the coast be comfortable.  But if you like to catch crayfish or fish, then this is abundant. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Having entered the reserve, many are speechless with admiration.  The Kazakh land is famous for its free, endless expanses of steppe, but here you see the real forest, bright and beautiful.  Basically it is <span>coniferous, evergreen pine</span> and birch, therefore there is no windbreak and shallow undergrowth, it is very pleasant to walk in such a forest.  Although Russians are spoiled by natural beauties, tourists still often travel to Borovoye from Omsk.  Reviews are beckoning to embark on a journey after them, breathe in the cleanest air, play with hand-made squirrels, look for mushrooms in the forest. </p>

    <p>  The cleanest is Lake Bolshoy Chebachye, various fish and crayfish live here, which can be observed through the clear water.  If you are not afraid of cold water, you can swim in its clear, azure waters.  Another, warmer and, unfortunately, dirty lake - Borovoe - is used more for sightseeing trips than for swimming.  A short walk around the lake (only 12 km) will leave a lot of pleasant impressions. </p><p>  At the source of the Gromova River you can see a unique "dancing" grove.  The trunks of the trees are so bizarrely curved that the name pops up by itself.  The east coast is a great sandy beach.  You can not get around the famous blue bay.  Mount Zhumbaktas (Riddle) rises directly from its waters.  This is the local Sphinx, and here tourists linger for a long time.  The fact is that if you look at the rock from different angles, the picture changes: first it is a girl with her hair loose, then a woman, and finally, the old woman Baba Yaga.  A little further is the peak of Otzhetpes, which is very similar to an elephant.  The local guide will tell you amazing legends about each of the local peaks. </p><p>  If inaccessible mountain heights attract you, then there are routes of all difficulty levels.  You can climb Mount Boletau, Otzhetpes, Kokshe or the highest local peak - Sinyuhu. </p><p>  Horseback riding is very popular.  For many citizens this is the only opportunity to get to know the graceful horse closely.  There is also a more familiar means of transportation - bike tours to local caves, waterfalls and mountains. </p><h2>  Fun for kids </h2><p>  Rest here is aimed at lovers of harmony with nature, there is no developed infrastructure, so it can be boring for kids, because they just can‚Äôt stand the hike in the mountains.  But you can play plenty on the beach, and in extreme heat - even plunge into the water.  Boat and catamaran rental services are available at <span>Lake Borovoy</span> .  In addition, a few days in the fresh air will benefit the child.  And what is especially nice, there are no mosquitoes and midges. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  If you still decide whether to go, the answer is unequivocal - get ready on the road.  Staying in such an amazing place gives an extraordinary boost of strength and energy.  The combination of <span>coniferous forest,</span> mountains and lakes creates a healing microclimate.  But not only air is useful, these places are famous for special mud and mineral water, and the locals prepare amazing koumiss.  If you go to Borovoye from Omsk, the prices will pleasantly surprise you, compared to Altai, the famous Belokurikha and even a tourist trip to Belukha - everything is much more affordable here. </p>
