    <h2>  Hotel itself </h2><p>  According to tourists from Russia, Nissiana Hotel &amp; Bungalows 3 * seemed to them very neat and well-groomed.  The hotel cannot boast of its own large territory, however there are several outdoor pools (adults and children), a sun terrace, a spa (indoor pool, sauna, massage rooms), a gym, a tennis court, a playground for children, a conference hall, restaurant and bar.  The hotel has a lot of greenery. </p><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Since the Nissiana Hotel belongs to the economy category, here you will not find luxurious apartments with a breathtaking design and modern technology.  However, as the hotel guests note, the rooms here are very cozy and comfortable.  Recently noticeable cosmetic repairs are noticeable in them.  As for furniture and items of equipment, everything is not new, but very high quality and in working condition.  If something breaks, then after contacting the administrator at the reception, hotel staff will quickly eliminate all problems that have arisen. </p><p>  Some of the complaints of tourists concerned only apartments with windows overlooking the pool.  According to vacationers living here, the rooms were too wet.  As for the pluses, many travelers note in their reviews the fact of the availability of free wireless Internet both in rooms and throughout the hotel.  Moreover, the connection speed is high enough, which allows you to always stay in touch with your friends and relatives staying at home.  As for the equipment of the rooms, there are no complaints.  Please note, by default, most apartments do not have electric kettles.  But they can always be taken at the reception, leaving a deposit of 10 euros.  The dishes in the rooms are always in sufficient quantities. </p>

Many travelers appreciated this attention to guests on the part of the administration.  As for the day of departure, you should hand over the room keys before noon.

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The guests of the Nissiana Hotel &amp; Bungalows (Ayia Napa, Cyprus) were mostly satisfied with the level of organization of the restaurant.  According to them, despite the fact that the choice of dishes here is not as diverse as, for example, in hotels in Turkey and Egypt, the quality of their preparation does not cause any complaints.  For this, our compatriots express special thanks to the hotel chefs.  In addition, for lunch and dinner, you can always choose something to your taste.  The menu always has meat, fish, poultry dishes, several side dishes, delicious fresh pastries, vegetables, fruits, desserts. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  As for this point, here the hotel in question was awarded the highest ratings from the guests.  After all, as already mentioned, it is located within walking distance from the best beach in Cyprus - Nissi Beach.  It will be comfortable for both adults and children to relax.  The beach itself is fine sand, the entrance to the sea is gentle, without stones.  The sea in this place is very clean and beautiful.  Since the beach is in municipal ownership, renting sun loungers will require additional payment.  But you can always sit right on the sand, laying the mats that you brought with you and installing an umbrella. </p>
