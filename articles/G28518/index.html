    <p>  And the defender of the Fatherland is a warrior in the main meaning.  It so happened that the war in any state is the most important factor in the history of the Fatherland, and, for example, the Russians practically did not have absolutely peacetime.  At all times, it was required either to defend their lands or to sift the interests of the country beyond its borders.  These are the conditions for the existence of Russia ‚Äî it needs both geopolitical integrity and cultural-historical integrity.  Therefore, here a military man always uses a special attitude: they trust him, respect him, they are afraid of him.  It is his memory that is perpetuated most often.  It is thanks to him that a country located on the sixth of the earth is alive.  The phrase itself usually refers to soldiers, officers, sailors and military people of all specialties, because the defense of the Fatherland is their job.  But here, by words is meant a much larger and broader meaning. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Background </h2>

    <p>  The military threat to our country is a <span>permanent state,</span> therefore the whole centuries-old history of the Fatherland is a war, endless and to some extent bloody.  Thus, behind a gray veil of incredibly distant time, a <span>military-national state was formed</span> with a mobilization type of development.  It is enough to recall the <span>reforms of Peter the Great</span> and the Stalinist modernization in the thirties of the last century, when the whole society, all the country's resources worked to solve military and political problems.  The creation of the army and navy in the first case and the most powerful military-industrial complex in the second.  And these are not the only examples. </p><h2>  Generational Memory </h2>

    <p>  In the sixteenth century, Russia fought for forty-three years, in the seventeenth for forty-eight, in the eighteenth for sixty-one years, in the nineteenth for sixty-seven.  Twentieth Century - The Soviet Union survived two world wars.  The Second World War is the main tragedy of world history.  With an unprecedented number of victims.  Armed forces of Russia and other republics of the Soviet Union defeated Nazi fascism, when the whole civilization came under threat of destruction.  It is all the more strange and even regrettable to hear how some people close to history are discussing on such a now burning topic.  The history of the Fatherland is the memory of generations, their spiritual state and healthy self-awareness, therefore it is necessary to protect our past from falsifications.  Without protection, the thread of the events of history is lost, which connects the people for many centuries.  If we forget how to respect our own army, we will have to respect the alien on our land. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vladimir Lenin and the defense of the fatherland </h2>

    <p>  This is the whole history of Russia, its exceptional position both from the point of view of geography and from the foreign policy situation require the presence of powerful armed forces.  The rest of the world knows about colossal natural reserves, and will certainly begin to build relations with Russia - only from a position of strength.  War is war.  Vladimir Ilyich notes that protecting the Fatherland is also not always true.  Thus, he shares the lies of imperialist wars, which replace all law and all democracy with violence during the war, in fact, fighting only for replenishing the top of the exploiters.  Civil and Patriotic wars are waged solely in the interests of the people, not by force of money, but by common forces and public consent.  Not a redistribution of the robbery of colonies and not a division of spheres of influence, but a mass movement of a people overthrowing national oppression - a just war.  Isn't it easy to throw a bridge over the century from V.I.  Lenin to modern events?  Today‚Äôs wars are characterized by just a lie: you have an oil field, but there is absolutely no democracy, we‚Äôre coming to you.  Lenin also wrote about the modern information war, when even a phrase like this has not yet been born.  A brilliant philosopher of insight.  He was right in the fact that the Fatherland is us, as a nation.  Therefore, the defense of the homeland is our task entirely. </p><h2>  Vladimir Dal about the Fatherland </h2>

    <p>  In the first words, the great lexicographer says the same thing as everyone: the Fatherland is the native land where our ancestors lived and died, and where we would like to live and die.  He asks: who doesn‚Äôt have a sweet <span>homeland, native</span> land ?!  Extensive and strong, our homeland gives everyone pride in the fact that he was born a warrior-warrior, and the whole history of the Fatherland is a continuation of the glory of the fatherland in grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  He recalls the year 1812, when both the old and the small saber belted: the Orthodox Kingdom did not perish!  We need to defend our homeland at every hour, the Dane tells us by blood, but by the breadth of our souls, because the homeland is both your house and your coffin, the cradle and dominion, your daily bread and life-giving water.  Fatherland is our haven and protection.  You can‚Äôt deny the Russian land, because the Lord will deny such a villain. </p><h2>  Actions to protect the Fatherland is a function of the state </h2>

    <p>  The most important direction in the work of the state is to ensure independence and integrity.  The root cause of this is national interests in the form of military, economic and political doctrines, concepts and programs.  The forms and means of protecting the security of the Fatherland are those that are most effective in achieving the goals set by the state, but are created on the principles of universal humanism.  Here, first of all, the country's defense, protection of sovereignty, guarantee of military security, as well as integrity and territorial integrity are important.  All this is provided by specially created state organizations - the Armed Forces and other military formations. </p>
