    <p>  Hotel Viva Maria 3 * was built recently, so the repair is completely new, living in the rooms is especially nice.  The complex consists of three floors.  The highlight of the hotel is the location between the floors of the pools.  The whole area is green, with lots of flowers.  There is a round-the-clock security, thanks to which any tourist will feel safe. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On the territory there is an outdoor pool with fresh water, which is constantly changing.  The pool itself is regularly cleaned.  Using it is included in the price, but it is important to consider that for several months a year the pool does not work.  There is also parking on site, it is guarded around the clock.  For a small fee (about $ 2 per day) you can leave your car here.  There is a small bar on site where you can enjoy delicious coffee or tea, as well as try local wines or other alcoholic drinks.  There is also a dining room where you can eat for a small amount, and this is a great alternative for a budget tourist who does not have money for a cafe.  It is very convenient that the hotel has a bureau that organizes the necessary excursion without any difficulty, and guests will not need to spend extra time looking for a guide.  Also included in the price is free internet. </p><h2>  Accommodation with children </h2><p>  The hotel allows children under 5 years old to stay for free.  This is a very convenient service, as in other hotels free accommodation is provided only for children under one year of age.  The only thing that will need to be paid is food for the child.  As for staying with children, it is important to consider the availability of all necessary documents.  Thus, children under 18 years of age who are resting with one of the parents need special documents for the child to stay in another country. </p><p>  The staff here is very responsive, will help in any matter and will certainly solve any problems.  Everyone can find entertainment for everyone.  The beach near the hotel is free, but you have to pay for a deck chair and an umbrella.  It‚Äôs not necessary to rent these things, you can just spread a towel and relax for your own pleasure.  Due to the mild climate and the lack of heat on the beach, you can stay all day.  At the same time, get a beautiful and even tan, which will especially interest girls. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The main evaluation criterion that Viva Maria deserves is the 3 * hotel (Abkhazia), reviews of vacationers.

    <p>  Hotel Viva Maria 3 * occupies a small territory with a pool with sun loungers.  The complex itself includes 3 buildings, which are located so that a cozy courtyard forms inside.  The hotel has an attractive facade.  The territory is very clean and has a good rest.  The hotel is just buried in flowers.  In addition to guests, the hotel has two parrots and a rabbit.  Sometimes they are taken out into the street, and everyone can watch them.  The perimeter of the courtyard is surrounded by tables with awnings.  There is a swing and a hammock.  In the evening there is always a place where you can relax.  You can rent a bicycle, play table tennis or air hockey.  Children can play on the trampoline.  It is very nice to be in such a place. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Abkhazia is an incredibly picturesque country.  Here, nature is amazingly beautiful, from which it takes your breath away.  The hotel can offer several types of excursions.  You can go to the mountains, surrounded by crystal lakes, canyons and waterfalls.  Some trips include a picnic.  In the forest, among mountain rivers, it is especially atmospheric.  Such an excursion lasts all day.  The cost per person is about 1600 rubles with a picnic. </p><p>  Most excursions include wine tastings.  If you wish and the opportunity you can buy excellent wine.  On the excursion route you can also visit the apiary and buy delicious honey. </p><p>  In Sukhumi, you should definitely go to the Botanical Garden (200 rubles per person).  It is very beautiful and calm.  You can walk all day, exploring the unique plants of the local flora.  On the territory there are shops. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Just ten minutes walk from the hotel there is a beautiful promenade.  The beach area here is more suitable for walking than for swimming.  The water is not very clean, and the bottom is rocky.  Good reviews have become famous for the beach of Mocha.  Everything is arranged here for a comfortable stay.  There are locker rooms, sunbeds, cafes and toilets.  There are also wild beaches.  There are not many people on them, but, of course, there are no amenities there. </p><h2>  General impression </h2>

    <p>  Rest in Abkhazia is always full of emotions.  The local nature cannot be compared with any overseas beauties.  Local residents (in particular, the owners of the hotel) are just an ocean of hospitality. </p><p>  Why go abroad if in amazing Abkhazia there is Viva Maria (3 * hotel).  Guest reviews suggest that the service is not inferior to four-star hotels in Turkey.  The only difference is nutrition.  Here it is not so diverse.  Modern renovated rooms, well-kept grounds, swimming pool.  In Abkhazia, this is one of the best hotels.  Populate quickly even at night.  Immediately offer dinner, breakfast or lunch, depending on the time of settlement.  The staff treats guests with special warmth.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter - is it the administrator or the canteen worker.  One gets the feeling that he was visiting old friends. </p><p>  Viva Maria 3 * hotel (Abkhazia, Sukhumi) is suitable for those who prefer European comfort to Soviet pensions, which are also available in Abkhazia.  The hotel definitely deserves its three stars. </p><p>  Abkhazia is a very interesting and colorful country, this place is worth a visit and feel new emotions.
