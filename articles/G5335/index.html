What kind of organization is this?  What services does she offer?  Are customers satisfied with them?  Understanding all this is not as difficult as it seems.  It is enough to carefully study the services of a particular corporation, as well as pay attention to numerous reviews.  Often, it is customers who can point out the pros and cons of firms that no one reports in advance. </p>

    <h2>  Office work </h2><p>  What feedback does this organization receive?  Should I contact Renessans Insurance?  What do customers think about this organization? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Customer opinions are generally mixed.  The thing is that some complain about the work of offices.  More precisely, the fact that certain branches refuse to provide certain services.  For example, purchase OSAGO. </p><p>  This phenomenon is the norm.  Official representatives of the organization often comment on such situations and ask to indicate the addresses to which customers contacted.  In most cases, it turns out that a particular department simply does not provide the necessary services.  For example, it is required to extend CTP, and the client contacts the sales department, which draws up only public insurance. </p><p>  It is recommended that you simply pay attention to which office you are contacting.  Otherwise, there are no significant complaints.  Unless in some departments of the organization queues are lined up. </p>

    <h2>  CASCO and CTP </h2><p>  What else can you hear about Renaissance Insurance?  MTPL and CASCO in this corporation are issued quite often.  At the same time, it is worth paying attention to the fact that reviews about the company are mixed.  There are good ones among them, and not so much. </p><p>  Some complain that it is impossible to get insurance on purchased policies.  Or you have to try pretty hard to get justice.  Some cases are not insurance, but they are generally not warned about. </p><p>  Despite this negative, there are still more positive opinions.  "Renaissance <span>Insurance" OSAGO</span> and CASCO offers on favorable terms.  Car repair is carried out quickly, without much labor and any negative aspects. </p><p>  So what to believe?  To a greater extent the second category of opinions.  The thing is that problems with payments arise for those who inattentively read the concluded agreement.  It prescribes all insurance and non-insurance events.  To be careful, no significant complaints about compulsory motor third-party liability insurance or hull insurance will arise. </p>

    <h2>  Online policy </h2><p>  "Renaissance Insurance" reviews are varied.  Not the best opinions are left for online policies.  What do customers pay attention to? </p><p>  First, the organization‚Äôs website will have to register.  Some people don‚Äôt like this process.  Be sure to indicate the region of residence. </p><p>  Secondly, some indicate that Renessans insurance does not indicate on the official website any restrictions on the production of third-party liability insurance.  The impossibility of ordering becomes clear only after sending the appropriate application for further processing.  The client will be called from the head office and will either be informed of the date of delivery of the policy, or they will say that in a particular city it is not possible to execute electronic registration. </p><p>  All this upsets customers.  On the official website of the organization, no restrictions are indicated anywhere.  Because of this, some suspect the company of dishonesty.  Rather, this is just a flaw that they are trying to eliminate. </p><h2>  About Payments </h2><p>  Renaissance Insurance (Moscow or any other city - it is not so important) earns mixed opinions about the payments made by the company.  What do customers say? </p><p>  There are those who complain about the lack of insurance, there are people who point out some delay in payments.  Nevertheless, the money is still paid.  There are also many thanks to the company.  In any case, no one will deceive customers.  And if, under the terms of the contract, payments are due, they will still reach the recipient.  Even if with some delays. </p>
