And indeed, at present, modern smartphones are practically not inferior to many expensive counterparts.  In this connection, another question is also relevant, how to photograph on a telephone correctly? </p><h2>  Good alternative </h2><p>  And, true, now many phones are equipped with a camera that is capable of taking quite good pictures.  Of course, this can not be compared with SLR cameras (although, perhaps, this is a matter of time).  But, one way or another, many people who do not plan to develop professional skills in photography, and this option will be acceptable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.greatbigscaryworld.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to photograph manicure on the phone" class="if uuid-2968871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968871.jpg"></div><p>  Possessing basic knowledge and skills, you can take good pictures, which in quality will not be inferior to many photos obtained by "soap dishes" of the middle price category.  And if a person not only knows how to take pictures, but is also familiar with such definitions as composition and harmony, then you can get not just masterpieces, but a whole art using the phone! </p><p>  What exactly can you take pictures on the camera of your phone?  Yes, actually anything and what the soul wants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Selfies </h2><p>  Many people like to capture themselves in the picture in splendid isolation.  At the same time, when preparing to take a picture or for a photo shoot, you should resort to the services of a makeup artist or do everything yourself.  Most girls are interested in how to photograph makeup on the phone?  To do this, you must adhere to a number of rules: </p><ol><li>  If you need to capture the face, then you should abandon the use of highlighter and transparent powders.  These substances can emphasize or fix makeup.  However, their composition contains particles that reflect light and in connection with this part of the face will be illuminated. </li><li>  It is acceptable to use facial bronzers and foundation with a slightly darker shade than skin color.  This is especially true for a photo shoot, as the lighting will eat up part of the makeup. </li><li>  It is mandatory to emphasize the eyes - the Smoky Ice makeup technique shows itself quite well.  As a result, an effect is created in which the light gamma smoothly turns into dark tones.  False or magnetic cilia can maximize the look, making the eyes larger. </li><li>  How to photograph yourself on the phone?  It is necessary to try to avoid the angle in full view, since often such pictures do not look very beautiful.  It is better to turn your face slightly in any direction or even slightly lower it. </li><li>  When choosing a pose, one should take into account body complexion.  With wide hips it is better to stand sideways.  To emphasize the thin waist and lush bust, you should stand up straight, but at the same time the lower body should be wound to one side, or cross your legs, wound one after another.  The face also needs to be turned sideways, and the chin should be directed to the shoulder.  This position will allow you to "lose" 5-7 kg and will be winning. </li></ol><p>  Compliance with these recommendations will allow you to make really high-quality images. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.savethestudent.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to photograph nature on the phone" class="if uuid-2968875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968875.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, they will be no worse than those photos that are obtained from a professional digital SLR camera. </p><h2>  How to photograph manicure on the phone? </h2><p>  Many girls not only care about the beauty of their hands, but also try to take beautiful pictures whenever possible in order to accept numerous compliments from girlfriends and fans.  But how can this be done with only one telephone on hand?  You can, of course, turn to a professional photographer, but his services cost a lot of money. </p><p>  In particular, such pictures are necessary for the masters of any nail service for various reasons.  Here, a number of features should be taken into account, and first of all, the matter concerns the arrangement of the hands.  It is very difficult to make them look beautiful in the frame.  Nevertheless, nothing impossible does not exist. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glitter.si" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to photograph nails manicure on the phone" class="if uuid-2968872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968872.jpg"></div><p>  At the same time, it should be remembered that making really high-quality photos using the phone will not work.  This is mainly due to geometric distortions, which are obtained using not the best lens of a smartphone.  In this regard, at least a compact camera with a zoom lens is required. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Factors to Consider </h2><p>  In order to finally dot all the i in relation to how <span>to photograph nails, manicure</span> on the phone, it is worth mentioning that the quality of the photos as a whole depends on a number of factors: </p><ol><li>  The beauty of the hands - during the shooting, not only nails are taken into the frame, but part of the hand along with the fingers.  And if there are any flaws, then in the final shot it will not look very attractive. </li><li>  Lighting - when taking a picture of nails, it is important that the light is scattered.  The presence of glare will violate the integrity of the picture.  If the presence of bright light strips is necessary, they should be unobtrusive and transmit volume. </li><li>  Good color rendering in the absence of artifacts largely depends on the lighting and its quantity.  The quality of the camera also matters.  And here we can mention a significant drawback of any smartphone camera - the result is a software-processed image that is far from reality.  In addition, due to the small size of the matrix, it is impossible to reflect a full volume on the image. </li></ol><p>  Even knowing how to take pictures of people, yourself, your manicure on the phone, it is impossible to get really high-quality pictures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pxhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to photograph people on the phone" class="if uuid-2968873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968873.jpg"></div><p>  However, if photographs are taken purely for private use or to show off in front of friends, then the smartphone is capable of something. </p><h2>  Little tricks </h2><p>  To take pictures of your nails, you can take into account the recommendations of professional photographers.  In particular, to focus on the hands, creating an additional image with the help of bright rings that will be in harmony with the shade of manicure. </p><p>  If you cross the wrists on your chest and at the same time spread all your fingers, you can get quite attractive and unusual pictures.  At the same time, such a shot will require careful selection of clothes.  It is better to stay on models of discreet color with a minimum number of ruffles, buttons, zippers. </p><p>  How to take photos of your hands on the phone?  An unusual arrangement of fingers will help bring a bit of zest.  It is necessary to give the hands some beautiful position, and to remove all extraneous details from the frame - such a pose is able to attract attention without any additional attributes. </p><p>  Dynamic shots will also look unusual and at the same time no less attractive.  Hand dance is the most successful perspective, but creating it is not so simple.  This can be done if the smartphone has a dynamic shooting mode.  It remains only to catch the moments, and then choose the most successful ones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="unsplash.com" data-author=": Banter Snaps, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to photograph nature on the phone" class="if uuid-2968878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968878.jpg"></div><p>  The most relevant topic for such pictures is Love story!  What could be better than a neat female pen on the shoulder or body of a beloved man ?!  You can even create an entire storyline.  Romance in such photographs is more than appropriate - it is even necessary! </p><p>  When lovers hold hands or girls fingers are beautifully placed in strong male hands or simple hugs - it is difficult to stay away from such frames.  For the sake of this, it is worth mastering the techniques of how to photograph everything that interests you on the phone correctly. </p><h2>  The largely unnecessary Zoom function </h2><p>  In any modern phone there is an opportunity to enlarge the subject.  At the same time, even a minimal level leads to a noticeable decrease in the quality of the photo.  Noises immediately appear, and this, in turn, worsens the already not the best sharpness. </p><p>  In other words, when it becomes necessary to bring something closer, it is better to approach the subject.  If this is not possible, then it remains to take pictures as is, and then in any editor you can trim all the excess (if necessary).  In addition, the closer the subject is, the better the picture will be. </p><h2>  Camera settings </h2><p>  The camera of each smartphone has its own characteristics, to find out which is enough to study its settings.  By default, auto mode is used, only for a specific situation it does not always work correctly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bedwalls.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to photograph the room on the phone" class="if uuid-2968874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968874.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, there are other modes: </p><ul><li>  sport; </li><li>  panorama; </li><li>  night shooting; </li><li>  portrait. </li></ul><p>  It is worth exploring all the features of your smartphone to get really beautiful pictures. </p><h2>  Lens cleanliness </h2><p>  Another question that may concern any novice specialist is how to photograph the premises on the phone?  In addition to the settings and choosing the desired angle, you should monitor the cleanliness of the lens of your smartphone.  Since the phone is on hand most of the time, the glass of the camera is constantly covered with a layer of sebum.  But due to fingerprints, the frame is not only blurry, sharpness may be affected. </p><p>  For this reason, you should always carry a microfiber cloth or special pencil with you.  With regard to many SLR digital cameras, this problem does not arise - the smallest particles on the lens will not be able to ruin the frame.  However, the smartphone‚Äôs camera is arranged a little differently and is not comparable with the ‚ÄúDSLRs‚Äù.  Therefore, this moment is very important and you should not forget about it for each phone owner. </p><h2>  Practice, practice and practice again </h2><p>  No matter how much theoretical information and books are read, whatever terms are learned, without practice for a fairly long period of time, all teaching is wasted.  All ideas that come to mind regarding the subject of images should be immediately implemented if possible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to photograph makeup on the phone" class="if uuid-2968877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41611/2968877.jpg"></div><p>  And how to photograph nature on the phone?  Here it is necessary not only to try different angles, modes, but also to collect whole compositions, be in search of a better background.  Any option, implemented in practice, will allow you to acquire certain skills and knowledge. </p><p>  In conclusion, one thing can be said: in order to get high-quality images for home use, it is not at all necessary to purchase sophisticated professional equipment, including various sources for the necessary lighting.  All that is required is to learn how to use all the opportunities that many manufacturers give their products. </p>
