Notable Dauphin are found in the chronicles of France and Spain.  Between the emergence of this title and its abolition lies five hundred years of turbulent European history. </p><h2>  First mention </h2><p>  Dauphin is the owner of Dauphine.  This value of this title is mentioned in connection with the aristocrats of the house of d'Albon, who for several centuries owned the lands of allobrogs. </p><p>  During the time of the <span>Roman Empire,</span> these territories were incorporated into a powerful state.  After the Western Roman Empire fell under the onslaught of external enemies, these lands became an independent state entity, which served as a buffer between the lands of the French kings and the territories belonging to the Duke of Savoy. </p><p>  The Counts d'Albon held the position of seneschals in the neighboring Arelate state.  The emblem of these aristocrats depicted <span>royal lilies</span> and a dolphin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dauphin is" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/698387.jpg" width="447"></div>  It was this animal that became the cause of the nickname, and then the title of nobleman, because the Dauphin - this means the dolphin in translation from French.  Gradually, so did the land that the Dauphin owned.  The historical area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDauphine and now bears such a name and is part of France

The coat of arms of the Dauphin was inherited by a continuer of the clan Beatrice d'Albon, who became the wife of the Duke of Burgundy and transferred the rights to Dauphin to her son.  The last official holder of the Dauphin title, as the owner of the Dauphin√© land, was Humber II (Humbert). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paris Dauphin" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/698693.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  By the beginning of the XIV century, the house of d'Albon had long lost its glory.  The ruined last representative of the dynasty, having lost his only son, decided to sell the land to Dauphin√©.  Bids for sale were sent <span>to the Pope</span> and the <span>Holy Roman Emperor.</span>  Neither side was interested in this proposal. </p><h2>  Title transfer </h2><p>  Then the offer to sell Dauphine was sent <span>to the King of France,</span> Philip VI. <br>  After lengthy negotiations, the French crown acquired land for its heir - the son of King John the Good.  It turned out to be the eldest son of John - Carl.  As the owner of Dauphin√© land, he also had the right to bear the rank of Dauphin.  This title of heir to the throne title was permanently entrenched in the Royal House of France as the name of the owners of certain lands inherited by the king‚Äôs children. </p><p>  At age 11, <span>Charles V</span> received the title of Dauphin.  This circumstance completely changed his life and was the first step in preparing the reign of France.  Prelates of Dauphine take the oath to him, and new subordinates provide homage - a contract of submission and protection between the overlord and the vassal. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ownership in France </h2><p>  Control of Dauphine was very important for the French kingdom, as the ancient trade routes connecting France with the Mediterranean countries passed through these lands.  Dauphine still retained the remnants of past rights and privileges as an independent state, but gradually the center of land management shifted to Paris.  Dauphin, by virtue of his minority, often could not be a full-fledged ruler of his land, and fully royal power was established in Dauphin only after 1461.  During the reign of Louis XI Dauphine, having lost the rest of its independence, it became fully part of the French kingdom. </p><p>  Through the <span>family ties</span> that arose as a result of marriages between the representatives of the royal dynasties of France and Spain, the Dauphin began to wear this title in Spain, although no direct connection was found between the Alpine Dauphin and Spain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dauphin in Spain" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/698889.jpg" width="251"></div>

    <p>  The heirs of the French crown used the word ‚ÄúDauphin‚Äù until the end of the 18th century.  With the overthrow of the Bourbons, <span>this title</span> went out of use.  And during the short restoration of royal power in France, the title of heir was replaced by the phrase ‚Äúroyal prince‚Äù. </p>
