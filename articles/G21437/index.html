And this is the Leicester Codex by Leonardo da Vinci.  In 1994, the Codex was bought by Bill Gates for a fabulous $ 30.7 million.  In today's equivalent, it is approximately 49 million. </li></ol><p>  But if you think that only foreign publications are valued at millions of dollars, then you are mistaken.  Here is a list containing the most expensive domestic works. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The rarest domestic books </h2><p>  So, the top 5 "The most expensive books in Russia." </p><ol><li>  "Russian folk pictures", Dmitry Rovinsky.

Year of publication: 1781-1788.  The price of the work is 5.9 million rubles. </li></ol><p>  These were the rarest and most expensive books.  But this is not a complete list of rare editions.  Maybe few people know, but even the most expensive antique books can number several thousand or even millions of copies, of course, in this case, the first editions are of particular value, the price for which can reach several million. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The main criteria for evaluating collection books </h2><p>  The rarest and most expensive books are selected according to the following criteria. </p><ol><li>  Books of Ivan Fedorov or his students.  There are not many editions of the first printer in the world, but because of their sad state, the price of some works does not rise above 300 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Antique books published in the 18-19th centuries, illustrations for which were written by famous artists. </li><li>  Not completely destroyed books.  Writers are creative people and therefore easily injured.  For various reasons, including negative reviews from critics, they bought up almost the entire circulation and destroyed their own works.  Books that survived this frenzy are valuable collector's books. </li><li>  The first books of future luminaries of literature.  Drafts of writers are especially valuable.  Of course, finding such ones requires a handwriting examination. </li><li>  Intravital editions of great writers, especially with their autographs. </li></ol><p>  The most expensive books, as a rule, are the rarest. </p><h2>  The most expensive book </h2><p>  Every educated person has heard of Leonardo da Vinci, and at least a little, but is familiar with his work and inventions.  Almost everything that a genius took was becoming great, and some of his inventions and thoughts were ahead of their time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most expensive antique books" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45615/1638022.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Leicester Codex, or simply, A Treatise on Water, Earth, and Heavenly Bodies, is one of the most valuable creations of the Italian genius.  The treatise looks like a notebook with notes on the structure of the world, which the scientist wrote down while being in Milan from 1506 to 1510. </p><p>  Entries contain illustrations made by the author.  Here, the inventor shared the conclusions of his observations and experiments that he conducted throughout his life. </p><p>  In 1717, the treatise was acquired by the famous English house, in whose honor it received its name. </p><h2>  Fate of the book now </h2><p>  The book was purchased at auction by the richest man on the planet at that time - Bill Gates - back in 1994 for almost 31 million dollars. </p><p>  This is currently the most expensive book in the world.
