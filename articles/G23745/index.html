In our article we want to talk about one of the hotels in Calella - Mont Rosa Hotel. </p><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Mont Rosa Hotel is a three-star complex a few meters from the coast.

    <p>  All rooms are equipped with central heating, a dining area, satellite channels, air conditioning and a CD player.  <span>The panoramic windows of the</span> hotel have a stunning sea view.  The rooms are also equipped with hairdryer, bathtub and telephone.  The apartments are regularly cleaned and changed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Complex infrastructure </h2><p>  Guests of the Mont Rosa Hotel 3 * can visit the restaurant, pool, bar, children's room.  The complex has free parking and an elevator.  It offers tourists a television lounge, animation programs, disco, bowling, entertainment. </p><h2>  Sports and Entertainment </h2><p>  Mont Rosa Hotel 3 * offers vacationers to ride a jet ski, a banana, a canoe, go on a boat for sea fishing, attend courses and learn the basics of scuba diving. </p><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  Mont Rosa Hotel 3 * (Spain) offers food in the main restaurant as a buffet.  At the request of tourists, you can take breakfast only, and you can add lunch and dinner.  Near the hotel there are a large number of bars and restaurants, where you can always eat.  Therefore, there are no problems with food outside the walls of the hotel.  The complex also has a poolside bar. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  Calella is the tourist center of the entire vast coast of the Maresme-Barcelona.  The city is characterized by democracy and a friendly attitude towards foreigners.  Attractive for tourists makes the Calella Mediterranean climate.  In addition, in the immediate vicinity of the city (only 50 kilometers) there are two capitals of the Catalan provinces - Girona and Barcelona.  Excellent transport interchange allows tourists to attend independently all the holidays and events in them.  Moreover, these cities are centers of cultural life on the Mediterranean coast in Spain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mont rosa hotel 3" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1560985.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, Calella is interesting because it has large shopping and pedestrian areas in the city center: many picturesque alleys, parks, squares.  The resort has many different hotels designed for tourists with different incomes.  Calella boasts three kilometers of golden sandy sea beaches, an extensive Dalmau park, and cool alleys of Garby, Puigver and Manuel.  Local beautiful places and attractions make Calella very interesting for tourists.  Experts estimate that every year the city is visited by 250,000 tourists from different countries, but at the same time the resort is especially popular among the Germans and British who live here throughout the season. </p><p>  For the first time, Calella was mentioned in documents of the beginning of the twelfth century, at that time the first fisherman's huts began to rebuild in this region of Spain.  An interesting fact is that in 1497 in the future tourism center there were only 35 residential buildings.  And only in the sixteenth century did the future central part of Calella begin to form: a market square appeared, the streets of Mar, Iglesia, Batlier, Howard, the quarter of Salvador. </p><p>  Tourism in the region began to develop actively in the sixties of the twentieth century.  Local residents began to gradually move away from their usual activities (fishing and textile production) and increasingly engage in tourism.  The massive influx of foreigners into the resort greatly changed the appearance of the city.  Many hotels appeared here, a new real estate was built, which the Dutch, Germans and British willingly acquired.  And, nevertheless, the city managed to preserve its original original architecture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Calella beaches </h2><p>  The coast of Calella is considered one of the best in Catalonia in terms of equipment and cleanliness.  Every year, beaches are awarded the blue flag for environmental friendliness and cleanliness, because it is no secret that only the best stretches of the coast can boast such an award.  Active tourists can always find interesting activities at the resort: volleyball, soccer, windsurfing, water skiing, catamarans, bicycles, yacht trips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mont rosa hotel 3 spain" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1560996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, not all of the coast of Calella has gently sloping beaches; rocky sections begin near Capaspre.  Here you can see many small secluded coves. </p><h2>  Resort Activities </h2><p>  Near the town is the Montenegre Corredor Nature Reserve.  As an entertainment at the resort you can visit the markets with the products of local artisans, concerts and fiestas.  The center of cultural life is considered the alley of Manuel Puigvert, at which a fair is held every year, various entertainment events are organized.  Calella is also famous for the Catalan exhibition of roses, carnival, sardana festival, international beer festival. </p><h2>  Mont Rosa Hotel 3 * (Calella): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking of the complex, I would like to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited it.  It is worth noting that Mont Rosa Hotel (Spain) is one of those hotels that receive very conflicting reviews.  Let's talk about them in more detail.  According to vacationers, the complex definitely has two advantages: the staff and the location.  The hotel is located near the center and right on the sea coast.  To be on the beach, just cross the road. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mont rosa hotel 3 calella reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1560998.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  Mont Rosa Hotel 3 * (Calella) has, according to guests, very different apartments.  Seasoned tourists are advised to book rooms overlooking the sea.  They are more spacious, have balconies or terraces, large panoramic windows.  The hotel also has rooms facing the courtyard.  It‚Äôs hard to say whether they are all very small.  But many tourists remain dissatisfied with them, because the rooms are very tiny, and the windows are also small, and it is impossible to ventilate the room.  In addition, sometimes a situation arises when the air conditioner does not work.  Therefore, when booking, you should not choose the most economical option, so as not to be disappointed later.  Sometimes the hotel staff offers to move to the best apartments for a surcharge, which is taken from each person, which in the end is a pretty decent amount.  This option for a budget hotel is also unacceptable.  Therefore, you should initially consider which apartments you prefer. </p><p>  As for cleaning, the reviews regarding it are very different.  Some vacationers are very happy, while others are not.  Apparently, it all depends on the maids.  Towels and bed linen are changed regularly.  The furniture in the rooms is not new and made in the colonial style.  It is noticeable that the apartments are "tired" and require repair. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  How are meals at the Mont Rosa Hotel?  Reviews of tourists in this matter are always mixed.  And this hotel is no exception.  Guests at the complex can only take breakfast or prefer full board.  According to tourists, breakfast in the restaurant is very scarce and monotonous.  Of course, no one remains hungry, but there are no interesting dishes at all.  Even bacon and sausages are served very rarely. </p><p>  As for lunch and dinner, a greater variety appears on the buffet: a lot of vegetables, several types of meat, fruits, desserts, paella, pasta, cheese, sauces and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mont rosa hotel reviews" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1560999.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who prefer to eat outside the hotel will easily find a place to do this.  There are an incredible number of cafes and restaurants around, which always have delicious European food.  It is possible that meals in a hotel are cheaper than in other places, but which option to prefer is a personal matter for every tourist.  In general, the food in the hotel is acceptable for a three star hotel. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  Mont Rosa Hotel 3 * (Costa Brava) - a hotel that will appeal to those who are planning a vacation on the sea coast or an active excursion program.  A ten-minute walk from the hotel there is a railway station, and therefore it is very easy to get to the main attractions and the nearest cities.  Electric trains run on a schedule with an interval of half an hour, and they absolutely do not interfere with vacationers, since they are not at all noisy. </p><p>  A serious drawback is the complete lack of Wi-Fi (for those who are very interested in this issue).  There is absolutely no internet throughout the hotel, even in the lobby.  Therefore, vacationers go to the nearest cafe or McDonald's to chat with family. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mont rosa hotel 3 calella" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1561000.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <p>  But the complex has a very nice and helpful staff who are always smiling and very welcoming with vacationers.  Workers, to the best of their ability, try to help the guests by solving the problems that arise.  In general, the hotel makes a very good impression.  The complex has a small pool, but there is no reason to swim in it, since such a beautiful sea is located very close by. </p><p>  As we mentioned, the hotel has a convenient location.  It‚Äôs not difficult to get to him.  There are regular Aeroflot flights to Barcelona from Moscow.  During the high season, a considerable number of charters are added to them.  And from the capital to the resort in an hour you can get on a comfortable train.  Tickets from the resort to the capital in both directions for adults will cost 6-8 EUR, and for children 4-6 EUR. </p><p>  The hotel is always attended by representatives of travel agencies offering their own excursion programs, but you can see Spain on your own.  For example, a rental car where you can travel the entire coast and see Barcelona can be a great option.  But for this you need to have documents (rights) of international standard.  The rental price is very different, but on average is thirty USD. </p><p>  Since there is an electric train station near the complex, vacationers can get by with public transport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mont rosa hotel spain" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1561001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Calella is a great place to relax, around there are an incredible number of attractions and simply beautiful and interesting places, so active tourists will always find new routes for excursions.  Knowledgeable travelers are certainly advised to visit the famous Barcelona with its unique light and music fountains. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Mont Rosa Hotel is a hotel that is good for beach and sightseeing holidays.  However, the hotel clearly refers to budgetary institutions, so it will appeal to unpretentious and uninhabited tourists.  If you are a supporter of comfortable, beautiful rooms and gourmet food, then you should definitely look for another place.  The choice of hotels of different levels in the resort is simply huge.  In this complex, those tourists who want to relax at sea and see Spain, but at the same time meet a certain limited amount, can have a good time.  The hotel is popular among supporters of economy-class recreation and European youth. </p>
