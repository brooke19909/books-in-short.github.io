The resort complex of Santa Marina with an amphitheater is located on the first line near the sea.  Very pleased is the famous royal beach, known for its white sand.  The resort town is surrounded by mixed forests, turning this place into a cozy oasis, protected from the whole world with its problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="santa marina holiday village" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1449415.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The territory of the complex has a well-developed infrastructure.  There are children's entertainment centers, bars, restaurants, swimming pools and many other amenities that make tourists a real holiday. </p><h2>  Complex structure </h2><p>  The whole village consists of four-story cottages with different apartments, many of which have wonderful sea views.  The resort is surrounded by greenery.  The architecture of the buildings is made in the style of the Bulgarian Renaissance of the nineteenth century.  The town was built in such a way that seventy percent of its territory remained under green spaces and park alleys.  The best place for a relaxing holiday is simply not to be found. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A bit about the hotel </h2><p>  Santa Marina Holiday Village is located two kilometers from Sozoplya.  It has direct access to motorways.  The complex was founded in 2006, and since then it has hosted lovers of sea resorts.  In 2013, the hotel was completely renovated.  Currently, it is a completely modern complex with all the necessary infrastructure. </p><p>  Hotel Santa Marina Holiday Village is located at the following address: Bulgaria, Sozopol, 8130, HV Santa Marina, ap 13, 407. In fact, it is a closed type hotel complex.  It consists of eighty villas and cottages (two- and three-story), which are built along the Black Sea coast.  Externally, the resort resembles an ordinary Bulgarian village on the shores of Sozopol Bay. </p><h2>  Hotel Features </h2><p>  Santa Marina Holiday Village is a town living its own resort life.  On its territory, you can rent not only apartments with several rooms, but also entire attics.  The interiors of all apartments fit perfectly into the general atmosphere of this resort: the walls are painted in sand tones, natural wooden furniture in the inimitable country style, highlighted by unobtrusive, but original accessories. </p>

    <p>  The layout of the apartments makes them very convenient for everyday relaxation.  They have kitchen units, washing machines, ironing facilities, and, of course, the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  As we already mentioned, Santa Marina Holiday Village is a large complex, and therefore the number of rooms is very diverse.  It is not possible to describe all the possible options within the framework of the article.  Therefore, we give a description of only some of the most popular apartments in order to give an overview of this wonderful place: </p><ol><li>  The studio is about forty square meters and can accommodate two guests.  It consists of sleeping and living areas, and also has a kitchenette.  This type of apartment does not have an extra bed. </li><li>  The rooms with a bedroom and a living room have a large area (65 square meters).  These apartments can comfortably accommodate two people. </li><li>  The rooms with two bedrooms and one living room are designed for a family of four.  Such apartments have an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout eighty square meters. </li></ol><p>  The hotel is very diverse, everyone can choose the right option for themselves.  All apartments of the complex are very spacious and well equipped, which creates a wonderful atmosphere for a carefree holiday. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  Santa Marina Holiday Village is not an ordinary hotel, but rather a whole village with its well-functioning infrastructure.  The complex has five pools, three of which are adults, and two are children's.  The ponds are cascaded and decorated with a variety of lights and all kinds of bridges. </p><p>  The hotel has been hosting guests since 2006, during which time a playground, volleyball, basketball, football, table tennis and tennis courts appeared on its territory.  Animators every day offer tourists water aerobics classes.  For active vacationers, the hotel even has extreme attractions.  Initially, a SPA center was opened in the complex; over the many years of its work, the range of services has gradually expanded. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To overcome a large territory of the hotel on foot, not everyone can do it, and therefore electric cars are launched for tourists on it.  It is very convenient, especially for young children and people of age.  And the stairs leading to the sea were supplemented with an elevator, which makes the descent much faster and shorter. </p>

    <p>  The hotel is interesting in that it has a huge green area.  Around everything is buried in trees and shrubs, many flower beds.  Everything is very clean and tidy.  It's nice to just walk along the alleys.  It is worth noting that this vast territory has natural elevations, which is associated with the local landscape.  Perhaps someone will not like it. </p><p>  "Santa Marina" is a hotel with parking, although this moment is probably not so important for our compatriots. </p><h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  On the territory of Santa Marina Holiday Village 4 * there is a cafe "Sky", "Breeze", a bar "Joy" and a pizzeria.  At these establishments, guests can grab a bite to eat and enjoy fine cocktails. </p><p>  In the ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù, the cook will prepare the dish you ordered right in front of you.  The main restaurant of the resort is Apollonia.  Every day this institution feeds tourists with delicious and satisfying breakfasts, dinners and lunches.  However, those vacationers who do not want or cannot eat in public places can buy groceries in the supermarket on the territory of the complex and cook on their own, since all rooms are equipped with their own kitchenettes.  This is especially convenient for those families who come with small children. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Santa Marina Holiday Village (Sozopol) has its own small sandy beach with paid umbrellas and sunbeds.  In addition, a fairly large beach area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe neighboring Zolotaya Rybka camping site is nearby.  It has a free zone, which can be visited by vacationers of neighboring hotels.  The entrance to the water along the coast is gentle and comfortable, quite suitable for children.  The water is clean, but far from always calm, still it is the Black Sea.  On the beaches there are locker rooms, cafes, showers. </p><h2>  Entertainment <strong></strong></h2><p>  Santa Marina Holiday Village has many sports facilities.  The hotel‚Äôs animators do an excellent job of organizing children's activities.  Young tourists are very satisfied.  In addition, the complex has a playground, more precisely, several of them.  In general, kids will always find activities. </p>

    <p>  But as for adult animation, then, according to tourists, it is not enough.  However, it is not necessary to be bored in Santa Marina Holiday Village 4 * (Sozopol).

    <p>  Of greatest interest to tourists is the old part of the city, which is an architectural reserve and is protected by UNESCO.  The church of the Bulgarian Renaissance is especially beautiful in it, old houses, the remains of the fortress walls, restaurants serving national cuisine with panoramic views of the sea coast. </p><h2>  Santa Marina Holiday Village: reviews </h2><p>  Concluding the conversation about the hotel, I want to turn to the impressions of vacationers.  According to tourists, the complex has a rather convenient location.  From the airport by bus, the road does not take more than forty minutes.  Of course, you can order a transfer at the hotel, but it is not particularly needed.  It is quite possible to get on your own. </p><p>  Tourists are very pleased with the spacious and beautiful rooms of the hotel complex.  A special delight is the presence of the kitchen.  This is very convenient, because you can always cook something for a child, and even for adults.  The hotel has several shops, so there are no problems with the products.  At any time you can buy semi-finished products, a couple of minutes - and the dish is ready.  Many vacationers buy a tour to the hotel only with breakfast, and for lunch and dinner they eat in a cafe or cook on their own.  This option is most convenient, because often you do not want to leave the beach and it is easier to have a snack there.  Or, going for a walk in Sozopol, you don‚Äôt have to rush to dinner.  In this regard, the complex is well thought out. </p>

    <p>  Of great interest is the hotel territory itself.  She is really awesome.  It takes two to three days to get around it and study.  There is something to see here.  Santa Marina is somewhat similar to a botanical garden.  On its territory there are many plants from all over the world that get along well here.  There are a lot of beautiful flowers around. </p><p>  The complex is so arranged that rains are not terrible.  Water descends very quickly, even puddles do not remain.  The infrastructure is thought out to the smallest detail, you can live there for a couple of weeks without even leaving and not even think about anything. </p><p>  You can go to Sozopol on foot, or you can ride on a steam train that runs every half hour for two leva.  He makes the last flight at ten in the evening.  After this, you can only get by taxi (ten leva).  Sozopol is a wonderful city, which is worth a walk and sit in the atmosphere of local cafes. </p><h2>  Children's resort </h2><p>  The hotel is a good place to relax with children.  Here, the coast itself is as if created for kids.  In addition, there are many playgrounds on the territory itself.  Not to mention that it is closed and guarded.  Entertainment activities are organized for children.  In general, animators work well.  Kids really like the local beach.  They rush along the shore with butterfly net and catch the local marine life.  This process causes them special delight. </p><h2>  Service: reviews </h2><p>  Maids clean rooms every day.  Towels are also changed daily.  The staff is friendly.  The quality of the cleaning is sometimes lame.  Cots are provided free of charge. </p><p>  As for the service in the hotel restaurants, not all guests are satisfied.  The staff is slow and of poor quality. </p>

    <p>  If you do not want to eat in a cafe, you can cook it yourself.  Fruits, vegetables and meat here in stores are much cheaper than in Turkey.  Also sold a lot of seafood: flounder, eels, stingrays, clams, <span>crabs and king</span> prawns. </p><p>  The hotel organizes trips to local attractions.  You should definitely visit the old castle.  In principle, all interesting and beautiful places can easily be reached independently if you do not want group ‚Äúraces‚Äù. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up all of the above, I want to note that Santa Marina is a wonderful holiday complex.  It can be safely recommended to tourists planning a vacation in Bulgaria.  A large beautiful area, spacious rooms, good infrastructure and beautiful landscapes - all this is the key to a good vacation on the sea coast. </p>
