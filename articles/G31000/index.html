Quite unexpectedly, however, this technique quickly gained high popularity.  The speakers were comfortable.  Their range is really huge, which allows you to choose the device to your taste.  The article provides an overview of portable speakers that received the highest ratings from consumers. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  It's about power and speaker format.  As a rule, the manufacturer indicates the first indicator quite rarely, and consumers are never interested in this information.  Before deciding on a model, it is better to pay attention to how many speakers are used, as well as how large they are.  If the device has treble or bass heads, it will be much better than where only one broadband sound source is installed.  A review of portable speakers will allow you to understand which of the proposed options has the most powerful playback, so you should not worry. </p><p>  Size is also not necessary to forget.  In the photographs that are presented on the Internet resources, the systems may seem the same, but in reality their dimensions differ markedly.  In the event that the buyer is going to carry the column with him everywhere, it is better to prefer a model weighing 300-500 g. Heavier ones are usually intended for a desktop device at home or in the office.  That is how they are more rationally used. </p><h2>  Appearance (design) </h2><p>  Most of the proposed devices from a huge range are connected to sound sources using a bluetooth module.  Before you buy a column, it is best to clarify how many tags it stores in memory.  If there are several, then switching from tablet to phone will occur instantly.  Otherwise, you will have to reconfigure and connect the speaker each time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Internet provides extensive reviews of portable Bluetooth speakers.  Popularity is easily explained by their functionality.  Therefore, it is best when choosing to pay attention to this particular type of device. </p><p>  If the consumer is more interested in Apple's technology, then he should give preference to models that connect using AirPlay.  They seamlessly and instantly connect to the necessary device, which is good news. </p><p>  In the event that the column will work in "cooperation" with a computer or laptop, it is more convenient to choose devices with a <span>linear input.</span>  This will help not only increase the comfort of use, but also make the operating period longer without recharging. </p><h2>  Speakerphone </h2><p>  A review of portable speakers includes a description of those models that have a microphone.  In this case, you can use them in speakerphone mode.  What does this mean?  This solution allows you to pick up the phone and communicate with the interlocutor through the column.  However, this does not cause convenience.  You have to move tightly to the column so that the person hears what the owner of the equipment says. </p><p>  More expensive models got good microphones and noise reduction systems, so thanks to them it will be much more comfortable to communicate. </p><h2>  Beats pill 2.0 </h2><p>  A review of portable speakers should start with one of the best.  It's about Beats Pill 2.0.  Unfortunately, no matter how popular this company is, consumers do not like products from other segments.  Most believe that they have gained widespread popularity through fairly stubborn marketing.  However, this cannot be said about the columns.  They really work at an excellent level, forcing consumers to write positive reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The new 2.0 is practically no different from the well-known version of Pill.  It looks relevant, attracting a large percentage of consumers, can charge a smartphone, if necessary.  It weighs only 310 grams, so it is easy to transport.  It has several broadband speakers - sound at the highest level. </p><h2>  Sony SRS XB3 </h2><p>  It is necessary to note, considering portable speakers, Sony SRS XB3.  A review of this device shows that it meets modern requirements and fully justifies its cost (about 12 thousand rubles).  The sound is interesting, especially if you include electronic music.  <span>The appearance is</span> impressive, it is boring and non-conservative, which is inherent in many well-known column models. </p><p>  Why is it necessary to pay attention to this particular model?  It is famous for its long battery life.  If the consumer listens mainly to calm genres and styles in music, then the sound of the speaker will undoubtedly please him.  Over time, the price of the device will decrease, and it will receive high reviews from consumers.  In the meantime, they are confused by the cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="portable speaker review" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1594394.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Harman / Kardon Esquire </h2><p>  Products from the manufacturer Harman / Kardon have long been tagging premium products.  In fact, recently in the design details of product design from other companies are being seen.  However, it should be noted that the combination of all the elements is really impressive.  The assembly and materials used are commendable because they are top notch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The model received a pleasant and advanced sound effect.  It is detailed, complete, and low frequencies are heard perfectly.  On battery, the model is able to work for about 10 hours.  Thanks to the presence of a microphone, it can be used as a speakerphone.  When choosing this model, it is worth paying attention that in its dimensions it is more of a desktop speaker, rather than a portable one.  It weighs about 1 kg, which not everyone will like.  By modern standards, portable devices, this figure is too high. </p><h2>  Interstep SBS 100 </h2><p>  The portable speaker Interstep SBS 100, the review of which shows its undeniable advantage, is suitable for those consumers who are responsible for the quality of the received sound.  The main competitors of this device are some devices from JBL.  Their price category is almost the same, but the characteristics are slightly different.  In both, the upper frequencies are felt with a bang.  But consumers still call the practical model SBS 100. The materials are pleasant to the touch, the case is comfortable.  It is undesirable to drop the device, but light mechanical damage is fearless.  The buttons are excellent, it‚Äôs a pleasure to click on them, a distinctive click is heard with the tap.  In general, the Interstep SBS 100 portable speaker gets good reviews. </p><p>  The model review should contain information on what attracts an additional percentage of consumers.  The main feature of this device is the ability to use a flash card.  Accordingly, the column in this case acts as a player. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="portable speaker interstep sbs 100 review" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1594406.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> Bluetooth Speaker and Xiaomi Square Box </h2><p>  Next, we review Xiaomi portable speakers.  It should be noted that the company perfectly understands what consumers need.  Therefore, all products, including the proposed speakers, well combine quality and value.

    <p>  Among the shortcomings, consumers note the absence of at least a small display.  He would help to figure out which composition plays or what the technique is connected to. </p><p>  The music plays pretty well, which many did not expect.  Sometimes there are problems with the sound of high frequencies, because of which you have to reduce the volume. </p><p>  Often, this system is not used as portable.  Her weight is 5 kg.  The dynamics fully work out their cost, which is confirmed by each buyer.  With a special desire, you can only find fault with a bit confusing management, but the model is budgetary, therefore this nuance is insignificant. </p>
