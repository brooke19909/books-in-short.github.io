History of Prussia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Prussia is one of the most historically controversial states of continental Europe.  On the one hand, we have a once powerful state, under the flag of which all Germany was united.  On the other hand, the kingdom had not only ups, but also downs.  The country was disbanded after the fall of the Third Reich, and previously suffered under the yoke of the Teutons.  What legacy did the history of Prussia leave us? </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  Unlike most countries of the Old World, Prussia on the map <strong> </strong>  sought by purely political grounds.  The language attribute, so widespread for the definition of other states, works very poorly here, as in general in countries of German culture. </p><p>  Important for Prussia was the <span>Baltic Sea,</span> located in the north of the country.  It was there that the first settlements appeared.  Throughout history, the borders of Prussia have repeatedly changed - from a (relatively) small duchy to the main part of the Second Reich of Bismarck. </p><p>  Huge influence was exerted on Prussia by neighboring countries - Lithuania (Lithuanians are more blood brothers to Prussians than Germans) and Poland.  The second built many intrigues to its northwestern neighbor during its independence.  Poland repeatedly subjugated its territory. </p><p>  Finding the main lands of this deceased state, Prussia, is now easy.  They belong to the Russian Federation and are the Kaliningrad region.  Its center is old Koenigsberg, <strong> </strong>  since 1946, known as Kaliningrad. </p><h2>  Ancient times </h2><p>  A huge role in the emergence of Prussia, as in all European history, was played by the leader of the Huns Attila.  It was the appearance of his empire that made the Estians living on the shores of the Baltic Sea rise.  Ancient authors wrote about them.  Estia left free territory for the Prussians, who until then were located only within the framework of modern Kaliningrad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prussia is" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635729.jpg" width="500"></div>

Their existence remains in question, however, it is the presence of such rulers who created a strong society from the tribe with developed social relations and built a <span>vertical of power, which</span> explains the sharp jump in the development of the Prussians.  As a result, in the cultural tradition, they turned out to be brothers to the Germans, and not to the closest peoples - Poles and Lithuanians. </p><h2>  Christianization </h2><p>  Since the 11th century, the small Polish principality has been trying to expand its lands at the expense of pagan Prussians.  However, they were extremely successful defenders.  Perhaps the territory of Prussia would have remained free from the games of feudal Europe, if under the pretext of Christianization (at the invitation of the Polish prince and the personal blessing of the Pope) the legendary Teutonic Order would not have invaded it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prussia Kingdom" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635774.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The Order of Lithuania received its own state, in which it was fully authorized to carry out the Christianization of the pagan population, which turned out to be robbery, torture and violence for the Prussians. </p><h2>  Territory expansion </h2><p>  Thanks to the active build-up of power directly by the Teutons themselves and the absorption of other <span>knightly orders,</span> Prussia itself expanded on the map.  At some point, most of the Baltic belonged to the state of the Teutonic Order. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Inside, this country was a tough Catholic state with, to put it mildly, a huge bias in church authority.  In fact, the Teutonic Order was subordinate (through the master) to the Pope, so the state was under the full control of the Vatican. </p><h2>  Kingdom Creation </h2><p>  Until the sixteenth century, the state of the Teutonic Order lasted.  It waged many wars - sometimes successful, expanding their state, but the closer to the modern timeline, the more often the Teutons were inferior to the battlefield. </p><p>  Especially severe was their defeat in the Thirteen Years War against Poland.  This was the final blow to the Teutonic Order - the desire to maintain power and get away from the anger of the Pope.  Master Albrecht of Brandenburg accepted Protestantism, thanks to which Prussia became a secular state.  He also became a vassal of the Polish king.  The former master has done many useful things for the state.  For example, he carried out social reform and opened the first university.  In addition, thanks to him, Prussia is the first state in history with an officially dominant Protestant faith. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prussia on the map" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635735.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The Duchy of Prussia did not last long - the son of Albrecht was sick and after the death of his father could not take the throne, and then unexpectedly died.  The next heir to the duchy was the <span>Polish king.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Kingdom of Prussia as part of Poland </h2><p>  Having received at his disposal new lands, the ruler wondered what Prussia would become.  Kingdom <strong> </strong>  It seemed the best option, as it significantly increased the prestige of the monarch.  Now he was twice ruler. </p><p>  Like any kingdom within the kingdom, Prussia was very independent.  She had her own laws, her own court.  Even her army functioned separately from the Polish.  In addition, the territory of the state was expanding rapidly, as the king of Prussia understood that only by gathering powerful and strong support around them could they resist Poland and return to their German origins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old koenigsberg" class="if" height="214" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635785.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  However, such drastic measures were not required.  At the time of the emergence of Prussia as a German state, Poland waged war with Sweden, and it needed the help of allies.  Prince of Brandenburg, Frederick William I, agreed to lend a helping hand to his neighbors, on condition that he received Prussia - the land that he, as the largest German prince, considered to be originally German, and therefore his own. </p><p>  Thanks to this deal, the Principality of Brandenburg-Prussia was formed, which was destined to play a huge role in the political life of Europe. </p><h2>  Independent Prussian Kingdom </h2><p>  Thanks to his father‚Äôs efforts and inheritance, the son of the prince of Brandenburg, conquering more and more lands, and with them influence, was crowned.  Frederick I ascended the throne in 1701, demonstrating to the whole world that Prussia is now an independent kingdom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Prussia 1945" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635793.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <p>  The maximum historical dawn of Prussia fell on the reign of Frederick.  He is still considered one of the greatest kings of Europe, because he carried out many reforms - strengthened the economy of Prussia, thanks to which the treasury was able to finance the army with astronomical amounts.  He made profound changes in education, the state apparatus and military affairs. </p><p>  Thanks to the huge number of wars, for some reason the King of Prussia needed to intervene, his state was gaining more and more land, creating the Prussians' reputation as one of the leading nations of the Old World.  Prussia only lost once - the Russian Empire took part of the Baltic states after defeat in the battles against it during the Seven Years War.  However, even this defeat was not serious - under a peace treaty between Frederick II and Peter III, these lands returned to the Prussians very soon. </p><p>  Unfortunately, after a powerful heyday, rapid wilting followed.  The new king, Frederick II, could not maintain power over such a huge state.  His rule significantly weakened Prussia, but his son marked the final loss of Prussia's leading role in Europe. </p><p>  But it‚Äôs also impossible to blame him.  The kings of Prussia could not resist the avalanche of Napoleon‚Äôs army.  She swept away every state in her path.  After the Napoleonic era, Prussia was restored in much smaller territories, and, it seemed, it was destined to live out its century to the complete loss of statehood, if not ... </p><h2>  German Empire </h2><p>  The great Otto von Bismarck, oddly enough, was a Prussian.  With his appearance on the political scene, you can stop calling the names of the Prussian kings - now they did not play a role in comparison with the "iron chancellor". </p><p>  Bismarck was the Minister-President of Prussia and a passionate fan of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa unified German state.  At that time, it seemed impossible - German territory fit a dozen rival small states and one weakened Austria.  However, Bismarck would not be a great ruler if he did not have a clear and unshakable plan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="friedrich ii" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23212/635755.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Step by step, he increased the power of Prussia, fighting with Denmark and taking away its territory.  Bismarck needed only an excuse to attack Austria, and he turned up - a military conflict in Italy led to a seven-week war between Austria and Prussia, which ended with the unification of 21 German states and the creation of the German Empire.  King of Prussia <span>William I</span> became a Kaiser, and Bismarck became his Chancellor. </p><p>  The German Empire has become one of the main states of the world.  Not the last role in its composition was occupied by Prussia.  The kingdom sunk into oblivion, but it was the Prussians who set the cultural and political tone of the empire. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, William II was not so far-sighted politician.  He removed Bismarck from his post, and then began to pursue a domestic policy full of conservatism and an aggressive foreign policy filled with harsh statements.  Having quarreled with the Russian and British crown, he led Germany to isolation. </p><p>  These events served as the main prerequisites for the outbreak of the First World War, after which the Second Reich fell forever.  The November uprising ripped Germany apart, making Prussia one of the small independent states that had to repay the debts of their big parent. </p><p>  But as always happens in the history of Germany, when the chroniclers were ready to put an end to the history of a single state, a new personality appears on the horizon, who is destined to gather all Germans around him. </p><h2>  Third Reich </h2><p>  Prussia was one of the central regions of the <span>Third Reich</span> . </p>

    <p>  Although Hitler did not divide Germany, an exception was made for this region. </p><p>  In the state united by the Nazis, Prussia received autonomy, but had it only on paper.  In fact, the head of the autonomy was either Hitler or one of the heads of the Reichstag - depending on the specific date. </p><p>  It was in the Third Reich that Prussia finally blurred the borders of an independent state.  Now she was part of Germany, even her former capital, Berlin, had long ceased to be associated with her. </p><p>  After the defeat of Germany in World War II, part of the territory of Prussia, including the old Koenigsberg, withdrew to the USSR.  The remaining territories remained with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. </p><h2>  Prussia at the end of World War II </h2><p>  Prussia 1945 <strong> </strong>  year already did not represent absolutely nothing.  As a separate state, it did not exist even in theory, being considered a losing Germany.  So the sun went down for one of the most influential powers in Europe.  Or is there a new unexpected turn ahead of us?  After all, before the advent of Bismarck, Prussia prophesied the same thing. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Prussia is one of the most controversial pages of German history.  The state that laid the foundation for the existence of modern federal Germany, in fact, was an independent incredibly small amount of time. </p><p>  However, every time Prussia is on the map <strong> </strong>  reappeared, even within its smallest borders, it invariably proved: it is she who is the true strength of Germany, her heart and brain. </p><p>  Somehow, the story again received an ironic connotation - the Prussians, the inhabitants of the Baltic states, whom we should relate to the Lithuanians and Estonians, are Germans even more than the Germans themselves.  This is the mystery of Prussian history, but, among other things, its fascination lies in endless victories and defeats in the fight against paradoxes. </p>
