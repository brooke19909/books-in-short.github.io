It is famous for its many kilometers of beaches, picturesque nature, developed tourist infrastructure, hospitality of local residents.  All this contributes to a comfortable holiday by the sea. </p><p>  However, you should not take this hot and picturesque island exclusively as a place where you can swim in the warm Caribbean Sea and lie on a white sand.  There are two nature reserves on the island, and in its large cities there are many cultural and historical attractions. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Margarita Island, owned by the Republic of Venezuela, is two mountain ranges that are connected by a narrow sand spit, which is 18 kilometers long.  An island with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1071 km is located in the southern part of the warm Caribbean Sea.  A strait 22 km wide separates it from the mainland.  The maximum width of the island is 34.6 km, length - 69.2 kilometers. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="10.9970723" data-lng="-63.91132959999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/7/9/8/7798.png"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  Margarita island in Venezuela owes its name to the famous navigator Christopher Columbus, who discovered it in August 1498 and named it in honor of the Princess of Spain Margarita of Austria.  The Indians who inhabited this land at that time mined pearls.  This was the reason for the appearance of the second name - Pearl Island.  The natives called him Paraguachoa, which translates as "people of the sea." </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Presumably in the 1st century BC.  e.  Indians from South America populated the island.  Most of them were fishermen and boaters.  The tribes were distinguished by hospitality and friendliness, pride and strength.  They revered centuries-old traditions, defended the island from the encroachments of other, more warlike tribes. </p><p>  As soon as the first European arrived on the Margarita island in Venezuela (he became Pedro Alonso Nino), the fate of this marvelous corner of the globe was a foregone conclusion: because of the large amount of pearls, he underwent colonization.  The Spaniard Nino exchanged 38 kilograms of pearls from the Indians and at first even made friends with the tribes, but soon the Indians had to get tons of oysters, turning the island into a source of enrichment.  Interestingly, the first currency of Venezuela was just pearls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.venezuelatuya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island history" class="if uuid-2742080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2742080.jpg"></div><p>  The islanders tried to prevent the colonization of the island.  A serious struggle for independence from the Spanish crown was marked by 1810.  The first leader to lead the national struggle was <span>Simon Bolivar.</span>  In 1821, the island became part of the state of Great Colombia, and after its collapse Margarita Island became part of Venezuela.  Already in those days, the creation of the tourism industry began here.  In the early eighties of the last century, the first tourists from Europe and America began to arrive here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Island Description </h2><p>  Today a photo of Margarita Island can be seen in advertising booklets of almost all travel agencies working in this direction.
