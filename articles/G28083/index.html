    <h2>  Why is the train better? </h2><p>  Unfortunately, there is a widespread rumor that travel by rail is uninteresting and all the more uncomfortable.  Fortunately, this is not so.  The romance of railways is hard to describe in words.  This is an unforgettable mixture of emotions and vivid impressions.  Many have known her since childhood, and some people have never been able to ride trains.  The Yekaterinburg-Anapa trains have long been unlike the trains of the USSR.  They are not formed from obsolete, but from modern and comfortable cars. </p><p>  Why is this the best option?  First of all, because the passenger is resting all the way.  No need to keep track of the road or car.  Also, the trains have quite comfortable berths, which undoubtedly allows you to relax properly.  On the route you can eat at any time of the day.  To do this, you do not have to go to a restaurant.  Each wagon is equipped with a tank of boiling water.  If the passenger left all provisions at home, he can buy it from the conductor.  It is always available there.  There is always the opportunity to wash or go to the toilet, because 2 bathrooms are in each of the cars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In other words, the train is much better than other vehicles.  Not the least role in this is the cost of tickets and the choice of seats. </p><h2>  Everyone can afford </h2><p>  Trains are popular in that cars are always of a different class.  When buying a ticket at the ticket office or on the Internet, a passenger chooses a carriage and class of service.  On Yekaterinburg-Anapa trains, you can choose one of two types of reserved seats, several types of compartment, SV and luxury cars. </p>

    <p>  Reserved seats are the cheapest wagons.  The design is the same on all trains of the Russian Railways.  Sleeping places are not fenced off from the central aisle and a bit narrower than the others.  There are also side windows.  There are many places in such a car, but there is not enough space.  There are two types - those with and without air conditioning.  There are practically no wagons without air conditioning in the south.  However, even if they are, it is advisable to give preference not to the lowest possible price, but to an improved level of comfort. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The compartment cars on Yekaterinburg-Anapa trains also have two varieties.  These are deluxe locations with or without food.  Places are much larger than reserved seats.  Each compartment with berths is isolated from the central aisle and has its own door and passenger-controlled lighting.  A ticket costs a bit more. </p><p>  Places of the SV-class are considered the railway analogue of the Junior Suite.  They have much more space and half as many passengers.  In addition, it is a great opportunity to travel comfortably with children and pets. </p><h2>  Real room </h2><p>  For lovers of comfort, there are special luxury cars.  Tickets for them are the most expensive, but the trip will be the most convenient.  There are no neighbors.  You can travel alone, with company or family.  Many trains equip this class compartment with their own bathrooms with shower.  Sometimes you can even meet your personal account. </p>

    <h2>  Route </h2><p>  The route of trains Yekaterinburg - Anapa is sufficiently saturated with stops.  For 3 days of the road you can look at 43 more or less large railway stations.  Especially long train costs in <span>Samara, Penza,</span> Rostov, Ufa and Chelyabinsk.  In these cities, you can not only inspect the station well, but also take a walk around the station areas and even order pizza directly to the carriage.  However, at most stations the train will not last longer than 2 minutes. </p><h2>  Travel time and other traffic features </h2><p>  The train is not a bus, much less a car.  The movement of the Yekaterinburg-Anapa train is carried out along a not even flat section of the railway track.  The fact is that this is not a Moscow direction.  That is why noises and shaking will be felt throughout the road in the cars.  Particular discomfort will be felt by those passengers who are in the head and tail of the train.  The noise from automatic couplings in corners is especially loud.  On the way, the train will stay a little more than 3 days.  This is a little, but it is very important if the vacation is small and every day counts, because there and back is more than 6 days of travel! </p><h2>  290 E </h2><p>  Reviews about the Yekaterinburg-Anapa train (290 ) are mostly positive.  This is the top rated main train.  Almost all passengers note the cleanliness of the cars and the courtesy of the conductors.  Many liked the cleanliness of bedding and the wide range of snacks available.  Most often, air conditioners work properly, and the trip does not cause inconvenience.  Visitors to the dining car praise the dishes prepared by professional chefs. </p><p>  Opinions are a very volatile thing.  It all depends on chance and perception.  And therefore, negative reviews about the Yekaterinburg-Anapa train are also present.  Not all passengers were lucky.  Sometimes cars break down, and they are replaced by those that have recently been removed from conservation.  Most often, air conditioning does not work in them, and a trip to the 45-degree heat will not leave a pleasant impression on anyone. </p>
