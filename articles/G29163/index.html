  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Were there any psychics in the USSR?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At first glance, there was no place for magic in the Soviet Union.  The atheistic state publicly denied the existence of God, but there were rumors that the country's leaders resorted to the help of people with supernormal abilities. </p><h2>  Psychics of the USSR </h2><p>  According to secret intelligence data, the powers that be, who headed the state, had a whole staff of people whose abilities went beyond the usual framework.  Psychics of the USSR could read minds, predict the future and even move objects with the power of thought.  There was an opinion that these were sci-fi inventions or tricks of spies.  However, in the seventies, Nina Kulagina, a well-known female psychic of the USSR, demonstrated the wonders of telekinesis.  Before the eyes of the stunned KGB officers, she moved with the effort of thought small objects: needles, buttons, paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.collective-evolution.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet psychic woman" class="if uuid-3198225" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3198225.jpg"></div><p>  The information that people with incredible abilities appeared in the USSR quickly went beyond the narrow circle of people.  The fact of the existence of unusual people in our country greatly excited the world community.  The Americans were especially wary, who considered the ability of some people to influence the world around them by willpower to be almost the most effective weapon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Famous psychics of the USSR </h2><p>  Lenin, Stalin and other leaders, whose decisions directly influenced the fate of the state, resorted to the help of people with magical abilities.  The names of advisers to the heads of state were known even abroad.  They were afraid, respected, trembling before them. </p><p>  However, in addition to the opinion that people with unusual abilities influenced the fate of the USSR, there is also an opposite point of view.  According to some sources, all these unusual people were only good psychologists and were able to influence the consciousness of people who lacked a little magic.  Simply put, people simply believed in what they wanted to believe. </p><h2>  Wolf Messing </h2><p>  One of the most famous psychics of the USSR under Stalin was Wolf Messing, a talented hypnotist and telepathist.  They say that Adolf Hitler himself was afraid of him. </p><p>  Young Messing gained popularity by performing in the west with an unusual show.  He entered a special state when his biorhythms slowed down and indicated that he was dead.  A little later, the psychic discovered the ability to predict and read thoughts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="masivaturk.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Psychic of the USSR" class="if uuid-3199440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3199440.jpg"></div><p>  Hitler considered Messing to be his enemy, since he predicted the collapse of his military company.  A careless statement about the impending failure of the F√ºhrer almost cost the clairvoyant life: he was sentenced to death.  In this regard, Messing had to flee to the USSR.  Only superpowers helped a wounded man who did not know the language get to the Soviet border.  Messing crossed the language barrier in a very peculiar way: he read minds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to one legend, soon after the escape Joseph Stalin found out about the amazing man and soon Messing became the chief adviser to the leader. </p><p>  Other sources of information say that the name of Messing, on the contrary, was not even mentioned in the Kremlin documents next to the name of Stalin.  The only thing that to this day does not raise any doubts is his unprecedented acting talent, the ability to grasp the slightest facial expressions and the movement of human muscles.  It is believed that it was these talents that led him to success and created the image of a powerful psychic and hypnotist. </p><h2>  Juna Davitashvili </h2><p>  This amazing woman is a healer, psychic, poetess, actress, founder of the International Academy of Alternative Sciences.  Juna was a famous psychic of the USSR, revolved in a creative environment, was very popular among creative personalities not only of the Soviet Union, but also of Europe and America. </p><p>  According to some reports, the clairvoyant Juna predicted the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the collapse of the USSR. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rferl.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Psychic of the USSR under Stalin" class="if uuid-3198286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3198286.jpg"></div><p>  The gift of healing was Juna's hallmark.  She was credited with extending the life of Brezhnev himself.  Her patients also included Marcello Mastroiani, Joseph Kobzon, Andrei Tarkovsky, Arkady Raikin and even the pope himself. </p><p>  However, when asked about healing abilities, Juna always answered that she should not return to the Stone Age.  She herself explained the success of her medical manipulations using various devices emitting electric fields, infrared and high-frequency waves.  The healer was engaged in the invention of these devices in her mansion, where patients were also admitted. </p><h2>  Anatoly Kashpirovsky </h2><p>  This is another famous psychic of the USSR, a psychiatrist by education, one of the adherents of healing through television.  Kashpirovsky influenced the viewer using hypnosis, which consisted in connecting the timbre of the voice and certain gestures.  An insightful look is still the hallmark of this man.  Eyewitnesses claimed that he literally heated the atmosphere on both sides of the screen. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rferl.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The famous psychic of the USSR" class="if uuid-3198308" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3198308.jpg"></div><p>  Despite the fact that people sacredly believed in the effectiveness of the Kashpirovsky method, there is evidence of very deplorable consequences of such an impact.  Believing in the effectiveness of treatment at a distance, patients stopped taking drugs, which sometimes led to death. </p><h2>  Alan Chumak </h2><p>  Another television healer among the psychics of the USSR.  At the end of the 80s of the last century, he was committed to bringing healing to people, ‚Äúcharging‚Äù water, salt, and photographs.  Like Kashpirovsky, he worked through television.  According to the psychic himself, at the moment when the television sessions were held, he, with the help of willpower, carrying out manipulations with his hands, charged pre-prepared water, oils, etc., giving them healing properties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.calvertjournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Psychic of the USSR under Stalin" class="if uuid-3199259" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64872/3199259.jpg"></div><p>  Today there is an opinion that the positive results of his treatment were nothing more than a placebo effect. </p><h2>  Yuri Longo </h2><p>  This man is perhaps one of the most interesting psychics of the USSR.  He called himself ‚Äúthe master of white magic‚Äù, claimed that he could do love spells, as well as raise the dead. </p><p>  For example, he claimed that he had resurrected Viktor Yushchenko, who, he said, had died in 2004. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Over the years, soberly assessing each of these personalities and their activities, we can conclude that information about the army of psychics in the USSR is nothing more than a myth.  Undoubtedly, the people mentioned above had extraordinary abilities.  Among them were talented actors, good psychologists and inventors.  However, the question of whether they have exactly extrasensory abilities to this day remains open. </p>
