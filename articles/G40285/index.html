    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the location of the recreation center is Serpukhov district, the Drakino park has become an ideal place for vacations.  The climate is temperate continental, which indicates comfortable temperatures throughout all seasons.  Warm, non-hot summers and ordinary cold winters make vacations especially attractive: tourists will not have to suffer from sudden changes in temperature, as well as bad weather conditions. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the Serpukhov district cannot boast of a very clean environment.  Of course, compared to large cities, the air here is much cleaner and ideal for restoring health.  However, in Serpukhov built about 10 chemical factories operating in an active mode. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Unlike the city center, in the vicinity of this factor is not felt much.  It is known that the only nature reserve in the Moscow region was built in the region. </p><p>  Calculating the weather, you should focus on the Moscow forecast - changes in the suburbs will be minimal. </p>

Quick access to you should be a phone, documents, money and tickets. </li><li>  Check the weather for the near future and choose the most comfortable clothes.  Do not forget that you have to spend a lot of time in the fresh air - clothes should be as comfortable as possible. </li><li>  Prepare a rest program in advance.  Despite the fact that various events are held in the park every day, you still have the opportunity to visit the nearby city and get acquainted with its attractions.  Examine the information about them, make a list of interesting places and follow it. </li><li>  Calculate your budget carefully.  You should not spend all the money in the early days: you should be familiar with the local shops and the goods presented in them.  By visiting several of them and comparing prices, you will choose the most appropriate purchase option.  You can also take advantage of the many services provided in the park. </li><li>  Book rooms.  Even if there are still free rooms at the time of departure, it is worth warning and booking a room in advance.  And in the case of early booking you can provide a discount.  This is especially true closer to various holidays and major events. </li></ul>
