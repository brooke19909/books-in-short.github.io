    <p>  Many are impressed by the large hotel area with cozy corners of greenery, neat paths, fountains and other places for relaxation.  Basically, the hotel is considered for families with children, has a quiet and relaxing pastime. </p><p>  Animation makes an ambiguous impression, but, perhaps, this is a purely individual matter.  Someone needs constant attention and emotion fireworks, while others need calmness and solitude. </p><h2>  Room &amp; Service </h2><p>  Hotel guests do not place a particular emphasis on rooms, and perhaps this is right, because Egypt travels mainly for beach vacations, interesting excursions, and fascinating shopping in the spirit of oriental bazaars.  In the rooms, the stay is minimal.  In general, guests of the Grand Plaza Hotel 4 * (Hurghada) give positive reviews.  The rooms are cleaned and towels are changed daily and at the proper level. </p><h2>  Restaurants and Food </h2><p>  Several restaurants and bars in the hotel, according to most visitors, offer decent and delicious food, both national and European.  The most picky note a noticeable uniformity in the menu, in contrast to others, others claim the presence of a large number of fruits and oriental sweets and pastries.  Hurghada guests appreciate the local drinks offered, including wine. </p>
