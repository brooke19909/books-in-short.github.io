    <p>  The appearance of the company's smartphones will not be able to particularly surprise.  Due to the imitation of leaders, the design is somewhat boring.  The Fly IQ 4404 phone was no exception. The front end imitates Samsung, while the rear looks very similar to HTC. </p><p>  Fly 4404 is made of plastic, and not of the worst quality.  The assembly will also please the user, there are no gaps in the device.  There may be a slight creak when squeezing the device, but this is not critical. </p><p>  Variations in the color of the case are very scarce.  Owners are offered only a white and black device. </p><p>  The front panel sheltered the display, sensors, speaker, touch buttons and a camera.  The back is also the expected picture in the form of a speaker, a main camera, a company logo and, of course, a flash. </p><p>  The power button is located on the right side, and the volume control is on the left.  The bottom end got a USB-connector and a microphone.  Above, respectively, a headphone jack. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design does not shine with special originality, but it cannot be called too boring.  Appearance is quite acceptable for a cheap device.  The smartphone also weighs not very much, only 132 grams. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The Fly 4404 got a quite suitable 4.5-inch screen.  Improves the impression of the display and the applied IPS-matrix, significantly increasing viewing angles.  However, the pixel resolution failed: only 854 by 480. Of course, such characteristics are used in almost all state employees, but I wanted the best. </p><p>  The brightness in the sun dims a little, although in general the screen behavior of the device is excellent.  Only emerging pixels are confused, but this is logical at 218 ppi. </p><p>  For an inexpensive device, the display turned out great.  The user should not have any special complaints about the image. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  Removes Fly 4404 rather mediocre.  The reason for this lies in the installed camera with 5 megapixels.  Although the device has functions that enhance the photo, such as autofocus and detailed settings, this does not save the situation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The resolution of 2560 by 1920 slightly improves the quality of images. The device lacks sharpness a bit to reach the cameras of modern state employees. </p><p>  The front camera has the most common eye 0.3 MP.  Such a camera is only suitable for video communication, but it‚Äôs absolutely not suitable for more. </p><p>  In general, for the mobile phone of past years, the Fly 4404 has quite acceptable camera characteristics. </p><h2>  Filling </h2><p>  The <span>Fly IQ</span> 4404 uses the MTK processor, the Chinese favorite.  Actually, due to the use of this particular part of the device, it turns out so cheap.  The good news is that the processor has two cores.  Each of them operates at a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  Such characteristics allow you to use the device as efficiently as possible. </p><p>  But the RAM in Fly IQ 4404 has not so bright indicators.  They equipped the smartphone with 512 megabytes.  This is considered the minimum indicator for devices on Android. </p><p>  Lame in Fly 4404 and internal memory.  It is only 4 GB, and only 2.5 is available for use.  The rest of the memory is occupied by the system.  The only way out is to increase due to the flash drive.  You can put a card up to 32 GB in your smartphone. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The device operates under the guidance of "Android" 4.2.  The system allows you to install all the necessary applications and even not very demanding games on your phone. </p><p>  Problems in the operation of the device should not arise due to the filling, providing good performance.  In addition, updating the system to a newer version is not difficult. </p><p>  Be sure to note the efforts of the company to install many useful applications.  With the filing of the company, most of the necessary applications are already on the phone. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The device is available all the necessary standards for GSM-communication and even 3G.  In addition, the device works with two SIM cards. </p><p>  Unfortunately, there is only one radio module in the device, and the simultaneous use of two cards is impossible.  When you call the second SIM card will automatically turn off. </p><p>  Naturally, the <span>Fly IQ 4404 Spark</span> phone has features such as bluetooth, mobile Internet and Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  Battery </h2>

    <p>  Equipped a smartphone with a battery capacity of 1750 maH.  After evaluating the performance and functionality of the device, we can conclude that this is not enough.  The 7 hours of active work indicated by the company actually come down <span>to 3-4.</span>  The duration depends on the functions used. </p><p>  Disabling applications and Internet connections will help reduce battery consumption. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The smartphone turned out to be quite cheap for a device with such good characteristics.  You can buy Fly IQ 4404 Spark for about 4 thousand rubles.  Most likely, the price will be even lower, because the device has already been discontinued. </p><p>  In comparison with the more popular brands, the Fly 4404, considering the filling and cost, looks very tempting. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2>

    <p>  In addition to the phone, the kit includes a <span>USB cable, headphones, an</span> adapter, as well as instructions. </p><p>  Given that the device is made of plastic, buying a case looks quite justified.  In addition to this, the device will need a flash drive and, possibly, a new battery. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2><p>  Very pleased with the hardware of the smartphone.  The device provides excellent performance and will be able to perform a lot of tasks.  Fails only a minimum of RAM. </p><p>  A fairly recent version of the system should also be noted.  The capabilities of "Android" 4.2 are quite extensive.  Without any problems, you can install all the necessary programs or games. </p><p>  Present in Fly 4404 screen specifications will not only allow you to work with convenience, but also provide entertainment.  Of course, you can forget about HD playback, but medium quality videos and a variety of games will look great. </p><p>  Another trump card of the device is its price.  In fact, Fly 4404 can be considered one of the cheapest state employees.  Of course, among the little-known Chinese devices, there may be lower ones in price, but they will definitely be inferior in terms of characteristics. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The minus of the device is the copied appearance.  It is not necessary to expect special uniqueness from the state employee, but great similarity with eminent brands is also not to face. </p><p>  Mention of the device‚Äôs camera will also not cause delight.  Most likely, its use will be reduced to rare pictures and nothing more.  In general, there is a camera in the device, and all the advantages end there. </p><p>  Another weak point of the Fly 4404 is its battery.  Even for an inexpensive device, the battery capacity is very small.  The owner will immediately have to think about replacing it if there is no desire to be tied to an outlet. </p><p>  The phone‚Äôs memory does not cause delight either.  Available to the user 2.5 GB is poor.  Actually, the owner will be forced to purchase a flash card. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The owners did not have the best impressions of using the device.  After a few months, many users were forced to repair the phone.  Problems arose mostly with the display and system operation.  After prolonged use, the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù in the device starts to ‚Äúslow down‚Äù. </p><p>  Of course, users do not deny the advantages in the form of functionality, as well as low prices.  Basically, these advantages are decisive when choosing a device. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  According to the specifications, the Fly 4404 shows itself very well.  But judging by the problems arising from the owners, one should not expect much from the device.  You should immediately set yourself up for a fairly short smartphone life. </p>
