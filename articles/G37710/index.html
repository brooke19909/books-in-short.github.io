Few people dare to deny the fact that nature generously endowed these places.  And even with the most superficial acquaintance with the South Urals, it becomes obvious that there is absolutely no need to spend big money and fly by plane to the other end of the world.  You can have a good rest in the Chelyabinsk region.  There still remained clean reservoirs surrounded by relict coniferous vegetation.  Of course, in the Urals there are a lot of environmental problems and they should not be forgotten, but there are still not so few places that have not been touched upon by these problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sandy lake" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/241036.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Peschanoe Lake, Chelyabinsk Region</strong> </p><p>  This is one of the protected areas of the Southern Urals, since 1991 it has the official status of <span>a nature monument of</span> regional significance.  At some distance from it passes the federal highway M5, which ensures the connection of this place with other regions.  <span>Catering establishments</span> located along this route <span>,</span> small shops and gas stations will remain the closest objects of civilization during their stay in the reserve.  To get here is not so difficult, the lake is located a hundred kilometers northeast of Chelyabinsk.  Such a distance from the largest industrial center of the region ensures the environmental cleanliness of both the reservoir itself and the surrounding area.  If you want to take a break from the rhythms of the modern city and immerse yourself in silence and solitude for a week or two, then Peschanoe Lake is exactly what you were looking for. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center sandy lake" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/241039.jpg" width="504"></div>  In terms of size, this is not such a large body of water, not more than one and a half kilometers in diameter, and its depth rarely exceeds a three-meter mark.  For better or worse, the question remains controversial, but there is no equipped recreation center in this place.  Sandy Lake implies life in a tent on its shore.  But this <span>type of recreation</span> has many fans, if we break away from the benefits of civilization, then we must be consistent.  But, living in a tent on the shore, you should follow the <span>rules of conduct in the forest.</span>  You should not leave any traces of your stay here.  Sandy Lake should remain as clean, it is still a natural monument of regional importance.

    <p>  <strong>Fishing</strong> </p><p>  Despite some household discomfort, Peschanoe Lake is able to provide good fishing for those who come to its coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sand lake Chelyabinsk region" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/241035.jpg" width="500"></div>  The shores of the lake make it difficult to access open water and are heavily overgrown with reeds, so for successful fishing it is best to have some kind of floating tool.  Those who have traveled here fishing several times prefer to use an inflatable boat.  This craft is easily transported and can easily be placed in the trunk of any car.  When moving through a body of water, it should be borne in mind that there is a large amount of fuel at the bottom of the lake, maneuvering with caution, especially off the coast.  Pike and perch are best caught here.  Experienced fishermen respond very well about winter fishing in this reservoir, but getting here in winter is not always easy.
