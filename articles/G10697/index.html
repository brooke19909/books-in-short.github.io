  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gameplay Fallout 3: passing a mediocre shooter or life in the aftermath of a nuclear war?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  What they promised us </p><p>  The player will explore the vast world, or rather, what remains of it after a <span>nuclear war.</span>  Civilizations, in the usual sense of the word, are no more, the remains of the surviving population are divided into fractions, and someone is trying to find a place in the sun alone.  This project is a role-playing game where the decisions made by the player influence the plot and have certain consequences.  The outcome of the game largely depends on the decisions of the player, in addition to the main storyline of Fallout 3, the passage of which takes only ten hours, the protagonist expects an incredible amount of additional quests. </p><p>  In Fallout 3, completing quests that are not related to the main plot is not necessary to complete the game, but these missions provide additional experience, skills, equipment and weapons, without which survival in a world that has survived a nuclear war is simply impossible.  The player will have to shoot a lot, perhaps too much - after a couple of hours of gameplay, the role-playing game begins to seem like an ordinary shooter.  Gameplay Fallout 3, the full passage of which takes an average of about 100 hours (including secondary quests), 70-80% consists of shooting.  Sad but true. </p><p>  The player can join various factions or explore the world alone, the main goal of the main character is to find a father who left refuge 101, in which he lived with his son and other survivors.  The father of the protagonist left, leaving his son no instructions regarding his purpose, and he leaves refuge 101 to find him.  Theoretically, Fallout 3 is a very original project with a twisted non-linear plot, surprising the player with unexpected twists, but practically the game turned out to be a very mediocre craft. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What we got </p><p>  Instead of the original role-playing game, the gamers were presented with a very mediocre shooter.  In theory, you can go through this game without a single shot, but in practice, alas, everything is joyless: the stealth mode does not work correctly, in addition, the peace-loving character has a very limited choice of possible actions.  The game pushes the hero to pick up a weapon and shoot.  In Fallout 3, the passage of the main storyline is more like an hours-long walk through a radioactive garbage bin with a gun at the ready than the life of people after the end of the world. </p><p>  Secondary missions are very diverse, but the reward for them is of practically no value - the player, most likely, will not even pay for the spent ammo.  The only advantage of secondary quests is experience that allows you to improve existing skills and gain new abilities.  It is worth noting that half of the abilities are simply useless, since the gameplay was clearly not fully developed. </p><p>  The choice of small arms in the game is really huge, but the melee arsenal is rather meager.  Locations are very monotonous, before evaluating the work of game designers, it is worth asking a question: did they work on it?  Of course, they worked, but looking at the gloomy and monotonous world, you won‚Äôt immediately say that.  However, the game really surprises with something - the system of turn-based shootings due to the automatic guidance system.  Skirmishes in this mode look very good. </p><p>  A huge selection of armor and equipment - the lyrics and nothing more, but a lot of protective equipment, but there is almost no sense from them.  Among dozens of protective suits there are 5-7 really worthwhile items.  As the developers promised, the player will be able to get a dog to accompany him on the way, they also kept their promise regarding the system for manufacturing weapons and various items that the main character, with certain abilities, can collect from garbage.  Unfortunately, we can talk about the shortcomings of this game for a very long time, unlike the advantages.  If you expect Fallout 3 to go the way it was in the 2nd or 1st part, then you will be very disappointed - instead of evolving, one of the best episodes has degraded to the level of a middle-person shooter. </p>
