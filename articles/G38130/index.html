Some have already fulfilled their cherished dream, while others are only planning a trip to the Eternal City.  What explains the popularity of the Italian capital?  Why do thousands of people come here every year? </p><p>  Rome is an amazing treasury of unique historical, architectural and cultural monuments that many want to see with their own eyes.  If you have already been to the capital of Italy more than once, and it seems to you that you know well the interesting and memorable places of this city (although, in our opinion, this will take a whole life), we suggest you poison yourself in the vicinity of Rome.  What to see in the nearest suburbs of the capital?  We assure you that the areas surrounding a noisy and modern city will seem very interesting to you, and the sights of the suburbs are not inferior to the capital's - picturesque mountains and lakes, ancient castles and villas, streets of ancient cities - all this is located at a distance of no more than 60 km from the capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandinspiration.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Italy: surroundings of Rome" class="if uuid-2542300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542300.jpg"></div><h2>  Cerveteri </h2><p>  We will begin our acquaintance with the environs of Rome with a settlement located northwest of the capital, Cerveteri.  This is a town with a rich history, where in ancient times the settlement of the Etruscans was located.  Cerveteri is surrounded by a complex of ancient cemeteries (necropolises), in which representatives of one of the most progressive civilizations in those distant times found the last refuge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Etruscans were convinced that a person who had gone into the underworld should have a dwelling, so they built large houses for the deceased with the necessary utensils, a little out of the way of the living.  And so the necropolises appeared.  Having been in one of them, you feel a special connection between the past and the present. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The surroundings of Rome: what to see" class="if uuid-2542305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542305.jpg"></div><h2>  Tivoli </h2><p>  The most famous and frequently visited city in the vicinity of Rome is Tivoli, known from ancient times.  It welcomes tourists with magnificent nature and ancient architecture.  The town is famous for its three villas: Adriana, Gregoriana and d'Este. </p><p>  We advise tourists to visit the once luxurious estate of Emperor Hadrian.  Unfortunately, only picturesque ruins have survived to this day. </p><p>  Villa d'Este is located in the heart of the city.  This is a magnificent park with fountains and graceful sculptures.  Experts are sure that this particular villa became the prototype of Peterhof and Versailles.  If you are a fan of the beauty of the gardens, we recommend that you visit Villa d'Este.  It is located opposite the Villa Adriana.  This is a magnificent estate, but tourists come here most often in order to see the gardens.  What is remarkable about them?  This is a collection of unique and unusual plants, as well as picturesque landscapes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.joyofrome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Villa d‚ÄôEste" class="if uuid-2542313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542313.jpg"></div><p>  Take a walk through the winding labyrinths - at every step there is a surprise in the form of an elegant statue or a musical fountain.  In addition, the garden has amazingly beautiful waterfalls.  And when you get a little tired of the walk, you can relax and have a cup of coffee in small cozy restaurants or buy souvenirs in boutiques located along the narrow streets of the villa. </p><p>  The third villa is Gregoriana.  This is a huge park where you can see gloomy caves, impressive waterfalls, ancient temples and huge grottoes.  This place is a must see. </p><h2>  Ostia </h2><p>  The next place in the vicinity of Rome that deserves your attention is the ancient port city, which reached its peak during the imperial period.  It was at this time that he became a major trading and business center.  Nowadays, its population has declined several times, but many attractions remain. </p><p>  First of all, it is an archaeological complex in which the atmosphere of the ancient Roman city is felt: narrow streets, luxuriously decorated baths, a tavern, a theater, houses of ordinary citizens and nobles, temples ... In addition, here you can relax on a great beach. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Assisi </h2><p>  Sights in the vicinity of Rome you can see in the Italian region of Umbria, located two hours from the capital.  Here is the medieval city of Assisi.  Many monuments related to religion have been preserved in it. </p><p>  But the main attraction of the city is the Basilica of St. Francis, which has become the place of eternal repose of the patron saint of the country.  The paved roads of the city will lead you to a magnificent cathedral, where you can enjoy the exquisite architecture of the temple and its interior.  Inside, the ceilings and walls are decorated with unique frescoes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lavacanza.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Basilica of St. Francis" class="if uuid-2542334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542334.jpg"></div><p>  Near the Basilica are medieval houses and even small shops, which are also worth a look.  Do not forget to visit the city center, where there is an old clock tower, St. Claire‚Äôs Basilica, and the church of Santa Maria Sopra-Minevari. </p><h2>  Albanian hills </h2><p>  If you are still interested in what to see in the vicinity of Rome, we advise you to visit the ‚ÄúRoman Castles‚Äù (Albanian Hills).  This is a stunningly beautiful area that combines several small towns and a nature park.  Once upon a time, the ancient Roman nobility loved to visit this place.  And today, most Romans find him attractive. </p><p>  The amazing beauty of lakes of volcanic origin, stunning landscapes, aromas of famous Italian wines and national cuisine - this is a true paradise for gourmets and lovers of outdoor recreation.  Everything is saturated with calm and pacification. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="roman castles" class="if uuid-2542759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2542759.jpg"></div><h2>  Capri Island </h2><p>  Do not forget about the natural attractions of Italy in the vicinity of Rome.  Therefore, we recommend that you go to the fabulous island of Capri.  You can get here by boat from Naples, while enjoying the amazing scenery. </p><p>  There are many interesting sights on the island, but if your time is limited and you cannot explore them all, be sure to visit Blue Grotto.  This is an amazing cave, which spreads a reflection of the emerald and blue colors of water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.capri.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Capri Island" class="if uuid-2542355" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542355.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced travelers recommend visiting the highest point of the island - Mount Solaro.  You can climb to its top on a lift.  A stunning view of the sea and the island opens from above.  Here, tourists usually take great photos. </p><h2>  Pompeii </h2><p>  The Italians will call your trip to the capital in vain if you do not visit the famous city of Pompeii, located in the vicinity of Rome.  The journey here takes no more than two hours.  You will have a unique opportunity to wander the streets of the ruined ancient Roman metropolis and see buildings, public places that were buried almost two thousand years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pompeii Street" class="if uuid-2542343" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542343.jpg"></div><p>  The National Museum of the city presents an exposition of unique historical artifacts, as well as works of art discovered during excavations of Pompeii. </p><h2>  Lake Martignano </h2><p>  Our overview of attractions would not be complete if we did not mention the lakes.  There are several of them in the vicinity of Rome, and each is unique in its own way.  And what landscapes are here!  For example, Martignano is a lake of volcanic origin, located just north of the city.  After a short descent from the track, you will find yourself on the shore, which is decorated with an English lawn, and you will see a reservoir of extraordinary beauty.  The Romans and guests of the city spend their days off here with pleasure - in the lake you can swim, sunbathe on the beach.  In addition, here you can listen to the performance of local musicians. </p><h2>  Albano </h2><p>  Lake Albano in the vicinity of Rome is a favorite vacation spot for citizens.  It is located very close to the capital and attracts vacationers with magnificent landscapes.  A lake formed in the crater of an extinct volcano.  Its area is six kilometers, the depth is about 170 meters.  It is interesting that the water level in it is regulated by a sewage antique tunnel, which was laid in 398 BC.  Lake Albano and Lake Nemi adjacent to it are separated by Mount Monte Cavo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.uniquetoursfactory.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake albano" class="if uuid-2542362" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542362.jpg"></div><h2>  Bracciano: castle of Orsini-Odescalchi </h2><p>  Where to go in the vicinity of Rome lovers of antiquities and ancient castles?  Bracciano is a lake located in the town of the same name.  It is a drinking tank of the Italian capital.  It is one of the cleanest and second largest lake in the province of Lazio. </p><p>  On the coast of Bracciano rises the ancient castle of Orsini-Odescalchi (XIII century).  Today it belongs to the descendants of the aristocratic family name Odescalca.  Before the castle belonged to another famous family name - Orsini.  One of the representatives of the family earned a very dubious reputation: according to rumors, Paolo Orsini settled the souls of his wives in the galleries of the family castle. </p><p>  The castle itself and its interior are perfectly preserved: huge fireplaces, carved and wrought-iron beds with canopies, Renaissance furniture, portraits of beautiful ladies and a huge number of old frescoes.  Ten years ago, the castle held a wedding ceremony for Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise.  Such a number of Hollywood stars in a small town at the same time have never been seen before.  Today, within the walls of the castle there is a museum in which there are several halls: armory, Etruscans, sciences, Caesars, etc. The castle tower offers stunning views of the mountains, lake and valleys. </p><div class="photo" data-original="civitavecchia.portmobility.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Orsini Odescalchi Castle" class="if uuid-2542375" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542375.jpg"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  It is unlikely that anyone is planning a trip to Italy just for sightseeing in the vicinity of Rome.

All of them are awarded the Blue Flag, but at the same time there is not such a crowd of tourists on them, as on other beaches of Italy.  The most popular of them are La Buffala Beach, Lido Azzuro Sabaudia, Duna 31.5. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wheretogoin.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of Sabaudia" class="if uuid-2542385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11458/2542385.jpg"></div><p>  Interestingly, Sabaudia is a city that was built in 200 days on the orders of Mussolini as an elite resort.
