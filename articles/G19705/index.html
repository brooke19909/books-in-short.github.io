Then you have polymer clay.  Crafts from it turn out magnificent and what is most important for many - utilitarian.  You can independently make brooches, earrings and even decorate dishes.  Look for interesting ideas and step-by-step workshops below. </p><h2>  Spoon decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spoon decor" class="if uuid-2426254" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426254.jpg"></div><p>  Beautiful dishes raise your appetite.  The same goes for cutlery.  But it is not necessary to buy expensive dishes in the store.  You can make it yourself.  Crafts made of polymer clay can be quite utilitarian.  You can decorate the spoons already in your house.  What is needed for this?  Cutlery, alcohol, polymer clay and stacks. </p><p>  Let's get to work.  First of all, you need to degrease the tip of the spoon, which will be decorated.  Now we take a piece of polymer clay, any attracted color, and well knead it in the hands.  We make a tourniquet.  We wind the resulting sausage on the tip of the spoon, thereby repeating its shape.  The base is ready, now you can make decorative elements. </p><p>  How to mold a ladybug?  Take a small piece of red plastic and mash it.  Give the material a ball shape.  Now flatten the workpiece a little and make an incision in the middle.  Set the body of a ladybug on a tourniquet.  Additionally, you do not need to fasten the parts.  A good press will be enough.  Now take the black plastic and make small dots on the body.  Roll a ball from the material and make a head.  It remains to make a ladybug face.  It will be created from white, black and red circles.  Roll them up, and then alternately create your eyes and nose. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dog </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.taringa.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dog figure" class="if uuid-2426255" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426255.jpg"></div><p>  A cute Yorkshire terrier can be created from polymer clay.  Craft of such a plan can become a decorative figurine or a voluminous pendant.  You can make a cute dog figurine both for yourself and as a gift to friends.  The picture above shows a polymer clay craft with step-by-step instructions.  Let's create the Yorkshire Terrier in this master class. </p><p>  For the manufacture of figures you will need black and ocher plastic.  We take the beige material and knead it in our hands to the state of plasticine.  We begin to sculpt.  We roll the ball, and then use the stacks to create a depression in the depression.  Immerse the black ball into the second recess.  Thus we make two eyes.  Now from the harnesses you must first create a mustache, and then the brow "curls".  We glue the sausages and cut strips into the stack.  The next step is the production of beard and wool on the forehead.  We also make them from harnesses.  The dog‚Äôs ears will look like triangles with a hole inside.  The nose is made of an oval, in the lower part of which you need to make two recesses. </p><p>  The head is assembled, proceed to the manufacture of the body.  We create an egg from beige material, and then we make black overlays.  Roll out the ovals, and then flatten them with your fingers.  We attach two ovals perpendicular to each other to the back of the body.  This will be the hind paw.  The front paw will be made of a thick tourniquet.  It remains to roll up four balls that need to be flattened.  These will be the lower parts of the paws.  We attach a thin black tourniquet to the body - this will be the tail.  It remains to cut through the strips on all the details.  In this way, a wool texture will be created. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The turtle </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tortoise figure" class="if uuid-2426270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426270.jpg"></div><p>  The original polymer clay craft is a mixture of an animal with a cake.  Let's make a macaroon turtle.  Such a figure will decorate your interior and bring a little fairy tale into it.  To make the turtle you will need turquoise and white plastic.  We will work in stages.  First, create a base from white material.  Knead it in your hands, and then roll a large ball.  Now flatten it to the state of a cake.  This will be the body of the turtle. </p><p>  The head of the animal should be in the shape of a ball.  In front of it we strengthen the eyes.  They can be rolled up from black plastic, or you can insert shiny beads.  Getting to the manufacture of forepaws.  We form a triangle with smooth edges from the ball, and then bend the corner to the side.  The hind legs of the turtle will be flattened circles.  The tail is a small triangle. </p><p>  The body is ready, proceed to the manufacture of the shell.  It will consist of a large, slightly flattened ball.  Cut the workpiece in half.  And now from the harnesses we create overlays for the edges.  And we process them well with sandpaper to give them a pronounced relief.  It remains to "dress" the turtle in a shell. </p><h2>  Fish </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.taringa.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fish figurine" class="if uuid-2426271" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426271.jpg"></div><p>  A master class of polymer clay crafts is presented above.  Even a child can cope with the manufacture of such fish.  Nothing complicated here.  To create a craft, you will need orange, white and black polymer clay.  If you wish, you can change the colors to those that you like more. </p><p>  Let's start making crafts for beginners from polymer clay.  Step by step the process of creating a figure will look like this.  Form a drop of orange plastic.  Then we extend the tail at the back, and the fins at the top.  Now create the recesses for the eyes and place two white balls there.  In the eyeballs we immerse the pupil blanks.  We finish work on the head of the fish by creating a slot for the mouth.  Next, roll out white and black stripes and decorate the back of the fish with them.  The final action is to create fins.  First we make the orange part, then add the black border to it.  We create a texture with a stack and then we attach the workpiece to the body. </p><h2>  Tree </h2><p>  You can see the photo of polymer clay crafts above.  Any person who begins to master the work with material will cope with the creation of such a tree.  Craft will be created from harnesses.  Therefore, the first thing you need to roll up a lot of sausages of different thicknesses.  Now take your blanks and join them by scrolling a little clockwise.  Spread the lower ends and fix them on the stand.  The body is ready. </p><p>  We again roll the harnesses, twist them again and attach them perpendicular to the body.  It will be the hands of a tree.  It remains to make a head.  It will be based on an oval.  We roll it, and then cut the crown.  The resulting plane is decorated with plaits.  To give the tree more humanity, you need to work out the face.  We cut the mouth, sculpt the cheeks and cheekbones, and then insert the black balls - the eyes.  As a decorative element, you can use a thin green tourniquet that will wrap around the whole tree.  On the resulting vine should attach a few leaves. </p><h2>  Cover decor </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cover decor" class="if uuid-2426276" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426276.jpg"></div><p>  Do you have special candy cans?  Then decorate their covers.  Crafts from polymer clay for beginners can carry not only a decorative, but also a utilitarian function.  Make various pastries out of plastic.  It can be cookies, marshmallows, macaroons, waffles and pieces of chocolate.  All this is easy to create with the help of miniature baby sculpting molds.  When the blanks are created, you will need to collect all the details.  Roll the formation and give it a circle shape, focusing on the edges of your cover.  Now attach the cut layer to the lid and create smudges on the sides.  It remains in a chaotic manner to arrange various "tasty" pieces. </p><h2>  Brooch fox </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com.mx" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brooch fox" class="if uuid-2426290" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426290.jpg"></div><p>  Want to create a decoration?  A fox brooch is an ideal option that you can do with your own hands from polymer clay.  For beginners, it will be easy to do the crafts, but the result is excellent.  How to create something similar?  Roll out a layer of orange, and then cut a drop-shaped shape of the muzzle and two triangular ears.  Connect the parts.  Roll out the white plastic.  From it you need to cut two long ovals and two more small triangles.  We strengthen the linings based on.  From black balls we create eyes and a nose.  It remains to make the decor of the brooch.  You can create fancy flowers, plants and geometric shapes.  Reinforce the details on the base well so that they do not fall off during wear.  After you bake the product, you can varnish it. </p><h2>  Minion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="minion figure" class="if uuid-2426282" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426282.jpg"></div><p>  You can create a cartoon character in just an hour.  It is based on a large oval of yellow color.  Cover the bottom of the workpiece with a blue thinly rolled sheet.  Cut out two small blue rectangles and attach them to the front and back of the figure.  Now from the harnesses make the resulting jumpsuit straps.  Blind hands out of yellow sausages.  Roll up black balls.  It will be the arms and legs of the minion.  Getting to the study of the face.  Using a pen or stack, we create a depression in the upper part of the product - this will be the mouth.  Two large white balls with black dots of different sizes inside will become eyes.  From gray plastic, make glasses on a black harness.  If you wish, you can make a bee.  It will be a flat oval with teardrop-shaped wings and black stripes decor. </p><h2>  Earrings </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="clay earrings" class="if uuid-2426285" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2426285.jpg"></div><p>  Sometimes it is difficult to buy non-trivial accessories.  If this becomes a problem for you, you can create yourself beautiful earrings yourself.  Take a piece of polymer clay and knead it well in your hands.  First, create a note.  Roll the material to a thickness of 0.5-0.7 mm and cut a note.  If it is difficult for you to do this, you can first create a stencil-pattern for yourself.  But the treble clef cannot be made this way.  It will have to be sculpted from harnesses.  Roll up thick sausages and lay them out in the shape of a key.  Now cut the sausage at the intersection and blind it so that there are no overlaps.  At both ends of the treble clef, overlays should be made from flattened circles, which should be carefully glued into the form. </p>
