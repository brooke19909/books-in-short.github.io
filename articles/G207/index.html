    <h2>  Types of Anxiety </h2><p>  At a low level of intensity, anxiety is vital for a person.  This feeling helps to take certain actions to mitigate or prevent danger.  For example, high school students put a lot of effort in order to prepare for the exam.  Normal anxiety stimulates the growth and change of the child, helps him move from one age to another. </p><p>  Excessive anxiety is an ambiguous response to stresses and problems that arise in school life.  If anxiety is normal, the child's internal mechanisms are turned on, which are aimed at eliminating the source of danger.  For example, the fear of passing exams stimulates active preparation for them.  Pathological anxiety causes maladaptive and unconstructive actions.  The child does not cope with threats, he is not confident in himself, his strengths, avoids social communication.  If you do not provide such a student with timely psychological help, he may develop various phobias.  In children, agoraphobia is formed, implying a fear of loneliness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Phillips technique helps diagnose the level of school anxiety).  Processing the results allows the psychologist to identify the problem, select ways to reduce fears.  If it is not possible to get rid of fears by external methods (Erickson hypnosis, cognitive psychotherapy), the doctor prescribes certain drugs to the child. </p><p>  Anxiety disorder is considered a diagnosis of neurotic disorder when a child without discomfort feels discomfort and nervousness.  This condition is revealed by the method of diagnosing the level of school anxiety of Phillips.  The objectives of the study are to assess the psychological comfort of children. </p>
