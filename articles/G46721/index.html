    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sunland beach hotel 4 turkey reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2063758.jpg"></div>  Since the beaches smoothly pass one into another (they are separated by a parking for yachts), the difference between them can be noticed only by the number of sunbathers.  There are more people at Tsentralny, and in the season it is even hard to find a free sunbed.  The entrance to the sea is also pebbled, but as guests write in their reviews of the Sunland Beach Hotel 4 * (photo below), if you are relaxing with young children, then it is better not to be too lazy and go to the Moonlight beach.  He, in their opinion, is better equipped, and the shallow water near the shore allows the kids to frolic in the water for at least a whole day, and their parents not to worry about their children.  In addition, this is the only part of the coast with a sand cover, which will allow kids not only to run freely along the shore, but also build castles or sculpt ‚Äúpies‚Äù.

    <p>  All the parents who visited this place with their children say that they got an amazing experience of traveling together with their child along paths, followed by another giant predator or dinosaur waiting for them in the thickets and among the trees.  Given that the park occupies 30,000 m <sup>2</sup> , there is something to see.  In addition, children can play and swim in the pool located on its territory. </p><p>  No less interesting for kids will be visiting the caves in which dolphins live, you can enjoy their performance in the dolphinarium of the Moonlight Park. </p><p>  The Turks did not spare the territory to create an ecopark, for which 40,000 m <sup>2</sup> were allocated.  Over 350,000 reptiles and amphibians live here.  Many of the presented species are on the verge of extinction, the ecopark has become their home of salvation, where conditions are created that are close to their natural habitat. </p><p>  As guests of the hotel note in their reviews, you can safely take children here, as they certainly will not be bored. </p><h2>  Expectations and Reality </h2><p>  As can be seen from the above, this hotel has many advantages, the main of which are: </p><ul><li>  The location.  Indeed, it is located not far from Kemer, where there are bars, night clubs, and the only country‚Äôs Dinopark park. </li><li>  The surrounding nature exceeds all expectations.  Mountains, crystal-clear water, pebble beaches, air filled with the aroma of needles and breezes, national parks and the cable car to the highest peak - all this is at the disposal of hotel guests.  Hiking and cycling are very popular here, so an active vacation for those who love him is guaranteed. </li><li>  Diving is no less attractive to vacationers.  Here, both beginners and experienced divers are waiting for underwater caves, in the darkness of which live barracudas and stone fish.  For beginners, a base for diving in the Aquarium Bay is specially equipped, where at a depth of only 3-4 meters you can see sea urchins, stars and octopuses.  According to hotel guests, they are fortunate that the dive sites and diving center are in close proximity to it, in Kemer. </li><li>  Rafting on a mountain river will also not leave anyone indifferent. </li></ul><p>  This is what awaits all guests at the Sunland Beach Hotel 4 *.  What does the hotel itself prepare for them?  Many travelers not only write reviews, but also use photos of their stay in it to confirm their words.  Major complaints indicate flaws in the rooms.  For example, smudges on the ceiling in the shower or damaged railing on the balcony. </p><p>  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the last restoration of the hotel was in 2007.  Many travelers say that over 10 years, even an apartment where 1-2 people live, needs repair and updating of the interior, let alone a large complex.  A staff turnover is also observed, as you can often see open vacancies at Sunland Beach Hotel 4 *.  Reviews about the hotel are mixed, but it is not empty.  Already booked all rooms until the New Year. </p>
