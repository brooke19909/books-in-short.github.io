Nothing human is alien to them.  They do not teach or instruct anyone, because they themselves lack solid moral principles.  They themselves often sin.  <span>The gods of Olympus are</span> deprived of authority, which is simply unacceptable to religion.  They are immortal, but not omnipotent, because they, like people, are subject to fate.  The list of Olympus gods is quite long, but we will try to recall the most famous of these characters in Greek mythology in our story.  So, let's begin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the gods of Olympus" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14431/214293.jpg" width="377"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Gods of Olympus: names and characteristics</strong> </p><p>  Greek deities are in fact innumerable, but we will tell only about the most famous of them. </p><p>  <em>Zeus</em> </p><p>  After numerous victories over the titans and giants, this god began to rule over heaven and earth.  Zeus obeyed both ordinary people and similar deities.  He became the giver of life, the universal protector and savior, the organizer of cities and the patron saint of soldiers. </p><p>  <em>Poseidon</em> </p><p>  This "blue-headed" god rules over all the salt waters.  He does not care about the life of Olympus, but he lives on <span>the seabed</span> in a magnificent palace with his wife Amphitrite.  It was believed that Poseidon is not inferior in power to Zeus. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>Hera</em> </p><p>  Zeus's sister, this goddess also became his wife.  She was considered a model of marital fidelity, the keeper of the hearth.  But at the same time, she herself was not happy in marriage, because her amorous husband Zeus often walked both on Olympus and on the ground. </p>

    <p>  This god was so gloomy that the region he was in charge of was not surprising, for it was the kingdom of the dead.  At the time of Homer, there was no such expression as "die."  Instead, there was another that sounded "go to the kingdom of Hades." </p><p>  <em>Demeter</em> </p><p>  Such gods of Olympus as <span>Poseidon, Zeus and</span> Hades called this goddess their sister.  Demeter was considered the goddess of the earth, and they called her only Mother, the Progenitor. </p><p>  <em>Hephaestus</em> </p><p>  A working God, patron of fire and metal, he was also the consort of the beautiful Aphrodite.  It was he, Hephaestus, who trained people in the construction of beautiful houses and furniture. </p><p>  <em>Athena</em> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of gods olympus" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14431/214295.jpg" width="351"></div>

    <p>  <span>Zeus's daughter coming</span> out of his head.  This goddess was in charge of military and knitting.  All the gods of Olympus were dressed and shod in Athena's knitted garments. </p><p>  <em>Ares</em> </p><p>  His name disgusted all people, because he was a fierce opponent of Ayrena, the defender of the world, and at the same time a friend of Eris, the patroness of discord.  This god of war longed for blood and killed indiscriminately everyone - both the right and the guilty. </p><p>  <em>Apollo</em> </p><p>  A beautiful young man, the son of Zeus was considered the god of poetry and music.  In addition, he guarded herds and sunlight, was the patron saint of muses. </p><p>  <em>Artemis</em> </p><p>  Apollo's sister was the goddess of the mountains and forests.  She is known as the keeper of nature and animals.  According to other sources, Artemis is the goddess of hunting and death. </p><p>  <em>Hermes</em> </p><p>  This god is known as the patron saint of merchants and merchants, a peddler of information, as well as an assistant to thieves.  In addition, Hermes is considered the protector of herds and shepherds. </p><p>  <em>Aphrodite</em> </p><p>  The wonderful goddess was born from sea foam.  Aphrodite was the <span>goddess of beauty</span> and love, attraction and passion. </p>
