Although they are not rare, but not everyone knows how to determine the authenticity of a banknote.  Because of this, negative consequences arise.  Therefore, every Russian citizen needs to know how real five-thousandth notes differ from counterfeit ones. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The banknote "5000 rubles" was created by the Provisional Government in 1917, and the Government of the RSFSR issued it in 1918.  On its back was a double-headed eagle.  The banknote was considered the largest in the country. </p>

    <p>  In 1996, this banknote became one of the small ones; intense inflation was observed.  Since that period, new notes began to be issued. </p><h2>  New money </h2><p>  In 1995, they began to issue <span>new money,</span> but they did not last long.  On the green banknote was the image ‚ÄúMillennium of Russia‚Äù, located on the background of the ancient church - St. Sophia Cathedral.  On the back is the Fortress Wall of the Novgorod Kremlin. </p><p>  This bill has watermarks in the form of an image of the cathedral and the number 5000. The denomination on the banknote is registered three times.  But she did not last long, and in 1998 they began to issue money with the same image, but with a face value of 5 rubles.  And since 2001, it was replaced with a coin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Modern banknotes </h2><p>  New five thousandth notes were issued in 2006.  At that time they became the largest.  On the back were memorable places of several regions.  At first, its circulation was small.  There was an assumption that such money would be in regions with high salaries. </p>

    <p>  But the banknote has become popular throughout Russia.  Because of this, the need for degrees of protection has arisen.  Therefore, after 5 years, bank tickets were reissued. </p><h2>  Where did the images come from? </h2><p>  Not everyone knows that the monument on the bill has a difficult fate.  Three sculptors participated in the competition - M. M. Antokolsky, M. O. Mikeshin and A. M. Opekushin, who became the winner.  In 1890, a finished statue was brought to Khabarovsk, and after 35 years, the monument was sent to the museum.  There he lay for many years, and during the war period he was smelted.  And only in 1980, funds were collected that went to restore the monument, in 1992 it was opened.  Five thousandth bills have a beautiful turn - a bridge across the Amur. </p><h2>  Size and Description </h2><p>  The banknote has a presentable appearance, as it is made in red-brown tones.  There are interspersed multi-colored fibers in the paper.  The bill is dedicated to Khabarovsk.  The embankment is located on the front side, and in the foreground is a monument to Muravyov-Amursky.  On the right is the emblem of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  On the reverse side is the road-rail <span>bridge across the Amur.</span>  The parameters of the bill are standard - 157 x 69 mm.  There are several degrees of protection on a banknote. </p><h2>  Definition of authenticity </h2><p>  Among counterfeit money, exactly five thousandth bills are popular.  How to distinguish them so as not to be deceived?  Naturally, it would be nice to have a device with you that allows you to determine the authenticity of banknotes, but this does not always work out.  Moreover, the protection of money makes it possible to distinguish fake to all citizens of the country. </p><p>  It is possible to determine whether a real bill is not only in appearance, but also to the touch.  The coat of arms is painted with OVI: if you change the angle of view, the color changes to green, and then raspberry.  On the banknote there is a section with hidden stripes MVC: if you look perpendicularly from 30-40 cm, then this part will be visible as monophonic, and strips are visible with a slope. </p><p>  The height of the numbers on the right-hand side of the serial number increases.  Watermarks are visible on the bill, which can be seen in the light.  The emblem has a polarizing effect.  Digital denomination created by perforation.  The element to the right of the signature ‚ÄúBank of Russia Ticket‚Äù was created by a print on an unpainted area. </p>

    <p>  A fake of five thousandth notes will immediately be noticeable if you know these simple rules for determining authenticity.  Microtext is on this note: if you carefully examine it, you can see "5000" and "CBRF 5000".  <span>A metallized thread</span> with a width of 3 mm 5 times comes out on the back of the bill.  There are other signs as well, but they are hard to see. </p><p>  If there is any doubt about the authenticity of a bank ticket, then it must be taken to any bank where it will be checked.  It should only be taken into account that in the case of counterfeiting by the employees, the police may be called for proceedings.  If false five-thousandth bills or money of other denominations were discovered, then they must be taken to the police.  It is necessary to tell how they fell into hands.  Counterfeiting bank notes is punishable. </p>
