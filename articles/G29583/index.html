"Hard reset" will come to the aid of users.  The procedure will help restart the gadget in case of any hardware error.  In the article you will find information on how to restart on different models of smartphones. </p><h2>  Why is this needed? </h2><p>  Almost every iPhone user has experienced a freeze on a mobile device.  Such a nuisance can happen due to the installation of applications from unverified sources, or when RAM is loaded.  In any case, the owner of the gadget will need to perform a hard reset of the iPhone in order to restore its normal functioning. </p><h2>  Specificity and Features </h2><p>  Like any personal computer, mobile devices process huge amounts of data.  The more information, the faster the device‚Äôs cache is populated.  This entails problems and malfunctions in the functioning of the gadget.  On iPhone 2, 3, 4, 4S models, the on and off button was on the top of the gadget.  On the new "iPhones" 6, 6 plus, 7, 7 plus, the keys were moved from the top to the right. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tollebild.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hard restart" class="if uuid-3205962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3205962.jpg"></div><p>  Performing a hard reset of the iPhone is called Hard Reset.  The procedure allows you to solve many problems associated with system errors.  Also, restarting the device may be necessary in the following cases: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  the image disappears; </li><li>  long loading; </li><li>  problem with getting updates; </li><li>  persistent errors </li><li>  occurrence of software conflicts; </li><li>  Slow device operation </li><li>  incorrect operation of the application. </li></ul><p>  Restarting the device will help even if the sensor does not work on the smartphone.  However, the procedure is unlikely to restore the functionality of the mobile device, if this is not a software error. </p><h2>  Benefits of Hard Reboot </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãHard Reset is not new, therefore it is universally applied on any mobile platforms.  The only difference is the combination and type of keystrokes that cause a reboot.  The main thing is that you need to understand the instructions described in this article in advance.  It is important to remember that carrying out a hard reset of the iPhone does not lead to the loss of data and personal information.  Therefore, users do not have to download a saved copy from iTunes or iCloud.  The procedure will completely restore the system and solve technical failures.  Now let's move on from words to deeds. </p><h2>  Standard procedure </h2><p>  Prior to the release of iPhone 7, all Apple mobile devices had two buttons: Home and Power.  The instructions below will help you hard reset the iPhone 6 and older devices.  The user will need to simultaneously press the power and power buttons, holding them for 10 seconds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="global.drfone.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rebooting iPhone" class="if uuid-3205957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3205957.jpg"></div><p>  The user will see a slider with the words "Turn off", which must be flicked.  After turning off the device, wait a couple of minutes and turn it on again.  As a result of a hard reboot of the iPhone, the user will eliminate most of the failures that will never make themselves felt.  This method will be effective even if the device does not respond to pressing hardware buttons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to perform a hard reset of "iPhone 7"? </h2><p>  Due to the functional change in the capabilities of the Home button, Hard Reset is performed differently.  In this device, the Home key has ceased to be mechanical.  Therefore, the above method with holding the "Home" button will be useless. </p><p>  To perform a hard reset, you will need to hold down the Volume Down and Power buttons.  The keys should be held until the screen goes blank and <span>the Apple logo</span> appears <span>.</span>  As you can see, the manipulation is almost the same as in older models of mobile devices. </p><h2>  Restart for iPhone 8 </h2><p>  The company has introduced various functional, technical and conceptual changes to the new line of smartphones.  Developers are changing the usual options for access to a hard reset of "iPhone 8". </p><p>  Owners of new smartphones can forget about the usual retention of buttons.  The user should press and slightly hold his finger on the volume up button.  At the same time, you need to hold the volume down button and the Power key.  After the familiar logo appears, the buttons can be released. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.primosync.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Company `s logo" class="if uuid-3205960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3205960.jpg"></div><p>  Not all users manage to carry out this procedure the first time.  However, mastery in this matter will come with experience, so do not worry.  It is not recommended to depart from the indicated sequence of actions.  Otherwise, the smartphone does not recognize the signal and is activated in standard mode. </p><h2>  How to reboot without a lock button? </h2><p>  Any mechanical damage that occurs as a result of a fall can lead to damage to the device.  As a result, the user is at a loss in how to hard reset the iPhone if the hardware lock button is out of order. </p><p>  You can use the Assistive Touch function.  To do this, you need to go to the "Settings" section and tap on the "Basic" item.  Then click on the "Universal Access" section and activate the Assistive Touch option.  A soft button will appear on the screen, by which you should tap and select the "Device" item.  The system will open a menu in which you need to click on the <span>"Screen lock"</span> item <span>.</span>  After that, you can turn off the phone. </p><h2>  Additional way </h2><p>  The user can wait until the battery is completely discharged.  This option involves hard resetting the iPhone without using hardware buttons.  The gadget owner does not need to do anything other than sit and wait for the battery to fully discharge and the smartphone will turn off. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.indiatoday.in" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restart Instructions" class="if uuid-3206029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3206029.jpg"></div><p>  In order to speed up the process, you can turn on any video or program.  Thus, the battery can drain in just a couple of hours.  Then, the user simply needs to connect the mobile device to the charger.  The method is not widespread, however, it has revenge to be. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Any mobile device may freeze at the most inopportune moment.  Therefore, people are interested in the question of how to make a hard reset of the iPhone and fix the problems that have arisen?  Each user of the mobile device will be able to restart the device. </p><p>  Do not underestimate the significance of this procedure.  Despite the simplicity and ease, a hard reset of the iPhone will fix many problems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imore.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Restart Instructions" class="if uuid-3205969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3205969.jpg"></div><p>  After restoring the functioning of the mobile device, you need to understand the cause of the problem. </p><ul><li>  If these are incorrect actions on the part of the user, it is necessary to work with the gadget more carefully. </li><li>  If the problem arose due to poor-quality filling of the device, you should contact the nearest Apple service center. </li></ul><p>  The instructions described above prove that a hard reset of the iPhone is quite simple.  It‚Äôs not necessary for the gadget‚Äôs owners to back up the data, as all the information will remain in place.  In this case, the procedure will solve all problems associated with the operating memory of the device. </p>
