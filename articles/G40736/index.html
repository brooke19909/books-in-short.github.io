    <p>  Virpul appliances on the stands of household appliance stores are immediately evident to customers, especially if it is a Virpul ARC 4178 IX refrigerator.  An unusual size is noteworthy - the width and depth of the models is 70 cm (as opposed to the standard sixty).  A large refrigerator outside simply cannot be small inside: the volume of the refrigerator compartment is 325 liters, and the freezer compartment - 107 liters.  It is clear that anything will enter into it: a whole bucket of <span>frozen berries</span> and vegetables, home-made preparations and supplies for the whole week for a large family. </p><p>  What else attracts buyers Whirlpool model?  The reviews indicate that, first of all, it is the No Frost cooling system, due to which there is no ice in the freezer compartment.  Secondly, the convenient location of the shelves.  The freezer in this model is located at the top and is divided into several compartments: a shelf, a sliding compartment and a device for making ice, which must be noted separately.  The fact is that it differs from ordinary plastic trays, which are put in domestic models.  Oo is designed in such a way that the finished ice cubes fall out into the hanging container by turning the handle. </p><p>  Capacious wide shelves that can be pulled out so as not to bend over, trying to get the right product, are noteworthy.  In the upper part of the refrigerator compartment there is a freshness zone, which allows you to store perishable foods in the Whirlpool refrigerator for 5-7 days.  Owner reviews indicate that many are attracted to convenient shelves on the inside of the doors of the refrigerator and freezer compartment.  Especially refrigerated - they freely include two-liter bottles and packages of juice.  An additional option of the company Virpul is an antibacterial filter. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not only <span>Whirlpool refrigerators</span> are in demand <span>.</span>  <span>Feedback from</span> sellers in household appliances stores suggests that the washing machines of this company are also very popular.  For example, the ultramodern and multifunctional model Whirlpool ARC 4178 IX, which only recently appeared on sale.  It is very economical in energy consumption, the maximum load is 7 kg, and the spin - 1000 rpm. </p><p>  A large display with many additional functions allows you to operate the washing parameters.  Among buyers, millet is used not only with front-loading, but also with vertical loading, for example, the Virpul AWE 2214 washing machine with a spin of 700 revolutions.  A large number of programs allows you to choose the optimal mode for washing clothes of various types: cotton, jeans, delicate fabrics, wool, silk, synthetics.  Separately, you can divide things according to color intensity into white, dark and light.  Depending on the selected program, the machine will optimize the temperature, washing duration and spin.  If desired, you can turn on special modes that will save water and energy, for example, ‚ÄúAquaEco‚Äù for lightly soiled or ‚ÄúEcoCotton‚Äù for very dirty linen and cotton linen.  Clothing that is only slightly dirty can be stretched on a short program that lasts only a quarter of an hour.  The model is also convenient in that it can be installed both along the wall and across.  Convenience of installation is an indisputable advantage over front models, which attracts the attention of buyers to the Virpul AWE 2214 washing machine. </p><p>  In general, the technique of this brand can be described as practical, reliable and convenient to use.  However, there is one significant drawback with Whirlpool products.  Customer reviews confirm that, in the event of a breakdown, it is difficult to find consumables (the same antibacterial filters) and replacement parts, since all models are assembled abroad, and those that are located are expensive, making repairs almost unprofitable. </p>
