    <p>  <span>Corporate card bookkeeping is</span> pretty straightforward.  Experienced accountants, as a rule, do not have any problems reflecting operations.  Difficulties may arise when compiling a <span>report on a corporate card by the</span> employee to whom it was issued.  Next, we consider the features of the reflection of operations. </p><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Corporate cards are called bank cards, the funds on which belong to the organization.  With their help, payment of expenses incurred by employees in the framework of their professional activities is carried out. </p><p>  A <span>corporate card</span> can <span>pay for</span> travel, household, and entertainment expenses.  This payment tool is not used for the personal purposes of the employee, crediting earnings to her, as well as social payments. </p><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  There are credit and settlement (debit) cards.  With the help of the latter, payment is made at the expense of funds located at the enterprise‚Äôs account, or overdraft. </p><p>  According to credit cards, accordingly, settlements are carried out using borrowed funds provided by the banking structure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Features of the operation </h2><p>  Replenishment is made by bank transfer.  For this, a payment order is sent to a banking organization. </p><p>  Funds are spent only with a card.  This can be either ordinary cashless transactions or <span>cash withdrawals.</span> </p><p>  <span>Corporate cards are</span> not subject to settlement limits established by the Central Bank for cash settlements.  Meanwhile, banking organizations, guided by the recommendations of the Central Bank, can set a limit for issuance.  For example, on a <span>corporate card of Sberbank the</span> maximum amount is 100 thousand rubles per day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corporate card for legal entities" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2005585.jpg" width="573"></div>

    <h2>  Benefits of Payment Instruments </h2><p>  The following advantages of using corporate cards can be noted: </p><ul><li>  Control of employee spending.  Firstly, all operations will be reflected in the account of the enterprise.  Secondly, a <span>corporate card report</span> is generated, which reflects all expenses incurred for a specific period. </li><li>  The ability to use funds at any time.  Access to money in the account around the clock. </li><li>  Quick card lock in case of problems. </li><li>  The ability to use funds on business trips abroad.  There is no need to purchase foreign currency when traveling outside the Russian Federation.  At the same time, from Russia you can quickly <span>replenish the account of an</span> employee who is abroad. </li><li>  Significant time savings when booking and paying for tickets, hotel rooms. </li></ul><h2>  IFTS and Funds Notice </h2><p>  Information about an open account should be sent to the FIU, BCC and the tax service.  At present, the notice is sent by the banking organization serving the settlement system. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Notification is carried out within 7 days (workers). </p><h2>  Important Nuances </h2><p>  <span>Corporate cards for legal entities</span> are issued for specific employees of the enterprise, i.e. are registered. </p><p>  Reflection of operations in <span>accounting for corporate cards is</span> carried out, as a rule, on a separate account. </p><p>  A bank account can be opened both in rubles and in foreign currency.  Moreover, in the first case, it is not necessary to open an additional currency account.  According to the Regulation of the Central Bank No. 266-P, <span>payment by a corporate card</span> can also be made in a currency different from the currency of the account.  Upon receipt, for example, of dollars, the bank system will convert the required amount (it will automatically translate rubles into dollars). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corporate card advance report" class="if" height="319" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2005586.jpg" width="547"></div>

    <h2>  Spending goals </h2><p>  Regulatory acts establish a list of operations that can be carried out in foreign currency using a corporate card: </p><ul><li>  Receiving cash foreign currency abroad of the Russian Federation to pay for representation, travel expenses. </li><li>  Payment of expenses (representation / travel) in trading / service organizations in foreign currency outside of Russia. </li></ul><p>  Other transactions are considered illegal.  Monitoring compliance with the list is carried out by the banking structure. </p><h2>  Organization Local Document </h2><p>  An act must be developed at the enterprise that defines the basic rules for using corporate cards.  In this document you must install: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The list of operations and costs that are allowed to be performed by an employee. </li><li>  Settlement limits. </li><li>  The procedure for submitting a <span>report on a corporate card</span> . </li><li>  Information about the inadmissibility of the disclosure of the PIN code to third parties. </li><li>  The time period within which an employee is required to submit an advance report on a corporate card.  In the same paragraph, it is advisable to list the documents that will confirm the information. </li></ul><p>  Moreover: </p><ul><li>  The order of the head determines the circle of employees entitled to receive corporate cards. </li><li>  Liability agreements are concluded with the relevant employees. </li><li>  Employees holding cards must be familiar with the procedure for using signature cards. </li></ul><p>  Return and issue of payment instruments is carried out in a special account book. </p><h2>  Reflection features </h2><p>  <span>Accounting for the current account</span> is maintained at the company on the <span>account</span> .  55. A sub-account 55.4 is opened for him. </p><p>  If an account has a <span>minimum balance,</span> it is advisable to create sub-accounts of the second order: "Minimum balance" and "Payment limit." </p><p>  If the organization has opened several accounts (for each card), then sub-account 55.4 is created for each of them.  If several cards of different workers are issued for one payment card, which make payments within the general limit, the need for conducting analytical accounting in the context of holders is determined by the enterprise independently. </p><p>  In cases where a corporate card is tied to a single settlement account, it is advisable to create a subaccount to the account.  51 or 52. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corporate card tied to a current account" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2005587.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The accountant of the enterprise supplements the standard report form with several lines.  First of all, graphs are provided to reflect the amounts of funds on the date of use of the card: </p><ul><li>  "Balance on the map."  This line is filled in if the employee did not return the payment instrument. </li><li>  "Issuance of card No. ...".  This line contains information if the payment instrument was issued before the task. </li></ul><p>  According to the conditions of the example, the balance on the card is recognized as 0, since the employee was issued a card before executing the order.  The line "Card issued" indicates its number and the amount available. </p><p>  To reflect the replenishment of funds, the column "Payment order" has been added to the report.

    <h2>  Form Approval </h2><p>  According to general rules, the head must approve the form developed by the enterprise independently.  Such an order is established in the Federal Law No. 402. The same requirement applies if the organization uses a unified form. </p><p>  Typically, sample forms of primary documents are provided in the appendices to the order on approval of accounting policies. </p><h2>  Account opening </h2><p>  To create an account with corporate cards, the company will need first of all the documents necessary for opening a regular account.  In addition, you must write a statement, the form of which is provided by the bank.  It is written for each employee who holds the card.  Also attached are documents by which the relevant employees are identified.  This, in particular, about the passport, as well as documents confirming the employment relationship with the company (copy of the contract).  The bank may request other securities, if necessary. </p>
