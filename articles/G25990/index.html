However, not all institutions can boast that they conduct concerts of groups of various musical directions.  Club <span>"Theater" (Moscow) is well</span> known to many music lovers and lovers of a unique atmosphere.  In the institution you can hear both your favorite hits and completely new songs from beginner performers.  For maximum comfort, a restaurant is open where you can order delicious and popular dishes for every taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sim-sim.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Design institutions Theater" class="if uuid-3126444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/3126444.jpg"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Club "Theater" (Moscow) is located in an old mansion, which was built in the XVIII century.  This detail already makes the place special for many visitors.  Previously, balls and various receptions were held here, as well as a real theater.  The building has absorbed this atmosphere, so visitors respond most flatteringly to the design of the club.  In the hall you can see balconies with stucco, which has been restored from past centuries.  The institution stands out among the others by the fact that the building itself has a high-quality sound.  Guests can enjoy it during concerts.  After all, it was not for nothing that the theater used to be here, so the acoustics here are very good.  That is why on the stages of the club you can see a variety of musical groups, as well as enjoy the sound of each note. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="places.moscow" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Club theater" class="if uuid-3126431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/3126431.jpg"></div><p>  The institution has opened two whole halls, each of which looks presentable and spectacular.  On the Internet you can often see a photo of the hall of the Teatr club in Moscow, since even a rare connoisseur will like the premises.  For VIP-guests there is a separate area, as well as balconies with tables for 300 people, from where you can watch performances.  For visitors open four bars.  The first room usually houses about a thousand people.  In the second room fewer people gather, as it is designed for two hundred people.  In the halls regular concerts are regularly held, comparable to real festivals in large complexes.  The institution has modern equipment for large-scale performances.  On the stage, guests can see not only Russian pop music, but also foreign groups.  The club has no restrictions on musical styles, which is why it sounds like rock and metal, as well as hip-hop.  The venue is often used for various parties; musicians also organize presentations of new albums here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zloyrock.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Artists on stage" class="if uuid-3126445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/55971/3126445.jpg"></div><p>  Reviews about the club Theater in Moscow are both positive and negative.  Many guests like it here.  They celebrate the pleasant atmosphere, as well as the original design of the institution.  A considerable number of visitors were satisfied with the sound and concerts that they could get to.  Regarding the price of drinks, guests respond differently.  Some items are overpriced, so club guests do not recommend spending money here.  By cons, many attribute the presence of a smoking area directly in the room.  The institution has a rather large wardrobe, but still large queues are formed.  These points are also indicated by some users in their reviews.  Guests also write that club employees do not always behave politely. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The address of the club "Theater" (Moscow) </h2><p>  The institution is located at the following address: Barclay Street, house - 6, building - 2.
