    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  At the Aqua Hotel Onabrava &amp; Spa 4 * in Santa Susanna, there are only two establishments: a cozy Mexican restaurant called La Pergola and a lobby bar.  For a hotel of this level a little, if you look at the reviews left by the guests here, you can once again make sure of the well-known expression - the main quality, not quantity. </p><p>  Hotel guests are delighted with the food offered here and their attitude to the guests.  If tourists arrived from the airport to the hotel when the restaurant is already closed, a cold dinner will be served in their room.  It includes such goodies as prosciutto, Spanish and Italian sausages, olives, salads, fruits and drinks.  Ideal for a bite to eat. </p><p>  The restaurant is a true gourmet paradise, and the reviews left by guests of the Aqua Hotel Onabrava &amp; Spa prove this.  Here is just a small list of dishes offered to guests: shrimp, salmon, lobster, pineapple, assorted nuts, lamb, elite cheeses (camembert, brie, with mold, etc.), jamon, mussels.  Needless to say, if breakfast is served here with champagne and even dinner with Russian vodka. </p><p>  But there is also simple food: soups, meat, fish, pizza, sausages, scrambled eggs, pate, jam, honey.  Importantly, there are also children's and vegetarian tables.  By the way, there are a lot of fruits and vegetables. </p>

    <h2>  Other numbers </h2><p>  Many come to Aqua Hotel Onabrava &amp; Spa 4 * to Spain as a family or company.  For such guests are other apartments.  They are called family here. </p><p>  It is only interesting that in terms of area, such rooms are absolutely no different from the notorious standards.  The number of beds is the same - two kin-size beds.  What is different is the price.  For four adults, a week of living will be about 45,000 rubles with breakfast.  If they want to pay for lunch and dinner, the price will increase to 70 thousand rubles.  This is not so much - 17,500 rubles per person per week. </p><p>  It is worth noting that, depending on the season, the cost may vary.  In summer, higher tariffs operate here, in winter, respectively, the lowest.  For example, the average spring-autumn indicator is indicated. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  In the end, I would like to pay attention to a more detailed consideration of the reviews left about the Aqua Hotel Onabrava &amp; Spa 4 *.  Here's what tourists talk about most often and most: </p><ul><li>  Beach.  To get to it, you do not need to cross the road - just go down to the underpass, which will lead directly to the sand.  The beach is very clean, like the sea.  Depth immediately begins from the shore. </li><li>  Purity.  The hotel is well maintained and tidy, the state of the territory is constantly monitored.  Maids clean the rooms every day, not forgetting to change linen and towels.  Personal hygiene products are replenished with the same regularity. </li><li>  Administrators  This is not indicated in the official description, but recent reviews indicate that the hotel has Russian-speaking specialists working at the reception.  They, like other administrators, are always ready to give a qualified answer to any guest question. </li><li>  A restaurant.  In addition to an impressive assortment, it also has excellently organized work.  Guests are welcomed and kindly escorted to the table.  The waiters are very polite and courteous, they bring the order quickly and with a smile.  By the way, if the guests paid for the HB food option (breakfast + dinner), but they need to go out in the evening, they can agree, and they will have lunch the second meal. </li><li>  The location of the hotel.  On the street where it is located, on Tuesdays from 9:00 to 13:00 the car traffic is blocked, as the fair arrives.  Paradise for shopaholics - you can buy a lot of things and souvenirs at low prices.  And to the right of the exit from the hotel is the Carrefour supermarket, which delights with a wide assortment.  If you move to the left, you can go to the notorious Lidl with the lowest prices in Europe. </li></ul><p>  These are the main features that guests note.  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that almost everyone who has been here comes to: Aqua Hotel Onabrava &amp; Spa is an ideal option for people who dream of a relatively budget vacation in a hotel with high-quality service.  If you want to have an unforgettable vacation in Spain and pay a small amount for it, you should go here. </p>
