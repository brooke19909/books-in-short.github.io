Linz am rhein</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When it comes to Linz, many tourists get confused.  The fact is that there is a city with that name in Austria, as well as in Germany.  Moreover, both of them deserve to be visited.  Let's look at the sights of the cities of Linz, study the reviews of tourists and try to understand the "highlight" of each. </p><h2>  The capital of Upper Austria </h2><p>  Linz on the Danube lies on both banks of the picturesque river.  It ranks third in the country in size.  190 thousand inhabitants live here.  Today it is a large industrial, transport and cultural center.  However, tourists celebrate his calm and still provincialism. </p><p>  Typically, Linz is visited by passage <span>from Vienna to Salzburg.</span>  It is better to do this from May to October, when pleasant weather is set with an average temperature of + 20 ¬∞ C. The city pleases tourists with its neatness and beautiful panoramas.  However, lovers of outdoor activities and noisy parties may find boring walks through the streets with sightseeing.  Linz in Austria immerses you in an atmosphere of European dimension and leisure.  Here you can stay for a few days, devoting the first of them to the inspection of the city itself, and the other - to travel around the neighborhood. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shiptraveling.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="church of saint martin" class="if uuid-2544279" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62920/2544279.jpg"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  The most ancient sights in Linz were not preserved, although people settled here since the Bronze Age.  It is known that the Celtic settlement with the name Lentos was originally created.  Then the area passed to the Romans, who in 15 BC  built here the border fortress of Lentius.  In 799, the city of Linz was mentioned by Bavarian written monuments.  This is due to the construction of the oldest Austrian church of St. Martin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Medieval Linz was part of the Roman Empire.  In 1490, he was even proclaimed the capital by ruler Frederick III.  True, this did not last long.  But the city got the opportunity to build a bridge across the Danube, which contributed to the development of trade.  Linz became a major center of industry during the time of Nazism.  A. Hitler spent his childhood here, and wanted to see the city as part of the Reich.  Since 1938, military factories and <span>the Mauthausen concentration camp have been</span> operating in Linz <span>,</span> on the site of which today is the Memorial Museum. </p><h2>  Landmarks of Linz </h2><p>  What do you need to see a tourist who finds himself in this wonderful Austrian city?

Walking through the narrow streets paved with cobblestones, you can imagine yourself a resident of the Middle Ages.  By the way, it was here that Turgenev stopped when he composed the story Asya filled with lyrics. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Probably the first inhabitants of these places on the right bank of the Rhine were the Celtic tribes (600 BC), who were then replaced by the Carolingians.  The first written mention of the settlement dates back to 874.  The first church was built here in the 9th century.  The status of the city of Linz received in 1320.  In those days, raids of nomadic tribes were not uncommon.  Therefore, in 1391, the construction of the Fortress Gate began, designed to provide reliable protection for residents.  In 1543, the Town Hall was erected, another of the attractions of Linz. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhine Gate" class="if uuid-2544348" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62920/2544348.jpg"></div><p>  Germany did not always belong to the city.  During his long life, he passed from hand to hand, managed to stay under the rule of the Swedes, the British.  During the reign of Napoleon, it belonged to France, from 1815 - to Prussia.  This led to serious damage.  Restore Linz began in 1861.  After the railway, industry began to develop here, mainly represented by winemaking and basalt mining.
