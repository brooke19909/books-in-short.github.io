    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Briefly about the history of the Riga station </h2><p>  In tsarist Russia, the growth in foreign trade at the end of the nineteenth century prompted the rapid construction of railway lines to the ports of Latvia.  Russian merchants and industrialists made their way to the world market persistently.  In the country, in addition to flour, grain, meat, there were rich deposits of coal, ore and other minerals.  Industry was also gaining strength.  Quickly enough, entrepreneurs appreciated the advantages of laying a new path to the Baltic. </p><p>  This led to the construction of the Moscow-Vindavo-Rybinsk road.  The creation of the gauge began by decree of Nicholas II in 1897. The Railway Society appealed to the Moscow city government with a request to agree to the location of the passenger and freight station ‚ÄúMoscow‚Äù near the Krestovskaya Zastava between the Lazarevsky cemetery and the Nikolaev railway line. </p><p>  The railway station was proposed to be built on a vast wasteland (near Krestovskaya Zastava), adjacent to 1st Meshchanskaya Street.  In this case, between the street and the building itself there should have been an area capable of providing access for the crews.  According to the plan, the freight station was located near the passenger one.  A special place was allocated for the shipment of firewood and forest materials, which at that time was of great importance for the city. </p>

    <p>  The railroad society required significant costs to resolve issues with the future and existing city water supply, since the pipes of the Moskvoretsky water supply were on the station territory, as well as street improvement.  As a result, society agreed with the findings of the city.  It undertook to arrange a wide passage near the Lazarevsky cemetery about ten fathoms wide, after which it should be paved, a pavement and sidewalk should be made in Trifonovsky Lane, a lot of questions on the maintenance of the Naprudnaya River and other tasks should be solved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since the time for the construction of the railway was very limited, its design was carried out according to simplified <span>technical conditions</span> using many rounds of the naturally created obstacles of the Klin ridge. </p><p>  The Vindava station was built according to the project of S. Brzhozovsky.  This is a Petersburg architect.  He is the author of the Vitebsk station, located in the Northern capital.  At the same time, the construction was carried out under the leadership of the architect J. Dietrich. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Opening <strong></strong></h2><p>  In 1901, the Vindavsky railway station was opened in Moscow.  The first train to Vindava departed at the beginning of the seventh evening.  In 1901, the first squad came here from Rzhev.  After that, the <span>Moscow-Rzhev train ran</span> regularly three times a week <span>.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  The station building stands out with an incredibly beautiful facade in a classic Russian style.  It consists of 3 towers, which are connected on the ground floor by covered walkways.  The wings of the station and the central part are two-story.  The building is decorated with almost all the elements that were found in Russian architecture of the seventeenth century: various forms of windows, kokoshniks, platbands, curbs, runners.  Contemporaries unanimously noted the advantages and refinement of this chosen option. </p><p>  Incredibly solemn was the central part of the building, which has a convenient entrance and a covered porch.  The station was justifiably considered the most comfortable for passengers, and in terms of technical parameters was largely perfect.  At the same time, he had his own power station, lighting platforms and premises. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Change of names </h2><p>  The station changed its name repeatedly.  From the very moment of construction it was Vindavsky, then Baltic, then Rzhevsky.  It began to be called Riga only in 1946. </p>

    <p>  In the late thirties there was a situation when the technical speeds of steam-powered trains began to restrain transportation.  <span>The electrified railway</span> had a higher throughput.  For this reason, in 1929, the Moscow-Pushkino section was the first to electrify at the Moscow junction, then, in 1933, electric trains went in the Gorky direction, in Ryazan in 1935, and in Kursk in 1937. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Running electric trains </h2><p>  The first electric trains, according to the plan of the third five-year plan, were to go in the Riga direction in 1943. But the Second World War prevented.  And they recovered only in 1945. </p><p>  Riga station eventually deteriorated.  The area under him also needed to be rebuilt due to constant traffic jams.  And in 1995, the Moscow Government decided to build it up, reconstructing the traffic interchange. </p><p>  The main problem that faced the city was just the arrangement of the mentioned interchange at the intersection of the Riga flyover with Mira Avenue, as well as Suschevsky Val, and Moscow should not have been aesthetically damaged.  Riga station was supposed to develop.  Specialists from possible options, such as a flyover and a tunnel, preferred the former, given the hydrologically difficult environment.  The construction of the overpass required the demolition of part of the cargo yard of the station, as well as a left-luggage office and several other buildings. <strong><br></strong> </p><h2>  Riga station in the modern world </h2><p>  The superstructure with a wide 2-way traffic, as well as a system of pedestrian <span>underpasses that</span> combine the metro station, the station itself, and city streets - all this is modern, refreshed, updated.  The appearance of the building has not changed after the reconstruction: no additional floors, no extensions.  In addition, according to the previous drawings, the stucco molding of the ceilings was restored, and elegant chandeliers were restored. </p>
