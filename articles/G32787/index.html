In our article you will learn about this city, as well as why you need to make a pilgrimage there. </p><h2>  Why do you need to know where the city of Bolgar is located? </h2><p>  A lot of letters from parishioners and pilgrims come to the temple of the martyr <span>Abraham of Bulgaria</span> .  In them, people write that sick children were healed, and disabled people with severe diagnoses did not have exacerbations.  Why is this happening?  It's all about the modest church, which was opened in the ancient city.  For parishioners, she opened her doors on September 25 in 1988.  Despite the fact that the church was opened not so long ago, they already know about it on different continents of our planet.  Orthodox Christians from different parts of Russia, Switzerland and even the United States of America visited the temple of the holy martyr. </p>

    <p>  The goal of all the pilgrims is the same - to attend a sermon by the rector of this temple.  Father Vladimir participates in conversations and finds answers to the most sacred questions of parishioners.  But, before you go on a trip, you need to know where the city of Bolgar in Russia is located. </p><h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  The ancient city of Bolgar has changed its name many times over its centuries-old history: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  until 1926 it was called Spassk; </li><li>  from 1926 to 1935 the city was called Spassk-Tatar; </li><li>  From 1935 to 1991, the settlement acquired the name Kuybyshev. </li></ul><p>  Thus, we can conclude and assume where the city of Bolgar is located.  It is located in the Republic of Tatarstan.  It is one of the oldest cities in the republic.  It is easy to find by looking at the map in the southwestern part of Tatarstan, namely on the left bank of the beautiful Volga River.  There they founded the city of Bolgar, where the historical and architectural museum-reserve is located.  It‚Äôs not long to go to Kazan, the capital of the republic ‚Äî only 200 km. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Since the Bulgarian has a long history, its guests have something to see.  In general, this city was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.  There is some suggestion that soon this city will be one of the tourist centers of our country.  It is famous for the ancient Settlement of the Bulgar.  On its territory are the remains of a moat and rampart dating from the XIV-XV centuries.  There you will meet the Northern and Eastern Mausoleums, the Black and White Chambers, there is also the Khan's Tomb, as well as the <span>Cathedral Mosque,</span> which has the Small Minaret. </p>

    <p>  The Big Minaret already belongs to the modern era.  There is a Museum of crafts in this wonderful city, a Museum of bread, a mosque called White for Muslims is open.  Access is free for visitors to the source of the holy martyr Abraham of Bulgaria.  Locals consider him their miracle worker.  In honor of the holy martyr, a church has been opened, of which we will talk about now. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Temple feature </h2><p>  As already mentioned above, the church was opened in 1988, on one of the anniversaries of the Baptism of Russia.  Why are so many pilgrims going to this temple?  The thing is that parishioners can participate in Orthodox services that Father Vladimir conducts.  They have the opportunity to become closer to God by participating in the sacraments of confession and communion.  The uniqueness of the temple lies in the fact that in its walls there is a cancer with the relics of the martyr Abraham. </p>

    <p>  In addition, a spiritual treatment is underway in the church under the auspices of Father Vladimir, where the father individually anoints each pilgrim with oil.  Then he holds a <span>prayer by agreement.</span>  But before participating in this process, it is necessary to receive his blessing.  In addition, Father Vladimir holds talks with pilgrims and parishioners.  He answers general church questions, as well as questions of a personal nature.  For him to answer you, you must submit a note.  Kazan land has its own shrine, which crowns the program of the pilgrimage.  Parishioners visit the well of Abraham. </p><h2>  Martyr Abraham </h2><p>  Bulgar Abraham was a simple and modest person.  At the beginning of his life, he was engaged in trade.  He was an unmarried Muslim.  After some time, he converted to Christianity.  At the local bazaar during fairs, he preached about the life of Christ.  Once at one of these sermons a very serious debate ensued, which grew into a conflict.  Opponents of Abraham demanded to abandon the spoken words, as well as renounce the Orthodox faith.  But he was adamant.  Abraham was brutally beaten.  He was executed by a decision of the People‚Äôs Court by quartering.  Merchants from the ruler of Bulgar (the ancient now defunct city) obtained permission to bring the remains of his body to the land of a Christian cemetery. </p>
