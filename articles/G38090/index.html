    <h2>  The beginning of the path, origin </h2><p>  Vladimir’s film debut took place at the age of ten.  He played a schoolboy named Sasha in the popular series “Simple Truths” (1999).  Despite this, the parents were sure that he would not choose an acting path for himself. </p><p>  Guskov Vladimir - the eldest son of the People's Artist of the Russian Federation Alexei Guskov and the performer of the role of Nastasya Filippovna ("Idiot") - Lydia Velezheva.  He was born in 1989, and celebrates his birthday on January 7.  He has a younger brother Dmitry, to whom they predicted the acting path.  But he went to study at VGIK as a producer, and it was Vladimir who decided to continue the family tradition. </p><p>  The young man was fond of karate from childhood and today is the owner of a black belt.  But this only helps to do the main thing - to play on stage and in movies.  In 2005, he became a student at the Schukin School.  The father told him in the same way as his daughter from his first marriage - Natalia: “To do it, if necessary, I will help, and then only by myself!”  Having thought, Natalya refused a career in cinema, and Vladimir Guskov set off to meet his dream. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Upon graduation, in 2009, he was immediately invited to the theater.  Mayakovsky, on the stage of which he still plays. </p>

    <h2>  Creative activity </h2><p>  The fact that he is immediately involved in 10 performances, even plays the role of an outstanding poet (“Mayakovsky goes for sugar”) speaks of the demand for the young artist.  In 2015, he was awarded the MK Prize.  The award for a supporting role, Vladimir Guskov, a theater actor, was awarded for the image of Alexander ("The Last", directed by N. Kobelev).  He convincingly showed the young man who had turned into a mirror image of his father.  Having become an irresponsible person, surrendered to the power of bad habits, his character realized all the parental fears and concerns. </p><p>  In 2009, the actor appeared on the screens in the movie "Autumn Concerns."  This tape and the series “Krapleniy” (2012) is a joint work with the star father.  In total, Guskov Jr. has more than ten film projects.  The most popular among them are Love Network (TV series 2015) and How to Raise a Million (2015), as well as a drama based on the work of D. Shakhov's Confession Zadrota.  Action "Hacking" allows you to believe that the young actor has a great future. </p><h2>  Personal life </h2><p>  Guskov Vladimir - handsome <span>186</span> cm tall - attracts many fans.  But, despite his youth, the young man is married.  He carefully hides his companion from the press.  It is known that in March 2016, the actor became a father.  Little Stefania appeared in his family.  Perhaps in the future she will continue the acting Guskov dynasty. </p>
