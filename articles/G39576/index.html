Lodeynoye Pole is the cradle of Russian shipbuilding.  Here is the famous Petrovsky shipyard and other attractions that deserve the attention of tourists. </p><h2>  From the history of the city </h2><p>  In 1702, on the territory of the present city, on the orders of Peter I, the village of shipbuilders was founded.  In the same year, the Olonets shipyard was opened.  A few months later, the frigate ‚ÄúStandart‚Äù was built here - the first vessel of the Baltic Fleet.  The history of the city and its main attractions are closely connected with the Petrovsky shipyard.  <span>Lodeynoye field</span> is considered the cradle of the Baltic Fleet.  The first Russian squadron in the Baltic was created within the walls of the city shipyard. </p>
