They can be from various materials, for example, glass, stone, porcelain, ceramics and others.  And already connected and fastened together in any sequence, which at first glance does not fit together, these elements turn into mosaics.  Secondly, it was only thanks to imagination and fantasy that the person put everything together, without even knowing at the beginning of the process what the final result would be.  A puzzle is an existing image, divided into separate elements, which are intended for assembly during leisure.  Therefore, do not compare it with the great works of mosaics. </p><h2>  What are puzzles and who invented them? </h2>

    <p>  A puzzle is a puzzle game with a picture, photograph or image of anything, consisting of several pieces having elements of connection from two or more sides.  In the 18th century, a very inventive teacher to teach his students, without any applied material, pasted a geographical map onto a wooden board, and then sawed it into many irregularly shaped parts.  Now, probably, there is no person who would not know what a puzzle is, but then this idea was unusual and liked the students and colleagues of the teacher, and later went beyond the classroom, becoming great fun for the aristocracy and a new trend in art with <span>creating collages.</span>  Time passed, puzzles changed.  Over the course of the 20th century, puzzle has gained tremendous popularity.  The more people were fond of this game, the more difficult and brighter the puzzles appeared. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What are they? </h2>

    <p>  In the modern world, a huge number of games and fun for every taste, intellect and wallet, but the puzzle does not age and keeps up to date, conquering new hearts.  Now everyone has the opportunity to purchase a puzzle game with the image of any picture, landscape, movie character, pet and even family members.  Various materials are used in the manufacture of puzzles - from familiar cardboard with a matte or glossy finish to voluminous figures made of plastic, plexiglass and ceramics.  Colorful pictures can consist of four or six parts, as well as several thousand, with the drawing of the smallest details, which will delight true puzzle players.  Volumetric puzzles are most often easy to assemble, but can vary in size and weight: from light, in the form of soft toys, to massive and heavy, in the form of ceramic decor.  Modern technology helps to expand the existing audience.  Now it is not necessary to think about what to do with the puzzle after assembly, where to store it, because there are online puzzles available with various levels of difficulty.  Magnetic-based puzzles are very popular, which fit perfectly on the outer surface of refrigerators.  They will decorate the interior of any home, recall beautiful moments in life or important dates, and will also become an indispensable assistant in the game and development of the child. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Putting it together with a child </h2>

    <p>  Puzzles for children are just a godsend for any parent.  Such an assiduous, calm, focused and enthusiastic child may not be in many cases, but collecting particles into one large and interesting picture is one of them.  You can collect puzzles with children from an early age, this will help to develop the baby's motor skills and concentration, and the adult will be a little distracted from everyday troubles.  This is the best way to spend an exciting time at home with your child.  You can start collecting puzzles with simple images of animals or objects, studying their names together, and most importantly, the elements will not be dangerous, since they are quite large.  At an older age, puzzles develop a child‚Äôs intelligence and his <span>creative abilities.</span>  Having assembled the picture yourself, the baby will want to save it, which can be done together by filling out a frame under glass or gluing it on a sheet of cardboard. </p><h2>  How not to miscalculate when choosing? </h2>

    <p>  The puzzle is an interesting and original gift for a child and an adult.  When choosing a puzzle game, it is necessary to take into account the age and hobbies of the person to whom this gift is intended.  For young children, puzzles depicting favorite characters with no more than 35 elements are best suited. For older children, you can choose a game with a lot of pieces, but for true puzzle pieces puzzles with 3,000 or more elements are suitable.  The classic <span>look of the puzzle</span> is an image of geographical maps or reproductions of famous paintings, but now panels with velor or luminous coverings are gaining popularity, as well as voluminous puzzles in the form of globes, famous buildings and soft toys.  If you are at a loss with the choice of a gift, then remember the puzzle.  This is a game from which they do not grow. </p>
