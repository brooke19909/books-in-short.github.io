This village has an ancient history.  Sometimes Bochum can be called the heart of the Ruhr, because it is located in the central part of this area, which is known throughout the world by the coal industry.  So, what should a tourist see in Bochum, and what places are worth visiting?  Read about it later. </p><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  Weather conditions in Bochum are generally stable and rarely subject to change.  As for the climate, it can be called mild due to not very hot summers and moderately rainy autumn.  In winter, there are not often severe frosts, and, in principle, this season is not long, it is replaced by a warm spring season.  However, at this time of year, the cold sometimes returns, which may cause some disappointment after the first sunlight.  April and May can be called practically in the summer, because during these months the corresponding temperature is felt.  That is why most of the excursions take place during this period.  Bochum (Germany) is located in an area that is usually classified as a temperate continental climate. </p><h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The city of Bochum (Germany) can indeed be considered one of the oldest in the country, since it was first mentioned at the end of the 9th century.  Its historical path has been going on for more than a thousand years.  Bochum was erected in a place where trade routes intersect, which were located there in ancient times.  According to scientists, 1517 was a difficult time for Europe, when there were terrible fires that affected this city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Then a large amount of time passed while Bochum recovered, in parallel with which coal deposits were developed.  Already at the beginning of the 19th century, during the Napoleonic occupation, the city was considered central in the Westphalian region of Prussia. </p><p>  German residents of the eastern regions came to these places, who, due to their plight, were in search of work.  Due to these circumstances, the city gradually expanded, which was facilitated by the constant development of coal deposits, which Bochum (Germany) is known for.  The university, which was called Ruhr, was opened here in the 60s of the last century.  This is an important educational institution that is known throughout the country. </p>

    <p>  Today, coal is not being developed in the city, and industrial enterprises for the production of steel do not work.  In general, factories are transferred to other, far corners of the country.  Bochum is systematically being mastered by other companies that are actively establishing enterprises in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sights of Bochum </h2><p>  The main tourist attraction is considered to be the building of the Industrial Museum of Westphalia.  However, his expositions, despite the name, tell not only about the history and activities of enterprises, but also about Bochum as a whole, its development.  The territory of the museum complex includes eight industrial facilities, among which one was fully turned into a museum. </p><p>  There are many churches in the region that Germany is famous for - Bochum also has its own famous religious buildings.  So, in the city there is a temple of Saints Peter and Paul, which was erected according to the orders of the Emperor Charlemagne.  There is a bell on the church, which today is a bit of a main landmark in Bochum.  The territory of the Ruhr Botanical Garden is also considered one of the tourist places in the city where you can see plants native to different parts of the world. </p>
