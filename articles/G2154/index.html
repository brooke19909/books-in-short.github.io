  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crochet hats for girls ... What are they?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Lovely Mommies!  Your daughter is growing up, is she already interested in beautiful dresses?  Do you want your little princess to look magnificent, attracting eyes with a unique style of clothing from childhood?  Then I would like to invite you to create her image for her myself, and one of his irreplaceable accessories will be a crocheted hat.  Of course, not the one that can be purchased at any clothing market or children's clothing store, because the prankster will be upset when she sees the same hat on the head of her girlfriend.  It‚Äôs best to tie a <span>gift to your daughter</span> herself.  For many centuries, our mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers honed their skills, creating interesting models, skillfully combining simplicity and a sense of taste, style and grace. </p><p>  What kind of <span>crochet hats</span> can be for girls?  The choice is huge!  Light fishnet hats, mischievous caps, warm winter bonnets, flirty hats, bold helmets, and much more!  Eyes run up at the sight of such interesting and stylish models, I want to take up every one immediately, presenting the joy of my beloved daughter.  Take your time, cool down a bit.  If, of course, you have not mastered the art of crocheting for more than a year, then, of course, you can safely get to work, you do not need any knitting patterns, or even photographs of models - your imagination and experience will help to create a unique thing that will amaze your character and splendor.  But if you are new to knitting or have always knitted only on knitting needles?  It is worth soberly assessing your capabilities.  <span>Crocheting a hat</span> for girls is a very interesting process, but slow and laborious, by the way, it is much more difficult than knitting a hat on knitting needles.  It‚Äôs not worth hoping that the very first time, barely taking the hook in your hands, you can create something amazing.  For starters, you should open any magazine on crocheting and remember (or learn) the basics of knitting and the simplest loops.  The main elements of such knitting are an air loop, a crochet, a <span>connecting column.</span>  Columns are with and without yarn, simple and embossed.  In each magazine devoted to knitting, you will find not only a verbal description of each element, but also photographs, and understandable patterns.  Before knitting something specific, be sure to practice, make a few test samples of each element, do not spare your time for this.  The faster you learn (or remember) the basics of knitting, the more fun and easier it will be for you to do your job.  When all the elements begin to turn out jokingly, choose for the first time the most simple crochet hats for girls.  Do not think that the simpler the knitting pattern, the more boring and poorer your product will be, it‚Äôs not at all!  From some air loops connected by simple columns, you can get a great hat that adorns the head of a little fashionista.  Complex crochet hats for girls require a lot of time, and very often the result disappoints beginner needlewomen who have put all their energy into this work.  Therefore, my advice to you is, do not chase multi-page schemes resembling nuclear warhead drawings, better knit five colorful colored caps.  Firstly, your daughter will be very pleased that she can wear a new hat every new day of the week, and secondly, when the last, fifth hat is ready, you will suddenly be surprised to find that crocheting hats for children is simple, quick and fascinatingly.  Then it‚Äôs worth opening a page with a more complicated model and mastering new elements.  You may also want to knit scarves, gloves or mitts for these hats, or maybe even a stylish poncho.  I wish you success, because you should never stop at what has been achieved! </p>
