It often happens that a smartphone starts to fail unreasonably.  Or it happens that, when setting up the device, actions were taken that worsen its operation.  For such cases, there is a function for resetting to factory settings.  This will be discussed in our article.  All features and methods will be discussed in detail below. </p><h2>  Reset settings via the smartphone’s main menu </h2><p>  How to reset all settings on Android to factory settings?  There are three ways to do this.  Let's look at the first one. </p><p>  In order to reset the smartphone to factory settings based on the Android OS, you need to go to “Settings”, select the “Privacy” section there and click on “Reset Settings”.  Next, select one of the items - “Data Archiving” or “Auto Recovery”. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.apeaksoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset all settings on a smartphone" class="if uuid-2958333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958333.jpg"></div><p>  These items are necessary so that you can cancel the restore and return the settings of the smartphone before resetting the settings. </p><p>  Next, click "Reset Data."  This will lose some data.  For example, a Google account, as well as all installed applications and games will be deleted. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All that will be lost from the smartphone when resetting the settings is indicated in the notification before this event.  After reading the information provided, you must confirm the selected action and wait for the end of this procedure. </p><h2>  Service code </h2><p>  How to reset everything to factory settings using a service code?  About the second method later in the article. </p><p>  On each device with the Android operating system, there are a number of service codes for various purposes.  One of these codes is used to reset the data of the smartphone to the factory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hard reset" class="if uuid-2958322" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958322.jpg"></div><p>  In order to perform a hard reset, you need to do the following: </p><ol><li>  Go to dialing. </li><li>  Enter the code necessary to reset. </li><li>  Click on the call. </li><li>  Wait for the reset procedure to complete. </li></ol><p>  Each phone model and version of the Android system has its own reset code. </p><div class="photo" data-original="drfone.wondershare.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset all settings" class="if uuid-2958324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958324.jpg"></div><p>  Code entry examples: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  * # * # 7378423 # * # *; </li><li>  * 2767 * 3855 #; </li><li>  * # * # 7780 # * #. </li></ul><h2>  Use Recovery (Reset with special keys) </h2><p>  How to reset all settings?  Each phone has its own combination of special keys. </p><p>  The following combinations are possible on Android: </p><ol><li>  "Volume down" + "Turn on the device."  This is one of the most common combinations used on many phones.  Try it first.  If this does not work, then see the list further.  The combinations below may help. </li><li>  “Volume up” + “Volume down”. </li><li>  “Turn on the device” + “Home” button + “Volume up”. </li><li>  “Volume up” + “Volume down” + “Turn on the device”. </li><li>  "Volume up" + "Home" button. </li></ol><p>  These are standard button combinations for resetting smartphones on Android.  If none of them worked, see the instructions for your phone model.  They must be held for several (2-5) seconds. </p><p>  After pressing these keys, the system menu (Recovery) will open.  Using the "+" and "-" buttons (increase and decrease the sound), you need to find the line that says: wipe data / factory reset, Clear eMMC or Clear Flash.  Select it, click on the "Home" button.  Select Reboot System.  After that, all settings will be reset to the factory settings. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidphonesoft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset everything to factory settings" class="if uuid-2958319" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958319.jpg"></div><h2>  Returning to the factory settings on the iPhone </h2><p>  <span>How to reset iPhone to factory settings?</span>  On Apple devices, you must use the Reset function.  You will need to go to the "Settings" - "General" section and select the "Reset" item. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset all settings from the phone" class="if uuid-2958323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958323.jpg"></div><p>  Now let's analyze what is in this section: </p><ol><li>  "Reset all settings."  This function is very convenient for those who want to delete all entered settings from the start of using an iPhone, without losing any other information.  By choosing this option, all installed settings will be reset on the device.  They will be reduced to factory.  That is, to those that were installed upon the acquisition of the iPhone.  In this case, your personal data will not be affected, as well as all media files created up to this point (photos, videos, music, etc.).  It is selected when unwanted settings were entered, and it is possible to return everything back as it was. </li><li>  Erase content and settings.  This type of reset is applied when the iPhone is put up for sale, or given to someone for a short time.  After “Erase content and settings” was selected, all personal data and media files will disappear on the “iPhone”, and the settings will be returned to the factory form.  After clicking on “Erase content and settings”, a warning will be displayed and that all data from the “iPhone” will be erased.  Confirm the reset (“Erase iPhone”), after which your device will automatically reboot. This is a very simple tool for those who want to get rid of all the data on the smartphone at once. It will take about five to ten minutes. After rebooting, the screen appears a request to enter user account information. To do this, you will need an Internet connection. After that, you need to enter the initial settings at your discretion. </li></ol><h2>  Reset Network Settings </h2><p>  This type of reset is necessary when the iPhone does not catch the network, the Internet or wi-fi.  You can pull-insert a sim card.  But on the "iPhones" this requires a special clip.  Therefore, it is easier to use “Reset Network Settings”.  In this way, in most cases, problems with mobile network, Internet or Wi-Fi connections are solved. </p><h2>  If the password is forgotten ... </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.imend.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset all settings if you forgot your password" class="if uuid-2958327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958327.jpg"></div><p>  If you forgot your password, how to reset all phone settings?  Now we will understand this issue.  Many smartphone users put individual passwords on their gadgets.  This greatly helps in protecting the phone from other people.  However, it happens that this password has been forgotten and the phone is locked.  To avoid entering this password, you must turn off the phone in emergency mode and immediately turn on the settings section when turning on, without waiting for a lock or a request to enter a password. </p><p>  Next, you need to reset all phone settings and restart the phone.  Password will be reset automatically.  Regardless of what kind of smartphone you have, each can be reset as necessary.  Using this function, you can reset the phone type settings (Samsung, iPhone, Lenovo and others). </p><p>  For some, a password may be required.  In most cases, it is standard - 0000. If this password does not work and an error is entered in entering it, then you need to contact the phone’s manual or the service to reset the settings. </p><p>  It so happens that the wrong actions were taken with an independent attempt to reset all the settings of the smartphone to factory settings.  In this case, you need to contact the smartphone repair service of your model (iPhone, Samsung, Lenovo, etc.). </p><p>  It will cost some amount of money.  But the reset will be performed reliably and without errors. </p><h2>  Important information! </h2><div class="photo" data-original="techpointmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to reset all settings on samsung" class="if uuid-2958329" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2958329.jpg"></div><p>  When wondering how to reset all settings, remember: absolutely all the information on your smartphone will be reset. </p><p>  In this case, it will be deleted: saved phone user accounts, multimedia files.  They will also be permanently deleted: photos, videos, music, etc. (personal information, messages, contacts, dialed numbers, time zone, location and other user data entered). </p><p>  In order to reset to factory settings and not lose all this data, a backup copy of the account is created.  Information about the account and all files stored on it get into it. </p><p>  This is necessary when the reset must be canceled, or return everything as it was before the operation. </p><p>  For example, this action may be performed by mistake.  Then at any time you can return everything to its place and restore the account with all the lost data. </p><h2>  User Tips </h2><p>  A backup is done before resetting.  Otherwise, when restoring the account, the last backup will be used, which can be done for a long time and it may not contain many files, records and other necessary information. </p><p>  In this situation, unrecovered data is lost.  And in order to return them, you will need to contact the service center, where with the help of additional software you will recover all the lost information. </p><p>  In addition to all this, installed applications will be deleted, among which may be purchased.  In this case, to return them and reinstall, you will have to pay again for the purchase of this program. </p><h2>  Little conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to reset all settings to Samsung or another device that runs on the Android operating system.  We examined different ways, gave valuable advice.  We hope that our recommendations in resetting you will help. </p>
