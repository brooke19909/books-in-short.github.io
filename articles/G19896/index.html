    <h2>  3 and 4 star hotels </h2><p>  I would not want our readers to get the impression that the best hotels in Thailand are 5-star exclusively.  Hotels below the rank differ only in the absence of luxury.  These are middle class hotels.  Their rating is slightly lower, but they provide the highest level of service, comfortable accommodation, which can satisfy the requirements of the most fastidious tourists. </p><h2>  Eastin Easy Patong Phuket </h2><p>  This hotel was appreciated by everyone who comes to the country not only for leisure, but also for business purposes.  In addition to the necessary furniture, household appliances, the rooms include a work desk with a computer and a daily fresh press.  The cozy rooms are cleaned daily.  We want to warn you that this is a non-smoking hotel, so if you have not yet got rid of a bad habit, you need to consider another option. </p><h2>  The best Thailand hotels in Pattaya </h2><p>  And now we offer to move to the youth resort of Thailand.  In Pattaya there are almost a thousand hotels of different levels of comfort and price category.  Most of them are located along the coast and have their own beaches. </p><h2>  Garden cliff resort </h2><p>  A luxurious 5 * full-board hotel where families with children can stay.  Those who wish can hold a wedding ceremony here.  Magnificent rooms equipped with the most modern appliances and comfortable functional furniture, have a good rest. </p><p>  Vacationers can use the fitness center, indoor and outdoor pools, and restaurants serving traditional Thai cuisine. </p>

The cleanest private beaches, amazing sea views attract here lovers of solitude, peace and silence.  Well-off tourists mostly rest on the island, because the comfort of the local hotels is amazing, and the cost of living in them is not available to everyone. </p><h2>  Banyan tree samui </h2><p>  The luxury hotel consists of detached landscaped villas.  Each of them has its own pool, dining room, living room and garden.  The cozy rooms are furnished with magnificent wooden furniture.
