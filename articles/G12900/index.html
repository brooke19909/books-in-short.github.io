Dominican Republic, Boca Chica</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Dominican Republic is a sunny country, which pleases tourists with picturesque beaches, always sunny weather, interesting culture and unhurried pace of life.  Naturally, many travelers choose this country for their holidays.  In resort towns there are many hotels of different sizes and categories.  One of them is Hotel 3 * Bellevue Dominican Bay.  Reviews of tourists about him are very positive, because this hotel can offer its customers a lot of entertainment along with sincere hospitality and excellent service. </p><h2>  Where is the hotel complex located? </h2><p>  Of course, first of all, people who are going on a trip are interested in the question of exactly where the Bellevue Dominican Bay 3 * hotel is located.  Boca Chica is a cozy resort town on the sea coast, which consists almost entirely of hotels, cottages and guest houses.  According to reviews, this is a real paradise for tourists - picturesque streets, a relaxed atmosphere, a sufficient number of entertainment and shopping complexes and, of course, picturesque beaches.  By the way, the hotel is located on the third coastline.  Las Americas Airport, which, incidentally, is mostly used by tourists, is 15 km away.  Do not worry about distances if the Dominican Republic becomes your temporary home.  Vouchers already include a transfer to the hotel. </p><p>  Another good news is the distance to the vibrant city of Santo Domingo is only 30 km.  This distance is easily overcome by public transport or by a rented car. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does the hotel look like? </h2>

    <p>  What conditions for a beach holiday does the Bellevue Dominican Bay 3 * hotel offer?  Boca Chica is a town located on the seashore, and therefore there are really many beaches here.  By the way, the hotel itself does not own a private section of the coast.  Nevertheless, the nearest public beach is about 300 meters away - a convenient road leads to it.  According to reviews, the coast is clean, the water is warm and calm, and the entrance to the sea is convenient, because the bottom is covered with soft sand.  As for the sun loungers and umbrellas, they are, of course, available, but you can rent them for a fee, albeit a small one. </p><p>  If simple swimming and sunbathing do not appeal to you, then there is the opportunity to do water sports, for example, do parasailing, go skiing and banana.  There are excellent conditions for windsurfing on the coast - you can even hire an instructor if necessary.  There are also <span>scuba diving</span> courses <span>,</span> because nearby the underwater world is bright and incredibly diverse. </p><h2>  Additional services offered by the hotel </h2>
