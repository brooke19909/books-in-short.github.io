At the same time, looking at its super-modern look, not many people realize that the history of this arena for horse racing has more than 130 years. </p><h2>  Hippodrome "Akbuzat": history </h2><p>  It all began in 1883, when it was decided to establish a random stable with a hippodrome in Ufa.  By the beginning of the 20th century, the Ufa arena for horse racing was already considered one of the best in the country, and in 1924 a new building was built for it.  For many years, the hippodrome was used to test trotting horses and was known far beyond the borders of the republic.  In honor of the 425th anniversary of the voluntary accession of the Bashkirs to Russia in 1982, a new arena was built in Ufa and it was called ‚ÄúAkbuzat‚Äù - in honor of the winged horse from the epic of the Bashkir and Tatar peoples.  This stadium has repeatedly become the venue for competitions of riders, including international ones, and 7 times has been recognized as the best hippodrome of the USSR, and later Russia. </p><h2>  Reconstruction </h2><p>  The Akbuzat Hippodrome in Ufa was subjected to a radical reconstruction in 2007.  The project of the new appearance of the structure was developed by the Japanese company RAUM Architects, and the work on its implementation was entrusted to the company Bashkortostanneftezavodstroy.  The reconstruction of the hippodrome was timed to coincide with the 450th anniversary of the entry of Bashkortostan into the Russian Empire.  In honor of the opening of the renovated arena, 16 All-Russian Equestrian Competitions were organized there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Arena Description </h2><p>  The reconstructed hippodrome ‚ÄúAkbuzat‚Äù has become universal and more spacious.  Now it is possible to conduct races not only of trotters, but also of pedigree riding horses, as well as organize competitions in all Olympic <span>types of equestrian sports</span> and spectacular races.  For the first time in world practice, a unified drainage system has been introduced at the Ufa race track throughout the arena.  The racetrack and race tracks, competitive and dressage fields are fenced by the innovative plastic material made by the French company Fornells.  In addition, all-weather soil from Vistex has been laid out in the arena. </p>
