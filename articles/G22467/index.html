Perhaps every adult, having read these lines, will remember his childhood and will feel a little sad. </p><p>  But, after all, even now in adulthood everyone can join the world of fairy tales and magic, creating toys and dolls with their own hands.  After all, making a doll allows you to put your soul into it, to show your inner world. </p><p>  Hand-made dolls are now used most often not for playing, but for contemplation and decoration.  They will become an original gift, an interesting decoration for the interior, replenish someone‚Äôs collection, act as a talisman or amulet.  Most often, dolls created from bast, vines, straw and the like natural materials become the talisman.  At the same time, in the manufacture of such dolls, compliance with folk traditions and technologies is mandatory. </p><p>  DIY dolls can be inexpensive, and expensive, it all depends on the cost of the material and the originality of the idea by which the doll is created.  Unusual special dolls are considered copyrighted, and most often are fabulously expensive.  Such dolls may be the purest fantasy of the author, but may also have the features of a particular person, then they are called portrait. </p><p>  Portrait dolls are made to order.  Work on such dolls requires a lot of experience and special education.  But, and in this regard, portrait dolls are many times more expensive than ordinary. </p><p>  You can make a doll with your own hands from many materials.  For this, there are special materials based on plastic, someone uses porcelain, and many people really like how dolls made of fabric do it yourself. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you want to learn how to make textile dolls, you can simply purchase books describing the creation of dolls from fabric, you can attend a workshop or resemble courses.  On them you will not only learn how to make dolls, make jewelry and various accessories for them, but also get acquainted with the history of their occurrence. </p><p>  Fabric is a universal material that allows you to create a lot of feelings: love, hate, irony and romance.  Dolls made from textiles are so homely and cute, where there are rag dolls, warmth and coziness will always be preserved.  And if such dolls are made with their own hands, this will make them practically living members of the family. </p><p>  If there are children in the house, then any mother will be able to please them by making a doll-glove, and preferably a whole set of such dolls, that is, a fairy tale-glove.  Mom can come up with something herself or go to the Internet, where in order to make dolls with her own hands there are always patterns!  Such a doll consists of only two parts: the front and back, which are sewn along the edge and turned out.  Then the doll is painted, embroidered or decorated with applique, the head is slightly stuffed with suitable material for this.  You can create individual heroes, and then invent fairy tales yourself or play scenes from existing works: "Masha and the Bear", "Gingerbread Man" and much more. </p><p>  There is also the so-called Waldorf doll - the basis of which is a traditional <span>textile doll.</span>  A soft toy that repeats the image of a person, while maintaining all the proportions of his body.  There is no definite mood on the doll‚Äôs face, which allows the baby to think it out himself during the game.  The stuffing of the doll is natural sheep‚Äôs <span>wool, the fabric</span> of which the doll is made is <span>flesh-colored</span> cotton <span>.</span>  Doll clothes should also be made from natural materials. </p><p>  You can always turn the process of creating a new doll into a game with your baby.  And the cute DIY dolls created by him will become his best friends! </p>
