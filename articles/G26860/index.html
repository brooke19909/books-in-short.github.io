A watch is an indispensable element in the image of any person, but in the era of technical and electronic technologies this can sometimes be insufficient.  Today gadgets are gaining immense popularity, and therefore the technologists of the leading countries in this area decided to make a breakthrough.  Today, they were able to combine gadgets with watches and present to the public a completely new product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart watch ‚ÄúSamsung‚Äù" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1075523.jpg" width="600"></div>  Quite a lot of companies went this way and found themselves in this area.  But which smartwatch to choose?  Samsung is a company that presents its customers a large selection of these products.  But what is the feature of the produced models?  What are their benefits?

    <h2>  Smart watch ‚ÄúSamsung Gear‚Äù is a technological breakthrough! </h2><p>  What is this product?  This device, made in the form of a watch, works through the Android operating system.  According to the owners of this product themselves, this is a kind of fun accessory with interesting innovations.  But what are the characteristics of the first smartwatch? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Samsung was able to increase its position in the overall ranking precisely thanks to the first released devices of this type.  They were an accessory made in the form of a watch, but instead of the usual dial, a 1.63-inch display appeared.  The screen resolution was 320 √ó 320 pixels 277 PPI.  The size was 3 x 3 cm. The device has a RAM of 512 MB, equipped with 4 GB of flash memory.  Equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 system and 1.9 MP camera.  The structure of the first model has an accelerometer and a gyroscope.  Some audio and video formats are supported: ARM Mali-400 MP4 Graphic-Processor.  And finally, the device lasts only 25 hours (315 mAh). </p><h2>  New models </h2><p>  But the development of this industry did not end there, because it was smart watches that were very popular.  Samsung decided not to stop there and went on to develop a second and third model.  The first copies were innovative, they were paid attention to at all exhibitions, but the second copies released by the brand did not find such popularity.  There were no worthy changes in them that could be called attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Smart Watch" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1075522.jpg" width="543"></div>  Probably, this influenced what the technologists did not think for a long time and soon introduced a new smart watch.  Samsung Gear 3 has incorporated a lot of new things.

Now you can use such a watch without a smartphone.  The next noticeable detail is the curved screen.  It looks futuristic and minimalistic.  Touch screen 2.0 ‚Ä≥ Super AMOLED, 360 √ó 480, 300 ppi.  There is a microphone and speaker, equipped with a heart rate sensor, gyroscope and accelerometer.  The device is lightweight, the weight without a strap is 35 g. There is a lithium-ion battery 300 mAh, all the same Tizen OS remains.  The main characteristics also include Bluetooth 4.1 LE, the availability of RAM (as in previous models) 512 MB, internal - 4 GB. </p><h2>  Consider the details </h2><p>  The technical specifications presented by the company, when compared with a real object, often change their position.  So, for example, the display here is out of competition.  Almost ideal screen settings have a smart watch.  Samsung tried to do everything not only neatly, but also beautifully.  The curved screen looks stylish, looks modern, but a couple of minuses should be said about the practical side. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart watch Samsung Galaxy" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1075525.jpg" width="600"></div>  When you look at your smartphone, you don‚Äôt feel any discomfort: everything that is displayed on the screen is clearly visible, here you need to get used to the new vision of the screen.  The smart watch ‚ÄúSamsung Gear S‚Äù has a well-thought-out design.  The price of this model varies between 15-17 thousand rubles.

    <h2>  Innovate the road! </h2><p>  Naturally, this is not the only smart watch.  Samsung Galaxy launches a number of other models that differ in color combinations and materials. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smart watch samsung reviews" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1075524.jpg" width="600"></div>  In this regard, the Samsung Gear S model is in perfect condition. There is a docking nozzle that is designed to charge the device.  It is inserted from the inside so that the contacts of the nozzle coincide with the contacts of the gadget.  It is tightly fixed on the inside of the watch and emits a soft click.  In this case, you can charge by any charge from your smartphone.  This has a huge advantage.  The only negative that consumers noticed is a more massive docking nozzle.  On the whole, the appearance evokes positive emotions, because its main concept is that a smartphone is wrapped around the wrist.  Such a futuristic design appealed to many, although such a watch looks very voluminous.  But that is why they are noticeable in any image.

    <p>  They have a <span>silicone strap</span> Samsung smart watch.  Reviews note that such material does not cause allergies to the skin and, most importantly, does not rub. </p><h2>  Smartwatch functionality </h2><p>  Many people wonder why such a device is needed at all.  The main and unique feature of this product is that it is used as a smartphone.  These watches have a SIM card slot, which means you can make calls, write messages, and so on.  In general, you can do with such a device everything that we are used to doing daily with our smartphone.  This model, namely Samsung Gear S, is a stand-alone device and does not require any smartphone to be connected to it (as was the case with the previously presented smart watches).  As the developers suggest, a person will be able to use a watch instead of a smartphone.  If we consider situations when it is really necessary, then a run comes to mind. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Smart Watch Gear 3" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1075526.jpg" width="571"></div>  If a person expects an important call, but doesn‚Äôt pick up the phone, then it‚Äôs very logical to insert a SIM card into the watch, which will allow you to contact the right person at any time.  The rest of the scenarios look exotic.  But there is another option: you can forward the call from this device to your smartphone.

    <h2>  The interface is interesting! </h2><p>  What else can you see in the smart watches of the latest series?  The interface is another detail worthy of attention.  When turned on, the first thing that appears on the display is the dial.  You can choose from 13 different design options.  The device menu appears after swiping with a touch from top to bottom.  There are 16 applications that are fairly easy to use.  All settings that can be observed in the smartphone are easy to manage.  You can also adjust brightness, themes, and so on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung smart watch Gear S price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35215/1075527.jpg" width="489"></div>

    <p>  In general, these smart watches are really good in all of their technical characteristics.  If we talk about the practicality of things, today it is difficult to replace a smartphone with something.  This device is at hand for every person at any time, and while the watch is not able to fully replace it, even such smart and modern ones. </p>
