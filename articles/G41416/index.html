The definition of this term, although it has a strictly historical justification - they call it a series of anti-government protests in France in the mid-17th century - is nevertheless ironic and mocking.  Events have shown that all the main characters of those long-standing events turned out to be hypocrites, who in words advocated for the well-being of the country and its people, but in fact pursued only their own selfish interests. </p>

    <h2>  A little tour of linguistics </h2><p>  Let us linger a little more on the very word "front".  This is nothing but the Russian-language pronunciation of French - Fronde, which means "sling".  Once upon a time, it was the name of a popular children's game that belongs to the category of empty and frivolous fun.  For the reasons stated above, it is customary to use it in relation to people, in words, showing dissatisfaction with the authorities, but not able to decide on any specific actions. </p><h2>  France mid-17th century </h2><p>  Events that gave impetus to the emergence of this term began to unfold in France since the twenties of the XVII century.  By this time, most of the country's population, which was made up of peasants, was actually ravaged by wars, exorbitant taxes and looting both from the side of their army and a number of enemy hordes.  This was the reason for social tension, resulting in open riots. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  According to the established tradition, the front is the term used to denote the speeches of representatives of the highest French aristocracy, who tried to use popular discontent for their personal purposes.  At that time, under Louis XIV, the government of the state was carried out by his mother, <span>Queen Regent Anna of</span> Austria and First Minister Cardinal Mazarin.  Their policies displeased not only the masses, but also the court elite.  The result was an opposition led by parliament. </p><h2>  Scattered performances of the masses </h2><p>  The confrontation of representatives of the upper layers of power was preceded by popular uprisings.  And although rebellion is often meaningless and merciless, regardless of whether it breaks out in the Orenburg steppes or under the windows of Versailles, in this case the queen and cardinal were lucky - the matter was limited only to the construction of barricades, and there was no bloodshed.  But Anna of Austria suffered fear and made concessions to the rebels and parliament. </p>

    <p>  A new turn of events was taken when in 1648 Prince Conde, a recognized hero of the <span>thirty-year war</span> that had just ended, stood on the side of the queen <span>.</span>  This desperate adventurer and venal warrior surrounded Paris with his troops, which provoked a new outbreak of discontent among the masses, who, in alliance with a whole group of aristocrats, took to the streets again. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Court wrestling and the continuation of unrest </h2><p>  The Fronde is just what formed as a result of such a striking mesalliance - the union of the poor people and the satiated rich.  If the former in their anti-government slogans were sincere, the latter tried to extract only personal benefit from what was happening.  This was well understood by the main initiators of the unrest - members of parliament.  Not hoping for the help of the aristocracy, they hastened to conclude a peace treaty with the queen, and this all temporarily subsided. </p><p>  But a lasting peace in the country did not work.  The same prince Conde broke the calm.  As it turned out, he was consumed with exorbitant envy of Mazarin and the desire to impose on the Queen Regent the adoption of political decisions pleasing to him personally.  Not possessing the ability to conduct subtle court intrigue, he set up a courtyard against himself with his rude antics and ended up in prison. </p>

    <h2>  The commander in the cassock </h2><p>  While the glamorous troublemaker sat in the cell of Vincent Castle, a new rebellion broke out in the country, this time organized by his own sister, along with the Duke Laroshfuko and a group of aristocrats who hated the cardinal.  The main danger to the court was that Princess Conde and her friends, neglecting national interests, attracted the Spaniards, the traditional enemies of France, as their allies.  It was not without reason that the opinion was firmly established that the front is primarily a struggle of personal interests. </p><p>  The cardinal had to leave the Mass at <span>the Notre Dame Cathedral</span> for a while and set off at the head of the army to pacify the rebellious areas.  He was successful, and soon the main part of the rebels laid down their arms.  Bordeaux resisted the government forces the longest, but his defenders surrendered in July 1650.  It should be noted that Mazarini, despite the fact that he was the face of high dignity, knew perfectly well military affairs.  Pacifying the rebels, he quickly and competently stopped the advance of the Spaniards who were moving to their aid. </p>

    <h2>  Freedom and betrayal of Prince Conde </h2><p>  However, after the defeat of the rebels, the front in France did not give up - Mazarin had too many enemies in Paris itself.  The aristocrats who hated him and were rushing to power entered into a conspiracy with the parliament, which had been paused for a while, and created a coalition that demanded that the queen remove Mazarin from power and release Prince Conde from prison.  Encouraged by the confusion of Anna of Austria, the frontiers tried to declare not her, but Prince of Orleans, the ruler of the young king Louis XIV. </p><p>  The first two requirements were met, and Prince Conde was released from prison.  Finding himself at large, he, contrary to the expectations of his former like-minded people, flattered the generous promises of the queen and joined her camp.  However, he soon found out that the promise of wealth was only an empty phrase, found himself deceived and instantly crossed over to the frontiers.  Oddly enough, his former friends gladly accepted it - apparently, venality in them was considered quite normal. </p><h2>  War hated by the people </h2><p>  By this time, the situation in the country was very serious, and the Queen's security was threatened by a real threat.  In many cities, a rebellion began, provoked by Prince Conde and his entourage, and from the south another Spaniard offensive began.  Events could take a very nasty turn, but Cardinal Mazarini saved the situation. </p>

    <p>  Shortly before this, under pressure from parliament, demanding his resignation, he left France.  And now, at the most critical moment, appeared again, but not alone, but accompanied by a powerful detachment of mercenaries whom he recruited in Germany.  It should be noted that he managed in time, as Prince Conde with his troops had already entered Paris. </p><p>  Desperate clashes began on the streets of the French capital and at the city gates.  A curious detail - historical documents indicate that the common people in this case adhered to neutrality, with the same hostility towards both sides of the conflict.  Everyone was already tired of the endless hostility, which was so old that the causes that gave rise to it were no longer relevant.  The frond lost the support of the masses and grew into a struggle for power within the state elite. </p><h2>  The end of the political game </h2><p>  The actions of the regent queen ended.  She temporarily removed the cardinal so annoying the opposition from the capital and announced her readiness to give in to the demands of parliament.  This was another political maneuver, but with its help <span>Anna of Austria</span> attracted former aristocratic opponents to her side.  All of them received honorable and warm places in the government.  Conde was left alone and soon committed another betrayal, joining the Spanish army. </p>

    <p>  This ended the infamous frond.  Summarizing what happened briefly, we can confidently say that, starting as an outbreak of mass social protest, this process was drowned in the egoistic struggle for power of the highest dignitaries of the state.  Despite the magnitude of the events, everything that happened in France between 1648 and 1653 was determined by the personal interests of a limited circle of people.  That is why it is generally accepted that the frond is a kind of empty game of politicians saturated with wealth and power. </p>
