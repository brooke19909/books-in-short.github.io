  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The social dynamics and statics of Auguste Comte</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The concept of social dynamics and statics was developed by O. Comte in the theory of <span>social progress,</span> the basis of which, according to its author, should be the history of the human spirit.  Social dynamics is the sphere of studying the laws of <span>evolution of social</span> forms, the successive change of systems and structures, determined by natural, climatic factors, economic conditions and spiritual and moral efforts of subjects of human activity. </p><p>  To social statics, O. Comte attributed social order and stable social systems and structures, localized in time and space, held together by a sense of solidarity, a social contract, common interests, moral, legal, ideological and political norms.  O. Comte believed that such structures include family, social group, class, organization, nation, state. </p><p>  Social dynamics should lead to progress in the development of society.  Comte identified primary and secondary factors that influence social progress.  The primary Comte considered spiritual, mental development.  Secondary factors, he considered race, climate, population growth, average life expectancy. </p><p>  The action of the secondary, according to O. Comt, only slows down or accelerates the progress of society, which must be made according to certain laws and its stages cannot be changed.  Comte shared progress in certain areas: material, in which there is an external improvement in life;  physical, in which there should be an improvement in human nature;  intellectual, where intelligence develops and the transition from a religious worldview to a scientific one develops;  moral, in which there is a development of a sense of collectivity.  O. Comte attached significant importance to the intellectual and moral spheres.  Social dynamics implies the operation of the law of three stages, which suggests that the 3 stages of the development of human thinking are similar to the three stages of the development of history. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first is theological, it is determined by the period of antiquity and the <span>early Middle Ages</span> until about 1300.  A. Comte divides this stage into fetishism, polytheism and monotheism.  In the first period of the development of history (fetishism), people can attribute life to surrounding objects and see gods in them.  Under polytheism, which was widespread in ancient Greece and Rome, certain beings were deified, whose intervention explained to the people of that time many phenomena.  The period of monotheism is associated with the emergence and development of Christianity. </p><p>  The metaphysical stage (from about 1300 to 1800) was considered by Comte as a transitional one, characterized by the destruction of old beliefs - the fundamental foundation of public order.  The most important events of this era (Reformation, <span>Enlightenment philosophy, French</span> Revolution) are accompanied by the spread of negative critical philosophy, which led to the decline of authority.  The metaphysical spirit of that era gave rise to doubt, moral depravity and political cataclysms. </p><p>  A society in a state of anarchy needs a new ideology that could play an integrative role.  To create such an ideology, Comte believed, is a very real task.  Social dynamics as a manifestation of natural evolutionary laws should contribute to the progressive development of society. </p><p>  The third stage is positive.  It occurs when the spread of sciences, the growth of their social significance, the development of industry and all spheres of life, with the fundamental development of positivistic morality.  The victory of altruistic ideals over egoistic ideals, the improvement of social feelings, the rapid growth of <span>material culture,</span> which ensures justice and peace, is, according to O. Comte, the social dynamics that should lead society to progress.  However, the views of Auguste Comte, many scholars consider utopian. </p><p>  Social <strong> </strong>  statics <strong> </strong>  and <strong> </strong>  dynamics are two sections of one general sociological theory that studies society as a single system. </p>
