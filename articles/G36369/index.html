Today, Russian legislation has established the possibility of repaying the share of financial resources spent on the purchase of housing - apartments, houses, rooms and other facilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get 13 percent from buying an apartment" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1068947.jpg" width="600"></div>  Let's talk about which categories of taxpayers are entitled to a refund and how to practice the tax return from buying an apartment.

    <h2>  Who is entitled to issue a refund </h2><p>  According to the rules established by law, only a working individual who receives wages and transfers personal income tax from the total amount of accrued income is entitled to return part of the money paid for residential real estate.  This right is determined by <span>Art.</span>  <span>220 of the Tax Code.</span>  In a word, only a payer of <span>income tax</span> can issue a refund <span>.</span>  A similar deduction in the Tax Code of the Russian Federation is called property, it is possible only from the amount of the transferred tax.  If the tax has not been received in the budget, that is, the person did not work or worked informally, then the right to a refund does not occur.  So, the legal benefit accompanying such a step as buying an apartment is to receive 13 percent of the costs incurred. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  There are restrictions on the amount of the purchase, which we will consider later.  Can receive a deduction: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ homeowner or their official spouses; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ one of the parents of the minor owner, if the deduction had not been made to them earlier. </p><p>  You can apply for a deduction only if you spend your own funds.  If the purchase is made at the expense of the organization‚Äôs financial resources, budgets of various levels, maternity capital, then the right to reimbursement of costs does not arise.  Now let's figure out how to get 13 percent from the purchase of an apartment. </p><p>  You can apply for a property deduction when purchasing a house or a plot of land for its development, building a house, paying off interest on a mortgage loan. </p><p>  This benefit does not apply to the costs of redevelopment of premises, the acquisition of plumbing and other equipment.  This is important to know, since the mention of these expenses in the declaration will lead to the refusal of the tax inspectorate to accept it and the subsequent return to reissue the document. </p><h2>  What acquisitions is personal income tax refunded </h2><p>  Under the definition of "purchase object" appearing in legal documents, the following units of real estate are understood: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  ‚Ä¢ apartment, its part, room; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ house, share in it; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a plot of land having the category of individual housing construction, that is, suitable for individual development.  In this case, you can return 13% from the purchase of an apartment (house) from the year when the ownership of the erected building or a share in it is officially registered; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a piece of land (share) with a building on it. </p><h2>  Calculation of property deduction </h2><p>  The deduction amount is 13 percent from the purchase of an apartment.  It may include not only the price of the apartment or house itself, but also the costs of erection and decoration, payment of services for the development of the project, connection to energy resources and communications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="13 percent of the purchase of an apartment" class="if" height="344" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1068951.jpg" width="539"></div>  In addition, a <span>tax deduction</span> applies to the repayment of interest on a mortgage.

    <p>  ‚Ä¢ 2 million rubles from the acquired cost of housing, that is, the ability to recover costs in the amount of 260 thousand rubles.  (13% of 2 million); </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ 3 million rubles.  from payment of interest on a mortgage, i.e. 390 thousand rubles.  (13% of 3 million). </p><p>  It is important to remember: if the cost of an apartment is below 2 million rubles, then the buyer has the right to use the balance in future acquisitions of real estate.  A similar rule applies to the purchase of property from the beginning of 2014.  Earlier, the calculation algorithm was used according to other rules: it was possible to get a deduction only for one acquisition (even if the cost of housing was significantly lower than 2 million rubles), and there were no restrictions on the deduction for a mortgage loan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Therefore, when purchasing housing by installments, it is necessary to take into account the features of the possibility of obtaining the right to deduction, because if it occurs before 2014, documents for reimbursement of expenses should be submitted after the full cost or part of it, equal to 2 million rubles, is paid, since this can only be done on one object. </p><h2>  For what period is a deduction for housing purchased in 2015 possible? </h2><p>  The possibility of reimbursing part of the costs of acquired property comes from the year of registration of the certificate of ownership (if the transaction is framed by a contract of sale), or the act of transfer of property with equity in the construction of the house. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to return 13 percent from the purchase of an apartment" class="if" height="257" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1068971.jpg" width="600"></div>  For example, when buying a house in 2015, the taxpayer from the next year 2016 draws up a package of relevant documents confirming the purchase and, with the approval of the IFTS, acquires the right to return personal income tax in the amount of 13% of the cost of housing with established restrictions.  The payer can file a tax refund for the next three years, the pensioner - four years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019).

    <p>  In order to arrange a return of 13% from the purchase of an apartment, a corresponding set of documents is presented to the tax office at the beginning of the year following the year of purchase, which was discussed above.  After checking the documents, the IFTS provides the taxpayer with a deduction in the amount of personal income tax paid for the year of purchase.  The rest of the deduction is drawn up in the same manner next year.  If necessary, if after the second year the deduction balance remains again, the paperwork is repeated again. </p><p>  You can return 13% from the purchase of an apartment through the employer.  In this case, by submitting documents to the tax office and obtaining permission, the taxpayer appeals to the employer, who on this basis gives an order not to withhold income tax from the employee from the month of receipt of the confirmation until the end of the current year.  The right to deduction next year is confirmed again. </p><h2>  Which method is more beneficial for the payer? </h2><p>  We will figure out how to return a 13% tax on the purchase of an apartment in the most convenient way.  Making a property deduction through the IFTS is preferable, since when the employer refunds the tax, the right to the deduction arises from the month of confirmation, that is, one month will be lost, because collecting documents, transferring them to the IFTS and getting permission in January is unrealistic.  The tax inspectorate was given the right to review documents within a month, that is, the shortest period for obtaining a permit is mid-late February.  If you decide to return the deduction for the months that were not included in the calculation, you will have to re-issue the 3-NDFL declaration for the past year at the beginning of next year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartment tax return" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1068991.jpg" width="565"></div>

    <p>  A few points important to the taxpayer: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ the month of acquisition does not matter, since the amount of tax paid is fully accounted for the whole year; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ help f.  2-NDFL must be ordered at the beginning of next year, and not at the end of December of the year when the purchase took place (the 2-NDFL certificate received at the beginning of the year contains information on tax deductions in full). </p><p>  So, having considered in the article the question of how to get 13 percent from the purchase of an apartment, we hope that the main points are clarified. </p>
