  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is math?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  An unequivocal answer to the question of what mathematics is does not even exist today, despite the fact that this science originated a long time ago, almost at the dawn of civilization.  Throughout all time, it was enriched, more and more being established and updated as a <span>way of knowing the</span> laws of the surrounding world. </p><p>  Thanks to the expansion and change of the multifaceted connections of mathematics with practice, humanity is given a unique opportunity to discover and use these or those laws of nature.  At present, it is a truly powerful and powerful engine of technology and science. </p><p>  <span>What is math?</span>  This is of interest to many, but to answer this question is not easy.  Of course, everyone is able to give his own answer, which will depend on the level of his mathematical knowledge.  For a high school student, this is a generalized name for arithmetic, algebra, geometry and the beginnings of analysis.  For a student of a technical university, this is a science consisting of several dozen separate sections. </p><p>  It should be noted that the number of such sections is constantly growing over time, as modern mathematics is constantly enriched with new information as it develops.  Well, for a small child, this science is the ability to count.  Nevertheless, our whole life is inextricably linked with the solution of various mathematical problems. </p><p>  Similar to the definition of what mathematics is, there is no universally accepted clear definition of the subject of a given science.  In the past, it was believed that the solution to such problems is to measure quantities or numbers.  But after some time, the definition of mathematics arose as a doctrine of infinite quantities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The modern world considers mathematics as the science of mathematical structures.  This term was introduced by a group of French mathematicians known to the world under the pseudonym Bourbaki. </p><p>  This science is not an arbitrary creation of thought.  It displays the objective world in a somewhat abstract form.  Her studies are based on concepts obtained by abstracting from phenomena of the real world itself and, in addition, from previous abstractions. </p><p>  The emergence of such abstractions is closely related to reality.  Moreover, after solving a particular mathematical problem, its result is fixed, and then applied to various phenomena, the physical nature of which is significantly different from each other. </p><p>  For example, the study of mathematics often comes down to solving specific problems: <span>how to find the rate of</span> reproduction of bacteria, how atmospheric pressure changes, or how to determine the rate of radioactive decay.  In this case, the solution of all these problems reduces to the same differential equation. </p><p>  Such abstraction is quite difficult not only to understand, but also to feel for an adult, and even more so for a student.  That is why it is so important to make learning mathematics accessible to everyone.  And this requires a balance of specificity and abstraction, intuitiveness and rigor, without losing the ease of explanation of complex concepts. </p><p>  Of course, today it is difficult to find someone who would not have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat mathematics is.  But, as a rule, many mistakenly believe that this is just arithmetic, which implies the study of numbers and certain actions with their help, such as multiplication or division. </p><p>  But if you delve into this science, you can understand that in fact this concept is much more voluminous.  After all, mathematics is a peculiar way of describing the world and combining some of its parts with others.  The mathematical symbols describing the universe express the relationship of numbers. </p><p>  But <span>how to understand the math?</span>  This is a separate issue.  Such a process requires patience, desire and attention.  However, everything is not so complicated.  It is common for everyone to succeed in mathematics, since it is proved that the ‚Äúsense of number‚Äù is an innate ability. </p><p>  Unfortunately, memorizing axioms, theorems and memorizing formulas will not give any result.  The main thing is to understand the essence of mathematical theory and its laws.  And special attention requires the ability to draw conclusions from the statements that have been made. </p>
