One of them is the multinational Vyborg - Russian, Finnish, Swedish and German cultures contributed to the formation and development of the city. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  Today Vyborg is a ‚Äúwindow to Europe‚Äù.  For a long time the city was a border fortress of Sweden.  It was the Swedish governors who erected the castle with magnificent chambers and surrounded it with stone walls with towers. </p><p>  Vyborg repeatedly tried to conquer the Russian regiments, but only Peter I managed to do it. From 1710 to 1811 the city was part of the Russian Empire, and from 1812 to 1917 the manifesto of Alexander I was annexed to Finland.  The Civil War of 1918, the <span>Soviet-Finnish War</span> (1939-1940) and, finally, the Great Patriotic War (Soviet troops entered the city in June 1944) - the residents of Vyborg experienced many hardships and grief, but after that the long-awaited restoration of the city‚Äôs infrastructure began. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotels in Vyborg" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1015363.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The cheapest hotel stay will be in low season (1.10-31.03) - 4500 rubles for two guests when booking a standard room. </p><p>  Hotel Victoria is located in the business center of the same name, where several restaurants, a fitness club and a bath complex are also open.  Guests can dine in the panoramic Vkus restaurant or pay for a buffet breakfast, which is organized by the family restaurant Monrapa. </p><p>  Guests have a pleasant experience of staying at the hotel: the main attractions are within walking distance, there are comfortable rooms and very attentive staff.  A little confused by the large number of foreigners who like to make noise at night, as well as the condition of individual rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Friendship" </h2><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the railway and bus stations, on the coast of the bay, is the hotel "Friendship" (Vyborg).  The building in the form of a multi-deck ship was built in 1982 and successfully fits into the city landscape. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="friendship hotel vyborg" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1015360.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  To date, the housing stock has 102 rooms, which can simultaneously accommodate more than 200 guests.  Economy and standard, superior, deluxe and president - regardless of the selected category, the price includes a sauna (from 7 to 10 in the morning) and a breakfast buffet. </p><p>  The Druzhba Hotel (Vyborg, Zheleznodorozhnaya St., 5) has a pretty good rating.  Negative reviews were written by guests who lived in old rooms.  There really are problems: shabby furniture and plumbing, as well as a lack of lighting.  Complaints also caused faulty locks and keys in the doors. </p><p>  More optimistic estimates were made by those who were lucky to get into the rooms with a European-quality renovation.  We hope that the hotel management will put the entire housing stock in order as soon as possible. </p><p>  The hotel has a nightclub Dandy, where themed parties are held, and visitors are entertained by strip shows and go-go dancers.  In the institution you can also organize a private event, such as a bachelorette party or a bachelor party. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Atlantic </h2><p>  Democratic prices are offered by the Atlantic Hotel.  When booking one of the 24 rooms, the management promises: </p><p>  - daily cleaning </p><p>  - free breakfast </p><p>  - Wi-Fi, </p><p>  - secure parking. </p><p>  Please note that some rooms do not have a bathroom and shower.  From the photographs on the official website you can observe a rather modest setting.  This is confirmed by hotel guests, but also note the cleanliness and comfort.  Delicious breakfasts and friendly staff make a good impression.  Cheap hotels in Vyborg owe their popularity to the location - the best part of the city is literally within walking distance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel atlantic" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1015921.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, lovers of luxurious interiors may not like it here, so carefully read the booking conditions. </p><h2>  Viking </h2><p>  The classic interior and excellent service are offered by the Viking Hotel (Vyborg, 10 Zheleznodorozhnaya St.).  The following accommodation options are available to guests: </p><p>  - standard double room, </p><p>  - number of the second category - from 2400 rubles, </p><p>  - double superior - from 2900 rubles, </p><p>  - VIP (‚ÄúWedding‚Äù, ‚ÄúJacuzzi‚Äù and ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äù) - from 5000 rubles. </p><p>  The hotel management pays great attention to security: secure parking, a video surveillance system and 24-hour security are present here. </p><p>  Many hotels in Vyborg feed guests in a restaurant.  On the territory of the ‚ÄúViking‚Äù opened the institution ‚ÄúBeaujolais‚Äù.  Breakfast is served here every morning, the cost of which is taken into account when paying for the booked room. </p><p>  The hotel is in close proximity to the station, but high-quality double-glazed windows adequately cope with the noise of trains.  According to travelers, the best rooms are on the fourth floor (in the attic).  In general, the ‚ÄúViking‚Äù is rated at a solid three.  The main disadvantages: </p><p>  - inflated prices in the restaurant, </p><p>  - meager buffet </p><p>  - poor lighting in most rooms, </p><p>  - the need for cosmetic repairs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Viking hotel Vyborg" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1015913.jpg" width="270"></div>

    <h2>  "Bat" </h2><p>  The ‚ÄúBat‚Äù (Vyborg) leaves a very good impression on travelers.  A hotel with a frightening name in reality turns out to be very comfortable. </p><p>  Room categories: </p><p>  - Standard (from 2800 rubles for double occupancy). </p><p>  - Junior Suite (from 3500 rubles). </p><p>  - Superior room (from 3800 rubles). </p><p>  - VIP Superior Room (from 3900 rubles). </p><p>  - Lux (from 4200 rubles). </p><p>  - Apartments (from 4600 rubles). </p><p>  Guests have at their disposal not only a kitchen corner with household appliances, but also a personal sauna.  The only negative is the presence of windows only in the bathroom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bat vyborg hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1015361.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel also has special offers.  For example, the package ‚ÄúWeekend in Vyborg‚Äù, which includes not only accommodation in the selected room, but also a gift certificate for dinner in a restaurant and a 10% discount on additional services. </p><h2>  Opinions of the guests about the hotel "Bat" </h2><p>  Travelers like the friendly attitude of the staff, the availability of parking, comfortable rooms and affordable prices at the Bat restaurant, and in bad weather, warm floors become the main salvation. </p><p>  There is a slight smell of damp in some rooms and an uncomfortable shower design - all the water is on the floor and dries for a long time. </p><p>  In general, there are no serious shortcomings at the Bat Hotel (Vyborg, 3, Nikolaeva per.).  This once again proves that the work of the administrator and the maids plays an important role in shaping the impressions of the guests.  For their careful attitude and friendliness, many are ready to close their eyes to shortcomings and not to find fault with trifles. </p><h2>  "Northern Crown" </h2><p>  A short distance from local attractions is the hotel ‚ÄúNorthern Crown‚Äù (Vyborg, ul. Sbornaya, d. 2).  Cozy and bright rooms are greeted with a classic interior, and some of them have ‚Äúfragrant‚Äù names: </p><p>  - ‚ÄúCappuccino‚Äù. </p><p>  - ‚ÄúCappuccino Royal.‚Äù </p><p>  - Espresso. </p><p>  - Latte </p><p>  - ‚ÄúLatte Royal‚Äù. </p><p>  In addition, guests can book: standard TWIN, standard DBL and family.  A special category is Cities of Denmark - these are nine issues dedicated to the Danish kingdom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel northern crown vyborg" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1015362.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays with children in the "Northern Crown" </h2><p>  The Northern Crown is recommended for family travel.  Here, on request, a cot for the baby can be provided, and the main entertainment is a children's corner with many toys. </p><p>  Bicycle rental is available in the warmer months, and hotel managers can organize an interesting excursion to local attractions at any time, where you will not only learn the history, but also try Vyborg delicacies. </p><p>  On the territory of the hotel there is a cafe "Domino", which will pleasantly surprise you with its prices: </p><p>  - breakfast - from 160 to 260 rubles, </p><p>  - lunches economy - 150 rubles, business - 190 rubles and luxury - 255 rubles. </p><p>  After the reconstruction, a new banquet hall for 70 people was opened in the cafe.  On Fridays and Saturdays, visitors enjoy live music. </p><p>  It is simply impossible to imagine hotels in Vyborg without a Finnish sauna.  After long walks around the city, especially in autumn and winter, a visit to the sauna will be your best relaxation.  Read more about the cost on the official website of the Northern Crown. </p><p>  Travelers really like the hotel: there are clean and comfortable rooms, parking, an inexpensive sauna, coolers on the floors.  Of the minuses, the absence of an elevator and the remoteness from the historical center and the railway station are most often noted. </p>
