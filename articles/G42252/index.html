What causes the formation of craters on the moon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are a couple of basic theories as to what causes craters to form on the moon.  One of them is based on meteorite impacts on the satellite surface.  The second is based on the fact that within this celestial body certain processes occur, similar in essence to volcanic eruptions.  And it is they who are the real reason.  Both theories are quite controversial, and below we will explain why exactly such a formation of craters could have happened.  Mysteries are peculiar to the moon, most of which mankind has not yet solved.  And this is one of them. </p><h2>  Briefly about the moon </h2><p>  As you know, this satellite revolves around planet Earth in a relatively stable mode, periodically approaching or moving away a little.  According to modern data, along the way, the moon gradually flies away from us farther into space.  Approximately this movement is estimated at 4 centimeters per year.  That is, you can wait a long time until it flies far enough.  The moon affects the <span>ebbs and flows,</span> or rather - provokes them.  That is, if there was no satellite, then such activity of the oceans and seas would also not be.  Since then, when people first began to gaze steadily at the sky and study this celestial body, the question arose of what craters on the moon are like.  A lot of time has passed since those first attempts to understand the unknown, but to this day there are only theories that have not yet been actually confirmed by anything. </p>

    <h2>  Age and color of craters </h2><p>  A feature of such formations on the surface of the satellite is their color.  Craters on the moon, which were formed several million years ago, are considered young.  They look brighter compared to the rest of the surface.  Their other species, whose age cannot be calculated at all, have already darkened.  This is all explained quite simply.  The outer surface of the satellite is quite dark due to the constant exposure to radiation.  But inside the moon is bright.  As a result, when a meteorite hits, light soil is thrown out, thereby forming a relatively white spot on its surface. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The largest craters of the moon </h2><p>  Since ancient times, a tradition has arisen to give various names to celestial bodies.  In this case, it refers to the craters themselves.  So, each of them bears the name of one of the scientists who, one way or another, but moved the science of space forward.  The most noticeable of the relatively young craters is the one called Tycho.  Visually, it looks like a certain "navel" of our satellite.  The formation of craters on the Moon of this type, most likely, really happened due to a collision with its surface of a very large meteorite.  In this case, the name comes from Tycho Brahe, who was at one time a very famous astronomer.  This is a young crater with a diameter of 85 kilometers and an age of about 108 million years.  Another notable formation of this kind has a diameter of "only" 32 km and is named after Kepler.  In terms of degree of visibility, they go further: Copernicus, Aristarchus, Manilius, Menelaus, Grimaldi and Langren.  All these people in one way or another related to the development of science, and therefore rightfully captured in history in this way. </p>

    <h2>  Impact Theory </h2><p>  So, back to the theories about what causes craters on the moon.  The most common and reliable of them implies that in ancient times huge meteorites fell on the surface of our satellite.  In general, judging by various data, this was indeed the case, however, another question arises here.  If this happened, then how did such large meteorites fly around our planet and hit it specifically on a satellite?  That is, if there was a conversation about that side of the celestial body that is directed into space, then everything would be clear.  But with the part turned to the planet, it turns out that the satellite‚Äôs bombardment went directly from the surface of the Earth, which according to official history simply could not be. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Theory of Inner Activity </h2><p>  This is the second likely cause of the formation of craters on the moon.  Given how little we know even about the closest cosmic body to us, it is also quite real.  It is understood that in ancient times (the same many millions of years ago) volcanic activity took place inside the satellite.  Or something that might be like her.  And craters are just the consequence of such events, which in general also seems to be true.  It is unclear whether something like this is happening there now, and if so, why does not humanity observe this.  And if not, then why has it stopped.  As in any other space situation, there are always more questions than answers.  In general, it can be assumed that the Moon at one time experienced about the same period of volcanic activity that was on our planet.  Gradually, the situation stabilized, and now it is almost imperceptible or even absent.  If we take this analogy, then this is also quite possible.  Unfortunately, an unequivocal answer will be possible only when people finally begin to study space in more detail and detail. </p>

    <h2>  Inexplicable features </h2><p>  In principle, everything is clear with what could be the reason.  There are so many craters on the moon that both theories are probably true.  However, there are some features that do not fit into any of them.  These include various <span>inexplicable phenomena that</span> regularly occur on the surface of our satellite, in particular in craters.  From them, strange radiation begins to emit, then inexplicable color spots arise and so on.  Until now, no one can even guess what it is.  Perhaps the matter lies in the material of which the meteorite consisted, or in the fact that it burst out from the inside of the satellite. </p>

    <h2>  Craters on the Moon and the reason for their formation </h2><p>  And now back to the theory of the origin of this celestial body.  The official version, so to speak, states that the moon was formed as a result of the collision of a satellite with the surface of the earth.  Then it seemed to bounce back into space and there it hung, fixed by the gravity of the planet.  Perhaps something like this really happened, but most likely the object that crashed into the Earth was completely destroyed.  A huge amount of dust rose from the impact, the speed of which was so high that it entered the orbit of the planet.  Gradually, this material was compressed with each other, and ultimately formed a satellite. </p><p>  This explains how craters were actually formed on the moon, on that part of it that is turned to our planet.  So, first the dust formed small objects that gradually collided with each other and connected, becoming more and more.  Over time, some kind of foundation was created of the largest possible size in such a situation.  A huge number of other, smaller particles flying in orbit already began to crash into it, reacting to the resulting force of attraction.  Naturally, among such elements there were also so large ones that the craters we now know have created. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  Space is a continuous mystery.  People do not yet have the opportunity to study everything so thoroughly that the questions disappear.  This applies to other galaxies or stellar systems, as well as the closest celestial body to us.  Perhaps in the near future the situation will change, because preparations are underway for the construction of a base on the moon, the study of Mars, and so on. </p>
