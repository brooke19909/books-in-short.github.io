  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problem of truth</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  According to the concept of dialectical materialism, human knowledge, which is acquired as a result of <span>abstract thinking,</span> living contemplation and verified by practice, is reliable.  It should be noted that the basic concepts of truth were considered by various philosophers.  Moreover, only <span>dialectical materialism</span> could give an objective justification of the reliability of this knowledge. </p><p>  The problem of truth in science is considered from two sides. </p><p>  First, it must be established whether it exists.  In other words, can there be such content in the human mind that does not depend on the person himself. </p><p>  If it takes place, then in this case does the phase of objective truth exist in a representation ?!  In other words, are its absolute (phases) expressions present or only approximate, relative expressions take place. </p><p>  The problem of truth is reflected in the teachings of idealists.  They believe that human knowledge is dependent on the subject, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãabsolute spirit. </p><p>  For example, for idealists of the Machist sense, the problem of truth was reduced to the ideological and organizing form of human experience.  Thus, objectivity was led to "validity".  Moreover, the problem of truth is that it cannot be objective and independent of humanity.  Some religious doctrines can be drawn to this concept.  The Machians erased the line between religious and scientific dogmas, since the former can still act as "ideological forms." </p><p>  Pragmatists reasoned in the spirit of the Machists.  For pragmatists, truth was all "useful for practical purposes." </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are objective laws of thinking, society, nature.  According to the concept of modern fideism, science does not claim objective truth.  However, without the recognition of the second, the first does not exist.  Thus, the <span>scientific worldview</span> has a close relationship with objective truth.  As a result, the idealistic worldview is destroyed. </p><p>  The problem of truth is solved by dialectical materialism.  This direction, recognizing the "objective", indicates a partial, gradual knowledge of it.  Moreover, in each historical period, knowledge is limited.  However, these boundaries are relative and are expanding almost continuously in accordance with scientific and technological achievements.  Due to the fact that the development of knowledge is a continuous process, human knowledge is also incomplete, incomplete and relative. </p><p>  Thus, the relativity of truth is recognized as dialectical materialism, but only <span>in the sense of</span> incompleteness of knowledge in a certain area at a particular moment.  Relativity is mainly due to the eternal and endless change and development of the world.  Along with this, human knowledge of the world develops and deepens. </p><p>  Man's thinking is capable of giving absolute truth.  The recognition of the existence of the surrounding world leads to it.  Absolute knowledge is present in all sciences.  As far as human knowledge is objective, so much is the "absolute kernel" in it. </p><p>  According to the direction of dialectical materialism, abstract truth does not exist.  She is always specific. </p><p>  Relative and <span>absolute truth</span> are two components of <span>objective truth.</span>  They differ in the degree of accuracy, completeness.  In every objective there is a particle of the absolute.  In this case, the absolute consists of a set of relative, which is opened by constantly developing technology and science.  The limits of knowledge are expanding thanks to new discoveries. </p><p>  There is a continuous refinement, replenishment of the truth.  Thus, it more and more faithfully and fully reflects the essence of the infinite material world. </p>
