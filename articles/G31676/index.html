Advise! "  And this problem is by no means idle.  Sochi is a huge city, stretching for one hundred and forty-five kilometers along the Black Sea coast in the Krasnodar Territory.  The resort begins in the north with Magri, and its southern border is <span>the Psou River.</span>  Sochi is divided into regions: Central, Lazarevsky, Adler, Khostinsky.  Some resorts, which are well-known to everyone, have already become part of the big city.  This is Krasnaya Polyana, Matsesta, Dagomys.  Without exaggeration, Big Sochi - if not the largest city in Russia, then the most elongated.  The distances between the areas are huge.  Therefore, you should not rely on luck and think that you can find a suitable budget accommodation on the spot.  It is better to take care of this in advance.  And our article will help you with this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay in Sochi inexpensively" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923718.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When to go to Sochi </h2><p>  The resort of Russia No. 1 accepts vacationers all year round.  After the Olympics in 2014, the tourist infrastructure for mountain skiers improved.  Krasnaya Polyana stood out as an almost independent resort.  There are many sports facilities and, of course, well-equipped slopes for descents.  Do not forget that Sochi is also a balneological resort.  Those who come here to improve their health and recover from ailments are not interested in the weather and the temperature of the water in the sea, but in the specialization of the health resorts.  But these two categories of vacationers, in general terms, know where to relax in Sochi.  In the summer, the resort simply overwhelms the influx of holidaymakers who are eager to taste the beach pleasures.  The lion's share comes in July and the first half of August.  But knowledgeable people advise not to succumb to the general hype and go to Sochi in September.  The velvet season in the Caucasus will delight not only with mild warmth, but also beaches not filled to the eyeballs, and - importantly!  - reasonable prices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay cheap in Sochi </h2><p>  The local population of the resort totals only four hundred thousand inhabitants, while every year three million tourists rest here.  Therefore, we say frankly: it is difficult to find budget housing in Sochi.  Beach vacations are a costly affair for visitors and beneficial for locals who try to squeeze as much as possible in three months of the season so that there is something to exist for the rest of the year.  Therefore, be prepared to face difficulties in finding affordable housing.  There is no single answer to the question of where it is inexpensive to stay in Sochi.  The same room or hotel room can cost differently.  Therefore, the main rule in the search for budget housing is to negotiate without intermediaries.  Early booking can also reduce the cost of renting a roof over your head.  What to choose - a boarding house, a recreation center, a hotel, a guest house or an apartment (or even a room) with private individuals - you decide.  The main thing is to decide what is important for you: amenities, price, proximity to the sea? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where is better to relax in sochi reviews" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923716.jpg" width="312"></div>

    <h2>  Where to stay in Sochi inexpensively: private sector </h2><p>  Apartments and rooms have been and remain the most affordable housing for budget travelers.  Convenience is another matter.  Do not expect to find budget housing with a European-style renovation and new furniture.  For two hundred and fifty rubles, you will most likely be handed over a converted garage with a toilet in the courtyard and an outdoor shower.  In the process of finding cheap housing from private owners, you need to pay attention to two patterns.  First: the farther from the center of Sochi, the more the price drops.  Therefore, it is worth taking an interest in the Lazarevsky, Adlersky and Khostinsky areas.  If in the center of the apartment there are about three thousand rubles a day, then in Khost or Adler you can find for 600. But these satellite resorts have their own center.  If you are interested in where to stay inexpensively in Sochi, then you need to look for a place away from the sea.  For example, in Adler, this is the district of Blue Dali, the streets of Farmers, Verkhneizvestinskaya and everything that is beyond Lenin Street.  There you can find a very decent housing and for little money (300 rubles).  Another thing is how you will daily overcome a high angle of inclination, climbing from the sea up. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay in Sochi inexpensively advise" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923723.jpg" width="509"></div>

The amenities in these guest houses are completely different.  Sometimes there is one toilet and shower for several rooms, and sometimes a bathroom is in the room, along with a refrigerator, air conditioning, TV.  In terms of food, guest houses often work like hotels: either order food from them, or dine somewhere on the side.  But you can find those where they rent mini-apartments - a room with a small kitchen.  Such guest houses are the best option for those who are looking for where it is better to relax in Sochi.  Reviews are again advised to pay attention to Adler.  Prices range from 250 to 600 rubles per person per day.  And this is at the peak of the season (July-August)!  Choosing a guest house to <span>stay in Sochi, you</span> should also contact the owners directly, bypassing the intermediaries.  Unlike private owners hiding from the tax, such family hotels are officially registered and often have their own page on the Internet. </p><h2>  Hostels </h2><p>  Students and other young people not burdened by children are also often looking for where to stay cheap in Sochi.  This category of vacationers chooses hostels.  A distinctive feature of such housing is that the rooms are designed for a large number of residents - from four guests.  The rooms are often equipped with bunk beds.  But in such hostel hotels there are kitchens, which is important for those who want to save on food.  Hostels are located in prestigious places.  So, VeryHostel is located in the very center of Small Sochi, near the Riviera, the singing fountains and the Church of the Archangel Michael.  You can also recommend "Garage" and "Hostel Olympic."  The latter is located five kilometers from the central district of Sochi.  But, along with the kitchen, vacationers can use the washing machine, and the rooms have air conditioning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to stay in sochi inexpensive private sector" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923721.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Economy class hotels </h2><p>  Before the Olympics, all the hotels in the city had to undergo a re-certification in order to confirm their ‚Äústardom‚Äù.  This circumstance only played into the hands of vacationers.  Non-certified hotels have lowered their rates.  Well, a spoiled tourist now knows that the declared five stars are not empty self-promotion, but the corresponding amenities.  And what about the inexpensive hotels?  Where is it better to relax in Sochi?  Reviews mention hotels, accommodation in which varies in the range of 600-1200 rubles per person per day.  For example, in the "Meridian", which is two hundred meters from the beach, they ask for only 880 rubles for a bed.  For an additional fee, the hotel can order comprehensive meals.  Sometimes a hotel offering cheap rooms can boast its own swimming pool and other tourist infrastructure.  Such is the hotel "Hazel".  It is located a hundred meters from the sea, and offers rooms for 650 rubles per person. </p><h2>  Loo </h2><p>  There is a settlement district in Sochi with such a ‚ÄúKorean‚Äù name.  Loo became famous relatively recently, after the construction of a large water park in it.  And now, when someone asks friends: ‚ÄúWhere to stay in Sochi inexpensively with a child?  Advise! ‚Äù, He gets a definite answer.  The water park in Loo is a huge tourist complex with its hotels and restaurants.  Children generally love water rides.  And if the ‚Äúfree‚Äù number is also attached to the slides, then this is doubly good.  What about three meals a day included in the ticket price to the water park?  The tourist has two options.  The first is to contact the hotel directly and reserve a room (economy class costs 1600 rubles per person).  Then water rides can be visited several times a day, plus feeding.  The second option is cheaper.  At the <span>cash desk-terminal of the water park</span> you can buy an entrance ‚Äúticket‚Äù of one thousand rubles.  A daily stay in a hotel room will be a nice bonus for you.  But food in this case is not included in the package of services, and the use of the water park will be limited (once a day). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Sochi reviews" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923729.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Which district of Sochi to choose </h2><p>  The resort, as we recall, is very stretched along the coast.  And this means that the sea is enough for everyone.  Another thing is that the beaches are not always well-maintained.  And if you decide where to relax with children in Sochi, you need to keep this in mind.  Pebble beaches, especially with large stones, are not always useful for the legs of a child.  In some places, the depth begins a couple of meters from the shore.  In the Central District of Sochi, the beach is landscaped, but its congestion (especially during the peak season) nullifies all the joy of relaxation.  With children it is better to stay in Loo, Adler, Dagomys.  On the other hand, almost all the entertainment for young holidaymakers is located in the Central District.  In the park "Riviera" there is an aquarium "Secrets of the sea."  You should not miss the opportunity to visit the arboretum with children.  In addition to the rich flora, there is a small zoo where a child can take part in feeding ostriches.  There are two dolphinariums in Sochi.  In one of them penguins participate in the show.  And near the seaport there is a water park (Mayak beach).  The minus of the Central District is overpriced compared to other parts of the city.  Lovers of wild beaches choose Hosta. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Sochi with children" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923746.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Health Resorts Sochi </h2><p>  Well, what about those who want to improve their shaky health at an all-Russian resort?  Where can I stay in Sochi inexpensively in a sanatorium?  The range of prices in such institutions is enormous.  It is important to choose the right place for relaxation and treatment.  There are sanatoriums (for example, "Belarus"), where the cheapest room will cost one person 5100 rubles.  Of course, this amount includes various wellness treatments and three meals a day in the a la carte restaurant.  Yes, and a sanatorium with a swimming pool is located fifty meters from the sea.  But accommodation with meals in the format of a "buffet" in the health resort "Knowledge" will cost a tourist already three thousand four hundred rubles.  The cheapest resort in Sochi is Izvestia.  Staying in it costs from two thousand three hundred and fifty rubles. </p><h2>  Some tips for experienced tourists </h2><p>  How to reduce the cost of vacation in Sochi?  First, visit the resort during off-peak season.  The assurances that in September the vacation can hopelessly spoil the bad weather and rains are unfounded.  Precipitation in the climate zone of the subtropics is just more likely in July than in the first month of autumn.  Secondly, look for housing not in the Central District, but in the Greater Sochi region.  And most importantly - do not contact the company.  ‚ÄúGood aunties‚Äù at the station with the signs ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs rent out‚Äù are actually agents who have a percentage of each given vacationer.  Do not ask the all-knowing taxi drivers where to relax in Sochi: the reviews claim that they bring customers to "their people", who are both expensive and not comfortable.  Better drive away from the center and look for yourself.  The reviews claim that almost every house in Sochi has a ‚ÄúRent a room‚Äù sign. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to relax in Sochi in the summer" class="if" height="272" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/923742.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  How to improve health inexpensively </h2><p>  The resort is not the only place in the resort where you can stay to undergo a course of medical procedures.  Knowledgeable tourists argue that it is much better (and cheaper) to rent an apartment or apartments in a mini-hotel.  Then you can buy a course and go through the entire treatment program with baths, muds, mineral waters, massages and other things that the sanatoriums offer their customers. </p>
