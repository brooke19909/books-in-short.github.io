    <h2>  Weather in Jordan in November </h2><p>  In November, Jordan has a very calm and comfortable autumn vacation.  There is already no sweltering heat, as well as cold, it’s a bit chilly at night, and daytime air temperatures are suitable for a variety of pastimes: a beach holiday on the Red Sea, fascinating excursions to the unique historical, cultural and architectural monuments of this amazing country, healing and treatment on the Dead Sea, exploring the exotic nature of this land. </p><p>  The only possible surprise that the weather in Jordan in November can bring is the starting rains that are characteristic of the northern regions.  Often they are accompanied by winds.  And at the same time, reviews of tourists allow us to judge that it is comfortable in Jordan at any time of the year, and the small whims of the weather are unlikely to spoil the impression of a vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The weather in Jordan in November is quite variable, depending on the regions.  The average air temperature in the country warms up to +27 ° C.  In the capital of the country Amman, as well as in the northern regions, it is much cooler - up to +21 ° C during the day, and at night it is already chilly almost in winter: no higher than +10 ° C.  Therefore, warm clothes will not be superfluous. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in jordan in november" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The central regions are warmer.  This is due to the proximity of the desert.  Here the thermometer rises to +22 ° C during the day, and at night the air cools to +7 ° C.  The water temperature in Jordan in November off the coast of the Dead Sea is +28 ° C.  And in the Red Sea, the water is still warm in summer - about +25 ° C. </p><p>  Diving fans are forced to disappoint a little: November is not the best month of the year for your favorite sport, as possible underwater currents significantly reduce visibility. </p><h2>  Where to relax </h2><p>  Jordan in November offers guests to visit many resorts.  You can see with your own eyes the amazing desert landscapes of Wadi Rum, visit the unusual pink city of Petra, carved by ancient nabateh in the rocks, have a wonderful rest on the Dead Sea coast, go diving in the Red Sea and, of course, you can admire the magnificent pearl that Jordan is proud of .  Aqaba in November is one of the most popular and most visited resorts in the country. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This wonderful city is often called the Jordanian window on the sea.  After a long journey through the deserts, the city is perceived as a real miracle, as a breath of fresh air: the crystal clear sea air has healing properties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Jordan in November" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463666.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The famous resort town is located on the coast of the bay of the same name.  Today, tourists from all over the world are attracted by <span>Jordan (Aqaba).</span>  The weather in November allows you to warm up in the middle of autumn on the well-groomed warm sandy beaches and, of course, swim in the Red Sea.  The city has gained worldwide fame as an international diving center.  Amazing landscapes of the Gulf of Aqaba fascinate at first sight and make you come back here again and again. </p><p>  Aqaba is surrounded by mountains that create a special microclimate.  There is sunny warm weather throughout the year.  We have already said that Jordan (Aqaba) is suitable for year-round recreation.  The weather in November in the city is characterized by rather high temperatures.  In winter and autumn, the average daily air temperature is above +24 ° C in winter, and in summer it often rises above +32 ° C.  It is surprising that during the year the temperature of the water remains practically unchanged.  Even in winter, it warms up to +22 ° C. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  When is the best time to come to Aqaba? </h2><p>  The best time to visit this city is from October to April.  At this time, the air temperature is optimal for adaptation, and the water temperature in the Gulf of Aqaba is quite high.  Summer in the city is perhaps too hot for tourists from Europe. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Holidays in Jordan in November for most tourists are, first of all, magnificent well-groomed beaches and a warm sea.  But sooner or later, such a pastime bothers.  And then tourists go to inspect the numerous historical and cultural monuments, which are the property not only of Jordan, but also of the entire Middle East. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jordan aqaba november weather" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1463667.jpg" width="600"></div>
