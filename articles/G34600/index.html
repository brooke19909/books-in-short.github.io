Let's find out what kind of city is between the sea and the mountains?  Gelendzhik stands on the coast of a picturesque bay.  Sights and entertainments (2014 is the time of the next hydro-air show) here are so numerous and varied that you just won’t get bored. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik attractions and entertainment" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/467643.jpg" width="580"></div>

    <h2>  Excursion into the past </h2><p>  According to one version, the name of the city means "white bride", and all because many years ago the Turks captured the coast, who were fascinated by the beauty of local girls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik Attractions and Entertainment 2014" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/467645.jpg" width="375"></div>  Despite the fact that the city is a little over 150 years old, the history of human settlements here is rooted in the distant past.  The coast in these parts has been inhabited since ancient times.  The settlement of the Lower (Early) Paleolithic is located a few kilometers from the city and reveals to us the unique attraction of the city - dolmens.  These are stone buildings overgrown with moss of incomprehensible form and obscure purpose, which are already more than 200 thousand years old.  Perhaps these are the tombs of the ancient nobility or pagan constructions.  In any case, they have the strongest energy, and it is considered a good sign to visit here and touch them.  It is known that the people who left these cultural monuments were quite developed, were engaged in agriculture and cattle breeding, traded with the Greeks.

Since the end of the 15th century, Turkish rule has been firmly established here.  In the place of modern Gelendzhik there was a village from which the export of young slaves was carried out. </p><p>  The yoke continued for three centuries, until in 1829 Russia liberated the Black Sea coast, winning victories in the Russian-Turkish wars.  On July 23 (according to the new style on August 4), 1831 the city of Gelendzhik was founded, the sights of which are striking in their antiquity and beauty.  One of the first attractions is the Gelendzhik fortress, built during its foundation.  During the Crimean War, the fortress was blown up and abandoned by Russia.  In 1857, the fortress was returned by the Russians. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik city attractions" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/467653.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The development of the city in the twentieth century </h2><p>  The population of the city consisted mainly of descendants of peasant immigrants from the far reaches of Russia, as well as representatives of some other nationalities, in particular Greeks, Poles, Turks, and Armenians.  In 1900, the first health resort, a library was opened in the city, temples and churches were built, a post office appeared, parks and squares were broken up, and the construction of a pier near the sea was completed.  Soon Gelendzhik gains the status of a city.  During the Great Patriotic War, it became a hospital city.  It was practically ruined by bombing.  After the war, an intensive restoration began, and it was rebuilt anew.  Horticulture and viticulture flourish here. <br><br></p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Gelendzhik in our time </h2><p>  Welcome to the really beautiful southern city of Gelendzhik, located in a picturesque place! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gelendzhik Attractions and Entertainment Photo" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12424/467658.jpg" width="600"></div>  Attractions and entertainment here are for every taste.
