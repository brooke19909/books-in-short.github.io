    <h2>  Village History </h2><p>  In 1862, a peasant Nikita Ponizovkin came to the village of Durkovo with one bag.  He came and got rich.  How?  Unknown  In 1863, enrolled in the <span>guild of merchants of the first</span> degree.  He began to build factories for the production of molasses from starch.  There was enough potato in the district, and the plants worked at full capacity, making starch.  In addition to molasses and starch, an initiative entrepreneur produced varnishes and paint.  They quickly dispersed.  In the 1880s there were fourteen enterprises throughout the neighborhood.  In 1866, he began to build a large factory, and then in 1867 he left for Yaroslavl.  They did not hear anything more about him.  Gone, gone forever.  He was about sixty years old. </p><p>  The heirs completed a large and modern factory for that time, continued the founder‚Äôs business and opened the Nikita Ponizovkina Sons trading house.  A new large factory produced its first products in 1868.  Things were going well.  Economic results were exhibited at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1889.  The Ponizovkins received a large silver medal.  They no longer knew the problems with money and could afford the construction for personal needs in the village, which is now called the Red Profintern.  Ponizovkina Castle was distinguished from other buildings by its magnificent beauty and splendor of decoration.  Now it is being restored.  Most of the <span>outbuildings are</span> preserved and even used.  At its base, the starch-syrup factory Yarpatoka operates. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New building and its owners </h2><p>  Who has not heard about the village in the Yaroslavl region Red Profintern?  Ponizovkina Castle attracts guests here, and residents enthusiastically talk about it.  He was beautiful, and now they began to revive him.  Old photographs taken in the village (now Red Profintern), Ponizovkina castle show in all its splendor.  The history of its construction is gradually overgrown with legends.  Legend has it that the grandson of Nikita Petrovich Nikita Andreevich married a beautiful Frenchwoman.  More precisely, his wife was a girl from Russified Germans - Rosa Bursian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Red Profintern Nikita Ponizovkina castle" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1396542.jpg" width="328"></div>  For a young wife on the banks of the Volga, from where a wonderful view of the expanse of water and the far shore opened up, the castle of Ponizovkin was built in the Russian outback (now Red Profintern) by an architect, whose name is unknown.  The young couple, while the palace was being built from 1912 to 1914, had a daughter Tatyana and a son Andrei.  But they did not have time to live together, but soon divorced.  The fault was the love of Nikita Andreevich.  The wife and daughter left for Moscow, and Nikita Andreevich remained with his son in his native land.  In Moscow, before the revolution, Roza Petrovna worked as a librarian, and then she got married and began to lead her house.  Nikita Andreyevich went headlong to work, but later married.  When revolutionary events came, well-being ended.  What happened to him next, no one knows.  This is a mystery to local historians.  Built near Yaroslavl (Red Profintern), the Ponizovkina castle did not become a tribal nest, as might have been planned.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What the castle looked like </h2><p>  The center of the building is a two-story cube protruding forward with high arched Venetian windows.  Under them on the ground floor is the main entrance.  It is completed by a spacious semicircular terrace.  <span>This risalit is</span> connected by a two-story passage with a high quadrangular three-story tower on the right, which has an observation deck at the top and a balcony, the fence of which reminds of the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ponizovkina castle red professional" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1396545.jpg" width="600"></div>  On its ground floor there are three deep oval niches.  The round tower also has two floors.  It is completed by a conical roof.  This is the facade of the building, which is clearly visible in the old photograph.  The windows were often made of small elements.  In the Nekrasovsky district (Red Profintern) Nikita Ponizovkin‚Äôs castle is a unique creation.  In this building, various styles were mixed, which is why it is called eclectic.  The palace was most attracted to Gothic and Art Nouveau.  Passengers traveling on ships along the Volga admired him for a long time.  And around was a park with linden trees and fragrant jasmine.  Silver poplars and Chinese apple trees grew in it.

    <h2>  What was inside </h2><p>  Judging by the descriptions, the mansion was luxurious: the front entrance staircase emphasized the interior of the building, the lobby was decorated in Egyptian style, there were columns, mosaic parquet floors, the ceilings were painted, there was colorful stucco molding, gilded cornices, mahogany panels covered part of the walls of mahogany In the winter garden with a glass roof it was summer all year.  The walls were decorated not only with frescoes, but also with silk and brocade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ponizovkina castle red professional how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1396548.jpg" width="600"></div>  The house was heated from a boiler room located in the basement.  The pipes hidden in the walls (they were double) received warm air.  The walls were warming up, and the house was dry and warm.  Everyone admired this beauty, which everyone saw only from the outside.  So unique, one of a kind and strange was the castle of Ponizovkina.  Red Profintern is proud of this place.

    <h2>  Guest House </h2><p>  Near the castle there is a two-story room for relatives and guests.  Traditionally, the first floor is made of bricks, and the second is made of wood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ponizovkina castle red professional address" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1396550.jpg" width="600"></div>  The tree allowed to decorate it with complex carvings.  On the second floor you can climb the heavy patterned cast-iron stairs.  In some places stucco ceilings were preserved.  Stucco was once gilded.  Now in places it is lost altogether or is covered with whitewash.  The rooms have Dutch ovens.  Tall doors are decorated with frosted glass.  They depict fantastic herbs and griffins.  Parquet flooring.

    <h2>  After the revolution </h2><p>  First, the castle of Ponizovkina (Red Profintern) was looted.  Then they made a school in it, changing the heating.  It became steam, and the house began to damp.  Repair was not made, since there was no money.  Then there was a club, then a library.  By the way, the rich Ponizovkin library was lost.  By the end of the 20th century, the Ponizovkin castle stood empty and gradually collapsed.  City authorities refused him.  The roof was leaking, the interior was a miserable look. </p><h2>  The nineties </h2><p>  In 1993, the castle was bought, but by 2001 its owners went bankrupt without doing anything for the palace.  Something managed to be taken to the art <span>museum of Yaroslavl.</span> </p><h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  The Tashir group of companies in 2008 acquired the Ponizovkin Palace and quickly began its restoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ponizovkina castle red professional excursion" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1396560.jpg" width="600"></div>  The facade was strengthened, the interior was cleaned of debris and brought to a decent view.  The household territory is also put in order.
