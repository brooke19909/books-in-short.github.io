Famous aircraft designers</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is impossible to imagine the modern world without airplanes and flights.  Being one of the most important assets among the inventions of mankind, the <span>aircraft</span> was born thanks to the frantic desire of man to have wings behind him.  Surely our ancestors dreamed of a dream soar in heaven.  Admiring the birds and spreading their arms, imagined themselves next to them.  Even a child sincerely believes in the existence of fabulous flying devices, truly envious of the heroes of magical stories.  Dreams came true only after millennia - when a sufficient amount of scientific knowledge was accumulated.  The experience gained during the many unsuccessful attempts made by the creator of the world's first aircraft and its predecessors came in handy today. </p><h2>  Makholet: the beginning of the road </h2><p>  As far back as the 15th century, Leonardo da Vinci was convinced that a person, having overcome air resistance, has every chance of rising into the air.  Huge wings can help him in this.  Calculations and a detailed study of bird flights led him to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such an apparatus as a makholet.  Leonardo da Vinci tried to realize the idea, which inspired him with an ordinary dragonfly. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aviation history" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1178548.jpg" width="600"></div>

The history of aeronautics and aviation remembers that among the enthusiasts who want to conquer uncharted airspace, there were many captains of sea ships.  Perhaps they sought to know the unknown expanses, but, having thrown off the romance, it is worth noting that the sailors had great knowledge in complex technical devices, were able to control large frigates.  If necessary, they could easily repair or build a new ship.  Therefore, the experience of professional sailors was useful in the process of creating the first self-propelled devices above the ground. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creator of the world's first aircraft" class="if" height="460" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1175796.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Modern civil and <span>military aviation, the</span> history of which is rich in many experiments, has gone through feelings of admiration and disappointment, human losses and new opportunities that have opened up. </p><h2>  The first gliders appeared </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 19th century, the first non-powered gliders appeared.  Imitating the birds, the inventors gave their creations a similar shape.  However, the first aircraft could not gain a foothold in use, since the desire to raise the inventions incredible for that time was unsuccessful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian aviation" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1175652.jpg" width="600"></div>

"Albatross" (as he called his technical miracle), depending on the direction of the wind and the density of air masses, had a chance to fly about 200 meters. </p><h2>  Mozhaisky's success </h2><p>  Russian aviation can safely be proud that the admiral of the Tsarist fleet was able to construct the first aircraft equipped with a steam engine, which broke off the surface of the earth with a man on board.  The creator gave him a promising name - "airborne projectile."  The dimensions of the aircraft of that period were impressive: the length of the wings was about 24 meters, the fuselage was about 15 meters.  Alexander Mozhaisky - the creator of the world's first aircraft - could not finish the job.  But his developments became fundamental in the further development of aeronautics. </p><h2>  Merit of the American Wright Brothers </h2><p>  Foreseeing the closeness of success, the best inventors around the world relied on the experience of previous discoverers.  Without giving up their hands and constantly searching for a suitable idea, they tried to create a lighter aircraft and were confident in the need to supply it with a more powerful engine.  However, not everyone thought about controlling the winged device.  The main goal was just to take off.  Such hindsight cost Otto Lilienthal's life.  In 1896, his glider turned over from the impact of a sharp windy rush, and the device crashed from a height.  Therefore, not only famous aircraft designers deserve attention, but also those to whom the first plane was able to submit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Macholet Leonardo da Vinci" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1175808.jpg" width="564"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Wright brothers, inventors from America, were able to master the most important skills in piloting and maintaining the balance of an aircraft in an air harbor.  The advantage of their design was a confident engine running on gasoline.  Despite the fact that the <span>aircraft was</span> not much like a modern aircraft, it was more like a flying whatnot, it weighed about 300 kg.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the first successful trials of the Flyer took place.  Having stayed in the air for 12 seconds, the Wright brothers gave a green light to a person for the development of heaven. </p><h2>  <span>Aviation in Russia: the</span> beginning of the 20th century </h2><p>  The next few years, the whole world was shocked by the success of the Americans, so that aviation continued its path of formation.  History mentions flickering newspaper headlines, a film shot by a Parisian cameraman, specialized publications devoted to aviation achievements.  However, the testers of the first aeronautical machines were rightly called daredevils.  Russian aviation, according to its representatives, was an uncomfortable and unsafe occupation.  For example, in the notes of the famous pilot of that period, Boris Rossinsky, there are essays and memories of flights.  Among the unpleasant moments during the flight, he especially remembered the smoking oil.  Smoky caustic smoke did not allow breathing fully, as a result of which the pilot had to apply ammonia to his nose from time to time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="history of aeronautics and aviation" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1175801.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  In addition, the lack of brakes forced the aviator to jump out of the cockpit on the go. </p><h2>  The creation of Sikorsky - Russian hero </h2><p>  Several years have passed since the launch of the American Flyer, and production of domestic aircraft has already been established at a high level in the territory of the Russian Empire.  Then the first passenger aircraft appeared, the creator of which was <span>Igor Sikorsky.</span>  Fully consistent with its historical name, "Ilya Muromets" was a real giant among its counterparts.  In addition, the interior was distinguished by unprecedented conditions: several bedrooms, a toilet and a bathroom, electricity and heating.  ‚ÄúIlya Muromets‚Äù passed its first practical test in the winter of 1914.  Sixteen passengers with a dog on board received a lot of emotions from the flight, after which the plane made a successful landing.  Six months later, comfortable aircraft had to take on the role of bombers, participating in the First World War. </p><h2>  Tupolev range record </h2><p>  The legendary ANT-25 is located in the Chkalovsky Museum hangar.  Once this aircraft was admirable and was recognizable thanks to the huge red wings.  The great Russian aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev was awarded many awards for his significant contribution to the development of aviation. </p><p>  <span>Valery Chkalov, a</span> famous Soviet pilot, in 1937 managed to set a real range record on this aircraft.  Subsequently, the ANT-25 acquired just such a second name.  From Moscow to Vancouver, the distance is about 8.5 thousand kilometers, and Tupolev‚Äôs aviation brainchild was able to overcome it in one breath. </p><h2>  Air tank IL-2 </h2><p>  The IL-2 attack aircraft became famous during the Great Patriotic War.  He terrified the Nazis, as he acted as the main air defense of Soviet soldiers over the battlefield.  Covering his soldiers with guns, machine guns and missiles, he led forward ground forces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="aviation development" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1175653.jpg" width="580"></div>  One of its clear advantages was its strong armor, which made it possible to fight off attacking fighters of enemy Germany.  Thanks to the power of this aircraft, their release prevailed in quantity over other military counterparts.

    <h2>  Modest U-2 </h2><p>  By the forties of the 20th century, countless <span>military aircraft</span> had been created by leading aircraft designers in the USSR <span>,</span> but not only were they entrusted with the protection of the Soviet sky. </p><p>  Along with them participated in the battle aircraft intended for peaceful purposes.  Among them, U-2 occupied an honorable place.  This modest training aircraft had two seats, was absolutely not whimsical to use, and could land outside the designated place.  In addition, the aircraft was appreciated for its maneuverability and quietness.  This allowed military pilots to sneak up on the enemy almost silently in the dark and deliver decisive strikes. </p><p>  Having distinguished himself in the battles of 1943, the U-2 received insignia and a new name.  In honor of Nikolai Polikarpov, a famous aircraft designer, in the entire Soviet space, he was renamed Po-2. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  A multifaceted aviation, the history of which still has many worthy examples and exemplary designs, including the best lifting, civilian aircraft and fighter jets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="unmanned vehicles" class="if" height="227" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/1175804.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  One cannot fail to mention the elegant Tu-144 airliner of 1968, the MiG-25 jet fighter, the Columbia and Buran orbital planes.  An important breakthrough was the use of such strategic devices as unmanned aerial vehicles.

    <p>  If a person once saw a dream where he flew, the desire to repeat this in real life will never leave him.  You can fulfill your dream by simply being a passenger on the plane, or having received the appropriate education to sit at the helm in the future, or become the greatest aircraft designer. </p>
