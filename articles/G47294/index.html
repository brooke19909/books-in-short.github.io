    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  It is believed that Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) was founded in the early 18th century.  More precisely, during this period an outpost Koryakovsky arose on the territory of the modern city on the banks <span>of the Irtysh River</span> .  After a quarter of a century, this military fortification significantly expanded its borders, and a few years later, although it lost its strategic importance, but due to the development of salt production on Koryakovsky Lake, it turned into a prosperous village, inhabited mainly by retired military personnel.  This fact was recognized by the authorities of the Russian Empire, which in 1838 assigned the status of a village to the outpost Koryakovsky, regimental infirmary and schools from Yamyshev were transferred there.  But the city of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) received its modern name in 1861 in honor of Grand Duke Pavel Alexandrovich.  The further history of Pavlodar is not full of interesting facts.  The only thing that deserves mention is a rapid breakthrough in the development of the city during the <span>development of virgin lands,</span> when it was decided to establish two large industrial enterprises in Pavlodar: aluminum and combine plants.  To accommodate their workers, residential buildings, as well as schools, clinics, kindergartens, shops, a stadium, etc. were built. Thus, by the end of the 80s of the 20th century, Pavlodar already had a fairly developed urban infrastructure.  As for the post-Soviet era, the city has successfully overcome the transition period and today is considered one of the most comfortable in Kazakhstan. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pavlodar Kazakhstan" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/440691.jpg" width="600"></div>
