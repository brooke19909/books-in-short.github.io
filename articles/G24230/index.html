To begin with, it‚Äôs worth getting to know her a little to understand what we are dealing with. </p><h2>  A little bit about Georgia </h2><p>  Georgia is located in the western part of Transcaucasia.  Due to its location, it is sometimes recognized as part of Europe.  Georgia celebrates two days of independence: from the ZDFR in 1918 on May 26, and from the USSR in 1991 on April 9.  It borders with Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan.  As for administrative division, the country is divided into two autonomous republics: Adjara and Abkhazia.  Four cities have republican significance: Kutaisi, Rustavi, Poti and Batumi. </p><p>  The land of Georgia is very diverse.  Here you can find almost any type of soil.  In the country you can even find small semi-deserts.  Georgia is very rich in minerals.  The main type of mining is manganese ores.  Also, the country is rich in building materials: clay, limestone, dolomites.  There are also mineral waters: Sairme, Borjomi and Nabeglavi. </p>

    <h2>  Getting started! </h2><p>  So, what interesting facts do we know about Georgia? </p><ol><li>  Firstly, the Georgians themselves call their country Sakartvelo.  In Europe, it is customary to call it Georgia, but the name has not taken root inside the country. </li><li>  There is Russian in the country, but only people aged there speak it. </li><li>  Georgians converted to Christianity earlier than Ukrainians. </li><li>  The police of the country are very famous, which favors not only residents, but also tourists.  It is difficult for a Russian person to understand, but it really is. </li><li>  All signs located in the country are duplicated in two languages: Georgian and English. </li><li>  If you do business in Georgia, then you will have to find out that you will have to pay for some elevators in huge centers!  Just do not rise to the desired height. </li><li>  Very long ago, Georgia and Spain were called the same. </li><li>  Attention should be paid to those who decide to learn the Georgian language.  The fact is that if there is the slightest mistake in a word, it can radically change the meaning of what was said. </li><li>  If you have drunk too much, but you need to get home, do not risk it and get behind the wheel.  The good-natured police will come to the rescue, which we have already mentioned above.  It is enough to make one call - and you will be taken home by your own car. </li><li>  In this country, it is customary to hang clothes everywhere.  This shows that a woman is a good housewife who cares for family members. </li></ol>

Everyone has heard about the <span>hospitality of this</span> people, but what is it?  When you come to visit you are not asked to change shoes.  Georgian owners will be allowed to enter your shoes, as a request for a change of shoes is considered impolite. </p><p>  To better understand the attitude towards the guests, it is worth recalling the expression: ‚ÄúIn Georgia, the guest is from God.‚Äù  However, there are some rules that few people know about.  No matter how elegant the banquet, eating up to the last bite is considered indecent.  But it's not only that.  Georgians are such by nature that if you have mastered one dish, even if it has barely fit in, they will immediately bring you a new one.  If the Slavic peoples believe that empty plates after the feast are a sign of delicious food, then the Georgians have the opposite.  The more food left, the better the owner tried.  Toast is very important.  Georgians are the authors of the most beautiful toasts.  At the holidays, the most important person is the host. </p><p>  Listing interesting facts about Georgia, we forgot to mention the love of local residents for bathhouses.  It is believed that only a feast that continues in the bath can be called good.  I. Grishashvili, a Georgian poet, believed that visiting Georgia and not steaming in the sulfur baths of Tbilisi is the same as visiting Paris and not climbing the Eiffel Tower. </p>

    <h2>  Legends </h2><p>  Interesting facts about Georgia for children relate to the legends of this country.  It is believed that she is one of the richest in this regard.  To prove this, consider the most <span>famous Georgian</span> legend. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most famous is considered a legend or a heroic legend about Amirani.  According to legend, Amirani was born in the union of the hunting goddess Dali and an ordinary hunter.  Since the boy was born prematurely, he matures in the womb of a bull (heifer).  His body was covered with divine signs, and some parts of it were completely golden.  Amirani is a giant who has tremendous power.  He is so powerful that even the earth barely holds him.  The oldest version of the legend says that the giant received magical power after bathing in the water source of the Igry-batoni.  Legends relate to the struggle of Amirani and his assistants with Veshapi and Devas.  Amirani managed to get out of Veshapi's belly, which he cut with a diamond knife.  After that, the giant stole Kamari - the heavenly maiden. </p>

    <p>  This hero is an analogue of Prometheus.  For active assistance to people, he was chained to a rock in a cave of the Caucasian ridge.

    <h2>  Winemaking </h2><p>  Georgians are excellent winemakers, they know this and are proud.  The country has more than 500 types of grapes.  Wine is not only an important part of the country's culture, but also a significant economic pillar.  The wine in this country is so tasty not only because of the variety of grape varieties.  It's about cooking.  The peeled grapes are wrinkled with bare feet, as in the famous film with the participation of Adriano Celentano.  For cooking, special dishes are used, which should not react with grapes. </p><h2>  Tbilisi </h2><p>  What else can Georgia surprise?  We examined <span>interesting facts about the country</span> , but forgot about the main thing - the capital.  For about 400 years it was an Arab city and had the name Tbilisi Emirate.  The influence of this period is very noticeable in the architecture and art of the country.  In 2005, one of the streets of Tbilisi was named in honor of George W. Bush.  In the capital, as in the whole country, there is no central heating. </p>

    <h2>  Kutaisi </h2><p>  Speaking about interesting facts about Georgia, one cannot but mention Kutaisi - the thieves' capital of the country.  For many years in a row, this city held a leading position in terms of criminal events.  However, the city has rich historical roots.  Once it was the capital of Colchis - the legendary Georgian state.  The city is famous for the cathedral of King Bagrat (Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary).  Its construction began King Bagrat in the X century.  The cathedral was built over 100 years.  He became the world famous pearl of Georgian architecture.  It was here that the coronation of all the kings of Western Georgia took place.  However, now only ruins remained from the cathedral, since in the XVII century it was blown up by Turkish troops. </p>
