    <p>  Getting to him is easy.  This can be done by metro, leaving at the Gorkovskaya station and walking about 5 minutes, by tram (No. 6 or No. 40) or by city bus (No. 46 or No. 134).  Trams Nos. 2, 53 and 63 also take you to Trinity Square.  And from there to the Ioannovsky bridge - a stone's throw. </p><p>  The bridge is not only an important architectural landmark of the city.  At any time of the year there are a lot of wild ducks, gulls and pigeons, which tourists are happy to feed.  And the views from the bridge are simply magnificent! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Ioannovsky bridge in St. Petersburg: photos and description </h2><p>  The birth of the city is directly related to the foundation of the Peter and Paul Fortress in 1703.  It was then that this bridge appeared.  True, it was originally called Petrovsky. </p><p>  St. John’s bridge in St. Petersburg connects the gate of the same name with the Petrograd Island.  At the same time, it crosses the Kronverksky Strait - one of the city channels of the Neva.  The bridge is an object of cultural heritage of Russia and is protected by the state. </p>

    <p>  Today the bridge is completely pedestrian.  Its width is 10 meters and its length is 152 meters.  On both sides it is decorated with beautiful lanterns (with figures of double-headed eagles and colorful hats) and patterned iron gratings. </p><h2>  John Bridge and the history of its creation </h2><p>  The hero of our article was destined to become the very first bridge of the "northern capital".  It was opened back in 1703.  Then the bridge rested on wooden beams and consisted of two adjustable parts, which were also made of wood.  This design feature was not an accident.  The bridge was designed in such a way that it could be burned at any time (in the event of an enemy attack). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the end of the XIX century, Ioannovsky bridge was significantly rebuilt.  Through arches under it were laid with a stone.  It was then that the bridge got its modern name. </p><p>  The next major reconstruction of the bridge took place in 1952.  Then he was decorated with metal lanterns and a lattice decorative fence.  In the early 2000s, the bridge experienced a major overhaul.  In particular, the arch was strengthened, the arcades were lined and the pedestrian canvas of the bridge was replaced.  Also, <span>waterproofing of the</span> structure was carried out.  After all this work, the restorers confidently stated that the bridge was protected from destruction for the next thirty years. </p><h2>  A touching monument by the bridge ... </h2><p>  Passing along the Ioannovsky bridge, any tourist will certainly notice an unusual monument located near it.  A small hare sits on one of the wooden piles.  The height of the figure is only 58 centimeters. </p>

    <p>  The sculpture has its own name.  This is a "Monument to the Bunny Who Escaped from the Flood."  According to legend, a frightened animal jumped directly onto the Tsar’s boot of Peter the Great, so as not to die from the furious water element. </p><p>  The figure of a hare was installed in the waters of the canal in 2003.  The monument has no particular architectural or historical value, but tourists and visitors alike love it very much.  Each of them will surely try to throw a coin on a tiny platform at the feet of a hare.  Incredible luck awaits those who succeed in doing this! </p>
