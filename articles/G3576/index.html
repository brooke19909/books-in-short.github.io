After all, it was they who became the basis of rail transport, connecting today the most remote corners of the country.  Many admit that this is one of the most amazing things ever created by man.  A machine that managed to combine air, fire, metal and water. </p><h2>  Steam engine forerunner </h2><p>  The forerunner of steam locomotives in Russia was the twin steam engine, which Ivan Ivanovich Polzunov was the first in the world to invent.  In 1763, he developed a steam engine project, and the next year began to create the machine itself. </p><p>  The project was even approved by the Empress of Russia Catherine II, who encouraged domestic bright minds; she transferred 400 rubles to Polzunov. </p><p>  In 1766, the inventor died at the age of 38, not having lived a week before the first test run of his car.  Apparently, the fatal role was played by the enormous tension at which he worked recently.  Unfortunately, in Soviet times, even his grave was lost, so that the memory of Polzunov was practically not preserved. </p><h2>  First steam locomotive </h2><p>  Russian steam engines originate directly from the machine invented by the father and son Cherepanovs - Efim Alekseevich and Miron Efimovich.  This happened in 1833, two whole years earlier than in Germany. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.istockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="steam locomotive features" class="if uuid-2507146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2507146.jpg"></div><p>  Moreover, the first steam locomotives in Russia were built so successfully that they noticeably differed from their foreign counterparts in their original design solutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The machine created by the Cherepanovs could carry more than three tons of cargo, moving at a speed of about 16 kilometers per hour.  In 1835, they launched a second steam locomotive, the carrying capacity of which increased several times, to 16.4 tons, and the speed remained the same, which was a major achievement. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the first steam locomotive in Russia was called by the word ‚Äústeamboat‚Äù quite unusual to us.  It described the simplest steam engine, which used its own power. </p><h2>  Overseas order </h2><div class="photo" data-original="mesouviens.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian Railways" class="if uuid-2507080" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2507080.jpg"></div><p>  Surprising as it may seem, the first steam locomotives on Russian railways, which began to be used for public use, were ordered not from the Cherepanovs, but abroad.  It happened in 1838.  They began to ply the route Petersburg - Tsarskoye Selo. </p><p>  The basis for the large-scale development of domestic steam locomotive construction was the construction of a railway between Moscow and St. Petersburg.  It began only in 1843.  By the way, for her, cars were already being built at domestic enterprises.  In 1845, they were released at the Alexander factory. </p><p>  By the mid-60s of the XIX century, the history of steam locomotives in Russia was rapidly developing.  This is facilitated by the massive construction of new railways, which leads to an increase in the need for steam locomotives. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1869, steam engines began to be produced at the Kamsko-Votkinsk and Kolomensky plants, and a year later at Maltsevsky and Nevsky.  Since 1892, a series of steam locomotives have been produced at the Putilov, Kharkov, Bryansk, Lugansk, Sormovsky plants. </p><h2>  Own development path </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Domestic Steam Engine" class="if uuid-2507077" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2507077.jpg"></div><p>  It is important that the construction of steam locomotives in Russia developed along its own unique path.  Over time, even a special steam locomotive school was formed. </p><p>  So, in 1878, it was at the <span>Kolomensky Zavod</span> that the world's first passenger locomotives appeared, which had a front trolley.  It was much safer.  Abroad, analogues of such steam engines began to be produced only after 14 years. </p><p>  In 1891, it was in Russia that the first steam locomotive with steam condensation appeared.  And since the end of the 19th century, domestic engineers have been using superheaters everywhere. </p><p>  At the same time, the doctrine of train traction is already being finalized in Russia.  Domestic scientists turned it into a real science, which allowed with extreme accuracy to calculate the speed, mass of the train, the time of its movement, as well as establish the braking distance depending on conditions. </p><h2>  Steam locomotive construction at the beginning of the XX century </h2><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The first steam locomotives in Russia" class="if uuid-2507079" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2507079.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the XX century, Russia finally freed itself from foreign influence in the field of steam locomotive building.  Russian engineers created original forms that met the advanced technologies of their time. </p><p>  From 1898 until the October Revolution, more than 16 thousand steam locomotives were produced in the country.  Moreover, the fleet of these machines was very diverse.  The Ministry of Railways even introduced separate series for private and state roads. </p><h2>  Soviet history </h2><p>  In the history of Russia and the USSR, steam engines occupy a special place.  In Soviet industry, the first steam engines began to be built at the end of 1920.  It was then that a 5-year plan for the restoration and development of the engine economy was adopted. </p><p>  In 1925, it was possible to design one of the best passenger steam locomotives in the world at that time.  In 1931, the most powerful steam locomotive in Europe was launched onto the rails, and next year their mass production began at the Voroshilovgrad plant. </p><p>  This industry also developed after the end of World War II.  In the late 40s, two serial freight steam locomotives were produced in the USSR, and in 1950 a powerful passenger car, which had the highest performance characteristics. </p><h2>  Steam Train Competitors </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of steam locomotives in Russia" class="if uuid-2507078" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2507078.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, steam locomotives begin to seriously yield to electric and diesel locomotives in power and efficiency.  But for many years they surpass them in unpretentiousness and amazing endurance. </p><p>  Surprisingly, the engine is able to withstand overloads of 400% relative to its rated capacity.  In this case, it could be heated by almost any type of fuel.  For example, raw wood, and during the Civil War he was drowned even by dried roach. </p><p>  In addition, it was much cheaper to repair these cars than electric and diesel locomotives, which is why they did not refuse them for so long.  In addition, fuel oil and coal were much cheaper and more affordable than diesel fuel and electricity.  This played a decisive role in the fact that it was the locomotives that ensured the uninterrupted operation of the railways during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  As a result, the history of the engine dates back about 130 years.  Even at the beginning of the 21st century, interest in solid fuel locomotives is still maintained. </p><h2>  The most amazing locomotives </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.railstaff.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of steam locomotives" class="if uuid-2507082" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2507082.jpg"></div><p>  There are many truly unique steam engines in history.  The locomotive is considered the most fault-free, which in 1912 was assigned a series of OBs.  It was as easy to repair and maintain as possible.  It was heated with fuel oil, coal, peat, firewood. </p><p>  In 1930, they transferred to secondary highways, and after that they were used mainly in industrial transport.  This model was operated until the mid-50s. </p><p>  The most massive locomotive in the history of steam locomotive construction was the E-class.  The first cars of this type were released in 1912, finalized and improved them until 1957.  The people called them "Eshaks." </p><p>  Such a locomotive worked in freight and passenger transportation.  In total, about 11 thousand such machines were produced.  Now these locomotives remained only in museums, but they can be seen in many domestic films.  For example, in Elusive Avengers or Admiral. </p><p>  The heaviest engine is the P-38.  Its service weight was as much as 383 with a small ton.  This is with a length of 38 meters.  Due to the temporary suspension of steam locomotive production in Russia, the series turned out to be limited.  As a result, only four freight steam locomotives were produced.  This happened in the mid-1950s.  They still remain in history as the most difficult, and therefore one of the most powerful. </p><p>  A steam locomotive is a technical invention that domestic science can rightfully be proud of. </p>
