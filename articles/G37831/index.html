On the reverse of the dime, the word ‚Äúhryvnia‚Äù was knocked out, and the year of publication was indicated below - 1718. Ten points were located on top of the back side in two lines. </p><p>  What is the dime of 1735?  This year, ten silver kopecks were issued, which were called "Anna Ivanovna's dime".
