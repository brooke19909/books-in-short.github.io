Products from straw are also suitable for decoupage.

They are often made from coarse materials, such as a two-thread or burlap, and adorned with lace, beads or beads, small rhinestones or faux pearls.  Decoupage on fabric on valentines is a beautiful way to express your feelings or just give a loved one an unusual interior decor. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The process of making hearts </h2><p>  First, two identical blanks in the shape of a heart are cut from the material.  They are stitched together, but not completely.  Then cardboard or thick paper is placed inside and with the help of glue a motive is applied on one or both sides.  After complete drying, it is fixed with an iron.  Then cordially you need to stuff with cotton or synthetic winterizer, sew on top a ribbon or eyelet and additionally decorate with lace, rhinestones or other decorative elements.  Products can be made elongated or flattened - it all depends on the taste of the craftswoman.  Very often, such crafts are additionally soaked in coffee or tea, giving the surface a beautiful brownish tint. </p><p>  If you place aromatic herbs or coffee grains inside the heart, it also acquires a pleasant and bright aroma.  Similarly, you can create not only interior items, but also Christmas toys.  Cutting shreds of different shapes, try to make Christmas trees, balls, nesting dolls or little men, decorating them with napkins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mycrafthood.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="valentines decoupage" class="if uuid-2425970" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2425970.jpg"></div><h2>  Fabric decoupage adhesive </h2><p>  Before starting work, prepare the material to facilitate the decoration process.  If you use linen bags, place a rectangle of cardboard inside them - then the base will be rigid, and the surface will stretch and level out.  Then prepare a napkin - cut it into pieces, and then carefully cut the motif and separate the top layer with it. </p><p>  For bonding surfaces, you can use three options for materials: </p><ol><li>  Adhesive for decoupage on fabric - allows you to glue rice paper, napkins and decoupage cards.  This tool is both glue and varnish at the same time.  Its peculiarity is that after use the product remains flexible, soft and waterproof.  Items made using decoupage glue can be washed.  For this, after working with this type of glue and drying, the fabric on the back side needs to be ironed with an iron. </li><li>  Textile glue has the same properties, but is also able to adhere fabric to fabric and is often used for applications.  The product can be washed even with aggressive household products.  All types of decoupage glue need to be fixed with an iron.  Its temperature depends on the type of fabric.  The picture is ironed for five minutes. </li><li>  PVA glue is also used to work with matter, but such things can not be washed and ironed. </li></ol><p>  It is important to monitor the expiration dates of the materials and their storage conditions.  <span>Water-based</span> expired <span>glue</span> can begin to curl, and when frozen, it can completely lose its properties, and the suspension, which is part of acrylic varnishes, sometimes remains sticky after drying.  The more carefully and attentively the decoupage master will follow the instructions given by the adhesive manufacturers, the better the motive will stay on the surface of the material and the longer things will work with decoupage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="emmet.by" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="adhesive varnish for decoupage" class="if uuid-2425977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2425977.jpg"></div><h2>  Dressing a linen bag for a gift </h2><p>  Decoupage on linen has a number of features.  If the matter turns out to be too dark, then the background of the napkin can merge with it and turn into a gray mass.  Therefore, dark surfaces, before decoupage on fabric with ordinary glue, it is advisable to process in a special way.  To do this, you need white acrylic paint, which should be applied to the material with a thin layer using a brush or a piece of foam.  Prime the canvas by applying more paint in the middle and less on the edges.  The background size must match the motive or be slightly larger than it, for a smooth transition of color.  Then dry the paint with a hairdryer.  The degree of drying is easy to verify: when pressed firmly, the palm should remain clean.  The surface can be treated with fine sandpaper to smooth the fibers of the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="girlinthegarage.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage technique" class="if uuid-2424481" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43581/2424481.jpg"></div><h2>  Bonding motive to the surface </h2><p>  Having prepared the surface, put the motive on top and begin to gently apply glue, moving from the center to the edges.  The napkin should be completely saturated with glue, the brush should be removed about 1 cm beyond the canvas.  The pressure on the surface should be sufficient so that the edges of the paper are connected to the material and there are no air bubbles.  Adhesive for decoupage does not contain water in its core, therefore, in the process of decorating the fabric, the napkin will not tear.  If desired, glitter can be poured onto the surface of the bag.  Having finished applying glue, blow dry the surface and, having removed the cardboard, dry the bag inside. </p><p>  If you want to further decorate a product made using the decoupage technique on fabrics, use contour paste - this will add extra volume to the picture.  Tie a bag, leave it to dry for 20 minutes, and then remember a little in your hands to form folds and give the fabric a natural look. </p><h2>  DIY pillow decoration </h2><p>  A popular option for decoupage on fabric with your own hands is the creation of a decorative pillow.  For its design you will need: </p><ul><li>  napkins; </li><li>  blank for pillows; </li><li>  a folder for papers or a thick magazine cover; </li><li>  fabric paints; </li><li>  fabric contours; </li><li>  tassels; </li><li>  masking tape; </li><li>  glue for decoupage; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  pelvis; </li><li>  2 tea bags </li><li>  piece of paper. </li></ul><p>  For pillows, it‚Äôs best to choose delicate, natural materials such as linen or cotton.  In this masterclass on decoupage on fabric, there will be one major central motif and several smaller ones located around the perimeter of the product.  Carefully cut out all the motifs without tearing the edges, otherwise they will have to be repaired in a special way using paint.  Then place them on the material to get the composition.  The largest part should be in the center.  Place a paper folder or thick sheet inside the pillow so as not to stain the back with glue and facilitate further drying of the product.  Moving from the center to the edges, spread the glue over the surface.  Dry the decor for a day. </p><h2>  How to make a pillow border </h2><p>  When the pillow dries, proceed to create a border.  In order to make it smooth, you will need a masking tape.  Stick it around the edges, protecting the pattern.  Then mix acrylics to get the color you want and apply to the fabric with a stiff, synthetic, flat-brushed brush.  You can use a regular sponge for dishes instead.  Place a regular sheet of office paper under the pillow so as not to stain the work surface.  When the paint has dried, remove the <span>masking tape.</span>  This will result in a neat, even colored strip.  Dry the product thoroughly, and then with an iron set to medium temperature, iron the fabric from the inside or through a sheet of baking paper from the face.  This will fix the motive on the material. </p><p>  The pillowcase can be slightly toned, giving a light beige tint.  Any colorant is suitable for dyeing matter - coffee, cinnamon, hibiscus. A regular tea bag will help to give the pillow an aging effect.  Pour warm water into a basin and place a tea bag in it.  Since the motives are fixed, now they are waterproof and will not suffer if the fabric is lowered into the liquid.  Try not to bend the material too much so that the appearance is more accurate.  Dry the pillowcase and iron it again. </p><h2>  Decoupage with PVA glue </h2><div class="photo" data-original="diy-enthusiasts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage with pva" class="if uuid-2425989" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/2425989.jpg"></div><p>  Adhesive for decoupage can be replaced with PVA if the item is not planned to be washed after decor.  It is reasonably accessible and sold at any stationery store or construction markets.  There are special varnishes for decoupage on fabric, allowing you to protect the picture.  If you apply it in several layers, you get a resistant waterproof surface.  Before starting work, the surface of the material must also be primed with white acrylic paint.  Then separate the layer with the motive from the napkin, attach it to the primed part and cover with glue starting from the center.  After drying, it remains only to apply acrylic varnish in several layers. </p><p>  PVA glue is considered to be building glue and is not suitable for creating interior decorations or household items.  In order to obtain a product with a matte surface that is resistant to abrasion and moisture, it is best to use specialized materials for decoupage.  Although their cost is higher, but they are rather economically spent and give a better result than cheap funds. </p>
