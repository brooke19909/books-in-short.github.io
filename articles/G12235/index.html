Unfortunately, in Russia in this sense, not everything is good, but the main thing is that work to eliminate the terrain, albeit slowly, is underway. </p><p>  The list of federal highways of Russia 2015 includes roads connecting the capital with neighboring states and regions of the country. </p><h2>  Classification of roads </h2><p>  Depending on what the roads connect to each other, they are either federal or general use.  The following are considered federal: </p><ul><li>  Tracks laid between administrative centers (indicated by the letter P). </li><li>  Roads connecting federal highways (have an A sign). </li><li>  Entrances leading to major transport links and federal facilities. </li></ul><p>  In the latest edition of the list of roads, all routes going from Moscow in any direction are referred to as the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù.  As for the routes included in the international transport networks, those located on the European part received the designation E, and on the Asian part - AN. </p><p>  In addition to the letter, the road number is always indicated, which is always put after the letter designation.  The list of federal highways of Russia 2015 includes all <span>categories of roads.</span>  For example, only in the direction from Moscow there are more than 20 autobahns, 10 of which lead to the borders of such states as Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Finland, Azerbaijan and Mongolia. </p><p>  All roads of federal significance are serviced, built and repaired from the budget of either the federation, or individuals or legal entities with which an agreement has been signed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Road M1 </h2><p>  <span>The M1 highway,</span> referred to in the register of Russian roads as "Belarus", stretches from Moscow to the border with this country.  In addition to the fact that this road unites two neighboring states, it is part of the international European route E 30 and the Asian route under the number AN 6. </p>

    <p>  Drivers traveling along this path cross the Moscow region, not reaching Odintsovo 4 km, then, past Kubinka and Mozhaisk, they get into the Smolensk region.  The journey is carried out not far from cities such as Gagarin, Vyazma, Safonovo, Yartsevo, and by the bypass road near Smolensk directly to the border of Belarus. </p><p>  <span>The M1 highway is</span> well equipped for safe and comfortable travel.  The road surface is of the highest quality, and 4 lanes allow drivers to choose at what speed to go.  You can relax, tidy up the car and yourself, refuel or buy food at gas stations, motels and cafes located on the highway. </p><p>  Catering facilities are located approximately every 45 km.  Among other roads of federal significance, this route leads in quality of road surface, and decent rest can be obtained in hotels located in the immediate vicinity of the center of Smolensk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In them you can not only take a shower and sleep, but also spend time with benefit in a sauna or pool or eat in a home-style restaurant, such as, for example, in the Usadba hotel, the Koleso, Chaplin hotels and others. </p><p>  While following the M1 highway, you can visit such sights as the ancient Russian city of Mozhaisk, the chapel named after the icon of the Mother of God, located at a healing spring, a monument to the soldiers who died in the Patriotic War of 1812. The cities of Vyazma and Smolensk with their temples and monuments of Russian architecture themselves themselves are a historical attraction. </p><p>  The length of this route is almost 450 km. </p><h2>  Route M 11 </h2><p>  Previously, the M11 road was called Tallinn Highway.  Now the new name of the route - ‚ÄúNarva‚Äù from St. Petersburg through Ivangorod, to the <span>border with Estonia,</span> has the designation A 180. </p><p>  It is part of the European route E20, along which Russians are used to making weekend trips to Estonia.  The length of the road is 142 km, and it passes in a beautiful wooded area.  On the way of travelers there are 2 water barriers in the form of Narva and Meadow, through which bridges are thrown with a lifting capacity of 60 to 80 tons. </p><p>  A turn of 57 km is considered dangerous, which has caused many accidents.  Unfortunately, this road has sections with poor asphalt surface, which should be taken into account when traveling along it at night or on foggy days. </p>

    <p>  The route crosses <span>Krasnoe Selo,</span> Kingisepp (detour 3 km from the city) and Ivangorod. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The M11 road is a freeway between Moscow and St. Petersburg.  A controversial issue along the way is a paid site to Solnechnogorsk.  Due to too high tariffs, which may depend not only on the vehicle itself, but also on the time of day, it is almost empty. </p><p>  The decision to build a high-quality toll road in order to unload the eternal traffic jams in the Leningrad direction failed, since the trip was 1000 rubles.  excluding fuel consumption, 90% of motorists cannot afford it.  The high cost, poor service and lack of high-quality lighting made this track unclaimed. </p><p>  At the end of 2015, the question arose that the tariffs on the M11 road were illegally overstated.  This gives hope that an optimal solution will be found and the amounts will be reviewed.  In this case, drivers will leave the free road with constant traffic jams, but this will happen after the path is fully lit, and gas stations and cafes begin to work. </p><h2>  Track "Don" </h2><p>  The list of federal highways of Russia 2015 includes many routes with a length of more than 1000 km.  M4 is one of them.  It originates on Lipetskaya Street in the capital and stretches almost 1544 km to Novorossiysk. </p><p>  The history of the road began in the middle of the 20th century, but it gained its name (‚ÄúDon‚Äù) only in 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p>

    <p>  Today she goes through: </p><ul><li>  The Moscow region, and to Vidnoye has 8 lanes, whereas after it, up to 71 km, the M4 Don road narrows to 6 lanes (to Saigatov).  The next section - up to 110 km - has 4 divisions. </li><li>  In the Tula region, the route has 4 lanes that have been repaired all the way to Efremov and Bogoroditsk.  Between these two settlements the road is in poor condition, but a paid bypass gives drivers the opportunity to choose: either pay for comfort, or "kill" a car on a free site. </li><li>  In the Lipetsk region, a high-quality 4-lane road with two paid sections is a detour of the cities of Yelets, Yarkin, Zadonsk and Khlevny. </li><li>  All along the Voronezh Region, the M4 ‚ÄúDon‚Äù highway has the quality of asphalt pavement of medium or low level.  Of the 4 lanes, only two are workers in connection with the repair work.  Part of the road has become toll - this is a bypass road of Voronezh and from 544 to 633 km. </li><li>  A good quality 4-lane road passes through the Rostov Region to Kamensk-Shakhtinsk.  This is followed by a section with a continuous double strip, which has a high risk category.  The bridge across the Don was re-renovated in July 2015. There are either safety lines or dividers between the sides of the road.  From the Bataysky post to the entrance to the Krasnodar Territory, the coverage condition is excellent, but this is the most dangerous section of the route, since there are no dividers.  Today, work is underway to expand the route and install a dividing fence. </li><li>  The path along the Krasnodar Territory is complicated by dangerous sections of the route where construction work is underway.  You should be careful after driving through the village of Berezanskaya, since sharp turns are found in this section to bypass road equipment if there is only 1 active lane on each side. </li><li>  On the territory of the Adygea Republic the quality of the Don track is excellent, without dangerous sections. </li><li>  From the Saratov village of the Krasnodar region to Novorossiysk there are many dangerous sections associated with road works. </li></ul><p>  Throughout the route, the service is well developed, but in the summer, places in hotels and motels should be booked in advance.  There are no problems replenishing fuel and food due to the numerous gas stations and convenience stores near them, as well as cafes and fast-food items. </p><h2>  Track "Ural" </h2><p>  Among the roads included in the list of federal highways of Russia 2015, the Ural is considered the busiest with large-sized trucks.  Since this road with a length of 1879 km is part of the European route E 30 and Asian AN6 and runs through the industrial regions of the country, it has the most dense traffic flow. </p><p>  For the first time, the route from Moscow to Ryazan was opened in the 1930s, when the automotive industry was just beginning to develop in the USSR.  In 1947, he was extended to Kuibyshev, and in 1965 a movement was opened to Chelyabinsk. </p>

    <p>  Most of the M5 Ural highway has one lane, only to the village of Dobry Sot, 2 or more lanes on each side.  In the early 2000s, several high-speed sections were introduced, for example, between Gorodishche and Lower Yeluzan, between Togliatti and Krasniy Yar and others. </p><p>  The federal road "Ural" passes through the following areas: </p><ul><li>  In Moscow, she captures Lyubertsy, travels around Bronnitsy and Kolomna, crosses <span>the Moscow</span> and Oka <span>rivers</span> .  The coating quality is excellent. </li><li>  The next is the Ryazan region, along which the road goes round Ryazan, passes by Rybnoye, Shilovo and Shatsk (it can be bypassed along the new bypass route).  On the way for drivers, there are bridges across Pronya and Tsna, as well as recently constructed overpasses through railway lines, on which barriers used to stand, collecting a line of cars for many kilometers. </li><li>  The next stage of the journey is Mordovia.  The only drawback of the road is its small width. </li><li>  In the Penza region, the road captures the settlements of Mokshan, Ramsay and the ‚Äúslice‚Äù of Penza. </li><li>  The next part of the journey is the Ulyanovsk and Samara regions, where the autobahn crosses Zhigulevsk, and then turns towards the Orenburg region and Tatarstan. </li><li>  In the eastern direction, the M5 Ural highway passes Bashkortostan, where two rivers meet on its way - Dema and Belaya. </li><li>  Further progress along the Chelyabinsk region and ends in the city of the same name. </li></ul><p>  If you travel from Moscow to the final point of the route, then passengers will find a change of terrain from a wooded plain to the mountainous part, the highest point of which is 830 m - this is Urenga Pass.  In winter, it is often closed due to snow drifts. </p><p>  Today, the route continues to develop, it is constantly updated, for example, in 2013, the opening of a new bridge across the Belaya River took place.  The most dangerous section of the Ural highway is considered to be a path not far from the settlements of Sim and Ust-Katav, on which, according to the state traffic inspectorate, up to 50 people die annually. </p><h2>  Road M13 </h2><p>  The M13 federal highway is a link between Bryansk, its region, Gomel and Brest.  Its length is only 221 km, and the new designation is A240. </p><p>  This road passes through a picturesque hilly area covered with forests, and has steep ascents and descents, dangerous turns and sections with limited visibility.  The road is equipped with everything necessary, so that even with such a short length, the road was comfortable for motorists. </p><p>  On the way, drivers will meet 5 gas stations, 3 campsites, 3 service stations, 2 ambulances and 5 traffic police posts (10, 77, 130, 164 and 193 km). </p><p>  The road starts in Bryansk, and after crossing the Belarusian border it goes to Gomel.  Along the way, travelers can explore the following attractions: </p><ul><li>  The house of the museum of A.K. Tolstoy in the Red Horn, where he was born and was buried. </li><li>  In the town of Pogar, you can visit the famous tobacco factory where cigars are made. </li><li>  You can get acquainted with leather products at a leather factory in the small town of Klintsy. </li></ul><p>  The M13 road has quality <span>asphalt concrete pavement</span> along the entire route. </p><h2>  Highways M 10 and M 9 </h2><p>  The federal level road, originating in Moscow and known today as the M10 ‚ÄúRussia‚Äù highway, has a continuation under the name ‚ÄúScandinavia‚Äù. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù part of the road includes the road connecting Moscow with Tver, Veliky Novgorod and St. Petersburg.  Part of "Scandinavia" begins from St. Petersburg to Vyborg and the Finnish border. </p>

    <p>  This is one of the oldest roads in Russia, built by decree of Peter the Great to connect Moscow with the new capital as a single highway equipped with horse-changing centers (pits) where you could spend the night, eat or ride out the weather. </p><p>  Another plus of building the old road was its positive impact on the development of the economy of the cities through which it passed.  Since today the route runs through 65 cities and towns, you cannot call it expressway due to current speed limits within the settlement. </p><p>  The M10 ‚ÄúScandinavia‚Äù highway goes to Vyborg, to the border with Finland.  Numerous motels are located along the entire route from Moscow, the cost of living in which per day ranges from 600 to 1700 rubles.  There is also no shortage of gas stations and service stations. </p><p>  The most dangerous sections on this route are places where there are no dividers, and an unequipped roadside is dangerous, especially in ice or rain. </p><p>  The M9 ‚ÄúBaltia‚Äù highway originates from Moscow, goes to Volokolamsk and further to the border with Latvia.  As part of the E22 international route, it is heavily loaded with trucks traveling from Europe to Latvia. </p><p>  Along the way, drivers cross rivers such as Istra, Vazuza, Mezha, <span>Zapadnaya Dvina</span> and others.  Excellent coating quality can be traced along the entire 610-kilometer track.  With the exception of a small part of the road in the Tver region, the entire route is considered safe, allowing speeds up to 140-150 km / h. </p><p>  The route of the Baltiya highway passes through the Moscow, Tver and Pskov regions.  In 2007 and 2015  the road was undergoing reconstruction, and repairs will continue. </p><h2>  Highways M6, M7 and M8 </h2><p>  The M6 ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúCaspian‚Äù federal highway has a length of 1831 km and is part of the European (E119) and Asian (AN8) routes from Moscow via Tambov and Volgograd to Astrakhan.  The designation with the letter "M" will be valid until December 31, 2017, after which it will be renamed to the federal road P22, which combines several administrative centers of Russia. </p><p>  Once, at the dawn of the emergence of the Russian state, the Nogai Way was the most important for the economic and trade growth of the country in the same direction. </p><p>  The construction of the modern ‚ÄúCaspian‚Äù highway began back in 1952 with a two-sided hard-surfaced canvas of the second category.  On the section from the capital to Kashira, 4 lanes were equipped.  The construction itself was carried out in stages.  The first road was handed over from Moscow to Tambov, then a part was built to Volgograd. </p>

    <p>  After the Soviet Union collapsed, the road from Volgograd to Astrakhan was attached to this highway, M6 number and the name "Caspian" were assigned. </p><p>  Part of the track has a double continuous strip, which greatly slows down the movement, especially in the fall.  Due to the large flow of trucks that strive to overtake impatient car drivers, head-on collisions often occur during this period. </p><p>  A feature of this route is the complete lack of access through settlements. </p><p>  The M7 Volga route stretched from Moscow through Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan to Ufa for 1342 km.  The road crosses the Moscow, Vladimir and Nizhny Novgorod regions, as well as Chuvashia, Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. </p><p>  The condition of the road is greatly influenced by the increased humidity of the cave marshes, through which it passes.  This route, on the contrary, is distinguished by a large number of traffic lights in the numerous settlements through which it is laid.  Currently, reconstruction and construction work is underway on various sections of the road, so you should be alert because of two narrow lanes and a small roadside where it is difficult to make maneuvers. </p><p>  The federal highway M8 ‚ÄúKholmogory‚Äù connects Moscow, <span>Yaroslavl, Vologda</span> and Arkhangelsk.  The length of the road is 1271 km, which offers travelers more attractions than any other way. </p><p>  The Kholmogory route was laid through Moscow, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Vologda and Arkhangelsk regions, where each of the settlements encountered along the way is an object of architectural and historical sight. </p><p>  In general, the state of the track is good, but there is congestion due to heavy traffic.  The weak link is the road from Velsk to Arkhangelsk. </p><h2>  Highways M2 and M3 </h2><p> Everyone who goes to rest in the summer to the sea is well acquainted with the M2 ‚ÄúCrimea‚Äù highway.  On the way from Moscow, travelers pass Tula, Oryol, Kursk and Belgorod.  Then follows the state border of Ukraine, after which the road is listed as M20 to the city of Kharkov and M18 further, through Zaporozhye and Simferopol to Yalta. </p><p>  The first route "Crimea" was introduced in 1950 and stretches for 720 km, although its history goes deep into the centuries.  Once it was the famous Crimean Way, and the path from the capital to Kharkov was built in the middle of the 19th century. </p>

    <p>  Large construction work throughout the route was carried out from the late 70s to the end of the 80s of the last century.  After the collapse of the USSR and the division of the road into 2 sections in neighboring states, the flow of tourists decreased and its value decreased.  High-quality road surface and good service along the way, leave a good impression of traveling along it even in the summer busy season. </p><p>  M3 highway "Ukraine" leads from Moscow through Kaluga and Bryansk to the border with Ukraine.  The route is 500 km long and was commissioned in 1976. </p><p>  For this road, a speed limit of 90 km / h is indicated, except for sections when it passes through settlements.  In plans to improve Russian roads, this route has been included for a complete reconstruction, and the section from 37 to 173 km will be paid. </p><p>  The road in many places, for example from Obninsk to Bryansk, is in poor condition, so you should be careful.  On the way there are many water barriers (Nara, Ugra, Oka, Snezhet, etc.), through which bridges are laid with a carrying capacity of 60 to 80 tons. </p><p>  All over, from Kaluga to the state border, there are many dangerous sites. </p><h2>  M18 highway </h2><p>  The M18 highway will have this designation until 01/01/2018, after which the public road, included in the list of federal highways of Russia, will be renamed to P21 Kola. </p><p>  It originates in St. Petersburg, follows through Petrozavodsk, Murmansk, Pecheneg, Borisoglebsky to the border with Norway.  The route is almost 1,592 km long.  Being a connecting link between the Leningrad region, Karelia and Murmansk, this route passes through the picturesque places of the Russian North. </p><p>  The road goes past cities with a distinctive history and noteworthy sights.  Not all sections of the path can be called perfectly smooth, and off-road is also found, but the general impression of the Kola highway is good due to the terrain through which it is laid. </p><p>  Along the route, gas stations, service stations and numerous motels are equipped, offering travelers not only quality rest, but also leisure.  There is also no shortage of fast food points, cafes and shops where you can replenish your food and water supplies. </p>
