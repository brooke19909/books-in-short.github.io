    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the era of ancient Rome, the town was just a small village.  And now Monastir attracts many tourists with inexpensive holidays and endless white beaches, historical sights, modern thalassotherapy centers.  The city is also popular because of its proximity to the youth resort - the city of Sousse.  The tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSkanes is outside the Monastir, thanks to which it was possible to maintain a unique atmosphere. </p><p>  The resort currently has good infrastructure and is a great place for families.  The nightlife here is not as stormy as, for example, in Sousse, but nevertheless, the city has a lot of restaurants and cafes, shops and shops, and pleasant places for walking.  Life in Monastir rages only in the summer, when the season ends, the city is almost dying out, only a small local population remains in it. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Monastir is filled with historical places that may be of interest to tourists.  The ruins of Rabat Hartem are considered a symbol of the city.  This defensive structure was built in the eighth century, later it became part of the entire defensive fortress.  In Monastir you should see the old part of the city (medina), the Great Mosque with marble columns, you can visit the museum of national costumes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magic skanes family resort 4 tunisia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1502720.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Shopping lovers can buy all kinds of trinkets, ceramics, cosmetics based on natural oils, key rings, souvenirs in the large supermarket Yasmina Center, which is located on the medina. </p><p>  The best restaurants of the city are located in the port, they are worth a visit to taste delicious and fresh seafood dishes, as well as national food. </p><p>  Monastir is popular for diving.  The underwater world is not as rich as in other places, but still there is something to see.  In small bays you can admire the underwater fauna, reefs, see starfish, hedgehogs, sponges and algae. </p><h2>  Magic Skanes Family Resort 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation, I would like to refer to the reviews of vacationers who visited the hotel.  Almost all tourists are satisfied with the service and living conditions in the complex.  Frequent guests of the complex note that in different periods there are changes in nutrition and animation.  In high season, the variety of dishes at the buffet is simply amazing, as is the intensity of the entertainment.  In September and October, the resort gradually calms down, and the hotel staff becomes noticeably smaller, as well as animators.  This certainly affects service and entertainment.  However, such nuances are not so critical. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magic skanes family resort 4 reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1502721.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel complex is quite spacious and has good rooms, which have everything that tourists need.  Some of them go to the amphitheater, where evening performances take place.  These apartments are not entirely suitable for those who crave silence in the evenings, as entertainment programs end late.  If you wish, you can contact the reception and replace the room with another one located in a more peaceful place.  As a rule, guests are welcomed, sometimes you can even do without surcharges. </p><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, tips can be left at will.  Maids change towels, but sometimes they have to remind them of this. </p><p>  As for food at Magic Skanes Family Resort <span>4 * (Tunisia), reviews</span> about it speak for themselves.  Most guests note the variety of buffets.  So, for example, for lunch and dinner they offer at least five meat dishes, not including seafood.  Salads and snacks are also varied.  From fruits you can try: grapes, oranges, melons, plums, peaches.  The waiters immediately replenish the ending dishes.  There are no lines in the restaurant.  The menu even has vegetarian food. </p><p>  A huge plus of the complex is the presence of its own beach, which is not allowed on by representatives of the local population and strangers.  There is constantly security on the shore; a police patrol car periodically arrives.  The hotel is located on the coast, the road to the beach does not take more than a few minutes.  The beach is sandy, with a gentle descent into the water.  The sea is warm and clean.  During the storms that occur in September and October, algae appear, but hotel workers try to clean them in time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="magic skanes family resort 4 tunisia reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1502725.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Tourists especially praise the incendiary team of hotel animators.  Every morning they invite vacationers to exercise and water aerobics, after which everyone receives a boost of energy and energy for the whole day.  Animators do not forget about children, occupying them with interesting events.  Kids do not even notice how quickly time flies.  Well, an evening disco for young guests is the highlight of the program. </p><p>  Adults are also satisfied with the show programs.  It is simply impossible to be bored here.  You can also watch local attractions as an entertainment.  At the hotel there are always representatives of tour operators offering trips.  To use their services or to travel on their own - you decide.  Knowledgeable tourists are advised to visit Monastir on their own, but on a tour of the Sahara you need to go only with a guide. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Magic Skanes Family Resort 4 * is a good option for a budget holiday combining excellent conditions and varied food.  Tunisia has long been popular with tourists from all over the world due to its beautiful beaches and affordable prices.  Therefore, if you plan to visit it, then you should pay attention to the Magic Skanes Family Resort 4 * hotel.  Of course, as in any other place, there are some disadvantages, but in general, tourists are very happy with their stay at the hotel. </p>
