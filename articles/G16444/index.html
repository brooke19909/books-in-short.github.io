    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, Hotel Palais Des Roses 4 * is located on the seafront, in the tourist area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAgadir.  This is the prefecture of Souss-Massa-Draa, which, in turn, is the administrative region of Morocco, the state of North Africa.  Recently, these places began to enjoy great popularity among people who want to relax for relatively little money in some exotic, unusual country. </p><p>  Here is the Hotel Palais Des Roses 4 *.  From it, the center of Agadir can be reached in about 15 minutes, and on foot.  The hotel, by the way, can be seen from afar.  It is built in a traditional Arabic style.  There is this place, by the way, for 13 years.  And during this time, the complex managed to become popular.  Many guests returned more than once here. </p><p>  By the way, the airport is located not far from the hotel.  It can be reached in about 10 minutes. And this is another plus. </p><h2>  Fun and relaxation </h2><p>  The hotel has everything you need for a pleasant and positive pastime.  Two terraces (one of which is for sunbathing), an outdoor swimming pool, barbecue and garden.  This is just what is available in the open air.  In addition to the items listed in the Hotel Palais Des Roses 4 *, there are show animations every night.  There is also karaoke.  And if this is not interesting for guests, they can play billiards, darts or tennis.  The hotel also has a fitness center - there are all the necessary equipment for a full workout. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a SPA center in the hotel, where guests can devote time to cosmetic or wellness treatments.  Many especially enjoy the Turkish bath, massage and indoor swimming pool. </p><p>  Many people come here, taking their children with them.  The hotel administration also made sure that the little guests were also comfortable and interesting.  A children's club and a separate playground are organized for them.  And also a separate entertainment area, located indoors.  The hotel also has special protective barriers for children.  And parents can use the <span>services of nannies</span> and carers if they want to be together, and the child can not be left alone.  Babysitters follow children properly - play, read, assemble puzzles together, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  In the Hotel Palais Des Roses 4 * (Agadir) there are several institutions offering gastronomic variety.  The restaurant serves its guests a buffet, but a menu is still available.  If guests are on a diet, then they may not worry - they will be given a special choice.  Here, by the way, breakfast is delivered to your room.  There is also a snack bar.  But there is no alcohol in the hotel - such are the rules here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Guests can enjoy Mediterranean, international and <span>Moroccan dishes at the establishments.</span>  Fish lovers will especially appreciate the main restaurant, because it offers a huge selection of seafood. </p><p>  The only negative is that the drinks that the restaurant visitors order during lunch or dinner must be paid separately, even if the guests took the all-inclusive service. </p><p>  But every evening in the institution plays live national music.  And the service in the restaurants is pleasant, unobtrusive.  The waiters know their stuff.  By the way, lovers will especially have to smoke a hookah - they make it there, and smoke connoisseurs sit in a separate area.  There is also a cigar room. </p>
