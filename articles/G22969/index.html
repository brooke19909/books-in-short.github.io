This is evidenced by the millions of flows of tourists visiting Crete daily.  The attractiveness of the island is due to the ability to combine beach tours with sightseeing.  Holidays on the island of Minotaur will appeal to both fans of lazy pastime and inquisitive tourists who travel from place to place in order to see more attractions.  There are so many of them in Crete that it is unlikely to be able to inspect everything at once in one visit.  As for the level of service in the hotels of the island, then this is also okay here.  The most popular among Russian tourists are <span>4 * hotels</span> in which you can get the highest service at relatively low prices.  So, for example, a week-long rest at the Mare Monte <span>Beach Hotel 4 *</span> (Crete) costs from 25,000 rubles per person.  The hotel is located near the city of Chania - the second city after the Heraklion island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mare monte beach hotel 4" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/477298.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Chania - the pearl of Crete </h2><p>  Due to the abundance of canals and rivers flowing through the city, Chania is called the Greek Venice.  In spring, the city is buried in the bushes of flowering jasmine, and its aroma is interrupted by the brackish smell of the sea.  The city is located in the western part of the island.  It is not as dry as in the eastern and southern parts, so you can see densely growing forests and gardens, flowering shrubs and a lush carpet of greenery around the hotel complexes.  The most popular resorts in the Chania area are the villages of Platanias, Kavros and Georgioupolis.  In the latter, among the greenery of gardens, is the snow-white building of the Mare Monte Beach Hotel 4 * hotel.  But before proceeding to the description of this fashionable complex, which, according to Russian tourists, is one of the best in all of Chania, I would like to stop at the village of Georgioupolis and briefly describe its attractions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Garden City </h2><p>  In fact, this resort is very green, just an eye happy.  Numerous restaurants, cafes, taverns and bars are buried in flowering bushes and eucalyptus and cypress trees.  The hotels here are small, mostly painted in white or very light pastel colors, which is in perfect harmony with the natural picture.  The town has a small port, on both sides of which stretch gorgeous golden beaches.  In a word, in this town, next to which is the Mare Monte Beach Hotel 4 *, miraculously combines white, turquoise, emerald and gold shades, forming an incredibly beautiful landscape.  Georgioupolis beach is divided into several parts by small rivers, Almiros and Perastikos.  At the place of their confluence, the water in the sea is cold; there are strong currents.  By the way, in earlier times, this village was called Almiroupoli, in honor of the Almyros River flowing along it. </p><p>  The holiday season in these places lasts from April to October.  It is especially beautiful here, of course, at the beginning of the season, when the city is in full bloom.  Summer is sometimes very hot, and the thermometer reaches 40 degrees or more, but the sea water is not very warm due to the currents, which helps to cool on especially hot days. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So, you decided to spend your vacation on the island of Crete, at the Mare Monte Beach Hotel 4 *.  ‚ÄúBiblio Globus‚Äù is one of the best tour operators in the Mediterranean countries, and if you decide to use the services of this company, then it organizes your vacation at the highest level.  Holiday packages from Biblio Globus include air travel, transfer, hotel accommodation, excursions, etc. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Despite the fact that there is an airport in Chania, there are no direct flights from Moscow and other major cities of the Russian Federation and the CIS.  You will have to fly with a change either through Athens or through Thessaloniki.  However, most tourists prefer to fly to <span>Heraklion airport,</span> and then from there go by road to Georgioupolis, where the Mare Monte Beach Hotel 4 * is located.  When compiling a package, the tour operator, as noted above, takes into account the costs associated with delivery from the airport to the hotel (transfer).  Therefore, a travel agent will meet you at the airport terminal and deliver you to the desired hotel. </p><p>  The distance from the capital to the resort is 103 km, therefore, only 1-1.5 hours will be spent on the path.  Chania Airport is only 40 kilometers away.  From there you can get to the hotel even faster, somewhere in half an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mare monte beach hotel 4 reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/477300.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  No matter how the infrastructure is developed, the main thing for any resort hotel is the beach.
