Highly qualified specialists who annually study abroad work on modern equipment, which determines the high efficiency of treatment.  However, is this the only thing?  It would be logical to assume that the <span>salary of doctors</span> in Germany is the same ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù, spurring much better than the Russian ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="careertrend.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the salary of doctors in germany" class="if uuid-2754827" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754827.jpg"></div><h2>  Some international medical statistics </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that the profession of an anesthetist is the most prestigious and highly paid.  In some regions of the world, the average salary of this specialist exceeds 160 thousand euros per year.  Gynecologists are in second place, followed by surgeons, and then dentists. </p><p>  Why do doctors working in Germany complain about their salaries?  And it‚Äôs not easy to bay among themselves, but they are frankly indignant, running to <span>work in Switzerland,</span> Great Britain and the Netherlands.  It turns out that the Federal Republic is the weakest link in international medical and economic statistics?  It turns out that the salary of doctors in Germany is much lower than in other European countries?  Is it really? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.healthline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="average doctor salary in Germany" class="if uuid-2754821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754821.jpg"></div><h2>  What is net profit? </h2><p>  Just the other day, all the <span>German media</span> unanimously declared that the "net" (not average) salary of a doctor in Germany ranges from 5,500 euros per month.  Is it a lot or a little?  It is clear that for the Russian specialist this is the cosmic sum.  But what about the German luminaries of medicine? </p><p>  To understand how well a doctor earns in Germany, two concepts should be compared: net profit and net income of an average German family, excluding benefits.  Using simple mathematical calculations, we can calculate that the salary of an ordinary German family is almost 2,900 euros, which is half the income of a medical worker. </p><p>  It is impossible to say that these statistics are reliable.  Indeed, the income of a person with secondary education is taken into account and compared with the profit of a person who owns prestigious higher education.  To understand the salary of doctors in Germany, it is necessary to compare the income of specialists in related professions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="healthcareinamerica.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="salary of a surgeon in Germany" class="if uuid-2754842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754842.jpg"></div><h2>  Average, minimum and maximum living standards in Germany </h2><p>  The average salary of citizens of the Federal Republic is 2,800 euros (as of 2018).  This applies to general indicators, excluding tax deductions and other obligatory payments.  It is important to consider that German taxes are extremely delicate.  The percentage of income tax depends on the size of income, social status, marital status and some other points.  For this reason, many qualified professionals complain that taxes often eat up half of their earnings.  Needless to say, this greatly affects the family budget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  On average, Germans pay the state about 20-25% of their monthly income.  It is clear that not everyone is forced to pay large taxes.  For example, the average <span>salary of a</span> hairdresser is a little more than 1,000 euros.  Accordingly, he pays less tax. </p><p>  Salaries exceeding 6 thousand euros are considered high and prestigious.  People with such earnings are equated with the elite.  Since 2018, a single minimum wage in the amount of 1,500 euros has been operating in the state. </p><h2>  What determines the salary of doctors in Germany? </h2><p>  The amount of monthly earnings may vary depending on the region, the location of the clinic and its profile.  For example, specialists from rehabilitation centers earn an order of magnitude less than their colleagues working in the medical field.  A young specialist with no work experience can expect a salary of just over 4,000 euros.  Of these, 25-30% will have to be given to the state, another 10-15% to pay for utilities and other obligatory payments.  With all the deductions, the young specialist remains ‚Äúclean‚Äù 2,500 euros.  But that is not all. </p><p>  As a rule, in Germany annually raise wages.  A medical specialist who has just received an education cannot claim a high income.  However, after 6 years of practice, his qualifications are equated with the highest category.  Accordingly, the income level increases to 9,000 euros. </p><p>  It is difficult to answer the question of what is the average salary of doctors in Germany, since much also depends on the specialization of the doctor. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.irishtimes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="salary of a surgeon in Germany" class="if uuid-2754868" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754868.jpg"></div><h2>  The most sought after professions </h2><p>  Today, Germany is in dire need of medical specialists.  Private and public clinics are in search of qualified employees.  The Federal Republic is doing everything possible to attract as many foreign specialists as possible.  So, graduates of Russian and Belarusian universities are appreciated.  It is clear that these graduates, and not those who have acquired their diploma in the transition. </p><p>  Among the whole variety of medical profiles, specialists in the following areas can most likely find work in Germany: </p><ul><li>  anesthetists; </li><li>  therapists; </li><li>  gynecologists; </li><li>  family doctors; </li><li>  psychiatrists; </li><li>  neurologists. </li></ul><p>  Given that the salary of a gynecologist in Germany is much higher than our domestic specialist receives, one wonders why higher minds are flowing to Europe. </p><div class="photo" data-original="multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="gynecologist salary in Germany" class="if uuid-2754859" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754859.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get a job? </h2><p>  Have to go through a series of bureaucratic procedures.  Worth it or not - this is a private matter.  But as migration practice shows, not many are eager to return to Russia.  One diploma will not be enough.  It is necessary to obtain another similar document, only of international standard.  It is advisable to study a foreign language at this stage.  And not superficially, but in-depth - with the help of a tutor and conversational practice. </p><p>  In addition, you need to get a visa with the right to further employment.  To register in the government departments of the Federal Republic, as well as to find a potential employer who agrees to hire a foreign specialist, taking into account the time required to complete the practice. </p><p>  If everything is done promptly and punctures are eliminated at each stage, then in a year and a half or two years you can admire the view of the Rhine from the window of your own office in a prestigious clinic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="health.clevelandclinic.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="average doctor salary in Germany" class="if uuid-2754866" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754866.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits and Prospects </h2><p>  Many who think about international medical practice and work abroad know that the salary of a surgeon in Germany is much higher than that of a domestic specialist.  However, income is not the only positive side.  Besides: </p><ul><li>  decent standard of living; </li><li>  the opportunity to move the whole family; </li><li>  equivalent powers with other German specialists; </li><li>  the opportunity to gain invaluable medical experience and internship outside Germany; </li><li>  social guarantees. </li></ul><p>  You probably thought about why the Federal Republic is trying by any means to attract as many qualified specialists as possible.  The fact is that Germany is one of the ‚Äúaging‚Äù countries.  Over 40% of medical professionals have crossed the age of 50.  Therefore, a good medical education and work experience is so valued in the country. </p><div class="photo" data-original="time.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the average salary of doctors in germany" class="if uuid-2754836" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49954/2754836.jpg"></div><h2>  Doctors of all countries, unite! </h2><p>  Today, about 8,000 specialists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, etc. work in German clinics. This only means that every graduate of a medical university can expect that one day he will get a position in a German clinic.  The main thing is to start learning the language as early as possible and diligently walk in pairs. </p><p>  Knowing what the average salary of doctors in Germany is, it is easy to guess that students of Russian universities are already in their first courses thinking about moving to another country.  Fortunately, the Federal Republic creates all conditions for the immigration of doctors from the CIS countries. </p>
