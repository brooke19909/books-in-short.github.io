It allows you to always stay in touch with business partners, loved ones and relatives.  Moreover, over the past ten years, there have simply been a huge number of communication methods - these are instant messengers, and video calls, and instant voice messages. </p><p>  A smartphone every day becomes a truly universal tool.  It is such a universal gadget that Huawei developed.  It's about the Honor 4C Pro gadget, reviews of which have a positive connotation, and users are mostly satisfied with their purchase.  But first things first. </p><h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  Smartphones come with both attractive and frankly unsuccessful design, and in this regard, Huawei designers did not fail.  The model turned out to be attractive, in no way resembling a faceless brick. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the body is made mainly of plastic, it does not creak and is pleasantly in the hand.  Plastic is odorless and does not look cheap, and the textured back cover gives the device its charm and elegance.  The frame is also made of plastic, but a rather high-quality imitation of metal is created.  However, do not forget that a metallized coating with intensive careless use can quickly go away and the view will be unattractive, so it will not be out of place to use a transparent silicone bumper. </p><p>  Among all the colors, it is worth highlighting the Huawei Honor 4C Pro Gold smartphone, reviews of which are of the most positive connotation, since this particular design looks as rich as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is surprising that, despite the non-removable battery, the phone received a removable cover.  Under it are slots for two SIM cards that have become the standard microSIM format and microSD card.  No lateral combined trays, no problems with the choice of what to put - a second SIM card or additional memory.  This wins the Huawei Honor 4C Pro smartphone from other Chinese with a non-removable battery, reviews notice this positive side. </p>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Perhaps this is one of the strengths of this smartphone.  The manufacturer installed a battery with an honest capacity of 4000 mAh, which, given the rather undemanding iron, is enough for two or even three days of quite active use without difficulty.  If necessary, the smartphone Huawei Honor 4C Pro Gold, the battery reviews of which are only positive, can be used as a portable battery for other devices, for example, Bluetooth headsets. </p><p>  For charging, it is better to use a standard adapter and cable, which are capable of delivering charging current up to 2A.  Under such conditions, the battery charges from 0 to 100 percent in a half to two hours. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Perhaps, at this moment, you can blame the manufacturer a little, because the brightness of the display is enough for comfortable use only indoors or in cloudy weather.  In addition, the brightness is greatly reduced if you tilt the display slightly in any direction.  When using a smartphone outdoors in bright, sunny weather, you will have to make an effort to see the picture.  Regarding the Huawei Honor 4C Pro 5, user reviews recommend turning off the auto brightness control and twisting it to the maximum if you have a walk on a nice day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, as a small compensation for the inconvenience, a protective film was put in the kit.  Again, it is unclear why it is not glued to the display immediately, like other Chinese manufacturers supplying film with the device.  But one way or another, and you have to glue it yourself, carefully driving out the air bubbles.  Thanks to it, the smartphone Huawei Honor 4C Pro, reviews about the quality of the display coverage of which are ambiguous, will receive additional protection. </p>

    <h2>  "Iron" characteristics </h2><p>  The main think tank is the chipset from the Chinese company MediaTek MT6735, which has four cores.  Each of them operates at a frequency of up to 1.3 GHz.  Complement it with 2 GB of RAM standard DDR3.  This bundle in most cases is enough for convenient and hassle-free work with most applications.  However, you should not expect that the smartphone will cope with too demanding modern games. </p><p>  The main reason for the presence of this particular chipset was its low price (the model is still a budget), as well as low energy consumption during operation.  Nevertheless, given a bunch, given the rather well-optimized system manufacturer, it‚Äôs enough to gain, according to what the Huawei Honor 4C Pro reviews say, about 32,000 points in Antutu. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Non-volatile memory of 16 GB is provided for storing system and user files, of which about 10 GB are left to the user out of the box.  If necessary, it can be expanded with a microSD card up to 128 GB, however, as the practice of users of Huawei Honor 4C Pro 16 GB shows, their reviews and ratings, it is better not to use cards larger than 64 GB. </p>

    <h2>  Software </h2><p>  Quite a competent decision on the part of the developer was to use the lightweight assembly "Android 5.1", supplemented by the EMUI 3.1 interface.  It reduced the requirements for iron and allowed more economical use of battery power.  The interface is quite pleasant and does not openly give away Chinese solutions and excessive "beauties", which is an additional plus for the Huawei Honor 4C Pro 16 GB.  Reviews from many users emphasize this point. </p><p>  The application menu in the shell is not provided, they are all on the desktops.  If desired, they can be compactly sorted into thematic folders.  The upper curtain is also conveniently organized - the space is divided into two parts, thanks to which both basic settings and notifications are available at the same time. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The camera resolution of the smartphone is 13 megapixels.  But do not immediately praise this camera for the rather large size of the resulting photos.  Either the firmware is not optimized enough, or the optics are not very well matched, but quite distinct noise is noticeable in the photos if they are not made in perfect lighting.  Such photos are enough to capture an important point, take a picture of the text or take a photo for social networks, but nothing more.  About Huawei Honor 4C Pro Gold the reviews are mixed though, and some people like the camera, despite the noise. </p><p>  However, it is worth noting the positive side - the camera application starts almost instantly, focusing is fast and accurate.  So for the average layman who is not trying to achieve the ideal in the photo, the camera will be more than enough.  If you wish, you can easily find a large number of examples of photos taken with this phone on the network. </p><p>  There are quite positive reviews about the front camera of Honor 4C Pro; it‚Äôs quite enough for comfortable use of video messengers.  If necessary, you can take a selfie, but with a prerequisite in the form of high-quality lighting, otherwise the photo will also be quite noisy. </p>

    <h2>  Positive sides according to user reviews </h2><p>  On average, the gadget receives ratings on the services of reviews significantly higher than the average, about 4.5 out of 5. This suggests that in general, users are satisfied with the quality of the smartphone and its price / performance ratio.  The main positive aspects, noticed by people who bought it earlier, are as follows: </p><ul><li>  The main indisputable plus of the Honor 4C Pro (reviews repeatedly emphasize it) is a capacious battery, which at the same time could remain quite thin, which allowed us to make a nice case that does not look like a brick. </li><li>  High-quality GPS, in any weather, almost instantly starting from a "cold" start.  Confident signal reception even in adverse conditions. </li><li>  As for the state employee, still a good camera that allows you to make high-quality pictures in good light.  Quick focus and high speed shooting. </li><li>  Design and quality of the case.  Despite the fact that it is made of plastic, users notice the solidity and pleasant appearance. </li><li>  The technology of fast charging, which allows not to linger for a long time at the outlet. </li><li>  Well-optimized operating system that allows you to use the capabilities of the iron component to the maximum and provides comfortable operation in most applications, as well as saving battery power. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, a lot of positive aspects have been noticed, but the fact that users do not like it as a result is not complete.  Let's look at the cons of this gadget. </p><h2>  Negative sides </h2><p>  Some points can be uncomfortable, and with respect to the Honor 4C Pro, reviews note this, but they are not critical.  The following is a list of exactly such nuances that you should think about before buying: </p><ul><li>  The lack of the ability to shoot video in FullHD, despite its support from the iron.  Poor video quality, poor focus when shooting. </li><li>  Lack of performance in some demanding applications. </li><li>  Many users note as a minus the lack of headphones in the kit, although this is already a personal opinion of each user.  Ultimately, this moment reduces the purchase price of the device itself. </li><li>  Display backlight quality, low brightness for outdoor use. </li><li>  Case heating in the camera area when working with demanding applications.  Battery heating during fast charging. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The Honor 4C Pro smartphone, the reviews we reviewed, is ideal for those who want to get a device with good autonomy and the ability to use high-speed mobile Internet.  Cons should be simply considered, and if they are not critical, ignore them. </p><p>  In general, the device turned out to be successful and attractive, with a pleasant appearance, having signs of luxury and elegance.  It is not a shame to get it as the main device for communication, but it will not allow you to make a truly multimedia device with support for heavy graphics. </p>
