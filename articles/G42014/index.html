    <p>  The design bureau BIO-architects (leader Ivan Ovchinnikov) launched the DublDom project.  A great option for a suburban residential building, and for an office or cafe. </p><p>  The idea is to offer middle-income people a fully equipped house for living.  In it, the use of modern technology is balanced with an affordable price. </p><h2>  Briefly: what is DublDom? </h2><p>  The modules for this house are completely assembled in the workshop, and they also make wiring for electricity and sewage.  Install plumbing, install lighting.  Directly on the site, the modules are assembled in one building, and the finished house is connected to communication networks. </p><p>  DublDom, as mentioned in all reviews, immediately attracts attention with its design and layout.  It is energy efficient, environmentally friendly, quick to build and economical.  A whole line of models of various sizes and configurations has been developed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  In short, this is: </p><ul><li>  Mobility of movement.  The weight of one module is less than 2 tons; it is transported by a regular truck. </li><li>  Build speed.  Specialists install communications directly in the workshop in just 1-3 days.  The production of the modules themselves takes 4-8 weeks.  The finished house is mounted on a site from 1 to 14 days.  The timing of installation depends on the size of the house. </li><li>  Saves customer time.  No need to rush about in search of an artist, spend time on the purchase of materials, construction control. </li></ul><p>  According to customer reviews, DublDom houses have an optimal ratio between price, quality and installation time.  The building is delivered ready-made. </p><h2>  What are the other advantages of DublDom for the owner? </h2><p>  Characteristics that today are recognized as significant in their reviews of DublDom by all its owners: </p><ul><li>  Warm - a layer of a heater of 150 mm and energy-saving double-glazed windows. </li><li>  The volume of the house is fully used - a large selection of layouts, spacious rooms, a modern kitchen. </li><li>  Functional division into zones, on the side there is an entrance with a vestibule. </li><li>  The architecture of the house resembles the Scandinavian style, which looks very modern. </li><li>  Very bright - a fully glazed butt, large windows, an anti-aircraft lamp in the cooking zone and a glassed front door at the rear.  This review about DublDom is confirmed by photos of any models of new buildings. </li></ul><h2>  Modularity and its capabilities </h2><p>  The DublDom modules, according to the reviews of its creators, can be folded as a designer, creating a house of an interesting configuration and the required area.  Starting from 40 m¬≤, you can eventually increase your housing to 130 m¬≤ or more.  <span>Do not worry, you</span> do not need to disassemble anything.  Additional modules are easy to attach to those that already exist.  True, a design with a second floor has not yet been developed, but manufacturers are thinking about this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Design description </h2><p>  The base of the house is a wooden frame with mineral insulation (150 mm).  Outside is a windproof film.  This helps maintain heat better than a half-meter thick brick wall. </p><p>  The type of foundation is chosen by the future owner on his own.  An alternative to a strip or block foundation can be screw piles.  It is quite acceptable, since the weight of the modules is small.  The foundation of screw piles is useful in those areas where groundwater is located nearby. </p><p>  Outside, the walls and the roof are sheathed with a metal profile sheet.  This is standard equipment.  The reviews of DublDom mention that in bad weather rain is drumming on the metal roof, but this only makes it more comfortable. </p><p>  Another finish is also offered - with a board, soft tiles, copper sheets and various composite materials. </p>

    <p>  In their reviews, the owners of DublDom advise using the offer of an additional order for a terrace or veranda.  They are made of larch and fit perfectly into life outside the city.  And they are simply irreplaceable when a large company of friends or relatives comes to visit you. </p><p>  A feature of the project is a wall glazed from floor to ceiling.  This idea is a symbol of an open attitude to the world.  Thanks to her, the surrounding nature is more acutely felt. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Do not worry about large glazing.  Energy-saving double-glazed windows are filled with argon.  Heat even in severe frost. <em></em></p><p>  It will help to save on heating and competent orientation of the house to the cardinal points.  Windows should face south and southwest. <em></em></p><h2>  Heating </h2><p>  In winter, to heat forty square meters of DublDom, according to residents, only two electric convectors are enough.  They are built into the floor near the windows. </p><p>  An additional option is the organization of water heating.  The wiring for it is laid immediately during manufacture at the factory.  When installing a house, it simply connects to networks. </p>

    <p>  The new models in the bathrooms have underfloor heating. </p><p>  The design of the house has a hole for the chimney.  If desired, a compact stove is connected - a fireplace.  The DublDom heating reviews confirm: a small wood stove is just an addition to make life in a wooden house more comfortable. </p>

    <p>  If you came to the country in the winter, then the house will warm up in no more than an hour.  Energy-saving technologies and materials help keep heat well. <em> </em></p><p>  You can make gas heating.  You only need to consider that the equipment of the boiler room will increase the value of your home. </p><h2>  Layout </h2><p>  The design allows you to choose the layout to your liking: a large studio or crushing into several rooms.  Living rooms are separated by fitted wardrobes.  They are both storage areas and noise flooring from neighboring rooms. </p><p>  You can choose a finished project - the choice is wide.  There are living rooms with a standard bathroom, and you can make a choice in favor of a sauna and additional outbuildings. </p><h2>  What does it look like and what does it have? </h2><p>  DublDom houses, according to owners, are captivating by their minimalist Scandinavian design.  There is not a single extra protrusion or corner, everything is logical and functional.  I also liked the huge panoramic windows, thanks to which there is so much light and space. </p><p>  Together with the house you can order furniture.  It is made from natural wood.  In models longer than six meters, it is possible to install large kitchens. </p><p>  And you can decorate the interior to your taste.  Ecostyle will fit in very well here.  Wood furniture will look great.  The similarity with the chalet is given by wooden <span>ceiling beams.</span> </p><p>  Interior decoration, plumbing, electrical appliances and communications are included in the price of the house.  Faucets, a toilet bowl, a boiler for heating water are installed, even the lamps are in place!  All this is standard equipment. </p><p>  In the reviews of DublDom, under the before and after photos, the owners share the changes that have occurred in their lives.  At first, people plan to spend only the summer season there.  But they are surprised to find that life in nature is quite combined with comfort.  And they begin to plan with pleasure already permanent residence in this amazing house. </p><p>  The creator of DublDom, Ovchinnikov, compared it to a car: ‚ÄúEverything is ready in it - bought and live.  It's like a car - got in and drove off.  You don‚Äôt buy a car without decoration. ‚Äù </p><h2>  Production </h2><p>  Designers created a home that combines cost-effectiveness, mobility and quality. </p><p>  Manufacturers achieve quality using modern technologies and collaboration with suppliers.  They do not waste time looking for contractors. </p><p>  The main production is located in Zhukovka, on the Kaluga highway.  Only 37 km from Moscow. </p><p>  Consumers became interested in the project and stopped dealing with the flow of orders a year later.  I had to transfer production rights to partners.  The franchise employs Kazan, Belarus, St. Petersburg, Khimki, Pokrov. </p><p>  According to reviews, DublDom is produced at a price two to three times cheaper than brick buildings. </p>

    <p>  Only dry wood enters the work.  For its processing using high-precision imported machines.  Cut to the nearest millimeter.  Deviations from the drawings should not be.  This will affect the rigidity and stability of the frame of the house.  After sawing, wood is polished manually. </p><p>  Then, right inside the frame, the craftsmen lay electrical wiring and communications networks.  Air ducts are laid in the construction of the house, to which a forced ventilation system is later connected. </p><p>  The technology of work determines first to complete the interior decoration.  Then do the outside.  This ensures high quality of work and design. </p><p>  On-site installation of modules is included in the estimate of the project (even if the installation location is one hundred kilometers from production). </p><h2>  Environmental friendliness </h2><p>  This is one of the main features of the structure.  And that's why: </p><ul><li>  For the production of the house using certified materials with a guarantee of quality.  The supporting wooden frame is necessarily treated with bioprotection. </li><li>  Can be installed directly in the forest or even on the water.  Those who draw strength in unity with nature, note a rare spiritual comfort, a sense of peace.  Responses of owners about life before and after the purchase of DublDom confirm photos of their new homes. </li><li>  Guests of yacht clubs, tourist camps and holiday homes will have the opportunity to live outdoors in an unusual and modern house. </li></ul>

    <p>  The above DublDom photo on the water shows all the beauty and practicality of this acquisition. </p><h2>  And what's in the plans? </h2><p>  More than sixty different models of residential buildings were commissioned by private buyers.  There is not even one DublDom on the water!
