Alga Chlorella</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A special position among the lower plants is occupied by <span>green algae,</span> which include chlorella.  This is a certain type of vegetation that can exist in different conditions, for example, in water, on land, etc. According to scientists, representatives of this very largest group of algae (there are still brown, red, golden and others) are the ancestors of higher modern plants.  Amazing single-celled chlorella is not only this.  In 1960, she was one of the first to visit space.  Chlorella is a type of plant that is the permanent companion of sailors in submarines.  Biologists attribute this to the Chlorellaceae family (Chlorellaceae).  The most common is Chlorella vulgaris.  It is found in puddles, in small ponds, and even in ditches.  What is the secret of its popularity and widespread use? </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1194137" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194137.jpg?1554487669"></div><h2>  Brief Description of the View </h2><p>  Chlorella is a microscopic algae.  The size of the body (thallus or thallus) of the <span>lower plant</span> is 2 or more microns.  It can only be examined under a microscope.  It is positioned as an independently functioning organism, represented by a single cell.  Chlorella is so small that in 1 cubic centimeter of water can accommodate up to several million such representatives of the flora. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chlorella: building </h2><p>  As already mentioned, chlorella is unicellular, its shape can be either ellipsoidal or spherical.  The microorganism is coated with a specific cellulose membrane, which is quite thin and smooth.  Inside consists of one chloroplast and core.  They are located parietally.  The cytoplasm plays the role of a storehouse where starch and fats accumulate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1194138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194138.jpg?1554487669"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  What was the ancient chlorella at the dawn of the origin of life on Earth?  It is a giant supplier of oxygen to the atmosphere.  In the aquatic environment, it is also indispensable, in particular, it is responsible for filling with nutrients, which, accordingly, allows you to accumulate enough energy for living organisms.  It owes its green color to the chlorophyll present in it.  For a unique process of photosynthesis, it needs, like any other plant, water, carbon dioxide and sunlight.  Chlorella is a thermophilic plant and carries out its incredibly significant function at a temperature of about 28 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  In addition to chlorophyll, algae has other parts of the thallus: the membrane, the semi-liquid contents of the cell and the nucleus.  But the organs of movement, like many of her other brothers, she does not have.  Algae passively swims in fresh water in the form of phytoplankton. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Propagation method </h2><p>  Chlorella reproduction occurs exclusively asexually, under favorable conditions, by dividing the cell in half.  The core is responsible for this complex process.  Previously, at the stage of preparing the cell for reproduction, its organs are doubled.  It increases in size, then the outer shell is stretched and torn.  From one mother, two daughter cells are obtained.  For a while, a break occurs in the chlorella cycle, and then everything repeats again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1194139" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194139.jpg?1554487669"></div><h2>  Habitat </h2><p>  Due to its simple structure and photosynthetic function, the green alga Chlorella perfectly mastered not only aquatic, but also other habitats: air, soil and even organismic.  Some species of zoochlorella cohabit with other organisms in the status of "tenants". </p><h2>  Value </h2><p>  The main wealth of chlorella for man is its fantastic composition.  As shown by studies of biochemists, the internal environment of its cells is almost half composed of protein, 1/3 of sugar.  Protein in chlorella is almost 6 times more than in wheat.  In addition, it contains vitamins, fats, mineral salts and other organic substances.  Moreover, the composition of the algae is a variable value, it can vary depending on the conditions of its maintenance.  Therefore, growing chlorella in artificially created tanks or at home can significantly change the plant.  For example, with the help of certain lighting, the components of the composition of the cell are controlled by setting the necessary indicators. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1194140" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194140.jpg?1554487669"></div><h2>  Application </h2><p>  In Japan and other countries, chlorella is widely used as a useful food supplement.  Its release is established in a variety of forms (extract, powder, tablets).  Each pharmaceutical form has its own specific advantages, therefore, before use, you need to read the instructions for use.  Medicines containing green algae in their composition increase immunity.  Testing and monitoring of its use as a treatment for cancer patients is underway.  Chlorella, the use of which helps to improve the work of yeast, is often used in the baking industry.  Such products turn out magnificent, smell delicious and do not turn stale for a long time. </p><p>  Thanks to active propagation in 1 liter of water, up to 60 grams of algae can be formed in the net residue.  A person will need only 500 grams per day of the <span>nutrients</span> contained in chlorella.  Accordingly, a 10-liter vessel, populated by green algae, can fully satisfy the need of a person in a confined space, not only for food, but also for oxygen for respiration and life. </p><p>  It turned out to be irreplaceable chlorella in the composition of animal feed for cattle, pigs, birds, fish and even bees.  Harvest of wheat or potato is significantly inferior to the "harvest" of algae from an equivalent plantation.  It is also noteworthy that there is no waste from it - no straw, no leaves, no roots.  All her little body is one solid nutrient. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1194136" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1194136.jpg?1554487669"></div><p>  Chlorella also serves as an indicator of contaminated water bodies.  It is used as a biological treatment of sewers, sewage and natural water bodies. </p><p>  Because of the unique structure and functions, the baby has great expectations, and simple green algae justifies them with success. </p>
