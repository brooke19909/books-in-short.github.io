Tariffs, connection</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is very convenient for Russians traveling to Belarus to use roaming from MTS.  In some cases, using this service in Belarus is even beneficial, given that roaming is always much more expensive than communication in your home country.  MTS, on the other hand, offers service packages with which you can call home and more, use the Internet and send regular SMS. </p><h2>  Who is available for roaming? </h2><p>  To use MTS roaming in Belarus, citizens of Russia usually need to have two rates on their phone.  These are “International and National Roaming” and “International Access”.  The requirements of MTS are not limited to this.  Only Russian residents, including legal entities, can connect these packages. </p>

    <p>  “International access” goes in addition to “International and national roaming”.  The fact is that in case of refusal of “International Access”, the call service outside the Russian Federation extends only to other regions of Russia. </p><h2>  What to do before leaving for Belarus? </h2><p>  If you do not want to go to the MTS office, you can connect roaming yourself.  There are 3 ways to do this: connecting via a special command that must be entered on a smartphone or another phone, ordering through the MTS official website in your personal account, and a contact center will also help you connect to this service. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To connect to roaming using the USSD command, dial * 111 * 2192 #. </p><p>  Using the Internet, connection is made after a simple registration on the official MTS website - www.mts.ru.  To do this, select your region and use the "switch". </p><p>  <span>MTS Contact Center</span> has ample opportunities in addition to roaming.  So, to connect roaming or solve any other problem, you can use several proposed methods.  Firstly, you can call the short number 0890 from your cell phone, secondly, while in international and national roaming, dial the phone number +7 495 766 01 66 (you must start dialing from +7), and thirdly , call from your home phone number or from a non-MTS operator number to 8 800 250 0890. </p><h2>  When to connect roaming independently will not work? </h2><p>  It will be possible to carry out independent connection of MTS roaming for Belarus and trips to other countries in two cases.  The first one is if the SIM card that you want to connect to roaming is valid for less than 6 months and the balance on it is less than 600 rubles.  The second is a SIM card under 12 months of age, and if during this period at least 1 month payment was missed, that is, it amounted to 0 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Roaming connection through a communication salon or MTS office </h2><p>  Do not despair if your MTS number does not meet the conditions for an independent connection.  You can connect roaming in the MTS service center.  What is needed for this?  For this, you will need to personally come to the MTS office or communication salon with a passport and have at least some positive balance on your phone account.  Also, an official representative of the subscriber will be able to seek help from the service center.  The power of attorney in this case is drawn up through a notary public. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But it’s not always possible to connect to roaming, even if you visited the MTS office.  But do not despair. </p><h2>  “Easy roaming and international access” </h2><p>  You can go to Belarus and some other countries by pre-connecting to Easy Roaming and International Access.  This service includes the ability to call and receive / send SMS to MTS in Belarus.  Also, thanks to this service, you can use the Internet through a smartphone.  But to use the Internet, you need to connect additional services, such as: “BIT abroad” and GPRS. </p><p>  The service “Easy Roaming and International Access” does not require monthly deductions, as well as payment for its connection or disconnection. </p>

    <p>  Corporate numbers and VIP-tariffs with city numbers, alas, will not be able to use this service to use MTS roaming in Belarus. </p><p>  It should be remembered that this service is not available with all tariff plans, which is desirable to clarify in the support service or in the MTS office.  “Easy roaming and international access” cannot operate together with “International and national roaming”.  They are mutually disconnected, and if there is a need to switch to one of them again, then it will have to be connected again, as for the first time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cost of services in Belarus </h2><p>  MTS tariffs for roaming in Belarus are quite affordable, especially when it comes to Belarus itself, and Russia too. </p><p>  Thus, incoming calls from Russia and outgoing to Russia will cost 70 rubles per minute when roaming in Belarus.  The same cost of calls in Belarus.  If the call is made to one of the CIS countries, Georgia, South Ossetia or Abkhazia, then its cost increases to 109 rubles.  To other countries on MTS roaming from Belarus, a call will cost 135 rubles per minute of conversation. </p><p>  All incoming SMS messages in roaming in Belarus are free, and outgoing ones cost 10 rubles. </p><p>  The Internet in the presence of the BIT abroad service will cost unlimited exactly 450 rubles per day, and without special services - 10 rubles for 40 Kb of incoming or outgoing information. </p><h2>  Service in roaming </h2><p>  The most convenient number for resolving communication problems with MTS in Belarus is 0890. The fact is that Belarus is a member of the so-called group of "countries of presence".  And therefore, being in the territory of this country, you can receive free advice and assistance without using the generally accepted number for most countries: +7 495 766 01 66. </p>

    <p>  In <span>Belarus, the</span> problems that have arisen can also be resolved in the Belarusian MTS stores.  In addition, even roaming itself, if it was not connected on the territory of Russia, can be connected in the Belarusian communication salon and make international calls with MTS. </p><p>  All information on roaming, its tariffs and services can be obtained while in the territory of Belarus.  To do this, enter * 111 * 33 # on the phone. </p><p>  Already in Belarus, the phone should automatically select the operator MTS-Belarus.  If this did not happen, then you just need to contact the communication salon with the question of how to connect MTS roaming in Belarus. </p><h2>  Payment </h2><p>  Paying for MTS services not in Russia is not difficult.  There are many ways.  As they say, choose your taste. </p><p>  You can top up your SIM card, as well as another person’s personal account while abroad, using a MasterCard or Visa plastic card.  To do this, you just need to call +7 495 766 01 66 and use the instructions on the voice menu.  You cannot replenish by less than 100 rubles when using this service. </p><p>  It is possible to replenish an account from a card using the Internet in a smartphone.  The link for this manipulation is www.pda.mts.ru/online. </p>

    <p>  You can temporarily get money on your phone at the expense of the operator company.  The service "Promised payment" is here to help.  In this case, from MTS on the phone will appear from 50 to 800 rubles.  The company will withdraw funds from the balance back after 7 days.  The cost of this service is only 5 rubles.  You can also borrow 1500 rubles, but this is if in total over the past 180 days your mobile account was replenished by at least 1500 rubles.  In general, the available amount that can be borrowed by sending SMS to MTS depends on how much money has been replenished recently.  You can find out this available amount, as well as use the service using the USSD-command * 111 #. </p><p>  It would be wise to download the Easy Payment application on your smartphone before going abroad.  With it you can easily top up your phone account not only in Belarus and other countries, but also in Russia without leaving your home. </p><p>  You can ask your loved ones to replenish the account using the request “Top up my account”.  But relatives, in order to carry out this manipulation, can use the Direct Transfer service.  Thus, you can replenish the balance from number to MTS number. </p><p>  You can take money on a SIM card on credit from MTS.  To do this, there is a special service "On full confidence."  But it should be remembered that in this case the “Promised Payment” cannot be taken until the loan is paid off. </p><p>  Well, the most convenient way to top up your phone account for calls from MTS to Belarus, Russia and other countries is to use the “Auto payment” service.  "Auto payment" allows you not to think about paying a phone bill.  With this service, money will be automatically debited from the card and credited to the phone number account.  This can be used on the territory of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  In order not to encounter communication problems while visiting Belarus and easily make international calls with the help of MTS SIM, it is better to follow some simple recommendations. </p><ul><li>  Put the necessary amount of money on the phone in advance. </li><li>  Find out about the tariffs of Belarus itself, being in the territory of this country.  After all, they can be used during the trip. </li><li>  For frequent trips to Belarus, it makes sense to find out about discounts in roaming from MTS and use "MTS without borders" roaming. </li><li>  It must be remembered that even 1 second in roaming is considered a full minute, which means that money for the entire time less than a minute will be written off as a whole minute.  Roaming does not provide any per-second tariffing. </li><li>  It is necessary to replenish the account on the territory of Belarus, but it is most reliable to have the “Full Trust” service on the phone.  The presence of this service allows you to use communication services with a zero and negative balance. </li></ul>

    <p>  Thus, the use of the Russian MTS in Belarus is not so expensive.  In addition, it is encouraging that any problem with the communication of MTS in the territory of this country can be completely dealt with.  But still, traveling to the Republic of Belarus, it is better to be safe again and connect all services and packages in advance and always stay in touch. </p>
