They are made in the form of various animals or insects.  It can be small crocodiles and dogs, lizards or spiders. </p><p>  In this article we will analyze in detail how to make a keychain from beads.  Dolphin is one of the options that is simple and affordable for a beginner.  In the process, we advise you to carefully study the sequence of beadwork.  After learning a little, you can figure out how to make a dolphin from beads quickly and beautifully.  The weaving technique is quite simple. </p><h2>  How to weave dolphin from beads? </h2><p>  Do not know how to surprise a friend?  Weave him a beadwork.  We will tell you how volumetric dolphins are woven from beads.  This principle is used to create most voluminous crafts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beaded dolphin" class="if" height="474" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1740026.jpg" width="570"></div>

    <p>  We advise you to pay attention to the step-by-step description and patterns of weaving from beads.  Dolphin is a smart and friendly creature.  When embodying the image of an animal, do not forget about it. </p><h2>  What do you need? </h2><p>  For this purpose, prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  beads of three different colors - blue, gray, and black; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  thin wire (for weaving dolphin fins); </li><li>  fishing line. </li></ul><h2>  Beadwork: Dolphin </h2><ol><li>  To get started, take a large piece of fishing line.  Dial the gray and blue bead onto the thread and slide it down.  Then draw one more blue and gray bead, and pull the other end of the fishing line through the hole in the opposite direction, thereby crossing the fishing line.  Namely, the two ends of the fishing line should form a cross. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a dolphin from beads" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1742079.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Next, you need to pull on both ends of the fishing line - for the two beads collected last.  Slide them to the two beads that were picked first. </li><li>  Continue weaving according to how the pattern is built.  Dial the next two beads, blue and gray, and in the same way pass the second tip of the fishing line.  Tighten both ends together.  You will need to repeat this operation one more time. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="volumetric dolphins from beads" class="if" height="286" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1742077.jpg" width="399"></div></li><li>  The weaving method is quite simple, even a beginner can master it.  If you follow the pattern of weaving, then your fishing line will be folded, leading the beads.  You will see a certain volumetric figure. </li><li>  Take two blue and one gray beads, reverse the second tip of the fishing line and pull back both ends.  Now you need to make a similar set of beads and crosswise tightening the ends of the fishing line.  As already noted, all rows must be duplicated, otherwise your figure will not come out voluminous.  At this stage of weaving, it will be possible to create a voluminous nose of a dolphin. </li><li>  Next, you need to repeat the previous row to give volume to the figure of a dolphin.  Remember that each row contained in the diagram needs to be done twice.  This rule must be observed. </li></ol><p>  In the future, the weaving technique does not change and is used throughout the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Some recommendations </h2><p>  In order to make a dolphin from beads, you will need a circuit.  It is needed not only for beginners, but also for experienced masters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dolphin weaving" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1742078.jpg" width="348"></div>  But do not forget that you need to weave all the rows proposed in this scheme twice, otherwise the dolphin will not come out voluminous, but flat.  Another characteristic feature is that the beaded dolphin fins are braided separately from the body.

    <h2>  Weaving pattern </h2><p>  So, let's proceed to the assembly, according to the scheme of weaving composite rows: </p><ul><li>  4 blue beads and 2 gray (2 times). </li><li>  5 blue and 3 gray beads (2 times). </li><li>  6 blue and 3 gray beads (4 times).  It should be noted here that in the first and second rows of four lines you should put on one black bead, which will become the eye of a dolphin. </li><li>  8 blue beads and 3 gray (10 times). </li><li>  6 blue and 3 gray beads (4 times). </li><li>  5 blue beads and 3 gray (2 times). </li><li>  4 blue and 2 gray beads (2 times). </li><li>  3 blue and 1 gray beads (2 times). </li><li>  2 blue and 1 gray beads (2 times). </li></ul><p>  The number of rows should correspond to the number of times.  Two times means two rows of weaving.  When you do all the rows indicated in the diagram, you will get a ‚Äúbody‚Äù of beads - a dolphin without a tail and fins. </p><h2>  Weaving a dolphin tail </h2><p>  At this stage, you will weave the tail of the dolphin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  To do this, collect six blue beads on a fishing line.  Further, according to the scheme, you need to make a turn.  It is necessary to additionally string two beads and in the first of them thread the fishing line in reverse.  You will get one bead in the role of "stub", it needs to be pulled to the rest of the beads. </li><li>  The fishing line will be turned in the opposite direction of weaving.  Again, string six beads onto this line. </li><li>  After that, fix the fishing line by threading it into one of the beads in the near row.  You should get half a tail of beads.  Dolphin is almost ready, the bulk of the work is done. </li></ul><p>  The second half is woven in the same way as the first.  Fix the remaining fishing line, passing it through the nearest beads.  At the end, tie the edges of the fishing line to the knots. </p><h2>  Fin weaving </h2><p>  For weaving fins, we use the scheme: </p><ol><li>  First make the lower fin.  Then attach it to the dolphin's body.  To do this, take a small piece of wire. </li><li>  Start weaving the fin from its lowest end.  Bend the wire in half and put on blue bead.  Then pass back the second end of the wire into it and tighten the ends. </li><li>  Next, you need to string two blue beads, and in a similar way tighten them with the two crossed ends of the wire. </li><li>  As you can see, the weaving technique is similar to that when weaving the dolphin‚Äôs body.  The only difference is that the number of rows does not double, because a flat figure is needed. </li><li>  Put on the three blue beads and tighten them with a wire.  Your fin is ready.  Now you need to attach it to the body of a dolphin. </li></ol><h2>  Assembly </h2><p>  Since the fin is attached from below, it must be attached to the dolphin's belly.  This is done as follows: </p><ul><li>  Using the two ends of the wire on which the fin is located, fasten them to the bead on the dolphin‚Äôs belly. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a dolphin bead" class="if" height="218" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44308/1742080.jpg" width="500"></div></li><li>  Pass the wire through different beads.  Choose a more convenient option.  Use the same connection method when attaching the upper fin. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The technique of beadwork implies a lot of directions, including the creation of various key chains from beads.  Dolphin can be a wonderful decoration of any of them - for a backpack, keys or phone.  Anyone can make a beautiful and original keychain.  The main thing is your desire and desire to create. </p>
