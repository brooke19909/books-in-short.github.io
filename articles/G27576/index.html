Adding bright original patterns will make a positive contribution to the holiday.  A handmade Easter egg using decoupage technique can be used in the future in two ways.  Protein and yolk can be eaten.  Also, the egg can be presented to relatives or friends as a souvenir, or use it to decorate the holiday table.  Souvenir eggs are very simple to make - you need to remove the contents so that in the future the craft does not deteriorate.  You just need to make 2 small holes and blow out the contents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="makezine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY decoupage Easter egg" class="if uuid-2432670" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2432670.jpg"></div><h2>  First craft </h2><p>  How to make do-it-yourself Easter egg decoupage?  Now we will tell. </p><p>  What is required: </p><ul><li>  eggs (10 pcs.); </li><li>  newspaper; </li><li>  gum; </li><li>  lace; </li><li>  dye; </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  Scotch. </li></ul><p>  Create crafts </p><ol><li>  Cook hard-boiled eggs.  This can be done by placing in a pan with salt and pour water.  Simmer for at least 10 minutes.  Place them under cold running water. </li><li>  Prepare an egg decoration kit. </li><li>  Follow the instructions on the package to make the dye.  In most cases, you need to add the granules to the water, and then pour the vinegar (about 1 tablespoon).  You can use a glass, cup or bowl.  The main thing is to make sure that there is enough space for the egg in the container. </li><li>  Set the dye containers in a row. </li><li>  Prepare the boiled eggs in one place.  It’s also nice to create a work surface by covering it with a newspaper.  Then you can lay eggs on it to avoid spillage of the dye.  You can put a cardboard box or wire mesh to dry the eggs after they are painted. </li><li>  Decorate each before staining.  There are many interesting ideas.  We will consider them below. </li></ol><h2>  Polka dot easter eggs </h2><p>  The original idea for decoupage Easter eggs is to make them “polka dots”.  It is very easy.  You need to make circles of paper or scotch tape, or buy special stickers.  Attach to egg and dip in dye.  Wait for the egg to dry and you can remove the stickers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Elastics, scotch tape, lace - we use everything at hand </h2><p>  If you want something original, unusual, and time is limited - this is ideal.  It is necessary to take gum.  Attach to the egg, vertically, horizontally.  Dip in dye. </p><p>  Pieces of scotch tape and lace will also help create an interesting design.  You just need to attach them to the egg.  Dip in dye.  Wait a couple of minutes.  Take off.  The original egg decoupage is ready. </p><p>  Coating parts of an egg with tape, stickers, wax or rubber bands will result in parts of the product not being coated with paint.  Then you can create your own unique effects. </p><p>  You can color the egg in a light tone.  Close parts and darken the rest of the part.  To do this, set the egg on a spoon and dip it in the desired color of the dye.  You can either omit it partially to color only a specific segment, or completely.  Leave the egg for 3 minutes.  Then get it out.  If the egg has not yet acquired what you want to get as a result, then leave it a little longer. </p><p>  Place the egg on a work surface covered with newspaper.  At this stage, you can add color effects - paint with paints, stick stickers or apply original patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hip2save.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage easter egg" class="if uuid-2432668" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2432668.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage napkins </h2><p>  How to make decoupage Easter eggs with napkins?  Now we will tell you in detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Materials: </p><ul><li>  paper napkins; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  scissors. </li></ul><p>  If you plan to eat an egg for food - then you must first boil it, and instead of glue use egg white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hip2save.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="we make an Easter egg with our own hands" class="if uuid-2432669" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2432669.jpg"></div><p>  Souvenir option (step by step instructions): </p><ol><li>  Poke both ends of the raw egg with a pair of scissors or the tip of a sharp knife.  Hold the egg with a large hole down over the bowl.  Rinse with warm water, strain.  Blow air out of an egg.  Let it dry. </li><li>  Cut patterns / patterns from a napkin using scissors.  Separate the printed top layer by discarding the bottom sheets. </li><li>  Coat some of the hollow white egg with glue using a small brush. </li><li>  Attach napkins to the egg.  Align the image so that air bubbles come out. </li><li>  Spread glue (protein) on the pattern.  Let it dry. </li></ol><h2>  Decoupage Easter eggs.  Master Class </h2><p>  Make Easter eggs that are completely covered with patterned or textured paper.  To work, you will need: </p><ul><li>  eggs </li><li>  paper; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  acrylic paint. </li></ul><p>  Step-by-step instruction: </p><ol><li>  You need to take paper that absorbs well (the main thing is not to use glossy).  Cut the paper into strips. </li><li>  Take 1 strip and dip it in glue.  Start covering the egg.  Overlapping in different directions, forming a layer of several paper strips.  You can use special glue purchased at the store.  Allow the glue to dry completely. </li><li>  From time to time, add a dry strip of paper to absorb excess glue. </li><li>  When the glue dries, you can make a second or third coating layer until the edges of the paper become smooth.  Remember, you need to dry each layer before gluing the next. </li><li>  After the paper has dried, you can start painting the eggs. </li></ol><p>  You can use a marker or acrylic paints.  If you do not draw very well, you can draw emoticons, flowers, various patterns.  If artistic skills are at their best, then it is quite possible to create an original work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.brilio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="decoupage easter eggs with napkins" class="if uuid-2432672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2432672.jpg"></div><h2>  Original decoupage techniques </h2><p>  Now consider unusual decoupage methods: </p><ol><li>  Decoration with a rope (thread).  One of the original design methods is simply wrapped with jute rope or colored threads, after having greased the egg with PVA glue. </li><li>  Foil decoration.  Wrap the egg in foil.  Acrylic paint can be applied on top. </li><li>  Additional decorations.  Most of us believe that the design of eggs is dyeing.  But this is not so.  When decoupage eggs, you can use lace, rhinestones, beads, flowers, ribbons. </li><li>  The old way.  Known for more than a day, the method of coloring eggs using leaves and nylon socks.  Attach the sheet to the egg, wrap it with the toe, fix it.  Dip in the dye. </li><li>  Decoration with sparkles.  Suitable for a souvenir version of staining, as there is a high probability of eating glitter.  The egg is coated with PVA glue and dipped in sparkles. </li><li>  Vintage style.  For decoration, you need old newspapers, notes, or letters, or you can simply print the necessary drawings. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="en.brilio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Easter egg decoupage with napkins" class="if uuid-2432675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13662/2432675.jpg"></div><h2>  Decoupage wooden blanks </h2><p>  Recently, wooden blanks (eggs) for decoupage of Easter eggs have been very popular.  When working with such materials, the procedure is slightly different. </p><p>  Materials for work: </p><ul><li>  wooden egg; </li><li>  sandpaper; </li><li>  primer; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  varnish; </li><li>  napkins (it’s better to select them with a medium-sized drawing, then it will work easier, and the glued image will look better). </li></ul><p>  Egg making </p><ol><li>  First you need to carefully prepare the surface.  If there are bumps, then sand them with sandpaper. </li><li>  Primed in several layers, allow to dry. </li><li>  Coat the surface of the egg with glue. </li><li>  Take a napkin, remove the white bottom layer, cut out the necessary pattern / ornament. </li><li>  Glue on the egg, you can stick not one picture, but several. </li><li>  Smooth so that no air bubbles remain. </li><li>  Apply a little glue to the surface of the egg, starting from the middle of the picture.
