Its territory is very large and consists of the Main Hall (shows are shown here), the Aquarium and the Swimming Center with dolphins (in the project).  In the Aquarium you can look at freshwater and marine animals close by, learn about each of them in more detail.  You can also touch starfish and learn about the fauna of the Japanese, White and Black Seas.  In the Water Hall, designed for 2.3 thousand visitors, there are killer whales, <span>dolphins, belugas,</span> sea ‚Äã‚Äãwalruses and <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãlions.</span>  During the performance, everyone can plunge headlong into the wonderful sea world.  In addition, after this you will definitely want to buy a ticket for swimming with dolphins in Moscow.  ‚ÄúMoskvarium‚Äù provides an opportunity to get a boost of energy and strength, improve the mood of each of its visitors.  Alas, the swimming center with dolphins is only planned to be opened soon, i.e. in the spring of 2016.

    <h2>  Dolphins in captivity </h2><p>  Only one question remains: how humane is it to keep these marine animals in captivity?  Society has long debated on this topic.  Opponents of this refer to the spleen of animals, a decrease in the chances of reproduction, the harm of chlorinated water for them.  In contrast to this view, there is another point of view. </p>
