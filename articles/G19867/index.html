Often, such devices are created in China for the domestic market and rarely go beyond the state.  There, the demand for a push-button phone with 3G and WiFi is very high, while in our country it is not particularly successful. </p><p>  Devices that support these functions work on the Android operating system, so we can seriously say that they are not much inferior to smart phones. </p><p>  Many people think that with the advent of touchscreen phones, push-button predecessors faded into the background and became a long forgotten past.  This is not true.  If only because it‚Äôs hard for older people to ‚Äúwork together‚Äù with new technologies, and parents don‚Äôt buy too ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phones for schoolchildren, because they are only needed for communication. </p><p>  The main advantages of push-button models include the following: </p><ul><li>  the battery holds a charge longer; </li><li>  the phone is more stable, it does not fail; </li><li>  in case of mechanical damage to the screen, you can continue to work with the equipment. </li></ul><h2>  Best WiFi <span>Button Phone</span> - Samsung W2014 </h2><p>  Users have repeatedly recognized this <span>Samsung phone as the best</span> among those that run on the Android OS.  Consumers unanimously claim that the photos taken by the device are impressive, the battery lasts about 2 days, and it supports almost all modern games. </p><p>  The W2014 smartphone was first introduced to the world in 2013.  It seemed quite interesting to the public, as it is made in the form of a folding form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As already described above, this <span>push-button mobile phone</span> with WiFi is designed for the Chinese consumer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button telephone with wifi" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1046125.jpg" width="343"></div>

    <h2>  Feature Samsung W2014 </h2><p>  The filling of the phone is really impressive, as for a budget smartphone.  You need to start with the fact that the processor has 4 cores;  The clock frequency is 2.3 GHz.  The user has 2 GB of RAM.  This <span>smartphone has two</span> cameras: one - 13 megapixels, the second - 2. </p><p>  The internal memory of the phone is not impressive (32 GB), but flash cards are supported, so it can easily be increased. </p><p>  Samsung W2014 - a powerful push-button phone with WiFi and 2 SIM cards works on Android 4.3.  Battery capacity - 1900 mAh.  The weight of the device is small, only 173 g. The display is 3.7 inches, while the resolution is 800x480 pixels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button phone with 3g and wifi" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1046123.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, this did not prevent him from gaining sufficient popularity.  Although in fact, Q10 went on sale much later;  in Russia and Ukraine has not yet received an official presentation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button cell phone with wifi" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1046121.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Feature BlackBerry Q10 </h2><p>  The package includes charging, a USB cable, a manual and a headset.  This push-button phone with WiFi distribution is considered the best in the BlackBerry line in appearance: it has a strict design and comfortable keys.  The shape of the phone is rectangular, the screen has become elongated than previous models.  The lack of call and reset buttons can be experienced, in any case, after a month or two, the buyer gradually gets used to it.  The buttons are straight.  Contrary to the fears of critics, their form did not affect the usability of the set.  In addition, consumers like the fact that the keyboard is larger than its predecessors, but you can type with even one hand without any difficulty. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  comfortable QWERTY keyboard; </li><li>  a battery that holds a charge for a long time; </li><li>  good assembly and panel material, the back of the lid is made in such a way that it does not slip at all in the hand; </li><li>  excellent voice communication, the difference between BB is that the phones are equipped with new technologies that ‚Äúcrush‚Äù external noise; </li><li>  fast and convenient built-in browser; </li><li>  The smartphone‚Äôs operating system works without any delays. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  phone accessories are very expensive; </li><li>  there are no "native" applications such as VKontakte, Instagram, Twitter, etc. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button phone with wifi and 2 sim" class="if" height="434" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1046119.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Nokia push-button telephone with Wi-Fi </h2><p>  The first thing that attracts Nokia Asha 2010 Dual Sim (a popular push-button phone with WiFi) is a full-fledged keyboard with a Latin layout.  The fact is that devices with QWERTY will no longer be available in the near future, so this smartphone caused a fuss.  Although there are more proponents of touchscreen technology, everyone knows the convenience of keyboard phones.  At the time that Asha 2010 was announced, the company entered into a cooperation agreement with WhatsApp.  This can explain the presence of a special button with the sign of the corresponding application.  However, for some reason, the device went on sale already without it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="push-button telephone with wifi distribution" class="if" height="437" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1046117.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Feature Nokia Asha 2010 Dual Sim </h2><p>  This WiFi push-button phone also supports two SIM cards.  It should be noted that there is its official counterpart, working with only one SIM. </p><p>  The color variety of this smartphone is great.  However, you should not choose bright colors, as, for example, the yellow case quickly gets dirty in the pockets of ordinary jeans. </p><p>  The device does not support 3G, unlike the previous options described;  it weighs only 99 g. The Wi-Fi function works fine, there are no difficulties with connection and distribution.  However, there is a problem in that the wireless connection does not pull applications and games online.  The whole reason lies only in the fact that the operating system on which this button phone with WiFi works is Series 40. </p><p>  The camera takes acceptable photos in excellent lighting conditions (2 megapixels).  The most common disadvantage of the OS is the lack of an equalizer in the audio player.  The headphones that come with the kit are best left out. </p><p>  The battery holds a charge for a long time.  Even with active use, it is able to work for about a week. </p><p>  As pluses, a loud speaker can be noted, which not only plays music in good sound, but also makes it possible to perfectly hear the interlocutor even in noisy places. </p><p>  The advantage of this model is that one of the SIM slots is located on the side, so you do not have to remove the back cover and turn off the phone.  There are buttons near the joystick for quick access to the camera and browser.  Paradoxically, when announcing the phone, it was presented as a ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù of WhatsApp, while most users expressed dissatisfaction with the operation that the application was not installed. </p><p>  The device has a RAM of 64 MB, supports memory cards up to 32 GB. </p><p>  The smartphone was assembled in India, so there are no complaints about its assembly and the quality of materials.  The buttons are easy to press, they are also pleasant to the touch.  When writing messages there are no problems. </p><p>  Main advantages: </p><ul><li>  low cost; </li><li>  design in bright colors; </li><li>  simple and intuitive OS interface; </li><li>  good build quality; </li><li>  support for 2 SIM cards; </li><li>  great speaker; </li><li>  QWERTY keyboard </li><li>  good wifi speed; </li><li>  separate keys for the camera and the Internet; </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  there is no ‚Äúrocker‚Äù on the panel to change the volume; </li><li>  there is no attachment for a thread or lace; </li><li>  bad camera. </li></ul>
