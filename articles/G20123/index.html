    <h2>  The situation on the peninsula </h2><p>  On September 26 - November 5, 1943 the Melitopol took place, and on October 31 - November 11 of the same year - the Kerch-Eltegen landing operation.  Soviet troops managed to break through the fortifications on the Perekop Isthmus.  The bridgeheads on the <span>Kerch Peninsula</span> and in the southern part of Sivash were captured.  However, for the complete liberation of Crimea, there was not enough strength.  The peninsula was occupied by a fairly large enemy grouping, which relied on layered defense.  On the Perekop Isthmus and opposite the bridgehead on Sivash, the enemy‚Äôs positions consisted of three, and on the Kerch Peninsula - of four lanes. </p><h2>  Positions of the parties </h2><p>  Having expelled the enemy from the peninsula, the USSR Black Sea Fleet could regain its key strategic base.  This would improve the placement of ships and the conduct of battles.  In addition, the peninsula of Crimea covered the strategic Balkan flank of the Germans, their main communications passing through the straits to the western part of the coast.  In this regard, the German leadership, in turn, attached great importance to the retention of the territory.  They believed that this would maintain the support of Turkey and the Balkan allies.  The leadership of the 17th Army, based on the peninsula, was tasked with retaining the terrain until the last.  However, the enemy command developed a detailed Adler plan in case of a retreat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Timing Issues </h2><p>  The liberation of Crimea in 1944 was supposed to begin in February, 18-19.  On February 6, a battle plan was presented.  However, subsequently the start of the campaign was postponed several times.  At the same time, battles took place on the coast of the Dnieper.  The command headquarters sent Vasilevsky an instruction to launch an offensive no earlier than the liberation of territories before Kherson. </p><p>  Subsequently, another order was given.  In particular, Vasilevsky was instructed to start the operation no later than March 1, regardless of how the liberation of the Dnieper coast would proceed.  However, the head of the troops reported to Headquarters that, given the weather conditions, the battles would have to be postponed until mid-March.  With this period, the High Command agreed.  However, already on March 16, Vasilevsky received a new instruction, according to which the operation had to be started after the capture of the Nikolaev area and advance to Odessa.  But after that, due to meteorological conditions, the battles had to be postponed until April 8. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Soviet Command Plans </h2><p>  The liberation of Crimea in 1944 was supposed to be carried out by a breakthrough in depth of 170 km.  The capture of enemy positions was planned for 10-12 days.  In this case, the average daily rate of advance of the infantry was to be 12-15 km, tank corps - 30-35 km.  The intention of the command was to simultaneously strike from the north - from Sivash and Perekop, and from the east - from the Kerch Peninsula.  Carrying out the liberation of Sevastopol and Simferopol, it was planned to split and liquidate the enemy grouping, preventing its retreat from the peninsula.  The main blow was supposed to be inflicted from a bridgehead in the southern part of Sivash.  With the success of the action, the main forces went to the three Perekop positions of the enemy.  Having captured Dzhankoy, Soviet troops were given the opportunity to advance to Simferopol and the Kerch Peninsula behind the rear of the Germans.  An auxiliary strike was supposed to be on the Perekop Isthmus.  The Separate Primorye Army was tasked with breaking through the defenses of the invaders north of Kerch.  Part of it was supposed to attack along the southern coast of the peninsula.  The main forces were directed at the liberation of Sevastopol and Simferopol. </p>
