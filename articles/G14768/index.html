If you decide to go to them, we recommend paying attention to the island of La Palma.  The Canary Islands are better known for the resort of Palma de Mallorca.  Each of us certainly heard of him.  In our article we want to talk about the island of La Palma, its attractions and the nuances of relaxation. </p><h2>  A bit about the resort </h2><p>  The island of La Palma (Canary Islands) is small, it is located in the northwestern part of the archipelago and covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 708 km <sup>2</sup> .  The land plot has the shape of a pear.  The island is very beautiful and attractive for tourists in terms of a relaxing holiday.  It is of volcanic origin, as a result of which most of the coast is covered with rocks.  There are not many good beaches, but all of them are picturesque.  In their beauty, they are not inferior to the coast of other islands of the archipelago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamtenerife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santa Cruz Walks" class="if uuid-3127756" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3127756.jpg"></div><p>  There are many mountains on the island of La Palma, the highest point reaches 2387 meters.  And in the northeast there are laurel cherry forests, which are unique in their kind.  Previously, such forests covered all the southern regions of Europe.  Nowadays, they are practically gone.  The last islands of laurel cherry forests can be admired on the island of La Palma.  They can be safely attributed to the natural attractions of the region.  Hiking trails are laid along the protected areas, allowing you to walk on foot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The climate of the region </h2><p>  La Palma Island (Canary Islands, Spain) is an ideal place to relax.  No wonder it is called the island of eternal spring.  The average sea temperature is +22 degrees, and it remains unchanged not only in summer but also in winter.  In summer, the air temperature does not rise above +25 degrees, and in winter does not fall below +18 degrees.  A moderate subtropical climate creates ideal conditions for a comfortable life.  There is no heat on the island, as climatic conditions soften the northern winds blowing from the Azores. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellocanaryislands.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lighthouses on the island" class="if uuid-3127786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3127786.jpg"></div><p>  Rains on La Palma are possible only in late spring and late autumn.  In the summer, in September and October there is practically no rainfall.  The island of La Palma (Canary Islands) is called the most beautiful and green. </p><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  From Moscow you can only get with a change.
