  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social pedagogy as a science - yesterday and today.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The term ‚Äúsocial pedagogy‚Äù in Russian pedagogical science currently has several definitions.  This is justified by the history of the formation and development of social pedagogy in Russia.  To date, there are several socio-pedagogical schools that consider social pedagogy from different points of view. </p><p>  Social pedagogy as a branch of pedagogy is defined by scientists G.M.Kodzhaspirova (explores the impact of the social environment on the upbringing and formation of personality), A.V. Mudrik (explores <span>social education</span> in the context of socialization). </p><p>  <strong>Social pedagogy as a science</strong> of the educational influences of the <span>social environment is</span> interpreted by V.D.  Semenov. </p><p>  Other scholars adhere to the definition of social pedagogy as a theory and practice of a certain activity (I.A. Lipsky - harmonization of human interaction and social environment, T.A. Vasilkova - training and education of an individual person or group of people, F.A. Mustaeva - cognition, regulation and the implementation of the socialization process). </p><p>  The stages of development of pedagogy as a science reveal the development of socio-pedagogical ideas in the ancient world.  The most important socio-pedagogical problems were expressed by the ancient Greek philosophers. </p><p>  In the process of development of pedagogy, world-famous teachers Y.A. Komensky, I.G. Pestalozzi, John Locke, J.-J.Russo, <span>K.D.</span>  <span>Ushinsky,</span> S.T. Shatsky <span>,</span> A.S. Makarenko, Yanush Korchak.  Social pedagogy as a science developed under the influence of their pedagogical ideas and experimental experience. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  I.G. Pestalozzi is famous for his social and pedagogical experiments.  The selfless work of a teacher to create shelters for poor children and orphans, the richest research on education and training in shelters are relevant today. </p><p>  The social and pedagogical activity of A.S. Makarenko on the education of juvenile delinquents is currently highly appreciated by educators all over the world.  In Germany, even a laboratory was created to study the socio-pedagogical experience of A.S. Makarenko. </p><p>  S.T.Shatsky headed the First Experimental Station of the People's Commissariat for Education, which in the twenties of the last century was a unique socio-pedagogical complex, consisting of several schools, kindergartens, a colony, libraries, clubs.  The experimental work of teachers led by S.T.Shatsky left a socio-pedagogical legacy in the development of many aspects of pedagogy of the environment. </p><p>  The great writer and teacher Janusz Korczak, who died in a gas chamber with his pupils, created a unique educational system for the Orphan House in Warsaw, the studies of which are still surprisingly new and relevant. </p><p>  Social pedagogy as a science has its own categorical apparatus.  It includes both general categories of pedagogical science and specific ones. </p><p>  Socialization - one of the main categories of social pedagogy - is defined as the process of assimilation, development and appropriation by an individual of <span>social norms</span> and values ‚Äã‚Äãthroughout life.  Foreign and domestic social pedagogy adheres to several theories of socialization. </p><p>  Social pedagogy as a science is currently actively developing.  However, among scientists there is still no consensus on many topical issues.  Under discussion are its place both in the <span>system of pedagogical science</span> and in the system of social sciences.  Some researchers consider social pedagogy a part of social work and apply the methodology of social work to the organization of social and pedagogical activity. </p><p>  But it is obvious that the achievements of domestic social pedagogy served to ensure that in 1991 in Russia the profession of social teacher was officially recognized.  Socio-pedagogical activity is aimed at solving the problems of social education and socio-pedagogical protection. </p>
