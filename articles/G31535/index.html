    <p>  <strong>The reasons for the formation of the USSR.</strong>  <strong>Briefly</strong> </p><p>  Of course, there have been attempts to resolve the whole complex of problems.  For example, the activities of Peter Stolypin, which is especially important in its agrarian part (an attempt to create many small peasant farms oriented to the market).  However, this reform was actually curtailed with the death of the initiator.  Ignoring the problems led to the fall of the tsarist government in February 1917.  However, the Kerensky government was also unable to cope with the situation and settle radical moods.  In the outbreak of civil war, the Bolshevik party, despite all its controversy, became the most attractive.  Yes, and the most progressive for the era in their aspirations.  The formation of the USSR, in short, was the result of the consistent development of socialist sentiments and the crisis of the monarchist system.  <span>The civil war</span> was actually completed in 1922, when Ukraine, Siberia, Belarus and others were fully occupied. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ussr education" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/215343.jpg" width="467"></div>  territory. <strong></strong>

And the very next day the treaty was ratified by the All-Union Congress of Soviets.  The first Constitution was developed only in 1924.  She laid the foundations for the functioning of the state in its first period.  The second Constitution was adopted in 1936.  The 1924 Constitution established common citizenship throughout the country, regulated relations in the system of power, where the Congress of Soviets was declared the supreme body, and prescribed the process for the republics to leave the Union. </p><p>  <strong>Education of the USSR: briefly on the situation in the party</strong> </p><p>  In addition to the event under discussion, something else happened during these years, which was also very important.  In May 1922, Vladimir Lenin became seriously ill, after which he actually retired from government.  And in January 1924 he died.  The death of a recognized leader by all logically raised questions about the successor.  The middle and second half of the 1920s was marked by heated discussions in the party apparatus regarding the country's future course, as well as the first persecution.  First in a mild form, but leading to global cleansing throughout the country in the 1930s. </p><p>  <strong>Education of the USSR: briefly on the meaning</strong> </p><p>  An important fact for the country was the end of the civil war, </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="reasons for the formation of the USSR briefly" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/215344.jpg" width="600"></div>  which allowed us to direct all our efforts towards the restoration of the national economy, the elimination of its consequences and the return of life to a peaceful track.  However, the creation of the world's first state, led by socialists, had significantly more global and long-term consequences.  Among them were negative ones, resulting from the complexity of the practical implementation of communist ideas.  The desire to ensure high rates of state growth, stability, general welfare and a quick solution to all social problems often led the Soviet leadership to voluntaristic methods (because market laws were not recognized and not taken into account) and deplorable results.  Such as mass repressions, famine for the sake of fulfilling the grain procurement plan, barren and notorious global epics of the Khrushchev era, Brezhnev stagnation caused by the slowness of the command and administrative system, and so on.  However, no less than this state gave positive fruits to its own people and the whole world.  Despite the contradictory nature of the 1930s, then unprecedented in all human history growth rates of state indicators were achieved.  The small peoples of the Union, despite today's nationalist assessments, have made a tangible contribution to the development of their economies and industrial structures.

    <p>  And the Western world was transformed under the influence of the communist ideas that the Union personified.  So, after the revolutions in Russia and Germany, an <span>international labor organization</span> was formed <span>.</span>  Already in 1919, an eight-hour working day was established by the decision of its congress throughout Western Europe and America.  The formation of the USSR, in short, led to the inspiration of the labor movement around the world, under the pressure of which governments repeatedly raised social standards and cared for social security.  After all, the fate of the Romanov empire eloquently demonstrated what ignorance of popular interests could lead to. </p>
