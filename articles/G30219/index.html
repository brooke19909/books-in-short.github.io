This resort attracts many tourists.  Almost all year round in these places you can meet vacationers.  It is known that Yalta is located on the same latitude with numerous cities of hot Italy, so the sun shines here many days a year. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="44.49520500000001" data-lng="34.166300999999976" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/7/5/4/8/7548.png"></div><h2>  <span>Yalta: hotels</span> with pool, prices </h2><p>  Tourists have appreciated this city recently.  Permanent landslides and a changing landscape for a long time made local beaches unsuitable for swimming.  Currently, the beaches are pebble, deep enough, which is not very convenient for bathing children.  However, the water is very clean. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gornyi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="evening city" class="if uuid-2725991" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2725991.jpg"></div><p>  In Yalta, there are many entertainment and shopping centers, restaurants, bars and cafes.  There are also its attractions, memorable places.  In the reserve you can see more than 200 species of exotic plants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for housing, vacationers in Yalta are given the opportunity to choose their own apartments for every taste and budget.  You can book a place in the sanatorium with five meals a day or settle in the guest house with all amenities.  If you need to visit such a beautiful city as Yalta (hotels with a pool and a beach will be in abundance here), then it is worth looking at accommodation options closer to the waterfront.  Comfortable and cozy accommodation in numerous hotels is the choice of most tourists. </p><p>  It is only necessary to determine the location of the housing.  The article will focus on how to find Yalta hotels with a pool.  We will consider offers both in the private sector (park zone) and in the center.  The cost of housing will vary from 3,000 to 15,000 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Hotel "Villa Elena" </h2><p>  This royal house is located in Yalta at the address: Morskaya street, house 3A.  When you pass into the courtyard of this wonderful place, you immediately fall into another world.  This is a world of luxury and wealth, royal gloss and chic.  Here, every detail reminds of royal status.  Yalta hotels by the sea with a swimming pool are the choice of many vacationers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ostrovok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pool at the hotel &quot;Villa Elena&quot;" class="if uuid-2726071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2726071.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel has rooms with views of the sea and the historic building built in 1912.  Both of these options have their advantages, so I want to come to this house again and again to live in all rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the hotel, everything is thought out to the smallest detail, from slippers and bathrobes to bedside rugs.  Crystal cleanliness throughout the hotel and in the rooms can even be scary.  I just can‚Äôt believe that with such a dense population it can be so clean.  The hotel has a chic pool, which is open around the clock.  He is always clean.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas.  Yalta hotels with a swimming pool are common, but you should pay attention to the cleanliness and temperature in them. </p><p>  As for food, everything is just excellent.  The restaurant serves such dishes (according to guest reviews) that I do not want to go to other places. </p><p>  Some tourists, as a remark, say that it was possible to make the restaurant on the beach closed (with air conditioning), but this opinion is not shared by everyone.  The hotel has an atmosphere of royal tranquility.  Here you can relax your body and soul, go to the salt room or for a massage.  You can plunge into history by visiting the historical building opposite.  Some tourists complain about their reviews, because hotels in Yalta with their own beach and pool should be closed.  And in this case, anyone can go to the territory or beach of the hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Villa Elena&quot;" class="if uuid-2726041" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2726041.jpg"></div><h2>  Eco-hotel "Levant" </h2><p>  The hotel is located at: Seaside Park, 3A.  The biggest advantage of the hotel, according to vacationers, is its location.  This is the <span>embankment of Yalta,</span> and the hotel beach is cleaned and guarded by employees of the Levant Hotel.  Tourists believe that the beach should be closed.  The cleanliness and availability of umbrellas attract a large number of people who are not living in the hotel.  This creates a certain discomfort for vacationers.  In general, the rooms are quite decent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is new furniture and a gorgeous view of the sea from the window.  Breakfast is included in the price.  For a fee, you can enjoy lunch and dinner in the restaurant.  However, there are many of them nearby, so there will be plenty to choose from. </p><h2>  Yalta: hotels with a pool by the sea.  Oreanda </h2><p>  The hotel complex "Oreanda" can be found at the address: Lenin street, 35/2 in Yalta.  In the city, almost all hotels are equipped with swimming pools, but not everyone has their own private pond with sea water.  Oreanda also offers a wonderful spa area, salt room, baths and massage.  The salt room and its own cinema pleasantly surprise many tourists.  Many hotels in Yalta with a pool, however, cannot boast of an extensive spa complex.  The rooms at the hotel are spacious and have the necessary facilities for sleeping and taking a bath.  If necessary, you can ask the staff, and you will bring additional cosmetics or hygiene products.  Cleaning is carried out regularly, everything is clean and tidy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travel.momondo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small pool in the yard" class="if uuid-2726048" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2726048.jpg"></div><p>  The interior of the hotel is classic, very calm.  And the hotel itself is somehow peaceful.  There is no fuss and noise.  Everything is done measuredly.  Breakfast is ordinary - buffet.  There is everything you need.  Lunch and dinner can be ordered.  And it‚Äôs convenient that you can make an order by a certain time.  When you come to dinner, the table is already set, and you do not have to spend hours waiting for your dishes.  According to tourists, the hotel is one of the three best in Yalta.  Service and comfort are top notch. </p><h2>  Hotel "Bristol" </h2><p>  This hotel is located at: st.  Roosevelt, house 10. A fairly large building of the Soviet type.  Good value for money.  The rooms have everything you need: towels and slippers, toiletries and bathrobes.  Upon request, they bring a kettle and cups. </p><p>  Most tourists respond positively about this place.  Only a few noticed negative aspects: noisy air conditioning, poor water pressure and lack of internet.  The hotel administration claims that these were temporary problems.  However, they influenced the feedback of some guests.  In the hotel restaurant you can have breakfast at the buffet from 07:00 to 10? 00.  The food is varied and tasty.  There is an assortment of cereals, children's breakfasts, dairy and cheese products, as well as many drinks.  In general, everyone will find food to taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small pool at the hotel" class="if uuid-2726032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2726032.jpg"></div><h2>  SPA-hotel "Seaside Park" </h2><p>  Complex at: Seaside Park named after  Gagarina, house 4, received an ambiguous assessment from the guests.  Many praise the rooms and service.  The excellent location and proximity to the sea, of course, attract many tourists.  However, there are nuances.  Some guests in their reviews note dirt and dust in the rooms.  Tables and doors of showers are all in dust and dirt.  Also a big minus tourists consider too noisy atmosphere in the hotel.  Nearby there are many cafes and restaurants, and in the rooms above the dining room all the time you hear the operation of the hood.  All these shortcomings greatly overshadow the rest in this place. </p><p>  Hotels with a pool (Yalta, Crimea) should bring vacationers the maximum of positive emotions.  It is worth noting that there are positive reviews about the hotel, and there are a lot of them.  Nice and comfortable pool, great food and drinks and an excellent wellness center.  In general, you won‚Äôt be bored. </p><h2>  Hotel Atlantis </h2><p>  This epic name was given to a place for tourists in Yalta on Kommunarov Street, 7A.  The appearance of the hotel fully meets its name.  Stone columns and flat roofs, lots of greenery and unusual plants, arches instead of windows - all this reminds of the Stone Age.  However, as soon as you go inside, all these sensations will disappear, and you will feel in a spacious European apartment. </p><p>  Classic low-key style with notes of minimalism can be traced in all apartments.  Yalta hotels with a swimming pool are not uncommon.  So, ‚ÄúAtlantis‚Äù has its own oasis in which you can swim and relax.  Many tourists in their reviews note that the hotel rooms are very spacious and comfortable.  Everything is done taking care of vacationers.  Simple but tasty breakfasts are included.  From the window a beautiful view of the sea.  Beautiful, clean and pleasant - that‚Äôs all that vacationers write about the hotel.  I must say that tourists are so satisfied that they do not indicate even minor flaws in their reviews. </p><h2>  Hotel "Chestnut Mansion" </h2><p>  Walking in Yalta along Biryukov Street, you will not pass by building No. 34 - this is the Chestnut Mansion hotel.  It is as if hiding in the shade of the magnificent foliage of trees, hiding its beauty from prying eyes.  For a noisy city, this place is exceptionally quiet and comfortable. </p><p>  From morning to night, you can enjoy the murmur of a rivulet, birdsong and the chirping of grasshoppers.  The apartments themselves in the rooms are very spacious, with some unusual gloss.  Here, even the interior is surprisingly calm.  For those who are tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, this is an ideal place.  In the courtyard of the hotel there is a spacious pool with a comfortable water temperature.  It is always clean and well maintained.  The rooms have small kitchens, so you can cook something yourself. </p><p>  The hotel has its own restaurant, which takes into account all the preferences of vacationers.  Many tourists in their reviews write that they will return here again. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krym.guru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel by the sea" class="if uuid-2725984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2725984.jpg"></div><h2>  Pension house of creativity "Actor" </h2><p>  This hotel complex can be found at: st.  Drazhinsky, 35. The boarding house was originally opened with an emphasis on wellness: massage, pool and other procedures.  In their reviews, tourists who come here not for the first time say that the hotel is a bit spoiled. </p><p>  Many wellness services do not provide.  Furniture and furnishings are outdated, and photos from the site are not true.  Of course, there are those who like this place of rest.  Many come here again.  Breakfast is said to be quite ordinary: porridge, yogurt, cheese and sausage.  You can eat in the morning before going to the beach.  Recently, 2 new coffee machines appeared in the dining room, which eliminated the lines for an invigorating drink in the morning. </p><p>  According to guest reviews, the hotel is not bad, but requires a little modernization.  I would like all services to be provided with high quality and in full. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dreempics.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beachfront hotels" class="if uuid-2725997" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/68653/2725997.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In conclusion, I want to note that Yalta (good hotels with a pool are available here) is very attractive for tourists in almost all seasons of the year (with the exception of several winter months).  That is why hotels and guest houses try to organize holidays for tourists with maximum comfort.  Almost all hotels in Yalta with a pool and umbrellas, some have baths and saunas.  Everything you need to relax. </p>
