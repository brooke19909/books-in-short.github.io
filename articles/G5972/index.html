The advantage of this technology was that it could be used without any, even the simplest analog-to-digital converters.  As a result, it was possible to reproduce previously recorded sound even without electricity, using fully mechanical devices.  Over time, this technology improved, and as a result became the standard of quality, because it is the lack of coding that allows you to save live sound. </p><p>  In the modern world, only a few afford expensive equipment for playing vinyl records.  However, there are budget options for players, such as the Pioneer PL 990. Reviews of it emphasize that low cost can be combined with quite acceptable quality.  This article is devoted to this model of a vinyl player, its characteristics, key features and disadvantages.  Let's start with the main thing - appearance and characteristics. </p><h2>  Options and appearance </h2><p>  If you see this player for the first time, you may not notice that it belongs to the category of modern technology.  The manufacturer tried to keep the recognizable outline of the player cases, manufactured in the 70-80s of the last century, as much as possible. </p><p>  The device is delivered in a compact cardboard box equipped with a large amount of sealant.  This is a fairly reasonable precaution, because the Pioneer PL 990 has a large number of fragile parts.  The largest of them is a translucent plastic cover that covers the entire mechanism. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Externally, the player is a strict rectangle with clear edges and sharp corners.  On the front panel is the majority of controls, as well as a special scale that allows you to fine-tune the speed of rotation of the disk.  This parameter is especially important, because even a small divergence leads to a significant distortion of sound. </p><p>  Under the cover is a massive disk with a special coating on which vinyl records are placed.  The tonearm is quite light and has no additional adjustment.  Due to its simple operation, the Pioneer PL 990 vinyl player is recommended as the first step into the world of quality music.  It is ready to work right out of the box, and does not require fine tuning - all the necessary operations, except for speed adjustment, were made at the factory during testing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.parts-express.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vinyl player pioneer pl 990" class="if uuid-2517424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517424.jpg"></div><p>  On the rear panel there are holes through which the necessary cables are inserted.  One of them is designed to supply power from a 220 V network, while the second is connected to an audio frequency amplifier using classic round connectors called ‚Äútulips‚Äù or ‚Äúbananas‚Äù.  It is worth noting that these cables are not supplied separately and are not disconnected from the player. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the kit, in addition to the device itself, there is a spare <span>pickup needle,</span> which can be easily installed if the main one fails.  There is also a small adapter, designed for installation on a disc specific plates, at one time widespread in America.  They had a hole in the center much larger than the usual ‚Äúvinyl‚Äù, and the adapter serves to correctly position the plate on the disk. </p><p>  The necessary cables for connecting the record player to the network and connecting it to the amplifier are also included.  They are non-removable and are located in the back of the Pioneer PL 990. For some users this may seem like a plus, while others, on the contrary, complain about this feature, because they are often not long enough and you have to use adapters and extension cords, which can negatively affect the quality sounding. </p><h2>  Control system </h2><p>  This model is recommended for those who use this technique for the first time.  The fact is that it has a minimum number of settings, and the instructions for use are quite simple. </p><p>  On the front panel is a small number of controls.  The most difficult task is to set the speed of the disk.  To do this, in accordance with the instructions for the Pioneer PL 990, gently turn the knob and follow the special indicator in the center.  When there are indicators on it that correspond to the speed synchronization, the setting should be stopped, and the device can be considered ready for use. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is worth noting that this operation will not have to be done so often, since this parameter practically does not go astray.  The only reason that can force you to repeat a complex procedure is the accidental shift of the tuning handle. </p><p>  In order to listen to recordings from vinyl discs, you need to set their size using the special button.  Two sizes are common in the world.  Their diagonals are indicated on the switch.  Correct installation of the size of the vinyl disc is required for the automation.  The manufacturer took care to minimize the possibility of damage to the Pioneer PL 990 plate or needle during switching on.  Therefore, the tonearm has its own drive, which, by pressing the only button responsible for starting playback, move the needle to the beginning of the plate, lower it, and at the end raise it and put it back. </p><p>  If desired, you can move the needle yourself and place it above the desired location on the plate.  To do this, there is a button, in fact, which is a kind of implementation of the pause function.  She raises the tonearm and leaves it in the position in which it was during playback.  If it is pressed again, the needle will lower to the same place.  By moving the needle to the desired marking place with the pause button pressed, you can manually select the desired track.  No more controls are provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitalcinema.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer pl 990" class="if uuid-2517427" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517427.jpg"></div><h2>  The presence of a phono stage </h2><p>  For a person who is faced with playing music from vinyl for the first time, most of the terms are incomprehensible, and the features of configuration and connection are a complex ‚Äúscience‚Äù.  Therefore, the developer tried to make life as easy as possible for the user by installing a phono stage in the Pioneer PL 990 record player itself. </p><p>  Most devices of this type need to be connected through an external phono stage and do not work with conventional amplifiers.  The model under consideration can be easily connected to any <span>speaker system.</span>  Her role can be anything, such as a music center, car amplifier, and even computer speakers with the appropriate connector. </p><p>  This approach allows you to make the purchase of this device not too costly and as simple as possible.  The ability to connect using familiar and understandable standards has increased the popularity of the Pioneer PL 990 vinyl record player among users who did not want to delve too deeply into radio electronics issues. </p><h2>  Application of precision servomotor </h2><p>  One of the key elements of the player is the engine, which spins the support disk.  From its quality depends on how pleasant the sound signal will be by ear. </p><p>  The fact is that at a low speed, any deviation from the norm can significantly distort the sound of music, which is unlikely to appeal to users who are well aware of how their favorite tracks should sound.  In turn, the use of a precision servomotor made it possible to stabilize the rotation speed of the vinyl disc as much as possible and to avoid such jerks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.platenspeler-shop.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer pl 990 specifications" class="if uuid-2517431" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517431.jpg"></div><p>  It was due to him that setting the speed became a fairly simple task, easily implemented without additional equipment.  It is worth remembering that the motor is connected to the drive with a drive, so any loads should be avoided.  No need to try to stop or, conversely, accelerate the plate during playback using hands, as this will lead to stretching of the rubber element and its worthlessness.  If even with the correct speed setting the sound ‚Äúfloats‚Äù, it is recommended to replace the strap with a new one of the appropriate diameter and thickness. </p><p>  Motors of precision type are characterized by almost silent operation, therefore, as Pioneer PL 990 reviews show, while listening to music the user does not feel extraneous noise that could introduce dissonance into the sound. </p><h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  For those who are well versed in such a technique, it is easier to form an opinion about it not according to the description of individual parameters, but on the basis of dry digital facts.  That is why it is worth considering the characteristics of the Pioneer PL 990 provided by the manufacturer. </p><p>  The dimensions of this gadget are 420 x 100 x 342 mm.  It is quite compact and can accommodate, for example, on the cover of an amplifier or a small table.  The main thing is not to install the player near powerful speakers, as well as in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãstrong magnetic fields.  If strong vibration is transmitted to the device during operation, sound distortion is possible due to the needle jumping from one track to another. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mans.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer pl 990 review" class="if uuid-2517423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517423.jpg"></div><p>  The diameter of the supporting disc is 295 mm, which is enough to accommodate standard 30-cm vinyl discs on it.  These were the ones that were produced in the Soviet Union, and also are the standard of modern analogue audio carriers. </p><p>  If desired, the playback speed can be switched between two main standards - 33 and 45 rpm.  Another standard, 78 rpm, is quite rare, so it‚Äôs hard to find it in budget models, although it offers a much higher sound quality. </p><p>  The signal-to-noise ratio is 50 decibels, which can be called a fairly high indicator for a public sector employee.  Often, it can already be found in middle-class models, which does the honor to the manufacturer. </p><h2>  Features of tonearm </h2><p>  In order to simplify the design, the developer applied a direct tonearm, which is used in most cases.  It is a tube hollow inside, mounted on a special movable suspension.  Facilitating the operation of the Pioneer PL 990 vinyl disc player, the manufacturer decided to adjust the downforce at the factory and make this figure fixed.  Depending on the type of disk and speed, it ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 grams.  This indicator cannot be changed, since the load on the tonearm is static and cannot move. </p><p>  At the edge of the tonearm is a sound head with a needle.  It has a simple design so that the user can easily replace it in case of malfunction or wear.  Just press the latch, and the needle will be in your hands.  This operation should be done carefully, since the head and needle are very sensitive elements and do not tolerate rough handling and damage. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.platenspeler-shop.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer pl 990 manual" class="if uuid-2517432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517432.jpg"></div><h2>  Upgrade options </h2><p>  Users note that some points in the device due to its low cost are underdeveloped.  However, having basic skills in working with radio equipment, such shortcomings can be eliminated without problems. </p><p>  The first and main of them is the inability to remove and replace the speaker cable.  To solve this problem, it is enough to place the appropriate connectors in the rear part of the Pioneer PL 990 vinyl player and solder the existing cable to them from the inside in accordance with the polarity.  Of course, such actions should be performed only when the guarantee has already expired and you have the necessary skills for this. </p><p>  The second point that many decide to fix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe ability to connect the Pioneer PL 990 player bypassing the built-in phono stage.  If the user has an amplifier in which there is a phono stage, then its use may be preferable, since it is quite possible to significantly improve the sound quality.  To connect in this way, you need to find the part of the circuit that is directly responsible for the operation of the tonearm and pickup, and intercept the signal coming from it.  To do this, use only a special acoustic or microphone cable that is capable of transmitting a weak signal without interference over long distances.  Good shielding will keep the sound quality unchanged. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pioneer pl 990 player" class="if uuid-2517429" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517429.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive user reviews about the model </h2><p>  The time has come to analyze based on the feedback on the Pioneer PL 990 vinyl player from users who have already had the opportunity to operate it for a certain time.  It is they who can show without embellishment its advantages and disadvantages.  Better to start with the positive aspects, since there are still more of them, and they demonstrate attractive features of the gadget. </p><p>  Among the main positive points, the owners are distinguished by the following. </p><ul><li>  Acceptable sound quality.  For its value, the player produces a fairly high-quality sound that can eclipse digital formats.  Even despite some flaws in the phono stage, most users will not notice small distortions that are not critical and will not disfigure the original recordings. </li><li>  Automated management.  Many buyers of this device are novice users, and they warmly respond to such ease of use.  Lack of skills could damage the needle or the vinyl discs themselves if the playback process were not automatic.  Minimal user intervention with careful handling makes the device almost eternal. </li><li>  Nice design.  The manufacturer did not move away from the classic layout of the control elements.  Thanks to this, the Pioneer PL 990 vinyl player fits well into any interior and does not look too catchy or bulky.  A modest appearance helps him not stand out from the rest of the home appliances and acoustic equipment, and also gives solidity. </li><li>  The presence of a strobe.  The speed adjustment due to this simple device can be done not by ear, but according to quite accurate, simple and understandable readings of a special indicator.  Thanks to this, the recordings sound exactly at the speed at which they are intended to be reproduced, without distortion. </li><li>  Easy maintenance and installation.  It is enough to quickly look through the instructions once to connect, configure and launch the player for the first time without the help of a specialist without any problems.  In the same way, the user can perform simple repairs, for example, replace the needle or strap. </li><li>  Ability to connect to any speaker system.  Built-in phono stage eliminates the need to install additional blocks, adapters and other equipment.  Due to this, the number of individual devices does not increase, and the player can use any speaker amplifier or active system as speakers.  As reviews of the Pioneer PL 990 show, the most common connection option can be called music centers with AUX input and computer speakers.  Some users even connected it to a TV with high-quality speakers and used it as a sound reinforcement system. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, the player is actually liked by many users and allows some to plunge into the past, nostalgic with their favorite artists of the eighties, while others hear modern recordings in a completely new quality.  However, the gadget received a number of negative aspects described in the reviews of the Pioneer PL 990, which must be considered before buying.  Some of them have already been mentioned, but they can be eliminated independently. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.useddudley.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="turntable pioneer pl 990" class="if uuid-2517435" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2517435.jpg"></div><h2>  Negative user reviews </h2><p>  The first negative aspect is that the cables are soldered directly to the device.  Most users chose to lose the warranty, but eliminate this shortcoming on their own by installing the appropriate connector.  After that, they had the opportunity to transmit an audio signal over much greater distances.  This is especially convenient if the player and amplifier are at different ends of the room. </p><p>  The second point is the inability to adjust the force of pressing the needle to the surface of the vinyl disc.  According to reviews of the Pioneer PL 990 player, sometimes this parameter would not hurt to adjust, especially if the player is located near the speakers and painfully reacts to vibration.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to eliminate this drawback at home. </p><p>  Some users noted with displeasure the lack of the ability to select a speed of 78 rpm.         ,       . ,      ,      ,    . </p><p>     ‚Äì     .           ,      . ,     Pioneer PL 990,      ,     . ,    ,       . </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>     , Pioneer PL 990     ,        ¬´¬ª        .          ,     ,     . </p><p> The gadget can be taken by those who plan to use it as the first step to better technology in the future.  It will help to learn how to handle the plates themselves, maintain the main components and, possibly, even introduce their own changes in the design.  In any case, it fully justifies its value. </p>
