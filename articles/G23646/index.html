The Egyptians at one time created entire cities for burial - necropolises.  Currently, there are various types of <span>burials:</span> mafia <span>cemeteries</span> , underwater burials, cemeteries, cemeteries for pets.  It turns out that some old and even new cars also fall into peculiar cemeteries.  Let's talk about them in more detail. </p><h2>  How does a car graveyard appear? </h2><p>  It would seem logical to sell the whole battered "iron horse" or, if you don‚Äôt find anyone, take it apart.  However, this often does not happen.  At first, the hand does not rise to the ‚Äúfaithful comrade‚Äù, and then the rust does not allow to receive profit from it.  So there are dumps of old cars. </p><p>  The cemetery of cars can be found: </p><ul><li>  in the forest; </li><li>  in the village; </li><li>  in buildings abandoned by people (old hospitals, children's camps); </li><li>  in abandoned car parks. </li></ul><p>  Usually, the territory becomes a burial place for cars accidentally.  For example, the owner had a small business.  He bought <span>old cars</span> for nothing <span>,</span> dismantled them for spare parts and sold them.  Then the businessman died, and none of his relatives took up his case. </p><p>  Sometimes, in order not to waste parking space or to pay for parking, the owners themselves take away the used cars to the forest or village and leave them there forever. </p>

    <p>  Currently, there are whole necropolises from unsold cars.  Out of the factory, but not finding the owners, completely new cars spend their lives there. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Abandoned cars abroad </h2><p>  It is believed that the first car cemetery appeared in the United States in the 30s of the last century.  True, at first it was not a burial place of old cars, but a small business of the Lewis family.  Senior Lewis bought up old cars and sold them for parts.  In the 72nd year, the father of the family passed away, but nobody picked up his ‚Äúbaton‚Äù. </p><p>  Now in the state of Georgia, under the scorching sun, about 5 thousand worthless cars, trucks, office vehicles, as well as tractors and school buses rust.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cemetery is almost 140 thousand square meters. </p><p>  Another car graveyard is located in <span>Oregon.</span>  Old cars are gathering dust near the central airport of Eugene.  It used to be a Scott &amp; Sans transport company.  The office was engaged in the evacuation of "iron horses".  In 2005, the company went bankrupt.  It did not work to quickly sell the car, and a cemetery formed. </p>

    <p>  Currently, car dumps are in Sweden, Belgium, England, France.  In Bolivia there is a cemetery of old trains.  Ukraine is notorious for the remains of Chernobyl technology. </p><p>  In all countries, they treat this phenomenon differently.  Someone, like Americans, makes museums with a paid entrance out of automobile necropolises, while other countries, such as Switzerland, destroy the burial places of rusting retro ‚Äúhorses‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How do iron horses survive in Russia? </h2><p>  When talking about a car cemetery in Russia, most often they mean just a dump of old equipment that was accidentally discovered in a suburb in a forest, or dozens of rusting cars that have stood on the sidelines of country roads for years. </p><p>  However, there are more or less official landfills for cars.  For example, a car cemetery in Moscow.  The capital was distinguished by the presence of a thematic museum.  It is believed that any visitor to the site of the Mosgortrans State Unitary Enterprise can see how old public cars live: trolleybuses, trams and buses.  However, according to eyewitnesses, visitors are not allowed there.  And nobody watches the retro ‚Äúhorses‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  Another ‚Äúburial" of cars can be found near the Sheremetyevo Airport.  In Moscow suburbs, the crumbling cars rust in the territory of an abandoned factory.  At the same time, almost every abandoned car officially has a host. </p><h2>  Cemetery of unsold cars </h2><p>  Even less fortunate were cars that never had owners.  About 90 million cars are produced annually in the world, but not all are created to drive them.  Some of the exhibits almost immediately fall into the cemetery of new cars. </p><p>  Entire necropolises of unsold cars appear in major cities around the world.  For example, in different cities near the Nissan plant there are car cemeteries that did not find their owners. </p><p>  New cars rust in the large Swindon parking lot in England, about 60 thousand cars are waiting for their owners in Maryland.  ‚ÄúCitroens‚Äù gather dust in England, ‚ÄúToyota‚Äù - in California, ‚ÄúFords‚Äù - in Detroit.  Even the powerful Land Rovers can never leave Liverpool. </p>

    <p>  Thousands of cars from Europe and the USA stand at the <span>airport of St. Petersburg.</span>  All these cars are waiting for the owners.  But everyone is not and is not willing.  On the one hand, it seems, drop the car dealers price, and the owners would be found.  But factory directors will never take such a risk, because otherwise all car prices will plummet.  So there are dumps of new "iron horses". </p>
