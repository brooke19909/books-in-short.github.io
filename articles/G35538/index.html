    <p>  Religious reforms in the medieval Russian state are associated primarily with the name of Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavovich.  And speaking about the reasons for adopting Christianity, his own spiritual search is often highlighted, recalling the prince‚Äôs miraculous insight, about ambassadors sent to different parts of the world to see and tell about miracles there and so on.  The spiritual quest, no doubt, had a place to be.  However, in this context it is more important to recall the <span>geopolitical position</span> and development of the East Slavic state of that period.  Through the efforts of the militant princes, especially Rurik, Igor and Svyatoslav, Russia by the middle of the 10th century had occupied quite vast territories, uniting under their control the previously scattered tribes of the Eastern Slavs.  The time has come to strengthen power, create a single state and a single people.  Yes, the baptism of Russia, the date of celebration of which today falls on July 28, laid down to a large extent </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baptism of russia date 988" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/261288.jpg" width="404"></div>  foundations for the emergence of a single Russian community among the barbarian tribes.  Returning to the Middle Ages, it should be noted that Vladimir carried out a number of other reforms (military, administrative), the essence of which was to create a <span>centralized state</span> with a single apparatus, army, law, tax system and so on.  Actually, the time itself required such reforms from Vladimir, since without them Russia could hardly function effectively as a state and survive in the struggle with its neighbors.  However, it was religious reform that became the life of the prince.  <span>The baptism of Russia, the</span> date and description of which is well known to us from a number of sources, was a necessary matter.  The prince's first attempt in this area was the creation of a single pantheon of <span>pagan gods.</span>  This action was aimed at centralizing the state and rallying various tribes on a single cultural basis.  However, the reform failed, so Vladimir turned to monotheistic religions, very popular at that time.  And this step was very justified.  The fact is that the <span>adoption of Christianity</span> not only provided a powerful incentive for the internal development of the state, but also allowed Russia to enter a single cultural and value orbit of the advanced countries of that time, especially Byzantium, becoming on a par with them.  In material terms, this gave Vladimir many new opportunities.  For example, he made a relationship with the Byzantine Vasileus, taking Princess Anna as his wife.  It was due to these considerations that the baptism of Rus took place.  The date of the event itself was the result of a number of incidents.  In addition, it is important to note that Christians have long settled in the Eastern Slavic lands.  More than a century in Kiev existed <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="baptism of russia celebration date" class="if" height="424" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/261289.jpg" width="600"></div>  <span>Elias Church,</span> even the grandmother of Vladimir, <span>Princess Olga</span> belonged to the Orthodox group <span>.</span>  Thus, the baptism of Rus, whose date is associated with the spread and strengthening of Christianity in the lands of the Eastern Slavs, was most likely timely.

    <p>  Baptism of Rus: date and description of the event </p><p>  The Christianization of the population has become violent.  The immediate symbolic baptism of Russia took place in one of the tributaries of the Dnieper, the river Pochain.  Peasants, still faithful to pagan traditions, were massively and forcibly driven into the waters of the river under the sermons of priests.  Here the baptism of Rus took place.  The date is 988 according to the Christian calendar, as the annals tell us.  At the same time, the triumphal procession of Christianity lasted more than a dozen, not even a hundred years.  As a spiritual path, it was certainly more progressive than paganism, but the population remained faithful to the old gods for a long time.  And they did not leave the spiritual life of the Russians completely.  And today, many holidays in the Orthodox canon, strictly speaking, have pagan roots. </p>
