    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  This place was called "fake Gelendzhik" until 1964.  Such a name was received by Divnomorskoye in the last century.  This was due to the similarity of certain features of the coast in this place with the entrance to the bay of Gelendzhik.  Because of this phenomenon, a lot of confusion arose.  In particular, the sailors mistakenly tried to land in the wrong place.  The low mountains of the Markhot ridge, covered with mixed forests, surround the village and the coastal valley on three sides. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  A mild maritime climate prevails here.  Many factors have a beneficial effect on the mood and health of vacationers.  A huge number of sunny days can be attributed to them - there are more than one hundred and fifty of them.  In addition, there is picturesque nature and the gentle sea.  Divnomorskoe annually receives a large number of tourists.  The infrastructure is widely developed here.  One of the popular health resorts in the village is considered to be a Navy sanatorium.  Divnomorskoye has all the conditions for recreation and recreation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Divnomorskoe" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/470266.jpg" width="400"></div>
