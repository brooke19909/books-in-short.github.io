A long graceful neck, delicate facial features, high cheekbones, large eyes - this is how we see her now.  The appearance of the beauty is known thanks to the bust of the ancient Egyptian sculptor Thutmose, and she is fully consistent with her name (‚ÄúNefertiti‚Äù means ‚Äúthe beauty is coming‚Äù). </p>

    <p>  Scientists do not know who the parents were, but there are suggestions that his father served as chief minister at the court of the <span>pharaoh Tutankhamun</span> and, possibly, later took the throne.  At the age of twelve, the girl was elected as a <span>wife to Pharaoh</span> Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV), who ascended the throne in about 131 BC.  <span>The Queen of Egypt Nefertiti</span> ruled with her husband, and there are even frescoes where she was depicted with royal regalia.  After the death of her husband, she probably ruled for several years herself, which is not surprising, because women in ancient Egypt were equal with men, they could also rule, fight, trade and own property. </p>

    <p>  Alas, not enough information has come down to our days so that we can confidently say something about the life of the beautiful queen.  One way or another, after her death, she was buried with honors in the tomb built by her husband.  Subsequently, the crypt was looted, but the mummy was preserved.  Scientists are still arguing whether she belongs to Nefertiti, or this is one of her daughters.  The first version is supported by bioarchaeologist Don Brotwell, Egyptologists Joan Fletcher and Susan James.  In 2003, an attempt was even made to reconstruct the appearance of the deceased, relying on the mummy, and the result is really very similar to the famous image of Nefertiti.  The Queen of Egypt, whose photo of the bust is known, perhaps, throughout the world, was not only a ruler, but was also revered as a goddess.  The most famous and beautiful of the wives of the Egyptian rulers, she lived in a luxurious palace on the east bank of the Nile River. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  When Nefertiti, the queen of Egypt, died and was buried, her grave was looted by fanatical opponents and even abused the mummy (she had her arm torn off and there were a number of other injuries on her body).  However, this did not stop British scientists in 2002 from concluding that they found the mummy of the beautiful ruler in the mysterious crypt at number 35. Their findings were based on DNA analysis results, as well as indirect evidence.  So, for example, only Nefertiti, the queen of Egypt, and her daughter wore two earrings in one ear (and the mummy does have two punctures in the lobe).  On the forehead there is a trace from the bandage worn only by the queens.  And next to the mummy, the remains of a Nubian wig were found, which was popular among women precisely in the era of the beautiful ruler. </p><p>  Nefertiti, Queen of Egypt, firmly entered not only in history, but also in the culture of the modern world.  An extraordinary beauty, she still excites the imagination of poets, artists and writers, and her image appears both in painting and literature, and in the products of <span>mass culture.</span>  Along with Cleopatra, this is one of the most famous women and <span>symbols of Ancient Egypt.</span> </p><p>  I must say that Nefertiti, the queen of Egypt, is still considered a symbol of beauty, and her image is an embodiment of grace, subtle grace and that spiritual beauty that does not fade over the years, becoming more beautiful. </p>
