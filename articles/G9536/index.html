    <h2>  Gadget design </h2><p>  First of all, we note that <span>smart watches</span> from Apple will be of two form factors - smaller (38 mm) and slightly larger (42 mm).  The watch model is available in three main versions - Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition. </p><p>  Customers can choose from 6 different housing options: <span>gold, rose gold,</span> steel and dark gray steel, aluminum and dark gray aluminum. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the company for the first time launches products with so many design modifications.  The simplest version of a smart watch can be decorated with a more expensive strap - metal, silicone or leather.  Expensive models will be equipped with a strap made of precious metals.  The straps are all removable and highly adapted to any user. </p><h2>  Apple iWatch Sport Series </h2><p>  The most affordable version is the iWatch Apple Sport.  Watch case - aluminum. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Their main difference will be that the screen is protected not by sapphire coating, but by durable glass.  Therefore, the display is more noticeably scratched and more sensitive to mechanical damage.  This version offers 10 different colors for the straps. </p>

    <h2>  Apple iWatch Series </h2><p>  The second series of smart watches involves the presence of 20 different straps.  The display size for all models is the same - 38 or 42 mm. </p><p>  The watch display case is made of stainless steel and protected by a special sapphire crystal. </p><h2>  Apple Watch Edition Series </h2><p>  This watch is for lovers of everything luxurious and expensive.  The display and content of the gadget remain the same, but the appearance is significantly different. </p><p>  For example, the Apple iWatch case from the Edition collection is made in yellow or pink gold.  Various straps are also provided, they are all interchangeable. </p><p>  The display of this watch model is also protected by sapphire. </p>

    <h2>  Apple iWatch: Features </h2><p>  Versions with different display sizes differ in its resolution.  The smaller display will have a resolution of 272 by 340 pixels, 290 pp.  This model was developed for owners of a small hand - young people, girls or children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The 42 mm display will have a resolution of 312 by 390 pixels and already 302 pp.  Of course, such a gadget will look more impressive on the hand of an adult. </p><p>  To control the clock on the right side, a special wheel is built in, with which you can move around the gadget menu, as well as zoom in or out on the screen.  This item is called Digital Crown.  A multi-touch for such a small display would be an irrational solution, and one-touch gestures are enough. </p><p>  Under the control wheel there is also an ode button, which can be conventionally called ‚ÄúHome‚Äù - it returns the user to the main menu, and can also launch the Apple Pay system by double-clicking. </p><p>  Of the features of the watch, it is also worth noting that they will recognize the power of touches.  The technology is called Force Touch. </p><p>  The device is equipped with a mass of ready-made desktop design options.  There will be available electronic and analog clocks, various wallpapers, options for displaying the date and activity. </p><h2>  Apple iWatch‚Äì Not a standalone device </h2><p>  And, of course, an important feature of this watch is the need to have iPhone 5 and higher.  The older ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù do not synchronize with the clock. </p>

    <p>  In this case, the iPhone will act as a management console for the watch.  Without a smartphone, not a single application in the watch will work, not even a fitness tracker (pedometer).  They will only show time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the case when a pair of smartphones is created, the watch has a lot of applications, almost any possibilities are available in them, like on the iPhone - Siri, the function of answering a call and sending SMS by voice, various sports applications. </p><p>  Communication is provided through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology.  Unfortunately for owners of the Apple iPad and Android or Windows Phone smartphones, synchronization will fail. </p><h2>  IWatch Apple Smartwatch Hardware Base: Overview </h2><p>  First of all, this is the new Apple S1 chip, and the Taptic Engine vibration module provides feedback to the gadget. </p>

    <p>  The watch‚Äôs own physical memory is 8 GB.  At the same time, music can only be stored at 2 GB, as for the photo - only 75 MB.  The rest of the space is provided for various applications.  Practice shows that there is no need to store any files on the watch, since all this can be saved on the smartphone and use the data from there.  The watch is equipped with a memory just in case. </p><h2>  Battery and battery life </h2><p>  The company noted that the battery charge of the watch will be enough to work throughout the whole daylight hours - 18 hours.  Of course, we are talking about a moderate load on the screen.  If it is constantly on, the gadget will work much less. </p><p>  The built-in battery has a capacity of 205 mAh.  Charging time is approximately 2.5 hours.  Charging is connected to the watch in a magnetic way - this is Magsafe wireless inductive charging. </p><h2>  Interesting features of the Apple iWatch gadget </h2><p>  The watch has integrated heart rate technology.  To do this, you need to keep your hand level for some time.  There is also a function to send your data to friends.  How it works?  For example, you are talking to someone using a watch, also with the owner of the same gadget.  At this point, you can turn on the transmission of your heart rate to the other person.  So, you are talking on the phone and you feel the heartbeat of your interlocutor, and the beating of your heart is ‚Äútransmitted‚Äù to the person you are talking to. </p>

    <p>  You can also transfer to the interlocutor the pictures depicted with your own hand - a smiley, a heart, a flower and much more.  This feature is a nice addition to the luxurious design and super features of this gadget. </p><p>  Of course, the watch is protected from moisture.  But this quality is also conditional.  It must be understood that they are protected, for example, from rain.  But if you decide to swim long distances with this watch in your hands, they are unlikely to stand it.  And the cost of the device does not allow to arrange such checks. </p><h2>  Cost Apple iWatch </h2><p>  Well, of course, the price of the issue also has a wide spread due to the large number of possible combinations.  The basic equipment iWatch Apple, the price of which will be $ 349, is suitable for people with a small budget.  This, by the way, will be the Watch Sport version, equipped with a silicone strap and an aluminum case, the size is 38 mm.  The same model with a 42 mm screen costs $ 399. </p><p>  The basic equipment of the classic version of the Watch will cost 549 or 599 dollars, depending on the size of the display. </p><p>  If we talk about the classics, for example, a 42 mm Watch display with a steel case and a Milanese Loop bracelet, then this equipment will cost $ 699.  There are models that, due to the material of the strap, will cost $ 1,099. </p><p>  But the cost of the gold version of the Watch Edition will be from 10 to 17 thousand dollars. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  Many stars have already purchased for themselves iWatch Apple.  Reviews about this gadget leave the best.  Of course, for lovers of new products from Apple, this gadget, of course, was an explosion of positive emotions, because it is not only made in the best traditions of devices from the company, but also provides convenience and comfort. </p><p>  It is impossible not to note that this gadget, if it does not satisfy the entire market of consumers of the company's products, is for the most part accurate, since the abundance of various design solutions will help everyone to choose their own iWatch Apple.  The price of the device will determine the external characteristics of the watch - it will be a stylish device with a gold case and a leather belt or a simpler version for athletes with a silicone strap. </p><p>  Smart watch users report that the gadget is very convenient to use.  It allows you to have free hands during calls, for example.  You do not need to remove the phone from your pocket.  This is especially convenient for people who drive.  And thanks to this, the battery of the phone is also saved. </p><p>  Convenience also lies in the fact that the watch is always on hand.  There is no need to constantly hold the phone in your hand while waiting for a call or message.  If the devices are in the same room, you can communicate using the clock.  Also, good feedback was received by the system of dictation of messages to watches by voice. </p><p>  Russian entrepreneurs who have tested the gadget are also pleased with the functions of the weather, calendar events, and the ability to view international time.  It is also suitable for people who spend a lot of time abroad and travel. </p><p>  At first, users report that the gadget does not seem to be very understandable to use, you need to get used to it, because the screen is small, everything seems too slow.  But you just need some time to get used to it. </p><p>  Also, many who have tried smart watches from other companies (after all, Apple is not a pioneer in such technologies) report that the company has thought through many details, thanks to which the magnificent design of the watch perfectly complements the high-quality internal content. </p>
