There are ancient squares and quarters, catacombs, magnificent palaces and temples.  One of the most memorable places is the Marcellus Theater in Rome. </p><h2>  The appearance of the monument </h2><p>  The antique open-air theater is located on the left bank <span>of the Tiber River.</span>  The place was not chosen by chance, because the Tiber is the main river of Rome.  It was according to her that, according to legend, they started up a basket with Romulus and Remus, who founded the city.  The walls of the theater turned to the side of the city streets, and its stage went directly onto the river. </p><p>  Externally, the architecture of the building may seem simple.  However, several construction techniques were used for its construction.  The materials used were Roman concrete, tuff and travertine.  The building was <span>decorated with marble statues,</span> bronze vases, <span>theater masks.</span> </p>

    <p>  It was the Marcellus Theater that became the prototype of the Colosseum known to all.  Initially, it had three floors, rising 30 meters up.  The diameter of the amphitheater was about 130 meters.  It accommodated up to fifteen thousand spectators. </p><p>  Each tier of the theater stood out for its <span>architectural order.</span>  So, the floors were supported by Doric, Ionic and Corinthian columns.  The highest level with Corinthian columns has not been preserved to this day.  There were only three such stone theaters in Rome, including Balba, Pompeii, and Domitian's odeon. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Foundation History </h2><p>  The Marcellus Theater was opened in 12 BC.  This is one of the oldest structures in Rome, preserved to this day.  The construction of the theater began Julius Caesar.  It was completed already under the emperor Octavian Augustus, who dedicated it to his late nephew Mark Claudius Marcellus.  The young man was destined to become the heir to the emperor, but he died from illness. </p><p>  The architectural roots of the Roman theater go back to ancient Greek traditions.  In Greece, it also had a radial shape.  The difference lies in the higher stage of the Romans and the way of constructing visual places (in Greece they were cut out in a rock, and not built separately). </p>

    <p>  Inside, the Marcellus Theater was divided into sectors intended for various segments of the population.  The most profitable and convenient places for viewing belonged to the local nobility.  One place, separated from the rest, was occupied by the emperor.  There were places intended for women, separately for ordinary people and slaves. </p><p>  On the opening day, a statue of Claudius poured out of bronze and covered with gold was placed on the stage.  Very soon, the theater became a popular venue in the city.  Here comedies, tragedies were played, mythological plots were reproduced.  By a separate order of Augustus even held secular games. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Perestroika Theater </h2><p>  Over the entire period of existence, the Marcellus Theater has experienced a number of changes.  It was rebuilt in the 1st century during the reign of Vespasian, and then in the 3rd century on the orders of Alexander Sever.  In the IV century, the building was no longer used as a theater.  He was abandoned, and the townspeople gradually began to dismantle the building for personal needs.  Parts of the theater went to the construction of bridges and houses of local residents. </p><p>  Later, the Favvi family used the building as a fortification, and even later the Savelli family turned it into their palace.  In the XVI century, the theater became the foundation for a family residence.  The Orsini family who bought it preferred to turn the building into a Renaissance estate.  After them, the territory was occupied by traders, placing around the perimeter of the shop. </p>

    <p>  In the XX century, all this ceased.  <span>Benito Mussolini</span> undertook to rebuild the theater <span>.</span>  He ordered the removal of all shops and outlets from the architectural monument.  The building was restored from 1926 to 1932.  The Marcellus Theater has acquired its former appearance.  The Renaissance extension was not destroyed, it exists now as a residential building. </p><h2>  Open-air museum </h2><p>  It is currently a museum.  This is the only surviving theater of the <span>Roman Empire.</span>  Hundreds of tourists visit the museum daily.  On the first tier, concerts, festivals and holidays are still held. </p>

    <p>  How to get to the theater?  The building is located on Via Teatro di Marcello, near Venice Square.  Nearby are many other interesting objects, for example, the Jewish District, the Capitol, the <span>Circus Maximus</span> and a landmark called Usta Truth.  It is easily accessible on foot from the Circo Massimo metro station. </p>
