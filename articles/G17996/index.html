How to get to Oranienbaum</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Among the suburban residences located in the suburbs of North Palmyra, Oranienbaum stands out.  His sights were included in the art complex, created by the inspired work of famous architects, talented craftsmen, painters and masters of decorative and applied art of the XVIII century and occupying a special place in the history of Russian and world culture. </p><h2>  Oranienbaum </h2><p>  In 1707, lands near the confluence of the Gulf of Karasta in the Gulf of Finland were granted by Peter I (emperor) to his associate Alexander Menshikov, who at that time was the governor of Ingermanland, who had left the Russian Empire at the end of the Northern War.  By order of the emperor‚Äôs favorite, on the coastal site opposite the <span>island of Kotlin, the</span> architects G. Schedel and D. Fontana erected the Grand Palace, which is almost as inferior to the emperor in Peterhof as its palace.  Here, the Lower Regular Garden was designed - one of the first in Russia.  Around the suburban residence of Alexander Menshikov, named by him Oranienbaum, a palace settlement of the same name arose. </p>

One of the legends says that here during the favorite of Peter I there was an orange orangery (Oranienbaum translated from German - an orange tree).  In summer, on the terraces and open staircases of the Grand Palace, a curiosity for the North was displayed in tubs - evergreens of the genus citrus.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Residence History </h2><p>  Over its history dating back more than 300 years, the residence has changed many owners, and the settlement has received the status of a city. </p><p>  In 1743, the residence was given as a gift to Peter III, who ascended the throne in 1761.  After the <span>palace coup of</span> 1762, a palace was built for Catherine II in Oranienbaum, which included <strong> </strong>  in the complex "Own cottage".  The constructions of his buildings became the only examples of the Rococo architectural style represented in Russia. </p><p>  Since 1796, the suburban residence was the property of the imperial family and was passed on to the next generation.  Before the revolution, its last owners were the Dukes of Mecklenburg-Strelitzky. </p>

In some palaces, in particular in Chinese, museums were opened.  In 1948, the city was renamed Lomonosov.  "Oranienbaum" (as the name) is preserved only behind the historical complex. <strong> </strong>  The city was not named after the great Russian scientist for a reason.  Near here, in the village of Ust-Ruditsa, was his estate, and a laboratory for the preparation of stained glass.

It should be noted that in the suburbs of St. Petersburg the only not destroyed during the Second World War and retained its historical authenticity was the historical and architectural ensemble ‚ÄúOranienbaum‚Äù, sights <strong> </strong>  whom <strong> </strong>  complete the series <strong> </strong>  representative residences of the Peterhof Road. </p><h2>  Architectural and landscape complex </h2>

In Oranienbaum, his works are the Chinese Palace, the Opera House, the Palace of Peter III and The Catalan Hill.

    <p>  All park structures make up a peculiar composition, which is divided into the Lower Garden with the Menshikov Palace and the Upper Park with its many historical monuments. </p><h2>  Unique buildings of the Petrine era </h2><p>  The construction of the Grand Palace and the creation of the Lower Park around it, the distinguishing feature of which is the architectural and artistic unity, served as the beginning of the creation of the Oranienbaum complex.  The sights of this part of the architectural complex, in addition to the Menshikov Palace, include the Catherine Building, Monplaisir Palace, Marly Palace, the Sea Canal and the most beautiful fountain alleys. </p><p>  All of them have survived to our time.  The Grand Palace itself, despite repeated alterations, has not greatly changed its appearance.  He always remained close to his original plan, which allows him to be ranked among the unique constructions of the Petrine era. </p><h2>  Landscape art </h2>

When creating the Upper Park, Rinaldi managed to achieve a smooth transition of one of its stylistic parts to another.  The talented master took into account the features of the picturesque area that distinguishes Oranienbaum.  The park, consisting of Own cottage and the Peterstadt ensemble, merged together.  It does not have strict lines, neatly trimmed tree crowns, characteristic of a regular layout.  On the other hand, a harmonious unity is clearly felt, in which the complex geometric patterns of alleys, platforms, the water maze of ponds and artificial lakes connected by channels, a riot of wildlife and unique architecture merged.  The latter is represented by a unique combination of the rococo style with elements of the still nascent classicism.

    <h2>  Art design.  The synthesis of beauty and expediency </h2><p>  An exceptional feature of the Upper Park is that its layout and the projects of all the structures in it were completed by one architect.  Rinaldi's <span>artistic design</span> combines the magic of synthesizing beauty and expediency.  A mixture of different styles in the decor, a combination of regular and landscape principles, the equal participation of methods of both directions distinguishes Oranienbaum, the sights of which harmoniously merged into a single whole with the landscape, striking with its beauty and grandeur. </p><h2>  Architectural and artistic ensembles of the park </h2><p>  In the depths of the Upper Park, the Chinese Palace opens its gaze, which is part of the complex of Own Cottage.  Interestingly, the original building was called the "Dutch house".  The new name appeared later and is more likely due to the fashion of the "Chinese".  The interior decoration of the palace is made in the spirit of Chinese and Japanese art. </p>

It was created in the XIX century and is an excellent decoration of landscape gardening architecture of the time.  Pergola was erected on the site of the Coffee House, which was never embodied in the life of Rinaldi.

    <p>  The ‚ÄúKatalnaya Gorka‚Äù, which is a grandiose park construction, attracts attention.  Here, the courtiers had fun riding from the ice slides, going one after another and amounting to 532 meters in length.  Traditional folk fun was also available in the summer. </p><p>  The Stone Hall construction was probably intended for concerts.  Currently, there is an interactive cinema and an exhibition of interior and park sculpture. </p><p>  In the Upper Park you can also see the Cavalry Corps, the Honorary Gate, a pavilion called "Chinese Cuisine". </p><h2>  Petrovsky park </h2><p>  <span>Petrovsky Park</span> is another creation of Rinaldi.  His planning was carried out with the participation of the master Lamberti.  When it was created according to the principle of Italian gardens, elements of a regular direction were also used.  Numerous cascades, terraces are interspersed with miniature pavilions, among which are a two-story Hermitage, a Solovyov arbor, a Chinese house. </p><p>  Now Petrovsky park is made in landscape style.  Its compositional basis is the Karasta River, Upper and Lower Ponds. </p><h2>  How to get to Oranienbaum? </h2>

    <p>  Imperial residences in the vicinity of St. Petersburg are included in a variety of sightseeing tours.  You can visit them yourself if you know in advance how to get there. </p><p>  Oranienbaum is located in the city of Lomonosov, located 40 kilometers from the northern capital.  It is best to get here from the southeastern part of the city.  So, you can get to the Oranienbaum railway station (in Lomonosov) from the Avtovo metro station by K-424a minibus, bus number 200;  from the station "Prospect Veteranov" - by bus No. 343.  Electric trains regularly leave from the Baltic Station to Lomonosov. </p><p>  Earlier it was possible to get to the museum-reserve from Kronstadt by ferry, now it is easier to get by regular bus No. 175. </p><h2>  Portable travel guide </h2><p>  At the entrance to the park is a map with the key places that Oranienbaum is famous for.  A photo of the plan in the future will help to plan your excursion correctly.  It is worth paying attention to the instructions for downloading a portable guide to the park - this is the electronic application ‚ÄúPark Oranienbaum‚Äù.  It has a plan, a coat of arms, information about the history of the complex and a short video. </p>
