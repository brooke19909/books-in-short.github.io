    <h2>  Hotel Services Ratings </h2><p>  According to the reviews of tourists, a rating was drawn up for the services of this hotel, which consists in evaluating the services on a five-point scale: </p><ul><li>  The hotel infrastructure was awarded a score of 3.5.  The landscaped area, which is ennobled by a green garden, was rated above all.  But the work of restaurants and bars raises a number of complaints. </li><li>  The quality of service was rated low enough and was rated 2.9.  Such a low rating is due to the lack of entertainment and animation, as well as the sluggishness of the staff. </li><li>  Hotel rooms have earned a fairly average rating of 3.1.  In general, the satisfactory condition of the apartments of the Abalone Resort 2 * hotel is noted (photos of tourists confirm this), but their condition is affected by the old age and deterioration of the hotel building.  Overhaul or at least redecoration is required. </li><li>  The hotel is practically not suitable for children, so the score on this item is 1.3. </li><li>  As for the location, a score of 3.5 was set here.  There are many bars, restaurants and shops in the vicinity of the hotel, but the road to the beach is quite long. </li></ul>
