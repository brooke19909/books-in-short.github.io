    <h2>  PrivatBank advantages over other banks </h2><p>  The older generation has already been taught bitter experience, when all their savings turned to dust in one day, so today many people are wary and incredulous about the various baits of financial institutions.  Nevertheless, it is always necessary to have funds in reserve.  Of course, most people live from paycheck to paycheck, some are even mired in loans, but this only indicates the financial illiteracy of the people.  You can always allocate at least a small part of the money, for example, abandoning a new dress or an extra pack of cigarettes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, trusting your hard-earned money is only necessary for trusted and reliable banks, so that you do not have to worry about their owners' financial problems later.  Among the Ukrainian financial institutions, the leading position is occupied by PrivatBank.  Services at a decent level, has been operating for 22 years, provides a huge number of profitable and relevant banking products, has representative offices abroad, and is pleased with a wide network of ATMs throughout the country. </p>

    <h2>  How to open a piggy bank deposit? </h2><p>  If you have a debit card, the Piggy Bank service is provided.  PrivatBank opens a deposit for a period of one year or more.  You can save money only in hryvnias, but the annual interest rate of 16% is good.  After a year, the client can pick up the deposit;  if the funds are not withdrawn, the service is automatically extended for another year.  Interest is paid only after 12 months, that is, at the end of the contract.  If the deposit remains with the bank, then they are added in monetary terms to the amount of the deposit.  Thus, the <span>capitalization of interest</span> occurs <span>.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Basic deposit replenishment methods </h2><p>  Many clients are interested in questions about how to withdraw money from PrivatBank's Piggy Bank, and how to deposit it there.

If rounding to UAH 10 is chosen, then UAH 4 will be credited to the deposit.  (UAH 290 will be debited from the card);  and if up to 100 - 300 UAH will go off the card, and 14 UAH.  pick up the "piggy bank". </li><li>  PrivatBank 24 can also be involved in the accumulation process.  You can choose the method of crediting a certain amount of money to the Piggy Bank after each expenditure transaction.  If any amount is withdrawn or credited from the payment card, then a part of the funds is transferred to the deposit, the rate can be either fixed or interest. </li><li>  You can set a fixed amount, which on a particular day will be monthly transferred to the ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù.  For example, a person receives a salary on the 2nd day, 200 UAH will be credited on the same day.  on deposit. </li></ul>
