Unlike popular tourist centers, Santander is considered one of the most aristocratic settlements on our planet. </p><h2>  Diamond of Northern Spain </h2><p>  The capital of the autonomous community of Cantabria is called the diamond of the country's northern resorts.  The charming city will introduce you to the unknown Spain with a cool climate, cloudy weather and landscapes reminiscent of the Baltic states.  Many do not even believe that this is possible only an hour away from the hot Madrid. </p><p>  Friendly Spain welcomes all its guests.  Santander is no exception, and the hospitable locals have long been remembered by all the tourists who have visited a cozy town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Santander is a city in Spain" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1341496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  A city without historical heritage </h2><p>  As guests of the capital of Cantabria say, it‚Äôs useless to look for the medieval part here: in 1941, a terrible fire destroyed 37 streets with ancient buildings.  This was a real tragedy for the administrative center founded by the Romans, because it was very different from other cities, Spain is proud of its historical sights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Santander was subsequently completely rebuilt, and tourists are surprised at the lack of a main square and medieval color.  But you should not think that there is nothing to admire: the picturesque nature, restored and modern architectural monuments will surprise all visitors. </p><h2>  Former Royal Residence </h2><p>  Santander (Spain), whose sights have no centuries-old history, is famous throughout the world for the palace of Magdalena - the former royal residence.  Alfonso III and his family often spent the summer in a cozy town, repeatedly confessing his love to him.  At the beginning of the last century, the city hall allocated land for a luxury building, and Santander turned into the summer <span>capital of Spain.</span>  Adapted to local landscapes, the project was successfully realized: the palace was erected on the peninsula of La Magdalena, from which amazing views are opened. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="santander spain attractions" class="if" height="426" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1341485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The interior decoration of the palace and the choice of furniture were controlled by the queen herself, who was scrupulous about details.  Following the couple of monarchs, the whole nobility of the country rushed to the majestic Santander.  The city in Spain took the royal retinue until 1931, and after the overthrow of the monarchy, the beautiful palace became the property of the university. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  A wonderful place to relax </h2><p>  Located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, an architectural masterpiece, considered the most beautiful object in the north of the state, will amaze everyone with its grace.  The English-style palace is located in a fantastically beautiful park.  Fresh air, centuries-old coniferous forests, an unusual museum dedicated to the sea, a small zoo will attract the attention of children and adults. </p><p>  The Spaniards hurry to the royal palace, open to all visitors, to spend a weekend on the peninsula.  Here you can sunbathe on a sandy beach with the provocative name Bikini, try national dishes in a cafe, and a playground with many attractions will appeal to kids. </p><p>  Dreaming of a memorable wedding ceremony at the royal residence, the newlyweds rent the Magdalena Palace, which will allow you to plunge into the atmosphere of aristocracy and romance. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  You can not ignore the cathedral in the Gothic style, which dominates the religious buildings that Spain is famous for the whole world.  Santander has changed a lot after a great fire, and it is not in vain that the restored city is often compared to the <span>Phoenix bird,</span> reborn from the ashes. </p><p>  Considered the heart of the capital of Cantabria, the cathedral was rebuilt for 10 years.  A strict building with two chapels, designed by different architects, causes genuine interest and easy trepidation when meeting people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Santander city in Spain attractions" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1341476.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Resembling an impregnable fortress, the building has three naves, separated by powerful columns.  During excavations inside the temple, the ruins of a Roman settlement were discovered.  And now amazed visitors can observe the remains of therms and defenses under the glass floor of the cathedral.  Here they found the heads of saints buried in the Middle Ages.  Now the remains are placed in special sarcophagi and are in the cathedral. </p><h2>  Palace of Festivals </h2><p>  On the multi-kilometer promenade is an unusual palace, built 26 years ago.  All of Spain argues about a strange structure resembling a dog lying upside down. </p><p>  Santander became world famous after the opening of the concert and theater platform, which was recognized as one of the most ugly buildings in the country.  The gigantic size, problems with natural light, the small space between the seats and the significantly exceeded estimate caused bewilderment of all citizens. </p>
