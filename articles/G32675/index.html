    <p>  It should be noted that this city, located immediately on two rivers - Spree and Havel, the city more than once became the capital.  Throughout history, he managed to visit the main city of several states at once, for example, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the Prussian kingdoms, the <span>German Empire.</span>  Until 1990, only the eastern part was considered the capital of the GDR, and since reunification, Berlin has finally received the status of the main city of the entire state. </p><p>  At the moment, despite the fact that in Berlin there is a massive and almost universal construction, the city administration and the townspeople are doing their best to give it a more comfortable and well-groomed look.  Here, even communication pipes are painted in different colors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Perhaps everyone can find an activity for themselves here.  Architecture lovers will certainly be amazed by the cathedral, located right on the banks of the river, the local <span>Anichkov Bridge</span> and the buildings of the Jewish quarter. </p><p>  If a traveler is ready to discover something new and not quite ordinary, Berlin (Germany) is just the place where he must visit at the first opportunity.  Why?  And where else, if not here, you can meet so many unusual, original and sometimes just breathtaking monuments, statues and monuments.  For example, the Memorial to the burnt books on Babel Square, the monument to Jewish tailors, sculptures dedicated to the inhabitants of Berlin, the happy rat Lorchen on the embankment, St. Gertrude on one of the bridges are considered the most interesting. </p><p>  <strong>The capital of Germany.</strong>  <strong>What to see first</strong> </p>

    <ol><li>  Unter den Linden.  First of all, I would advise walking along the famous Unter den Linden boulevard, whose name in translation into Russian will mean "Under the lime trees."  For more than 300 years, the street has been considered a symbol of the capital, and the secret of its attractiveness lies in the presence of a huge number of different architectural monuments.  Many of them were built by masters of past centuries.  For example, the Opera House, the library founded in 1870, the Lustgarten Museum, the Fire Tower, and finally the world famous <span>Brandenburg Gate.</span> </li><li>  <span>Parliament building.</span>  If you leave the north side of the gate and walk only a few meters, you will see the Reichstag in Berlin.  <span>This magnificent</span> Neo-Renaissance building now serves as the seat of parliament.  Under the huge glass dome there is a very popular viewing platform for tourists.  From there, you can actually see the city from a bird's eye view. </li><li>  Berlin Zoo.  If you have time, be sure to visit the Berlin Zoo.  The history of this place dates back several centuries.  Originally created as a menagerie at the court of Frederick William IV, the zoo was constantly replenished not only with rare birds and animals, but also with seedlings of unique plants.  Now here is the richest collection of representatives of the world flora and fauna in Europe. </li><li>  House Aquarium.  Glass atrium, inside which there are numerous shops, restaurants, cafes, offices and even a luxury hotel.  But this is far from the most important thing.  The fact is that everyone who looks inside this room will be able to admire with their own eyes the huge model of the Atlantic Ocean.  Here you can meet the inhabitants of the deep sea, watch the life of a real coral reef and listen to fascinating excursions. </li></ol><p>  <strong>The capital of Germany.</strong>  <strong>The symbol of the city</strong> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Probably, many people know that the symbol of Berlin is a teddy bear.  And those who have already managed to visit this city drew attention to the fact that the figures of this funny animal very often decorate not only city squares, parks and supermarkets, but also private houses of the most ordinary citizens. </p><p>  No one knows exactly why the bear is located on the emblem of the city.  There are many legends, conjectures and options, but, nevertheless, an animal figurine without any problems can be purchased for about <span>2000 euros,</span> and later decorated as your heart suggests.  Someone turns him into a fabulous and cheerful creature, somewhat reminiscent of a good housekeeper, someone wants to see elements of the <span>family coat of arms</span> or a branch of the family tree on it, and someone simply uses it to promote and advertise the family business. </p><p>  Having visited this amazing city several times, I drew attention to one amazing nuance.  In Berlin you need to walk as long as possible, trying to penetrate this place in order to feel it.  In pursuit of successful and unusual shots, with a camera in hand, you can miss the main thing, namely not to notice his mood and spirit. </p>
