In addition to wellness treatments, you can try the local cuisine in the restaurant, visit the gym, fitness center, sauna or beauty salon. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Hotels in the Czech Republic are worthy of the Prague hotel Bella.

That is why it is extremely popular among businessmen. </p><p>  The newest hotel belonging to the Bristol Group complex is the Bristol Gregorij House.  It offers guests 24 comfortable rooms, parking, a restaurant, but there is no entertainment program. </p><p>  Another well-known sanatorium Bristol Livia is located in an old building and can compete with many five-star hotels in the quality of its services.  There is a balneological center, a restaurant, a swimming pool, a solarium, a sauna, an exchange office.  You can also use the services of a doctor and a nanny, and most importantly - book an excursion, so to speak, without leaving the ticket office.  Sports enthusiasts will enjoy the opportunity to ride horses, play golf or tennis.  Here, a professional doctor makes diet menus, there are macrobiotic and vegetarian cuisine. </p><p>  For fans of expensive holidays, hotels in the Czech Republic offer Carlsbad Plaza.

After all, reviews about hotels in the Czech Republic are not only positive, but also negative.
