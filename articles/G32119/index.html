Learn the basics of working with a hook </h2><p>  If you are a novice master and just learning to crochet napkins from motives, we recommend choosing the most simple and understandable schemes.  One of these is presented in the figure below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.blog.naver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet pattern for napkins motifs" class="if uuid-3127108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3127108.jpg"></div><p>  A napkin made of "hearts" turns out to be very tender and cute.  It will easily revive and decorate the interior of any dining area, will be an excellent decorative element when setting the table for a romantic dinner. </p><p>  To work, you will need to prepare a thin cotton yarn of several colors (yellow, pink, blue, purple) and a hook of a suitable size. </p><h2>  Learning to knit a heart-shaped motif - the basis of our napkin for a romantic dinner </h2><p>  We start work with a yellow thread with the execution of a magic ring.  We knit 1 VP, 1 PRS, 5 VP, 1 1, 1 VP, 1 1, 1 VP, 1 2 (double crochet), 1 VP, 1 1, 1 VP, 1 1, 5 VP, 1  and close first row of the joint venture. </p><p>  In the second row, we perform 1 VP and in the same base loop 1 RLS.  Next, we make 2 VPs and in the arch of 5 VPs of the previous row we form 5 1, between which we do not forget to add 1 VP.  In the next 2 arches we knit 2 1, with air loops between them.  At the top of the column with two crochets of the previous row, we knit 1 C1H.  In the next 2 arches, we again do 2 1 with 1 VP between them.  In the arch of 5 VP we knit 5 1.  We complete the second row of 3 VP and SP. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkins from motifs scheme 3" class="if uuid-3141274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3141274.jpg"></div><p>  In the third row, we make 2 VP and 1 PRS, then we tie the edge using the alternation of 3 VP and 1 PRS (in the arches of the previous row).  A series of 2 VP and SP completed.  We fix the thread, cut off the tails.  So our first "heart" for a napkin crocheted of motifs is ready.  We will deal with assembly and strapping schemes later. </p><h2>  Create the second element and combine the motives </h2><p>  To make the second heart, we take a thread of a different color.  We knit it by analogy with the first.  In the third row we make 5 arches from 3 VP and RLS between them.  We knit the next 4 arches by attaching the thread to the arches of the first element.  We do the rest of the harness as usual.  As a result, we get two "hearts" connected together. </p><p>  We carry out 2 more motives according to the exact same pattern, joining them to the first in the places indicated on the pattern as we knit.  We get the first sector of the canvas of the future napkins. </p><p>  To tie the edges we use a blue thread.  We attach it to the second arch of three loops of the upper right heart using the RLS.  We perform * 7 VP and 1 sc through the arch *.  Repeat * - * twice.  Next, we knit 10 VP and 1 sc (skipping two arches).  We work according to the scheme to the end of the row. </p><p>  In the second row of strapping, we use single crochet columns knitted with a common top - in each arch of 7 VP we make three of these elements, and from 10 - 4. We start the row with 2 VP, and in the intervals between the hearts we knit 3 VP - 1 RLS - 3 VP. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkins from motifs scheme 4" class="if uuid-3141277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3141277.jpg"></div><p>  We draw up the third row using the scheme (2 VP - pico from 4 VP - 2 VP) in the spaces between the columns with a common vertex.  As a result, we get a beautiful lace trim of the edge. </p><p>  So the first square element of the napkin crocheted from motifs is ready.  With the schemes of beautiful hearts and the binding of the edge of the difficulties should not arise.  By analogy, we carry out three more exactly the same squares.  And then we combine them into a single piece.  We subject to the WTO and enjoy the result. </p><p>  Now you know how to crochet a beautiful napkin from a motif for a romantic dinner.  Schemes with a description, we hope, did not cause you any difficulties.  I wish you creative success! </p><h2>  Napkin "Tenderness" from round motifs </h2><p>  We bring to your attention another beautiful crochet pattern for napkins with floral motifs.  Such a product will be the highlight of your living room, decorate a table, cabinet or chest of drawers, give your interior elegance and expressiveness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knittingday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful crocheted napkins with patterns" class="if uuid-3134117" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3134117.jpg"></div><p>  To work, you will need to purchase white cotton yarn (50 g) and a hook number 0.75 mm.  The dimensions of the finished product are 21 * 21 cm. In the manufacture of a delicate napkin crocheted from round motifs, we will use the following scheme. </p><div class="photo" data-original="knittingday.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkins made from round motifs patterns" class="if uuid-3134385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3134385.jpg"></div><h2>  We knit a large motive napkins "Tenderness" </h2><p>  To create a large round element, dial 14 VPs and close the chain in a circle.  Row number 1 we start with 3 VP, then in the ring we do 39 1, for completion we use 1 joint venture. </p><p>  We knit row number 2 according to the following pattern: "3 VP - 1 C4H (column with four double crochets)."  Do not forget at the beginning to do 6 lifting VP, and at the end of 1 SP. </p><p>  Rows from No. 3 to No. 9 are created using the RLS.  In row number 10, we use groups of five columns with two crochets, connecting them at one common vertex.  Between these "bumps" we knit arches from 9 VP.  With the help of this simple drawing, we form petals for our floral motif.  The first element of the napkin is almost ready.  It remains in row number 11 to make the arches with the help of the scheme "8 SBN - 1 VP - 8 SBN". </p><h2>  Making a little floral motif </h2><p>  An intermediate motive fits a little easier than a large one.  We begin work on it with 10 VPs, connecting them into a ring.  In row number 1 we do 3 VP and 23 C1N. </p><p>  In row No. 2 we use groups of 4 columns with two double crochets connected at the same vertex.  Between them we knit arches from 8 VP.  Get the petals for a floral motif. </p><p>  In row number 3, we make the arches with the help of the pattern "7 SBN - 1 VP - 7 SBN".  In the course of knitting the last row, we attach an intermediate motive to the main one (the attachment points are marked on the diagram with ‚Äúdouble‚Äù arrows). </p><h2>  Finishing work on a delicate floral napkin </h2><p>  By analogy, we knit all other motifs, attaching large ones at three peaks, and small ones at two.  As a result, we get a beautiful openwork napkin.  Crocheting motifs with patterns and description is not as difficult to knit as it might seem at first glance.  Even beginner needlewomen can get great lace products, delicate and delicate.  The main thing is to strictly follow the recommendations and strictly follow the pattern of patterns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rosegal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet napkins from motifs scheme 5" class="if uuid-3141334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14899/3141334.jpg"></div><p>  And by learning to knit napkins, you can successfully use the acquired patterns when creating many other textile products - lace tablecloths, bedspreads, pillowcases, tracks.  We wish you creative success in knitting unique decor items to decorate your home. </p>
