Using it, different coatings are performed.  To complement the interior, use spotlights for plasterboard ceilings.  They are easy to install and suitable for different types of rooms.  They are mounted not only in apartments, but also in many public institutions.  A large number of products are widely represented on the market that differ in their technical characteristics and appearance. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  <span>Spotlights</span> for plasterboard ceilings, the dimensions of which are quite small, are able to illuminate a small surface area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spotlights for plasterboard ceilings" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1197347.jpg" width="440"></div>  Therefore, more than two devices should be used for lighting.  Their number depends on the size of the room.

    <h2>  What are they for? </h2><p>  Spotlights are used more often than other lighting fixtures.  They perform such functions: </p><ul><li>  serve for the main lighting of rooms of different areas; </li><li>  as a night or emergency light source; </li><li>  for illumination of decorative elements of the room. </li></ul><h2>  Types of spotlights for plasterboard ceilings </h2><p>  This type is used for hanging.  By design, they are: </p><ol><li>  Customizable.  Spotlights for plasterboard ceilings of this type have a swivel mechanism.  To illuminate a specific surface, turn it in the right direction.  They are often used in living rooms, where it is periodically necessary to change directions. </li><li>  Stationary  <span>The luminous flux of</span> such devices is directed only downward, that is, there is no rotary mechanism in the design.  They are used to illuminate small rooms, such as a bathroom or kitchen.  For large rooms it is necessary to use a large number of stationary lamps. </li></ol><p>  Additional Information.  Spotlights for plasterboard ceilings of a custom type are used not only as the main lighting, but also to highlight the main structural elements. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Types of lamps </h2><p>  Spotlights for plasterboard ceilings, the photo of which is presented in the article, are divided by the type of lamps into: </p><ul><li>  halogen; </li><li>  LED; </li><li>  incandescent; </li><li>  energy saving. </li></ul><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  Spotlights for plasterboard ceilings with <span>halogen lamps are</span> characterized by small overall dimensions and high brightness.  Due to this, they are used in suspended structures with a small thickness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LED spotlights for plasterboard ceilings" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1197348.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main advantage is low power consumption at high brightness.  To illuminate a room with a small area, several devices are suitable.  Among the shortcomings, users highlight the installation of fixtures.  Their installation requires special care.

    <p>  <span>LED spotlights</span> for plasterboard ceilings are designed for additional <span>decorative lighting.</span>  In such devices can be installed as one LED, or several.  Single options are used to create a starry sky. </p><p>  Spotlights for plasterboard ceilings with incandescent lamps are the most popular among the population, as they have a low cost.  They have large overall dimensions, therefore, they are used as the main lighting for ceilings with significant thickness.  Replacing a blown lamp is not difficult. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Such lighting devices can be of two types: open and protected.  The first type is used when the humidity in the room is normal.  Protected are used in rooms with high moisture content, for example, in the bathroom.  Among the negative aspects, consumers note high energy consumption, as well as additional heating of the lamp design. </p><p>  The last type of lamp is energy-saving.  They have many advantages over other species. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spotlights for plasterboard ceilings photo" class="if" height="195" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1197349.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main positive quality is low power consumption.  They do not heat the lamp design.  However, there is a drawback - they can not often be turned on and off.  Such actions will cause the lamp to burn.  Many users use square spotlights for plasterboard ceilings.

The degree of protection is indicated by the following values: IPXX, where XX are numbers that show the peculiarity of the lamp.  That is, in what conditions it can be used.  At the same time, dustiness of the room, moisture content and air temperature are evaluated.
