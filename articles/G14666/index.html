And this applies both to the countries of the East and to Europe.  A special place in such a route, as a rule, is occupied by the famous city of love - Paris.  Everyone who has ever been to the capital of France knows very well that the streets and areas are located there very conveniently, so getting lost is almost impossible.  And all thanks to the fact that there are the so-called "districts" of Paris, which divide the city into cultural and ethnic zones.  About how many of them and what are their features, read in this article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paris district" class="if" height="187" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/263397.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The districts of Paris are made up of twenty components, the numbering of which occurs clockwise, starting with the first, whose name is the Louvre.  This is the oldest part of the capital of France, on the territory of which the main attractions of the city are located.  Among these can be identified Conciergerie, Saint-Chapelle, arch Carousel, <span>Tuileries Garden,</span> Palais Royal and, of course, the <span>Louvre Museum</span> itself <span>.</span>  This administrative district is located on the right bank of the Seine River; therefore, it also includes <span>the Cite Islands.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="9th arrondissement of paris" class="if" height="396" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10393/263622.jpg" width="538"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Located on the right bank of the Seine, the districts of Paris are mainly the center of historical monuments and architectural sights.  The third, fourth and fifth districts are places where mansions, museums and cathedrals were built over the past centuries, which have retained their former beauty to the present day.  The only exception is the second district, for which the reputation of ‚Äúbanking‚Äù has entrenched.  Since the nineteenth century, it was here that institutions were built where exchange <span>games, bank</span> trading, and other financial and economic operations took place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="10 arrondissement of paris" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/262952.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The districts of Paris 6th and 7th are located on the left bank of the river.  Luxembourg and the Palais Bourbon are areas of chic restaurants, expensive boutiques and sophisticated galleries.  It is also important to note that on the territory of the 7th administrative district the Eiffel Tower was erected, which has long been a symbol of all of France.  And on the opposite bank of the Seine is the eighth district of the capital, whose name - <span>Champs Elysees</span> - speaks for itself.  And among the attractions that he can boast include the <span>Arc de Triomphe,</span> Madeleine Church, the Small and Big Palaces, the Alexander III Bridge and the incredible beauty of Saint-Lazare station. </p><p>  Then we move to the 9th <span>district of Paris,</span> which closes the chain of ancient districts in this city.  Here you will find the most beautiful buildings of the past centuries, and modern shops, and restaurants, designed for any income.  Also here were opened middle-class hotels, in which there are always many Russian tourists.  And here is the 10th district of Paris, under the name Anclot-Saint-Laurent, has a not very good reputation.  The region is famous for its ‚Äúred lights‚Äù, so tourists are not recommended to be unaccompanied here, especially at night. </p><p>  All other districts of Paris are located far from the city center, therefore, they are mainly inhabited by locals and emigrants from different countries.  There are housing estates and market centers, where they sell all kinds of products and household goods. </p>
