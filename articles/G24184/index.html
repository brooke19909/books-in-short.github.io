    <p>  In psychology, the <span>violet color</span> is associated with observation, wit, vanity, increased sensitivity, and mood swings.  Since purple is a combination of red and blue (colors that are opposite in meaning), the personality of ‚Äúviolet‚Äù people is extremely contradictory.  They constantly have to find a balance between the calm of blue and the energy of red.  Relations with such people can sometimes be very easy, but to get to know them in real life is very difficult - such people are quite secretive.  Even the closest people can not understand them, because their feelings are quite incomprehensible and contradictory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Different shades of purple allow people to express their sensuality and personality without undue aplomb.  Violet helps a lot of creative and sensitive people, they are easily tuned to its positive vibration.  People who experience nervous tension and mental imbalance are advised to periodically refer to such shades, because the violet color in psychology, due to the mixing of two opposite shades of blue and red, means veiled excitement.  Violet color perfectly affects the nervous system, allows you to restore balance and harmony in your personal life, and even has a positive effect on various forms of neurosis. </p><p>  The violet color in the psychology of reason is considered the color of pregnant women, it exacerbates sensuality on the verge of individuality.  In everyday life, violet shades are rather heavy for perception, therefore they are recommended to be diluted with gold.  The ancient Aztecs called violet the color of wisdom and knowledge of truth. In ancient China, even the evening sky was designated by the principle of courage (YaN) and expressed in purple, and in Buddhism this color symbolizes the "color of the spiritual father."  The abundance in the aura of lilac shades is interpreted as altruism and the possession of high spiritual qualities, especially since the violet color in psychology means the striving for a higher spiritual consciousness. </p><p>  The desire for harmony and perfection is inherent in a person from his very birth, for this feature is responsible for the <span>green color</span> in psychology, but this does not mean at all that only ‚Äúgreen‚Äù people are harmonious and perfect.  The balance of colors and state of mind allows you to find a compromise in communication with the outside world and feel like one of its most important components. </p>
