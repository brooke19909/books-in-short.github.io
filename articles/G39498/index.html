Description of the towers of the Moscow Kremlin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin is the central vezha of the north-western section of the wall facing the Alexander Garden.  It is called Troitskaya, is a travel card and the second most important.  The tower is crowned with a ruby ‚Äã‚Äãstar, and once upon it, like on Spasskaya vezha (the old Russian name), chimes hung. </p><h2>  Ancient White Stone Kremlin </h2><p>  Even the Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy in 1366-1368 began to replace the wooden walls of the Kremlin.  The material from which the new fortifications and towers were erected was most often light limestone or ‚Äúwhite stone‚Äù, with which the central regions of Russia were so rich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the highest tower of the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="478" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/828566.jpg" width="600"></div>  From here comes the ancient designation of Moscow - "white stone".  However, this building material turned out to be fragile, and the defenses were dilapidated.  Restoration work was carried out regularly, which has a lot of evidence in the annals.  So, in 1462, the Moscow merchant Vasily Dmitrievich Ermolin, who at that time was in charge of all construction work throughout the country, underwent a major overhaul of the wall section from the Borovitsky Gates to the Sviblovskaya Strelitsa.  To answer the question ‚Äúwhich of the towers of the Moscow Kremlin is the tallest‚Äù, you need to learn more about everything, including the general reconstruction of the walls and towers, which, despite major repairs, continued to ‚Äúfloat‚Äù.  For this reason, Ivan III the Great, who, incidentally, increased the size of the Moscow principality by 6 times, issued a decree in the last third of the 15th century, as a result of which the Moscow Kremlin, its walls and towers underwent a radical reorganization.

Within ten years, new ones, this time from burnt bricks, were erected on the site of the defensive structures being dismantled.  In the process of this reconstruction, the Kremlin‚Äôs area was increased by joining a site in the northwest of the fortress.  And now it amounted to 27.5 hectares and acquired the shape of an irregular triangle.  These are the current outlines of the fortress.  The work was led by Italians.  Therefore, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the upper ends of the walls, decorated with battlements, all the vezhes (the old Russian name), including the highest tower of the Moscow Kremlin, very much resembled Italian castles - Scaligers in Verona and Milan's <span>Sforza castle.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Towers of the Moscow fortress </h2><p>  In total, the Moscow Kremlin has 20 towers.  Three corner towers - Vodovzvodnaya, Beglemishevskaya and Angular Arsenalnaya - are round towers in cross section, while the rest, including the tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin, are square.  Of the general ensemble, designed mainly in the same style, the <span>Nikolskaya Tower</span> stands out overlooking Red Square, which the French blew up in 1812.  During restoration work carried out by the project of O. I. Bove, she was given a Gothic look and painted white.  All vezhas differ in shape and height from each other.  So which one is the tallest <span>tower of the Moscow Kremlin?</span>  <span>Trinity.</span>  What is it and where is it located?  What is her story? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fryazh architects </h2><p>  Aleviz Fryazin (Milanets), who came to Moscow in 1494, took part in the general reconstruction of the Kremlin.  In 1495, he participated in the construction of walls and towers along <span>the Neglinnaya River.</span>  Stone chambers were also erected under his leadership (1499-1508).  In 1508, he built dams on this river, flowing along the northwestern part of the Kremlin wall.  Thanks to them, the water level in the river rose enough to fill the moat created along the wall overlooking Red Square.  From 1508 to 1516 they dug it under the leadership of Milan.  And he also built the northern highest tower of the Moscow Kremlin. </p><p>  It should be noted that Fryazin is not a surname, it is a nickname given by Russians to all Western specialists, immigrants from southern Europe.  It came from the distorted word "franc."  Because of this, there was often confusion.  Aleviz Fryazin Old, Aleviz Fryazin Milanets and Aloisio da Karezano (or Carcano) are the same person who built the Trinity Tower, and Bon Fryazin erected the Ivan the Great bell tower.  At the same time, Ivan III invites another Aleviz Fryazin to Moscow, but already a Venetian, or New.  They even had a common name - Fryzhsky architects.  In addition to the above ‚ÄúFryazins,‚Äù or ‚ÄúFryags,‚Äù invited by Ivan III the Great, were Marco Ruffo and Pietro Antonio Solari, respectively, Mark and Peter Fryazina. </p><h2>  Kremlin fortifications </h2><p>  So, the highest tower of the Moscow Kremlin was built from 1495 to 1499 by Aleviz Fryazin Milan.  And the very first fortification of the Kremlin - the Taynitskaya tower (central in the southern part of the Kremlin wall) - was launched on July 14, 1485.  After this, the towers were commissioned almost annually. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="north tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/828568.jpg" width="600"></div>  The latest - the Imperial Tower - was erected in 1680.  The Kremlin walls deserve special words, including those that walked along the Neglinnaya River.  In the center of this segment is the northern highest tower of the Moscow Kremlin.  The total length of the walls is 2235 meters, the height varies from 5 to 19 m. In the walls from 3.5 to 6.5 m thick there was a passage, initially through, but then littered with rubbish in some sections.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Unique walls </h2><p>  The towers were at a certain distance from each other, which could be overcome through the passage laid out on top of the wall.  Its width reached where 2, and where 4 meters.  Outside, it was protected by two-horned teeth, the height of which is 2-2.5 m and a thickness of 0.65-0.7 m. The total number of protective teeth located around the perimeter is 1045 pieces.  Sagittarians on the wall were covered with a parapet wall from the side of the courtyard.  Initially, the passage was covered by a gable canopy, under which it was possible to shelter in bad weather, and he covered the wall itself from the damaging effects of rain and snow.  This roof burned down in the 18th century, and was no longer restored. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  Since the tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin is called Troitskaya, it is necessary to find out why it was given such a name, especially since it was initially called Epiphany, then Rizpozhenskaya, later Znamenskaya and Kuretnaya, and it received its current name only in 1658 by decree of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in relations with the Trinity Compound located on the territory of the Kremlin.  Previous names were associated with the churches of the Kremlin and the nearby royal coach house. </p><h2>  Most original </h2><p>  <span>The tallest tower of the</span> Kremlin (photo attached) has the following parameters: from the side of the Alexander Garden, built where the Neglinnaya River used to be, taken into a pipe, the height of the tower is 80 meters with the star, 76.35 without it, and from the inside, respectively 69.3 and 65.65 m. This tower is a passage.  Its gate from the moment of its foundation to the end of the XVII century was considered the second most important after Spassky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The highest tower of the Kremlin in Moscow" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/828576.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  They served to drive to the courts of the queens, princesses and the patriarch.  In 1516, a bridge was thrown across the Neglinnaya River from the Trinity Tower, which ended with a branch archer or a barbican, which in this case was called <span>Kutafya Tower.</span>  This fortification fortification served primarily for additional gate protection.  This is the only surviving bridge tower of the Kremlin.  The Trinity bridge coming from it, according to some experts on the history of Moscow, was erected on the site of the first stone-like construction of the capital, built in the XIV century. </p><h2>  Second in importance </h2>

Obviously, during some period of Soviet history, the Trinity Gate was added significance by the fact that it was through them that on March 12, 1918, V.I. Lenin arrived in the Kremlin.  Napoleon entered through the Trinity Gate, and through them he fled from the Kremlin.  The kings returning with victory also entered through the Trinity Bridge, then they were solemnly escorted to the Spassky Gate.  Initially, the tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin (photo attached) played a significant role in the history of all of Moscow.  It is the highest, but not the main one, because it does not go to Red Square.

    <h2>  Similarities and differences </h2><p>  With the completion of the construction of this tower, work was completed on the creation of defensive structures of the entire north-western section of the wall - from this side the Kremlin became impregnable.  The huge tower at the top ended with battlements, the wooden tent was four-sloped.  According to documents from 1585, there were chimes on this tower, which equalized its resemblance to Spasskaya.  In addition, double-headed eagles were installed on both of them, and on the Trinity coat of arms of Russia it was more ancient, mounted from several parts, bolted.  And when in 1685 a multi-tiered top and a high stone tent, white towers, other white-stone decorations were built on, the resemblance to the main Spasskaya Tower became very great.  Yes, a year later, new chimes were hanged (when they burned down in the Moscow fire of 1812, they were no longer restored). </p><h2>  Elements of Church Architecture </h2><p>  To the question of which of the towers of the Moscow Kremlin is the highest, one can answer: the one crowned by a quad with an octagon, which has a through viewing part.  What does it mean?  The term ‚Äúoctagon on four‚Äù is a type of architectural composition, mainly church buildings.  An octagonal or octagonal floor configuration is on a tetrahedral, wider basis.  Such a composition seemed directed toward heaven, which gave the building dynamism, it, in turn, was a striking feature of Moscow baroque.  The bell was located in the churches of the noble estates in the octagon; naturally, it was not glazed and was looked through through.  <span>The Trinity Tower, the</span> upper tiers of which were built by this type, looked very beautiful from the side of the current Alexander Garden.  This was also facilitated by the fact that various turrets and pinnacles were placed in the corners and on the archery.  Some of them were removed during the expansion of the loopholes in 1707 due to the impending threat of the Swedish invasion.  Part - during the settlement in the Trinity Tower of the archive of the Ministry of the Imperial Court.  It was even rebuilt in order to expand. </p><h2>  Huge, eight-story </h2>

Deep basements initially served defensive and military purposes.  Then, in the XVI-XVII century, these cellars were turned into a prison.  These deep underground floors themselves were discovered in 1851.  Throughout its existence, the Trinity Tower has been used in different ways.  Until 1895 there was an archive of the Imperial Court, and now it houses the Presidential Orchestra.

    <h2>  Kremlin stars </h2><p>  In addition, the tallest tower of the Kremlin in Moscow is one of five stars crowned.  Borovitskaya and Spasskaya, Nikolskaya and Vodovzvodnaya are four more towers on which the coats of arms of Imperial Russia were replaced by stars.  In accordance with the emblems, one can also ask a question that is very relevant in the quiz: ‚ÄúWhich of the towers of the Moscow Kremlin is the highest?‚Äù  The answer will be as follows: the one on which stood until 1935 the oldest (erection time - 1830) double-headed eagle.  The youngest (1912) was on Spasskaya.  He was replaced by a star first.  The first stars were gilded semiprecious and very heavy - up to a ton in weight.  Therefore, the roofs of the Spasskaya, Trinity and Borovets towers were previously strengthened.  However, semiprecious stars faded very quickly, and in 1937 decided to replace them with glowing ruby ‚Äã‚Äãglass stars. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the Kremlin towers </h2><p>  How else can you answer the question of what is the tallest tower of the Moscow Kremlin?  If you look at the plan diagram, you can see that it is the 15th tower from the Spasskaya vezha (numbering goes counterclockwise) that is the highest - Troitskaya, the bridge departs from it alone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the highest tower of the Moscow Kremlin is called" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/828584.jpg" width="600"></div>  Each of the 20 Kremlin Kremlin venues is unique, has its own history, and one article is not enough to describe them at least superficially.
