Many do not know that in case of untimely taxes paid, this service may impose <span>penalties</span> on you and even contribute to the fact that for the most insignificant violation you will not receive a visa to the countries of the European Union.  Everything is serious here: the tax inspectorate should be informed of any financial income or transaction.  This procedure is especially important for those who open an IP or are responsible for financial transactions in a private organization - the tax service carefully monitors all actions of these structures. </p><p>  Many do not understand why you need a message about opening an account in the tax, because there may not appear at all money.  However, this is a necessary procedure that has been carried out for many years.  And the operation of an account that has not been registered with the tax office is considered illegal.  The holder of this account immediately turns into a financial fraudster, that is, into a criminal. </p><p>  Therefore, do not delay with this procedure.  And immediately send a message about opening an account to the appropriate authority.  As a rule, bank employees warn about it those who use their services in opening.  In what period do I have to send a message about opening an account in the tax?  Dates are clearly defined - within 7 calendar days from the date of opening.  If your organization does not do this, you will be fined 5,000 rubles for the company, and you, as its head, will have to pay 2,000. Automatically you will be blacklisted by the tax service, so do not be surprised that inspectors will often drop in to you at the enterprise with your checks.  And this is not very nice.  Therefore, it is better to timely report on the opening of an account in the tax. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What needs to be done in order to send this notification?  Just come to the tax office where your organization is registered and ask that you be given the form No. -09-1.  There are only 2 sheets to fill out - and this is not so much when you consider how many papers you had to fill in, opening your own business.  On the first sheet, you write down the answers to questions in block letters and legible handwriting.  There will be mainly information about your company.  The second sheet will contain questions about where, when and by whom <span>the current account is opened.</span>  On the second sheet you need to indicate the name, patronymic and last name of the person who fills out the documents.  By the way, the same person must open an account and fill out a message.  Otherwise, the message about opening a tax account will be considered invalid. </p><p>  Try to ask the bank in advance for information that you have opened an account.  They will be useful to you in order to draw up documents at the tax office.  They will need to be attached to the message itself.  So, the message about opening a tax account should contain the following information: the serial number of your account, the exact date of opening, the name of the bank in which the operation was carried out, up to the department number, the address of this bank, as well as the standard <span>TIN, KPP</span> and BIK of this financial institution .  Below, you must put not only your own signature, but also the seal of the organization for which the account was opened.  Without printing, the message about opening an account in the tax will again be considered invalid. </p><p>  You can get documents at the bank, and fill them out in the company.  But it is more reliable to take it personally: by mail it can either go for a long time, or even get lost.  Better not take the risk. </p><p>  The fact that reporting a tax account is your direct responsibility is legally supported.  If you do not believe this, read the Tax Code in subparagraph 1 clause 2 of article 23.  By the way, these are the types of accounts that a tax account should always learn from you, and not from bank employees, otherwise you run the risk of giving an impressive amount of money for fines.  This is primarily a <span>currency account,</span> then a settlement account, then a card account, it is very important to inform about the opening of a <span>bank account</span> abroad, as well as about a special currency <span>account</span> .  Transit and deposit accounts are two varieties, the opening of which you may not inform the tax. </p>
