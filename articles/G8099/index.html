Its source is in a small lake, which is closed by high mountains.  This river flows through a valley surrounded by two mountain ranges.  Hotels and hotels were built in the valley (closer to the sea), and grape plantations stretched in its depths.  It is from these world-famous berries that the champagne beloved by many is produced - Abrau Durso. </p><h2>  How attractive is the village? </h2><p>  Abrau-Durso is not one village.  It consists of two settlements - Abrau and Durso, located next to each other (a distance of seven kilometers).  But you have to overcome this path along a picturesque mountain road.  Therefore, from Abrau it is not too convenient to get to the sea.  Here tourists stop for whom privacy, beauty of nature, peace are important.  If you dream of a luxurious beach vacation, we recommend that you go to Durso. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="abrau durso hotels" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/1128777.jpg" width="600"></div>
