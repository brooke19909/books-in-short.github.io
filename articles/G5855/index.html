For the first time, the Kaliningrad Regional Philharmonic Society has its own concert hall - this has become a new era for classical music in this city.  Now this magnificent building can be considered a true calling card for music, as well as one of the most beautiful sights of the city, which is closely connected with its long history.  This article will talk about the Church of the Holy Family in Kaliningrad, as well as its history and significance for the city. </p><h2>  Delving into history </h2><div class="photo" data-original="deacademic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Heitmann Sketches" class="if uuid-2867125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867125.jpg"></div><p>  The Church of the Holy Family begins in 1907.  It was at this time that it was built, then back in the Prussian city of Koenigsberg, under the leadership of the famous architect Friedrich Heitmann.  It was built for three whole years, but the time spent on it was completely worth it, since the building received beautiful features of medieval Teutonic castles.  Unfortunately, during the second war, under constant shelling, both the city itself and Kirch were very seriously damaged, although it generally withstood the blow thanks to residential buildings located next to it.  Special damage was done only to the tower, as well as to the exterior decorative ornaments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the war ended, they refused to repair it for a long time, so the building began to continue to collapse.  According to official figures, there has long been a simple household warehouse.  Viktor Vasilyevich Denisov, Chairman of the City Executive Committee, decided to return the majesty of the Holy Family of the Holy Family in Kaliningrad.  The building was rebuilt for almost a dozen years, but on the other hand, the external appearance got its original appearance.  Within a couple of years after the construction was completed, an organ was delivered here, and Kirche herself became a concert hall.  Thus, it functions to the present moment, attracting the most famous musicians of our time to perform.  Here, after the opening, Yanchenko, Guillau, Fisei and many other celebrities appeared on the scene. </p><h2>  Architecture </h2><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Clock tower" class="if uuid-2867401" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867401.jpg"></div><p>  In order to describe Kirche of the Holy Family, there are simply not enough words.  Built in neo-Gothic style, it fully meets all the canons of symmetry.  It is impossible not to notice that it is the true crown of the creation of the architect Heitmann.  A connoisseur of history, in many respects in his construction he used before that a style uncharacteristic for him, but the result really came out amazing.  The impressive volume of the building and German solidity gave the building its distinctive features - powerful dynamics and the desire to reach heaven.  As already mentioned, the Church of the Holy Family in Kaliningrad in many respects resembles a part of the medieval castle characteristic of East Prussia, where most of the knights' orders were based at one time.  A lot of decorative details and a high tower only add color to the architecture of this building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Internal acoustics </h2><div class="photo" data-original="welcome2018.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Organ Hall" class="if uuid-2867114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867114.jpg"></div><p>  Even during the construction of the Holy Church of the Holy Family in Kaliningrad, the architect planned to put a large organ here, so the interior initially assumed very powerful acoustic data.  But after perestroika, they were further strengthened.  In 1982, the Czech organ of the Rieger-Kloss company was installed here, which has 3600 pipes.  However, in order to give viewers an even greater opportunity to feel the grandeur of sound in this place, the hall was specially redesigned in the form of an amphitheater, which made it possible for music lovers to constantly sit facing the instrument.  Now, according to visitors' reviews, it seems that the music here is born on its own and does not even require any source - such an effect was obtained precisely thanks to correctly selected building materials and the interior, which together create the ideal level of reverb, namely 3.6 seconds. </p><h2>  Religious motive </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.holytrinity-nyc.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Catholic ministry" class="if uuid-2867107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867107.jpg"></div><p>  Looking at the photo of Kirche of the Holy Family in Kaliningrad, it immediately becomes clear that the place was built specifically for use as a temple, and this really is true.  Initially, it was supposed to be a Catholic temple - one of the three that are available in the city.  Unfortunately, after the onset of Soviet times, more than one worship was not held here, although believers fight for it every year. </p><h2>  Construction legend </h2><p>  Indeed, if you look closely at other buildings built by this architect, it becomes clear that such a symmetrical style was very uncharacteristic for him.  In particular, such deviations from their own style during the construction of the Holy Family Church in Kaliningrad are explained by one legend.  It is believed that when Heitmann drew drawings for construction, he constantly kept a Bible nearby, since he was led by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a true temple in which one could constantly feel the son of God - Christ.  That is why, according to his covenants, Kirche never held memorial services for the dead, but only wedding and baptism. </p><h2>  Location </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of the Holy Family" class="if uuid-2867126" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867126.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worthwhile to dwell on the question of the address of the Church of the Holy Family.  By the way, if you delve into history, then initially a livestock market was located at the construction site, which religious people did not like during the construction.  According to the architect, such a choice was made on purpose, because it was in one of these markets that Joseph, who raised Christ, once bought a donkey in order to bring his wife and Son of God to Egypt. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="54.6982458" data-lng="20.509349499999985" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/9/5/8/9/9589.png"></div><p>  But now the direct address of the Church of the Holy Family in Kaliningrad is Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street, 61a.  Unfortunately, it is simply impossible to inspect the building, because it is a concert hall, so you can only enter here by tickets to the event.  However, you need to visit this philharmonic society, which has one of the best acoustics in the world, at least once in your life. </p><h2>  Katarinen Kirche </h2><div class="photo" data-original="en.studia360.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Philharmonic Hall" class="if uuid-2867404" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867404.jpg"></div><p>  For a long time the temple had another, more unofficial name, namely Katarinen Kirche.  And such a name really had a right to exist, since there was a large hospital dedicated to St. Katarina nearby.  The ministers of the church constantly came here and brought all the food that was presented to them by the parishioners.  Such outdoor meals allowed many people to avoid starvation. </p><h2>  Tragedy </h2><p>  It is worth remembering that until 1946, Kaliningrad, now the westernmost city in Russia, was not at all part of the USSR, but was under the control of Prussia, and then Germany.  At one time, namely in 1939, the organ training class was first opened here.  He recorded only eight boys who enthusiastically engaged.  Unfortunately, their life ended in tragedy - they all died very quickly, because during the Second World War they became soldiers of the Third Reich.  None of them became not only a trained organist, but also an ordinary musician.  Who knows how history would turn out if the war simply did not happen. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.rolandosaad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Performance at the Philharmonic" class="if uuid-2867110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867110.jpg"></div><p>  But no matter how events unfold, now the building being described is the Kaliningrad Philharmonic, which is considered one of the best in acoustics.  Although today it is no longer a religious temple, which is its namesake, the Sagrada Familia (Temple of the Holy Family), but, despite this, it deserves special attention because of its architecture.  In addition, various concerts are constantly held here, at which famous organists from all over the world perform, so listening to them will be a real pleasure. </p><p>  Since 2007, the regional government has classified the building as one of cultural objects at the regional level, so if you are relaxing in Kaliningrad, be sure to buy a ticket for the concert.  However, in addition to this, there are often a variety of festivals, as well as guided tours to the organ.  If you wish, for a complete acquaintance with organ music and other programs, you can buy a subscription to visit. </p>
