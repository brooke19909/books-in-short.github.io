  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How sick leave is calculated</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Nobody likes to be sick, and the point here is not only in poor health, but also in the fact that reduced ability to work cannot but affect family income.  An employee who has entered into an agreement with the employer may not legally attend work - this is confirmed by the sick leave certificate.  The main thing is to notify the employer of the disease. </p><p>  <span>The calculation of sick leave</span> directly depends on the period during which insurance payments were made, and is also regulated by the law ‚ÄúOn compulsory social insurance in case of temporary incapacity for work and in connection with motherhood‚Äù (the latest edition was on February 9, 2011). </p><p>  Those whose experience does not exceed six months, the allowance is supposed to be in the amount of not more than minimum wage.  With less than five years of service, deductions will amount to 60%.  An experience of five to eight years guarantees payments of 80%.  And only if the employee's experience exceeds eight years, the payments will be 100%. </p><p>  <strong>How sick leave is calculated in 2012</strong> </p><p>  January 1, 2012 brought some changes in the way in which sick leave is calculated.  The procedure for <span>filling out sick leave has</span> also been changed. </p><p>  Starting this year, the billing period that allows you to accrue sick leave benefits begins with two calendar years that preceded the employee‚Äôs illness.  To calculate the average daily earnings, divide by 730 earnings accrued over two years.  According to the new procedure, according to which temporary disability payments are made, since 2012, the employer pays only the first three days from the date of registration of the sick leave, the remaining days under certain conditions are paid at the expense of the Social Insurance Fund or not paid at all. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The FSS pays benefits after three days in the following cases: </p><p>  - when care is required for an ill family member, </p><p>  - when quarantine is necessary for a child under seven years of age, or for a legally incompetent family member, </p><p>  - if necessary, carry out prosthetics in special.  institution </p><p>  - if necessary, undergo rehabilitation in a sanatorium after treatment. </p><p>  <strong>How sick leave is calculated after dismissal</strong> </p><p>  The resigned employee, regardless of the reason, the next 30 calendar days has the full right to apply for benefits that will cover temporary disability, it is provided directly at the place of last work, or by the regional branch of the Fed.  In this case, the sick-list will be calculated on a general basis, as for those working at that time ‚Äî all that is needed is to present a work record and a sick-list. </p><p>  <strong>How is sick leave calculated in relation to pregnancy?</strong> </p><p>  According to the new order, the average earnings of the expectant mother for the last two years are taken to <span>calculate maternity</span> payments.  <span>Average earnings are</span> determined in the same way as in the case of a regular sick leave, that is, by dividing the total accrued amount of earnings for the period by 730. For <span>maternity payments, the</span> average earnings cannot be less than the minimum wage, and the allowance paid for child care cannot be below the minimum monthly wage required by the mother.  The maximum amount that can be paid for child care is the same for all regions and amounts to 36,563 rubles. </p><p>  <strong>Who has the right to issue sick leave</strong> </p><p>  Sick lists can be issued by doctors of state hospitals and clinics;  doctors working in private clinics;  doctors working in specialized sanatoriums;  attending physicians, consisting of a research institute.  In all the above cases, a <span>medical license is</span> required <span>,</span> and the examination of temporary disability is also taken into account. </p><p>  If, in case of incapacity for work exceeding 30 days, a <span>sick leave</span> certificate was drawn up by a doctor at a private clinic, he is obliged to send the citizen to the place of registration in order to undergo a commission that can prolong the sick leave effect. </p>
