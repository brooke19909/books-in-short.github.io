  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia in the 19th century</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Russia in the 19th century underwent territorial changes.  Lands were formed, to a greater extent, due to Central Asia, Transcaucasia, and the North Caucasus.  Russia in the 19th century became a very populated country.  After a hundred years, the population in the state has tripled.  Political Russia in the 19th century was experiencing an era of reform and reaction. </p><p>  In the nobility, which accounted for 0.5% of the total population of the country, there was a tendency to develop large estates, while some nobles tried to farm in a new way. </p><p>  In the 19th century, Russia conducted the food trade through fairs, which were the main market form.  So, then Irbit, Novgorod, Chicken fairs were well known.  The few shops almost all belonged to foreigners.  Chapters were retailing. </p><p>  In the 19th century, the construction of railways began in the country (1837).  The main means of communication and, accordingly, trade remained waterways - rivers.  The decisive role belonged to the domestic market. </p><p>  The main foreign economic partner of the state at that time was England. </p><p>  The country's industry has practically not developed.  This is evidenced by the structure of state exports.  According to some authors, the historiography of the Soviet period formed a stereotype that the beginning of the <span>industrial revolution in Russia</span> occurred in the thirties of the 19th century.  This provision is mainly associated with the Marxist dogma of the development of domestic capitalism in sync with Western.  <span>The industrial revolution</span> was the mechanization of manual labor (replacement with mechanisms), the transition to factory production from manufactory.  The main classes would be the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, some historians believe that in the first quarter of the 19th century the industrial revolution could not have arisen.  The most numerous class at that time was the peasantry. </p><p>  Russia in the second half of the 19th century completes the formation of the domestic market.  From that moment, the state began to enter the <span>world trade.</span>  Along with England, Germany became the foreign economic partner of Russia.  Then trade and economic relations began to be established with Japan.  In 1875, a new (after the Shimodsk treaty) treaty was signed on the recognition of the Kuril Islands by Japan and the Sakhalin Islands by Russia.  However, tensions between the two countries still remained. </p><p>  Russian reforms have significantly contributed to the establishment of a western way of life in the country.  Thus, society more and more stood on the path of <span>socio-economic progress.</span>  However, due to the fact that the government did its best to prevent a weakening of its position, the pace of development in the country was lower than was possible. </p><p>  Changes in the political and economic life of the country during the second half of the 19th century contributed to the formation of conditions for the cultural development of the population.  Capitalist modernization provoked <span>scientific and technological progress,</span> increasing the need for highly educated personnel. </p><p>  During this period, the Russian intelligentsia was formed - a new, independent social layer.  Intellectuals strove for spirituality, serving for the good of the people. </p><p>  Russia at the end of the 19th century was experiencing the formation of a kind of historical and artistic period.  This period was called the ‚ÄúSilver Age‚Äù in Russian culture. </p><p>  At the turn of the century, the socio-economic development of the state took place against the backdrop of the desire of the autocracy to maintain its international position.  Creating a powerful military potential, the government pursued a policy that was aimed at accelerated industrialization in the country. </p>
