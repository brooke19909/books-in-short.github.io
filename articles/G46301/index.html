How to open an account in Sberbank for individuals and legal entities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All domestic banks offer their customers to open an account for individual entrepreneurs.  But there are many credit organizations.  Which services should I use?  Briefly answer this question, it is better to choose a budget institution.  In this article you will learn how <span>to open a current account for an individual entrepreneur in Sberbank.</span> </p><h2>  Why is he needed at all? </h2><p>  The state does not prohibit business entities from functioning without opening a bank cell.  But it is very inconvenient.  Although new technologies allow transfers through payment systems, they are not legalized.  Accordingly, the tax authorities cannot track income and expenses on them, and large organizations simply will not take you seriously.  Cash settlements with large volumes of transactions look suspicious.  Better to work through a bank.  <span>The current account for the individual entrepreneur</span> contains details that can be communicated to the partner to conclude the contract.  In addition, the presence of a <span>bank cell</span> greatly facilitates the work of employees of the financial department.  And with the growth in the volume of activities and the emergence of international partners, services of a credit organization cannot be dispensed with.  Therefore, it is better to immediately ask how to open a current account for an individual in Sberbank. </p>

    <h2>  The choice </h2><p>  Those who do not understand credit institutions at all are best served by the services of a government agency.  In Russia there are only two of them: VTB and Sberbank.  Their employees are very meticulous in everything regarding the documentation that comes from customers.  Therefore, the process of collecting information can take a long time.  At the same time, it should be noted that such organizations are transparent in their activities: all work takes place in strict accordance with the letter of the law.  Therefore, in case of cataclysms, the money will be reliably protected.  During the <span>1998 crisis</span> , many entrepreneurs remained afloat, as their money was stored in Sberbank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Opening a current account </h2><p>  After registration of a legal entity, it is necessary to apply to the FSS, PFR, IFTS and obtain certificates that the IP is registered.  To conclude a settlement account agreement, it is necessary to submit to Sberbank: </p><p>  - certificate of state registration of legal entities; </p><p>  - statement of current account; </p><p>  - a document confirming the authority of the director; </p><p>  - notarized copies of the contract and charter; </p><p>  - a document confirming the authority of the chief accountant; </p><p>  - cards with sample signatures; </p><p>  - certificates of registration with the PF; </p><p>  - a license that allows you to carry out activities; </p><p>  - registration card; </p><p>  - if it is not the entrepreneur but the third person who will manage the funds, then a power of attorney must be issued for him. </p>

    <p>  After submitting the application, the bank checks the <span>documents, verifies the identity of the</span> client, signs the contract and enters the data into the Registration Book.  After these operations, you can begin to use the account.  The legislation stipulates a period of one day to comply with all formalities.  In fact, operations occur in real time.  If a complete package of documents that meet the requirements is provided, then the registration procedure takes about one hour.  Here's how to open a checking account for an individual with Sberbank. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most often, the contract that the client signs includes the following services: </p><ul><li>  settlement and cash services; </li><li>  cash transactions; </li><li>  card service; </li><li>  overdraft. </li></ul><p>  In order to attract customers, banks do not charge a commission for the operation of opening an account, but the service can cost a pretty penny. </p><h2>  Government Notifications </h2><p>  Within 7 days after processing the documents, the entrepreneur must notify the tax.  It is necessary to submit documents from the credit institution and receive from the inspection a letter confirming the acceptance of the papers.  If the deadlines are violated, the entrepreneur faces a fine of 5 thousand rubles.  It is also worth doing this because the bank also notifies the fiscal authorities within 5 days.  The notification is drawn up in a special form No. -09-1, a sample of which can be obtained from the tax office.  The date of sending the letter will be the one indicated on the stamp. </p><h2>  R / C for IP vs LLC </h2><ol><li>  By law, an individual entrepreneur may not open a bank cell at all. </li><li>  To withdraw or transfer funds, LLC must provide supporting documents. </li><li>  IP can work with one account in different cities. </li></ol><h2>  Online banking </h2><p>  Simultaneously with the execution of documents on the radio station, you can conclude an agreement with the bank for remote servicing.  This will allow you to pay invoices, track the movement of funds, transfer salaries to cards, send money to tax and other government agencies, without being distracted from the computer.  But the contract clearly states that the number of operations is limited.  And for each subsequent one will have to pay a fixed amount.  Certain Sberbank services are provided only to those customers who use the Internet to make payments: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Loan without collateral.  Individuals with annual income of less than 60 million rubles can receive a ‚ÄúTrust‚Äù loan at a reduced interest rate of up to 3 million rubles.  However, the client may not indicate the purpose of the use of funds.  Upon repeated appeal, the loan amount increases to 5 million. </li><li>  Loan for production needs.  The Business Turnover loan allows entrepreneurs to use funds to purchase raw materials, semi-finished products, etc. </li><li>  Entrepreneurs with an annual income of 400 million rubles are allowed to use a Business Auto loan.  With the funds received, you can purchase a new or used car, truck, trailer or special equipment. </li><li>  The product "Business Real Estate" finances on the security of the purchased object.  You can also purchase premises through a borrower accredited by the bank. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBusiness project‚Äù: funds are provided in large volumes with the possibility of obtaining a delay. </li></ul>

    <p>  But there is still a way out of the situation.  Clients need to open a Universal Account at Sberbank for 10 rubles.  This amount is immediately credited to the card.  <span>The account is active</span> for 5 years.  No service fee is charged.  Next, you need to activate the Internet banking service, if this has not been done before.  Three days later, in the "Personal Account" on the website will appear "Universal Account" and the account of the new plastic carrier.  The transfer of funds to the card will be carried out in two stages. </p>

    <ol><li>  You must send money to the "Universal Account".  The commission for the operation is 8 rubles.  The new tariff does not apply to such payments, since the funds do not go to 40817 (card), but to 42307 (‚ÄúUniversal Account‚Äù). </li><li>  Order a transfer from a bank cell to a new payment instrument.  The operation is free. </li></ol><h2>  Denial of service </h2><p>  You can only close an account in the department in which it was opened.  To do this, the specialist must provide a passport, a contract for cash settlement and write a statement.  Upon completion of the process, the client will receive a notice from the bank, which must be submitted to the tax office. </p><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  From all the above, we can draw a small conclusion about why it is worth opening a current account for individual entrepreneurs: </p><ul><li>  Sberbank is a reliable financial structure.  This has already been proven more than once. </li><li>  Convenience of service.  If you immediately connect a full package of services, then you do not have to stand in queues for a long time to complete one operation. </li><li>  Using the online system, you can send funds to the current account for individual entrepreneurs.  Sberbank allows its customers to conduct transactions over the Internet.  The online system has different levels of data encryption.  Payments are quick, but fees are charged at a separate rate. </li></ul>

    <p>  4. Payment terminals.  An entrepreneur does not have to have a store or office to receive money from a buyer.  It is enough to order a terminal and use it for transactions.  These devices can work on a SIM card.  Funds are credited to the seller‚Äôs account within 1-3 days.  The commission is 1% of the payment amount.  The device is provided free of charge. </p><p>  5. Tariffs for servicing a current account do not differ much from competitors in the market. </p><p>  6. Cash withdrawal.  You can withdraw funds by <span>checkbook</span> or transfer them to a bank card tied to the account.  The first option is not very convenient.  You need to issue a checkbook very carefully and carefully.  To withdraw funds, you have to go to the department.  Therefore, it is better to connect a salary plastic card and transfer money to it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In order to mobilize a business, you can use a cell in a credit institution.
