Modern man needs a <span>vacuum cleaner.</span>  <span>Good,</span> reliable, not requiring complicated maintenance.  The household appliance market provides the consumer with a choice from a huge number of models from different manufacturers and any price categories.  To buy, you need to decide on some key points. </p><p>  <strong>Which vacuum cleaner to choose?</strong> </p><p>  Vacuum cleaners are divided by type of cleaning.  There are models for dry cleaning, wet cleaning, as well as combined devices.  Weight, power, dimensions also matter.  It should be noted that for models with a fabric dust bag you must constantly buy bags.  If you don‚Äôt want to breathe dust by shaking the fabric, you can buy disposable paper.  The absorbability of these devices decreases with the accumulation of debris in the dust collector. </p>

    <p>  Models for dry cleaning with a cyclone cleaning system attract ease of care and the fact that no need to buy replacement accessories.  These are vacuum cleaners without a bag for collecting dust, reviews are very good, and the demand for such devices is consistently high.  The garbage enters a special transparent container, which, when filled, is easily shaken out into the urn. </p><p>  Washing models are bulky and cost more than their counterparts.  Water acts as a cleaning filter; these are <span>vacuum cleaners without a bag to collect dust.</span>  Reviews about them are contradictory: on the one hand, it is very inconvenient that the parts must be washed and dried after each use.  On the other hand, the cleaning efficiency is several times higher; it is possible to wash windows and clean carpets, as well as collect spilled water from the floor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Laziness as an engine of progress</strong> </p><p>  The first designs resembling modern vacuum cleaners began to be produced back in 1913.  The appearance of the models changed, new manufacturers appeared.  One thing was unchanged - when the bag was filled, the suction power fell.  The constant shaking of dust did not suit everyone. </p><p>  The inventor D. Dyson decided to rid himself and others of the unsuccessful, in his opinion, design and set about inventing a fundamentally new device - a vacuum cleaner without a dust bag.  After 15 years of trial and error, a cone-shaped garbage collector appeared in 1986 - the ‚Äúholy of holies‚Äù of cyclone-type vacuum cleaners.  The idea was picked up by a Japanese company, and since then the cyclone technology has been used by all major manufacturers of household appliances. </p>

    <p>  <strong>A spoon of tar</strong> </p><p>  <span>Cyclone filters</span> in modern vacuum cleaners capture no more than 97% of the particles, so the models are equipped with special microfilters.  They allow you to bring the percentage of capture to 99.7%. </p><p>  The HEPA filter needs to be washed once a month with soap and dried.  These filters do not last forever; once a year they must be replaced.  Another inconvenience: the container will have to be freed from rubbish and rinsed.  It is not necessary to do this after each cleaning, but you still have to contact the collected ‚Äúgood‚Äù. </p><p>  Despite some disadvantages of such units, an increasing number of consumers prefer vacuum cleaners without a bag to collect dust. </p>

    <p>  <strong>Reviews</strong> </p><p>  Since the price of cyclone vacuum cleaners declined and settled in the range of 100-200 USD, buyers began to pay more attention to them.  Devices are available in different configurations and differ in size.  People with allergies are gradually changing their old models to vacuum cleaners without a dust bag.  The reviews are mostly positive.  It is often advised to pay attention to power - the absorption capacity of cyclone vacuum cleaners is slightly lower, but it does not fall when the container is full. </p><p>  When choosing a vacuum cleaner, there is no need to search for a specific brand.  The lines are constantly updated, and for large manufacturers, the quality, as a rule, corresponds to the price.  Little things like the presence of a turbo brush and the controls on the hose handle can also influence your choice.  Someone needs maximum power, and he will get a traditional model.  Others will prefer <span>bagless vacuum cleaners.</span>  Reviews on manufacturers' websites about noise level, container volume and capacity will help you choose a home assistant for your soul. </p>
