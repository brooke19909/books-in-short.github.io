    <p>  In the world there are at least 8,600 different species of birds, of which more than 700 species are in our country.  In the forests, gardens and parks of the European part of the territory there are 294 species.  Various species of birds in Russia find refuge both in forests and in urban areas. </p><p>  In our country with its harsh climate, many species of birds fly to warm countries for the winter, and those who remain often wander from the northern to the central and southern regions.  In severe frosts and due to the cold and lack of food, birds often die in large numbers. </p><p>  The need of birds for food is very high due to their high mobility and intensive metabolism.  Their daily feed amount is about 1/4 of their own body weight.  Birds of prey eat once a day, granivores - at least two, and insectivores - about 5-6 times.  During the growth period of the chicks, the need for food increases even more.  They grow very quickly, in a week the weight of the newborn increases several times. </p><p>  Forest birds of Russia make up the largest group of species.  Birds are real friends and saviors of the forest from harmful insects.  Some of the species are exclusively insectivorous (a goat, nuthatch, almost all species of songbirds).  In others (tits, starlings, shrikes) insects make up the predominant part of the diet.  Granivorous and omnivorous birds include crows, buntings, bullfinches, jackdaws, finches, woodpeckers and sparrows.  But they feed the chicks only with insects.  And with strong reproduction of insect pests, all feathered, even grain-eating, feed exclusively on them. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Forest birds differ not only in the nature of the diet, but also in the type of nesting.  About 10 species of <span>insectivorous birds</span> and 10 species feeding on small rodents nest in hollows.  The remaining small ones nest on the ground and in the bushes.  A dense undergrowth for them is the best habitat and reliable protection from enemies.  That is why in old forests, where there is no undergrowth, there are few birds. </p><p>  Finchs and cuckoos live on the <span>fringes of forests,</span> in gardens and parks, nightingales make nests in bushes of bird cherry and elderberry along forest streams and rivers, tits love forest thicket, buntings and hemp choose small shrubs or dense grass in glades and cutting areas. </p><p>  Forest birds help the forest grow.  From the seeds scattered with their droppings, new bushes grow.  Many <span>birds (woodpeckers,</span> jays, starlings, tits) hide tree seeds, acorns, nuts in moss or old stumps.  From such forgotten or incompletely selected "caches" then new trees sprout.  Crows, magpies and jackdaws distribute seeds of garden plants, which can therefore be found in unexpected places in the forest. </p><p>  Forest birds have many enemies.  Especially a lot of birds die during the period of hatching eggs and feeding chicks, when parents cannot leave the nest and become especially defenseless.  Due to predators, as well as from human hands, no more than a tenth of small birds survive, living in forests near settlements.  In parks and gardens, this percentage is even lower. </p><p>  The most serious enemies of birds (especially those living near cities) are domestic cats.  Far from living places, foxes, ferrets, martens, weasels, ermines prey on flyers.  For birds nesting on the ground, the enemies are hedgehogs and shrews.  Humans also do considerable harm to birds by <span>deforestation</span> and the dispersal of pesticides.  Thus, only a few forest birds live the entire life span granted by nature.  And it is quite long: at the jackdaws - 11 years, at starlings - 10, at thrushes, wagtails and zaryanok - over 10, at swallows and swifts - about 9, at finches - 7 years.  Many birds are able to live even longer - sparrows up to 18 years old, river gulls about 20, magpies - 21 years old, nightingales - 25. </p><p>  When flying to distant lands, birds can develop significant speed.  So, small birds fly at a speed of 30 - 50 km / h, starlings - from 60 to 79 km / h, waders - 55 - 86. Birds of <span>prey (peregrine falcon)</span> fly at a speed of 95 km / h, and when attacking prey - about 360 km / h. </p>
