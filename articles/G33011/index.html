The package contains a smartphone, a clip designed to remove trays for a SIM card and a memory card, a vacuum-type stereo headset made to match the color of the phone, a USB cable, a charging adapter, and also accompanying documentation.  In addition, the package may contain a proprietary bumper with a folding black flip - a part that reclines and can bend in 2 places.  This makes it possible to install the smartphone on a table with a different angle.  Opening or closing a flip does not affect turning the display backlight off or on. </p><h2>  Ergonomics and design </h2><p>  <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 1520 completely inherited the features of its younger sister Lumia 925. An exception is some nuances.  Our heroine is an oversized Nokia Lumia 925. The main difference is that it lacks a <span>metal frame.</span>  As a result, the device turned out to be recognizable, and this, in general, is not surprising. </p>

One (bottom) is for Nano-SIM, the second is for MicroSD.  Access to them can only be obtained using a sharp object, which is rather inconvenient, but, unfortunately, this is becoming the standard for modern smartphones.  The opposite side carries a power button, a two-position camera button, a dual volume control key - a rocker.  Each of them has a ceramic coating.  They almost do not protrude above the surface of the case, which causes some inconvenience in use.  On the top of the device is a headphone jack. </p>

    <p>  - Change of focus.  This is for amateur photographers who like to focus on pictures after they are taken.  To have a choice, the camera takes up to eight pictures. </p><p>  - The projector.  This application makes it possible to display a smartphone image on a monitor or TV screen.  Unfortunately, the usefulness and functionality of the application is very low, so there is no point in comparing it with something else. </p><p>  - Stories.  It provides sorting of both video and photos into interactive groups depending on the place of creation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  - The camera.  This application combines two other familiar to users of other Lumia models - Nokia Smart Cam and Nokia Pro Cam. </p><p>  In addition, the Nokia 1520 has a new lock screen - Nokia Glance 2.0, disabling automatic screen orientation, the ability to save images in DNG format, support for devices with Bluetooth LE technology. </p><p>  The rest is familiar Windows Phone. </p><h2>  Hardware platform </h2><p>  For the Nokia 1520, the screen specifications are the most positive - it really deserves attention.  The presence of a Full HD-screen is not the only significant novelty that distinguishes the phone from other devices.  Its work is provided by a completely new Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chip. Today it is the most productive system that almost all flagships of Android smartphones are equipped with.  With this currently most advanced smartphone, you can be sure that its relevance will remain for at least another six months, and during the same time the device will receive updates.  Therefore, from Nokia this is the best and most profitable offer, since for a long period of time it will retain its technological advancement. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nokia lumia 1520" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21907/484233.jpg" width="390"></div></h2><p>  The <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 1520 also carries 2 GB of RAM on board.  Permanent it has 32 GB.  You can expand it using memory cards.  The manufacturer has kept a slot for memory cards, which is very pleasing in view of the not so much built-in volume, which is clearly not enough for a modern active user.  Thank you very much for this company. </p><p>  The pluses of these smartphones and the operating system used in them also include, of course, free navigation using proprietary applications HERE Transit, HERE Drive + and HERE Maps.  By the way, it is these programs that allow you to comfortably travel in unfamiliar areas.  They are the best that smartphones can offer for free.  And absolutely not inferior to paid software.  The only thing you need to take care of before starting your trip is to download and update maps. </p><p>  It should be noted speed and accuracy of determining the position.  The GPS operation of Nokia Lumia 1520 shows itself in this smartphone from the best side.  Satellites are searched instantly, there are no complaints in general about laying routes and the accuracy of maps. </p>

    <p>  The telephone part is traditionally on the level.  The phone has a sufficiently high speaker volume, high quality reception of wireless networks, including wired ones.  On the placement of the speaker, one can argue how anyone likes it, in general, the difference in deviation from its center in the strength of sound is felt. </p><p>  As already noted, the speaker volume is at a level.  Talk about the sound in the headphones.  This setting is one of the best on a smartphone.  Detail and volume at height.  In general, for music lovers just right - they will be satisfied. </p><p>  The Nokia Lumia 1520 smartphone is equipped with a battery that has a capacity of 3400 mAh.  This is the most voluminous battery among WP smartphones.  It provides <span>uninterrupted power to the</span> device for 2-3 days in standard use and one active.  The average load for this smartphone is automatic synchronization of several accounts, work on 3G networks and Wi-Fi, a 20-minute conversation, a couple of text messages throughout the day. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  Nokia is a company that uses both AMOLED screens and IPS displays in its devices.  Our smartphone has an IPS matrix of 6 inches and a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels.  The screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 2, which has an olefobic coating and anti-reflective layer.  Screen settings have a large number of additional items that allow you to make the image clear, adjust the saturation and color temperature. </p><p>  The brightness is adjusted in another section.  The user is given the opportunity to choose one of the proposed settings or automatic mode.  You can adjust the brightness in the range from 3.8 cd / m¬≤ to 589 cd / m¬≤.  Good visibility provides high brightness and anti-reflective layer.  The contrast of this display is very good - 1550: 1. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  She is the best.  The company always uses the most advanced cameras in its flagships.  The Lumia 1520 has a 20 megapixel module with Carl Zeiss optics and an image stabilization system.  On the Nokia Lumia 1520, photos are maximally obtained with a 4: 3 aspect ratio in a resolution of 19 megapixels, and at 16: 9 - in 16 megapixels.  At the same time, the camera takes a double shot, except for the main one, it saves the image in a resolution of 5 megapixels.  In addition, only small pictures can be seen on the phone, and natural ones after connecting to a PC on the monitor. </p><p>  Shooting and video playback is in 1080p format, and this at a frame rate of 24/25/30 frames in one second.  During playback of the recording, zoom is available without loss of quality, which is provided by the PureView function. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  On the example of this smartphone, we see that such devices on the new Windows Phone operating system are absolutely not inferior to those having Android and iOS.  But unlike them, they have, one might say, extra performance, which at present has not yet been decided how to apply. </p><p>  The review of the Nokia 1520 shows that if you do not take into account the operating system, you will see a device with a good quality 6-inch Full HD-screen, excellent sound and camera, as well as good autonomy and navigation. </p><h2>  Advantages </h2>

    <p>  About Nokia 1520 consumer reviews the advantages of this device include: </p><p>  - large size - 6 inches (on the verge between the tablet and the phone); </p><p>  - high-quality screen - a bright and nimble sensor; </p><p>  - multitouch for 10 simultaneous touches; </p><p>  - the absence of hangers, of course, with 4 cores with 2 GHz it would be strange for them to be; </p><p>  - A 20-megapixel camera, of course, is not a full-fledged camera, but a worthy alternative to it; </p><p>  - powerful filling; </p><p>  - great build; </p><p>  - huge technical capabilities; </p><p>  - surround battery; </p><p>  - additional memory card. </p><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  These are about the Nokia 1520 user reviews include the size and weight of the device.  Despite the fact that the large screen allows you to comfortably view content, its size creates inconvenience in your pocket, and the weight of 200 grams, although small, still draws it back.  In general, this is not a handheld device. </p><p>  In addition, users are not very happy with the new operating system, which they consider unfinished.  Some complain about bad drivers and malfunctions, knocking out working applications, which is not observed in Android and iOS. </p><p>  There is no adequate music player, like PowerAmp with Android, that could play lossless and sort music into folders.  The crooked player stretches even from the old Nokia.  The screen and case when electrified attract all the dust. </p><p>  When changing the SIM card, a reboot is required (N9 set SIM cards and settings on the machine). </p><p>  The layout of buttons is not convenient for everyone.  Users say that there are random clicks. </p><p>  Also currently there are few compatible accessories on the phone. </p><p>  The disadvantages include the cost.  How much does the Nokia 1520 cost?  Its price is pretty decent, and we can say that it bites.  Pay 20,000 rubles.  For a gadget, not everyone will immediately and willingly agree, even if there are many advantages.  But if there is money, this parameter can be omitted from the list of minuses of this device. </p><p>  Of course, these shortcomings are not critical, therefore, given the pluses, the smartphone is a worthy competitor to devices from other manufacturers of such a product. </p>
