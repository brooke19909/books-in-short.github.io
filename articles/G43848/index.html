  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY mug coasters: three manufacturing options</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The kitchen is the place in the house where hostesses spend a lot of their time.  That is why in it I want to do everything so that it was very nice and comfortable there.  Bright accessories in the kitchen attract attention.  They cheer up.  In stores, you can buy a lot of goods for arranging the interior of the kitchen.  But mass-produced products look dull and monotonous.  Small trinkets for the kitchen can make any woman, even far from needlework.  Decorate flower pots or cutting boards, vases and coasters with a mug do it yourself even a child can.  After all, now there is such a variety of materials for creativity. </p><h2>  About Hot Mug Stands </h2><p>  They settled in the kitchen from the end of the last century.  Nowadays they are known as ‚Äústand for mug‚Äù, ‚Äústand for hot‚Äù, and at the time of their appearance they were called ‚Äúcoasters‚Äù.  This word translated from German means ‚Äúbeer lid‚Äù, since they were originally used as substrates for glasses so that foam from the drink does not get on the tables. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ccp.org.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hot mug coasters" class="if uuid-3155566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3155566.jpg"></div><p>  A hot mug stand is one of those cute little things that will add a touch of comfort to any kitchen.  They are not only decorative in nature.  Stands are also used to protect the table surface from scratches and high temperatures. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This cute little thing is easy to create with your own hands.  This has many advantages: firstly, you can make it in the desired design, and secondly, the creation of the stand will cost a mere penny. </p><h2>  Felt Beer Coasters </h2><p>  First you need to decide on the design of the stand.  The most popular theme for the kitchen, of course, is fruit.  Stands are made in the form of strawberries, apples, etc. Such a soft and cozy material as felt can make your kitchen more comfortable and sweeter.  In addition, to sew a similar product is a couple of trifles. </p><p>  To make a stand from felt for a mug with your own hands in the form of an orange you will need: </p><ul><li>  felt white and orange; </li><li>  needle; </li><li>  sewing threads; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  pencil; </li><li>  compass; </li><li>  paper for a pattern. <div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fruit coasters" class="if uuid-3162432" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24824/3162432.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  It takes about half an hour to make.  In order to make a stand for a mug with your own hands, you first need to draw two circles on the paper with a diameter of about 10 cm and 9 cm. From a orange felt, cut a circle of a larger diameter, from white - the one that is smaller. </p><p>  You can take other colors, and then you get a fantasy fruit.  Triangles should also be cut from orange felt.  They should be sewn to the white circle with a seam ‚Äúover the edge‚Äù, imitating slices of an orange cut in half.  Then you need to connect the two parts together.  Do-it-yourself mug stand ready!  Now the tea party will be much nicer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Wooden bead stand </h2><p>  There are many other materials from which you can make no less beautiful coasters.  For work, you will need wooden beads and a strong thread.  Yes, from the most ordinary balls you can make a real work of art.  After all, a stand made of this material will look very beautiful. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hobbycraft.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wood beads" class="if uuid-3155552" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3155552.jpg"></div><p>  The number of beads depends on their diameter.  The smaller they are in size, the more they will be needed. </p><p>  So, first you need to string the beads on a thread and lock it in a ring.  The resulting circumference in size should be slightly larger than the bottom of the cup.  Then from the beads you need to make another ring - a smaller one so that it fits inside the first one.  If necessary, you can make another third circle, which will be less than the second.  But here it all depends on the size of the beads - after all, sometimes two rings are quite enough.  Next, you need to thread the resulting circles with each other so that the inside does not fly out.  So easily you can make a stand under the mug with your own hands.  This is a very simple and quick version of its manufacture! </p><h2>  DIY computer cup mug stand </h2><p>  With the advent of flash cards, floppy disks and CDs are a thing of the past.  Many of the houses left their whole mountains - both empty and filled with films or music.  No need to discard discs.  After all, from them you can make wonderful coasters for a hot mug.  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  2 unnecessary disks; </li><li>  glue; </li><li>  putty; </li><li>  small spatula; </li><li>  napkins for decoupage; </li><li>  degreasing solvent; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  sandpaper; </li><li>  acrylic lacquer; </li><li>  brush. </li></ul><p>  First you need to glue two disks together.  Let them dry.  Then putty to coat the hole in the middle.  After it dries, treat the disk with sandpaper.  Degrease the surface.  Take a napkin for decoupage, cut and glue two circles to fit the disks.  After the glue dries, you need to cover the product with varnish. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.savvyhomemade.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mug stand" class="if uuid-3155554" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/126645/3155554.jpg"></div><p>  Do-it-yourself stand for a hot mug is ready!
