How to disconnect subscription to Apple Music?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many scolded Apple for the quality of its web products, but the Apple Music streaming service turned out to be extremely successful.  The service is developing, growing, and now it is the best on the market among similar services.  This is evidenced by numerous positive reviews from Web users.  However, you should immediately clarify that the service is paid. </p><p>  Many are not satisfied with this fact, they use a trial subscription, and then they want to cancel it, but they do not know how to do it.  Some believe that this is impossible to do.  But anything is possible.  You just have to dig into the settings a bit, but you can cancel your subscription at any time. </p><p>  Apple offers each new user to test their service for free for three months, however, you still need to provide credit card information.  If you do not cancel your subscription, then after three months it will be renewed automatically.  Therefore, you should know that you need to cancel your Apple Music subscription one day before the renewal date, otherwise your funds will be debited. </p><h2>  What devices can be canceled? </h2><p>  You can unsubscribe from any device: iPhone, iPad or iPod, and even using the fourth-generation Apple TV.

The presented identifier makes it possible to use absolutely all products of the company.  After the subscription has been issued, the user is given full access to the service.  Such a user has no restrictions in choosing and listening to musical compositions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you take into account the free trial subscription, then there are the following types of subscriptions: </p><ul><li>  student; </li><li>  family; </li><li>  individual annual; </li><li>  personal; </li><li>  free. </li></ul><p>  There are countries where a free trial subscription is replaced with a preferential paid one. </p><h2>  How to unsubscribe from iOS devices? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="myapplemaster.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cancel on iPhone" class="if uuid-2966509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67767/2966509.jpg"></div><p>  Interested in how to cancel your Apple Music subscription on your Apple device?

Third-generation Apple TVs and others support this service, but they do not provide account management. </p><h2>  What do people do with Android smartphones? </h2><p>  Apple made an excellent marketing move, allowing all users to use their music service.  Many, using their application, after they switch to the "apple" products.  But this, of course, is not all.

All due to the fact that it is very convenient, new items quickly appear there, and a subscription is inexpensive.  True, there are users who just want to use the service for three free months.  But after that, the question necessarily arises of how to unsubscribe from Apple Music on Android. </p><p>  Of course, users of Android smartphones are also given the option of disabling a subscription to the service.  You can do it this way: </p><ol><li>  On the main page of the program, you need to go to the menu to open your account settings. </li><li>  Next, find the subscription management section. </li><li>  Turn off auto-resume. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, canceling your Apple Music subscription is simple, without any problems, even on Android smartphones.

In this case, it is important to know how to unsubscribe from Apple Music, because not everyone wants to pay money to listen to music from their own pockets, even for a quality product. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, many are satisfied with the service and note that during this time they managed to find much more interesting music than during the use of analogues from competitors.  It is also convenient that Apple Music often offers collected interesting playlists, which are divided thematically, as indicated in the headings.  In addition, the cost of subscription is more than adequate in today's market. </p><h2>  Who needs a cancellation? </h2><p>  Unsubscribing Apple Music on the iPhone is relevant for those users who did not like the service and are impressed by their competitors.  Also, not all Russian citizens are willing to pay money for the right to listen to licensed music in the face of flourishing ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù.  Indeed, many believe that there is no need to pay money for what is in the public domain. </p><p>  These are the thoughts of most modern people.  They are happy to use the trial period, and then begin to download music from torrents or just listen to it on social networks. </p><p>  Although not everyone does this, after all, many appreciate the work of other people and are ready to give a few dollars each month for a subscription, making it possible for music artists and Apple to earn money. </p>
