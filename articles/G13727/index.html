The Sinai granite mountains, whose silhouettes are visible to hotel guests, are a reliable barrier to desert air masses.  Thanks to them, the Red Sea coast is the resort part of the Sinai Peninsula, which has a classic Mediterranean climate.  These places are called the Egyptian Riviera. </p><p>  Here, along the coast of Naama Bay, the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh was built.  It is fundamentally different from any typical Egyptian city.  After all, its buildings and infrastructure are modeled on the Mediterranean European resorts.  It is in Sharm el-Sheikh that the Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 is a second-line hotel. It is only 300 meters from the sea from it. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel architecture </h2><p>  The hotel complex is memorable, it was created in a colorful Andalusian style (whose homeland is the southern coast of Spain).  This characteristic design of Arab-Spanish origin is characterized by bright warm colors with a predominance of white and <span>terracotta colors.</span>  It is characterized by elegant semicircular "Arabian" arches, balconies with curly balusters.  Design Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4, with just such generic features, characterized by a desire for elegance.  The snow-white exterior of its four two-story buildings borders the inner Andalusian courtyard.  True, in this case it is quite spacious.  That, in fact, is the territory of the hotel complex.  There is a large outdoor pool with a relaxation area, small neat English lawns. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 is on the outside a city building of closed architecture, and on the courtyard side it is the embodiment of open architecture. </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2>

Of these, 71 are standard rooms (22 m <sup>2</sup> ), 65 superior (26 m <sup>2</sup> ), 2 small suites (with a living room), 3 non-smoking rooms (economy class).  Inspire immediately upon arrival.  Cleaning in the rooms of visitors - daily.  Bed and towel change - twice a week.  The rooms are decorated in an Andalusian style.  The furniture is stylish, made of dark natural wood, high, with rectangular shapes and inlaid with mother of pearl.  On the walls - stucco, in Andalusian painted in bright warm colors.  The organizers did not save on the floors either.  It is lined with artificial marble.  There are heavy curtains on the windows.  Bedspreads and pillows with a characteristic complex ornament.  The sconces harmoniously combined with the design of the rooms illuminate the rooms of Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4. Reviews indicate a certain lack of natural light in the standard apartments due to the small window space and the absence of a balcony in them.  Therefore, according to guests, going to a boarding house, you should order the rooms "superior".  However, some lack of lighting is a hallmark of the Andalusian style.

Moreover, the design of various premises is not repeated.  The reception area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 looks like a palace. Visitors' reviews note its original and bright natural lighting not only thanks to its stylish narrow windows rounded from above and wide, triple-width, stylish glazed doors.  Natural light also cascades from above due to glazed light openings in places where the height of the complex two-domed ceiling drops.  In addition, the reception center is crowned with a chic ‚Äúpalace‚Äù crystal chandelier. </p><p>  Marble artificial stone flooring and mother-of-pearl stucco walls give solemnity.  And the elegant French-style palace semi-chairs and coffee tables put the logical end to this stylish design in the spirit of the XVIII century. </p><p>  The premises of the restaurant can rightfully be called a columned hall.  Its arched ceilings, based on tetrahedral columns, create a special non-casual atmosphere here.  There is no doubt that the Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 (Sharm El Sheikh, Naama Bay), made in the Spanish-Arabic style, is original and comfortable. </p><h2>  Courtyard - hotel grounds </h2>

    <p>  Animators are constantly working in this indoor recreation area.  In the mornings, they conduct classes in water aerobics.  Vacationers in the pool area are served by a bar.  Bathers have the opportunity not only to relax, but also to have a bite to eat pizza, hamburgers, vegetable snacks, various pastries, without being distracted from rest.  Generally speaking, some vacationers (especially Germans) like the Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 hotel pool (Sharm El Sheikh, Naama Bay) so much that they simply don‚Äôt reach the sea a day later.  Although it is only 300 meters away. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  To come to the hotel beach, you should cross the road.  The coveted sand strip itself - the goal of our walk - is directly adjacent to the first line Dais Inn Gafe hotel.  Perhaps Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 (Egypt) rents its beach from the aforementioned hotel.  Sun loungers and sun umbrellas are free here.  Moreover, there are plenty of them on the beach.  At any time of the day, a vacationer who comes here will find a free deck chair waiting for him.  But a <span>beach towel</span> will only be issued to a spa traveler after he presents a receipt at the reception.  Entry into the water - bulk, sandy, peeled of corals, but not worth the risk, after all - the Red Sea.  Enter the water should be in special shoes.  On the beach of Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 (Sharm el Sheikh, Naama Bay) there are pontoons that allow more experienced swimmers to enjoy the deep underwater world. </p><p>  If you swim a little to the right, you can watch the charming underwater world of a small reef.  You will, of course, be instructed before that - you should not feed the fish.  In fact, the fish of the Red Sea are not our crucians.  If you offer them bread, then it will remain uneaten, but only clog the water area. </p><p>  But if you show a little imagination and offer the local fish a little tuna fish, you will be rewarded with a real show.  Hundreds of colorful underwater inhabitants will sail to you and will unceremoniously literally wrest their prey from your hands.  However, do not get involved.  Take only a small piece, because moray eels and stingrays can sail to the feast.  The bite of a fish surgeon and scorpenops can be fatal. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  There are two restaurants in the hotel complex: the main one and by appointment, and there are also two pool bars.  Food is varied.  The main dishes are prepared from beef, lamb, calf, liver, chicken, turkey, quail.  The fish table is especially good.  Periodically, the menu offers seafood.  There are always a lot of side dishes, salads, delicious mashed soup, fruits and juices - in stock. </p><h2>  Entertainment </h2>

    <p>  On the beach, entrepreneurs arrange water activities for holidaymakers: riding a "banana", "cheesecake", paragliding.  More prepared are water skiing.  A special know-how from Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 (Sharm El Sheikh) is its own diving school. </p><h2>  Diving </h2><p>  How to dive?  How to breathe there?  How to behave there in various typical situations?  What can not be done under water?  An interested person will find the answer to all these and other questions by attending diving classes. </p><p>  It is no accident that it was on the Red Sea that diving turned into one of the applications of the tourism business.  The reason for this is a universally recognized fact: the local underwater world is represented by the richest fauna and flora in the world.  The sea water area near Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 has good opportunities for exploring it. Almost all tourists take home the photos of the underwater world from here. </p><p>  Indeed, there are more than 150 species of corals in the Red Sea alone!  From ancient times, the wise people of Egypt kept this national treasure.  There has never been fishing here since the ancient world.  Residents considered the consumption of agricultural and livestock products to be worthy of nutrition.  Eating fish was considered a sin.  In our time, the Red Sea is under state protection.  Nowhere in the world are there penalties of this size for attempting commercial fishing.  At the same time, fishing is practiced as an exotic paid vacation for tourists (but we will talk about this later). </p><h2>  Diver certificate </h2>

At the school, by the way, which has a certificate from the national geographical society, several courses function.  Here, a beginner will learn the basics of scuba diving, and a diver with experience will learn the intricacies of communicating with the world of the Red Sea.  A newly made diver will receive an international PADI certificate by taking the appropriate courses of the diving school at Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4 (Egypt).  Testimonials from school graduates indicate that the received document is taken into account by diving clubs in almost all countries.  Now, for its owner, not only ‚Äúhome‚Äù and ‚Äúbaby reefs‚Äù (with a flat bottom, without currents), but also dives in the open sea will become available.

    <h2>  Buying excursions </h2><p>  Traditionally, Sharm el-Sheikh is not only a place of rest, but also an excursion center of Egypt.  What sightseeing trips are most popular with tourists who flew there?  By the way, it‚Äôs more profitable to buy them from reliable travel agencies, rather than from travel agency guides.  According to the reviews of tourists vacationing at Oriental Rivoli Hotel 4, the hotel is potentially a convenient launching pad for excursions to Cairo (Valley of the Kings) by plane ($ 210, 1 day), to Jerusalem by bus ($ 90-110, depending on visa availability, 1 day), to Luxor by plane (ancient Thebes, $ 220, 1 day). </p><p>  The above tours are branded for Egypt, they are really expensive.  However, you can buy tours cheaper: Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve ($ 35), Bedouin dinner ($ 20), camel ride - $ 25, dolphinarium - $ 25, crocodile show - $ 30, water park "Albatross" - from $ 35. </p><h2>  Giza Plateau </h2>

This is the only of the eight ancient wonders of the world that has survived to our time.  And the pyramids were built around the III millennium BC.  The complex consists of the <span>pyramids of Cheops,</span> Hafra and Menkaur.  These structures are a tribute to the Egyptian people to the pharaohs.  Near them are smaller pyramids.  They, in turn, are dedicated to the queens.  To the east of the pyramids is the legendary Sphinx.  According to archaeologists, his face is that of Pharaoh Hafra.

Indeed, the buildings here are constructed of marbled gold-colored limestone.  Nowhere else in the world is there such a stone.  This ancient city is a unique monument of three religions.  Each of them has its own shrines here.  For Christians, this is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.  For Muslims - a complex of mosques <span>al-Haram al-</span> Sharif.
