In terms of size, this continent is second only to Eurasia today.  The climatic conditions of this continent are very diverse.  Here are the world's second largest Nile river, as well as the largest Sahara desert. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The population of this hot mainland is currently about one billion people.  On its territory there are fifty-five states and far from one hundred cities in which, according to approximate estimates of experts, more than six hundred different ethnic groups and tribes live.  It should be especially noted that this continent is considered the ancestral home of humanity.  At one time, it was in Africa that the most ancient remains of hominids and their ancestors were found.  As for modern history, today on this continent people of various nationalities live, who came here from all over the world. </p>

    <h2>  Cities of Africa </h2><p>  Trying to create a kind of universal image that would be characteristic, if not for all, then at least for most cities of this southern continent, is a futile task.  The countries represented on this continent are too many-sided and diverse.  In the same way, as it is impossible, for example, to combine them according to some quantitative criterion.  The cities of Africa, located in the south, are more than two hundred cities with a population exceeding thirteen thousand people in each of them.  The most famous and largest of them are Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and Soweto.  The <span>largest cities in</span> Africa located in the north of the continent are, first of all, Algeria, Cairo, Tripoli, Lagos, Tunisia and El Aaiun.  For this region of the mainland, in contrast to the south, the influence of colonial and Arab culture, as well as the presence of a large number of minarets and mosques, is very characteristic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
