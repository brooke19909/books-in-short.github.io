Adler is one of the most visited cities located between the famous Kudepsta and Sochi.  These blessed places are famous for their magnificent climate, magnificent nature and, of course, convenient city beaches that welcome guests from the first days of May until the onset of November. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barracuda Adler Beach" class="if" dir="ltr" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1561997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of them is Barracuda Beach.  It is about him, his advantages and features that will be discussed in this publication. </p><h2>  Adler beaches: reviews </h2><p>  The rating of <span>Adler's beaches</span> is a very conventional concept, since all urban beaches are pebble-stony, clean and well-groomed.  You can choose the best of them only on the basis of your own preferences.  Adler is a recognized resort located in a unique scenic area.  The mountains recede from the sea, forming magnificent pebble beaches, sand stripes on which are very rare.  Just the presence of pebbles explains the rather high level of water purity in the water area.  Smooth pebbles do not create a suspension in the water, polluting the sea, and for a whole day it remains transparent.  This fact is the main argument in favor of rest in these places.  Nevertheless, we note that the rating at the Barracuda beach is quite high and corresponds to the recognized Adler beaches, such as the closed departmental Burgas, Dolphin, Aphrodite, Coral. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The reviews of vacationers at different times on this beach are unanimous: Barracuda is the most fun beach, full of attractions, contests, various entertainment events and having excellent service of the modern leisure industry. </p><h2>  How to get there? </h2><p>  You can get to Adler from Sochi by private car or by bus in half an hour.  Barracuda Beach is located between the Resort Town and the Knowledge Pension.  Hotels and mini-hotels surround the beach, so it will not be difficult to rent a room in Adler near the Barracuda beach for any period of time.  This can be done upon arrival, but it is easier to book a room in one of the hotels in advance by contacting any of them on the Internet.  In July 2016, a hotel of the same name opened on the beach, hosting guests all year round and offering very affordable prices for the services provided. </p><h2>  Barracuda Beach (Adler): reviews </h2><p>  Pebbled stones of various sizes and a fairly wide coastal strip are a kind of visiting card of the beach.  Another feature is a slightly lower water temperature, as the mountain river Mzista flows into the sea nearby.  A long gentle slope to the sea and the absence of sharp drops in depth guarantee a comfortable pastime for couples with small children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rent a room in adler near barracuda beach" class="if" dir="ltr" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1562032.jpg" width="600"></div>  The constructed breakwaters extinguish the wave, not allowing water flows to cover the coastal strip.  The order on the beach provides security.

The reviews available at various forums are very controversial, but we note that the vast majority of them are positive.  Most often they are mentioned: </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ a whole range of entertainment; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ availability of modern leisure infrastructure, deck chairs, umbrellas and awnings; </p><p>  ‚Ä¢ perfectly organized work on cleaning the territory - the beach staff removes the garbage accumulated in the litter bins all over the place, unnoticed by vacationers. </p><p>  In the coastal area there are toilets, changing cabins, showers.  Sprawled within the city limits, Barracuda Beach (Adler) is equipped with rescue posts.  Professional rescuers serve around the clock.  A medical worker is constantly on duty here, ready to provide assistance in case of unforeseen situations.  A variety of beach vacations offers hydromassage services that can make you feel a general surge of strength and energy or relieve pain in people with problems with the spine and joints. </p><h2>  Sea activities on the Barracuda beach </h2><p>  As with many southern beaches, it is impossible to get bored here.  By renting a scooter or boat, you can move away from the coast, enjoy the speed, the wind that beats in the face and carries fine water dust. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adler beaches reviews rating" class="if" dir="ltr" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1562019.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The beauty of southern nature can be appreciated by going out to sea in an open sea tram that periodically runs and offers an hour-long walk at a significant distance from the coast.  It offers a wonderful view of the sea distance and the most beautiful mountain range, sheltered by the emerald green of the forests.  Barracuda Beach (Adler) is located in amazingly beautiful places. </p><h2>  For anglers and paragliders </h2><p>  In addition to organized recreation, there is the opportunity to negotiate with the owner of the fishing vessel and go fishing.  Fishing gear, spinning and other equipment can be rented.  Just imagine how magical the fresh-caught fish cooked in the on-board kitchen has! </p><p>  Paragliders have the opportunity to fly over the sea, and dive at the end.  Special safety equipment will not allow the glider to drown or experience unpleasant moments that frighten inexperienced swimmers - a life jacket will keep him on the surface of the water. </p><h2>  For families with children </h2><p>  A family vacation captured by a professional photographer will be remembered for a long time.  The familiar photography service with an exotic animal or fairy-tale character will entertain children and leave a memorable picture.  Water slides and air hockey are installed in the coastal zone.  Here you can play tennis or other board games, providing children (and not only) leisure.  Barracuda Beach (Adler) is surrounded by small catering establishments.  In cafes and restaurants, you can have a bite or celebrate an event. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the best beach in adler reviews" class="if" dir="ltr" height="438" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19205/1562056.jpg" width="600"></div>
