    <p>  Einstein's Theory of Relativity </p><p>  As it turned out, at that time only the tip of the iceberg was discovered, further research threw new, completely incredible facts to scientists.  So, at the beginning of the 20th century, it was discovered that the propagation of light (which has a finite speed of 300,000 km / s) does not obey the laws of Newtonian mechanics.  According to Isaac Newton‚Äôs formulas, if a body or wave is emitted by a moving source, its speed will be equal to the sum of the source‚Äôs speed and its own.  However, the wave properties of the particles were of a different nature.  Numerous experiments with them have shown that in electrodynamics, a science young at that time, a completely different set of rules works.  Even then, Albert Einstein, together with the German theoretical physicist Max Planck, introduced his famous theory of relativity, which describes the behavior of photons.  However, for us now it‚Äôs important not so much its essence as the fact that at this moment the fundamental incompatibility of the two areas of physics was revealed, to combine </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="postulates of quantum mechanics" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/187911.jpg" width="360"></div>  which, incidentally, scientists are trying to this day.

Moreover, they also refused to interact according <span>to Newton's laws.</span>  The study of these smallest particles has generated new postulates of quantum mechanics for the scientific world.  Thus, perhaps the ultimate understanding of the Universe lies not only and not so much in the study of stars, but in the study of the smallest particles, which provide an interesting picture of the world at the micro level. </p><p>  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle </p><p>  In the 1920s, <span>quantum mechanics</span> took its first steps, and scientists only <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wave properties of particles" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12537/188913.jpg" width="300"></div>  were aware of what follows from it for us.  In 1927, the German physicist Werner Heisenberg formulated his famous principle of uncertainty, demonstrating one of the main differences between the microworld and our familiar surroundings.  It consists in the fact that it is impossible to simultaneously measure the speed and spatial position of a quantum object, because when we measure, we have an effect on it, because the measurement itself is also carried out using quanta.  If it‚Äôs completely banal: evaluating an object in the macrocosm, we see the light reflected from it and, on the basis of this, draw conclusions about it.  But in <span>quantum physics</span> , the influence of light photons (or other derivative measurements) already affects the object.  Thus, the uncertainty principle caused understandable difficulties in studying and predicting the behavior of quantum particles.  At the same time, interestingly, one can measure separately the speed or position of the body separately.  But if we measure at the same time, then the higher our speed data, the less we will know about the actual position, and vice versa.
