    <h2>  Geography </h2><p>  Malaysia is a small state in the Andaman Sea.  It is located on several islands and captures a small mainland of the <span>Malacca Peninsula.</span>  To find the Andaman Sea on the map, you need to rush up from the Indian Ocean, there, among countless bays and seas, this geographical object is located.  Its waters are washed from all sides by the island (pulau) Penang, which belongs to Malaysia.  The island is 25 km long and 15 km wide.  Penang is the most developed and settled region of the country.  The Penang Bridge connects the mainland and island parts of the state.  The territory of the island is a hilly and wooded area.  The highest point is the mountain of the same name.  The island hosts two cities and several small settlements.  Thanks to the booming tourism industry, the island is populated more and more every year.  According to the latest census, about 750 thousand people live on the island.  41% are Chinese, 40 are Malays, 10 are Indians. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Economy </h2><p>  Penang, Malaysia, from an economic point of view, is one of the most prosperous regions of the country.  In general, Malaysia is a modern country with highly developed technologies and economies, it belongs to the so-called <span>new industrial countries</span> and is considered one of the richest and fastest growing countries among developing economies. </p><p>  Penang (Malaysia) exists mainly at the expense of industries such as tourism and agriculture.  Palm trees, rubber, almost all kinds of fruits are grown here.  The island is rich in forest; therefore, processing and export of wood is an important sector of the economy.  If you look at the Andaman Sea on a map, another important part of the island‚Äôs economy will become obvious - this is marine fishing.  Warm waters are inhabited by a huge amount of fish and seafood, which Penang is famous for.  Malaysia is rich in minerals, the country has its own oil, large deposits of gas, iron and tin ores.  Travel and tourism in recent years has become a priority for the development of the economy.  So far, the country has not reached the level of development, as, for example, neighboring Indonesia and Thailand, but is striving for this.  The island is constantly building new hotels and leisure complexes, an excellent road system has already been created here, and special conditions are being created for entrepreneurs and investors.  All this leads to the fact that the tourism area on Penang is constantly growing, there are new opportunities for spending holidays, which entails a steady increase in tourist flow and stable development of the country's economy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the end of the 70s, an <span>electronic industry</span> base was created here <span>,</span> which also became the locomotive of the Penang economy.  Today, the island has offices of many large companies, such as Intel, Bosch, Motorola.  There are several <span>free economic zones,</span> which contributes to the development of various areas of production.  The deep-water port of Penang connects it with more than 200 port cities in the world. </p>

    <p>  The standard of living on the island is quite high, here you will not find poverty and devastation.  A very large percentage of the middle class creates the conditions for the improvement of territories and the development of service infrastructure.  The island is divided into two administrative units: Northeast and Southwest Penang. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Andaman Sea region is one of the oldest inhabited corners of the world.  Favorable living conditions made these lands a desirable place of residence.  Penang (Malaysia) was first mentioned in written sources in the 15th century, in the diary of the Chinese navigator Zhen Ho.  He is considered the discoverer of the island, although by this time there was already a developed culture.  Already then, active trade relations were established between local residents and Chinese entrepreneurs.  Residents of the island consider Zhen Ho to be a local hero, on the island you can see several monuments to him. </p><p>  In 1592, the British arrived at the island, led by James Lancaster.  The name Penang, derived from the name of the local palm tree, was attached to the island in the 18th century, before that it had many names in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof local residents.  In 1786, Francis Light, a British merchant and navigator who worked for the East India Company, essentially occupied the island.  At that time, negotiations were underway between Sultan Abdul Mukkaram Shah and the British government on a protectorate over Penang in exchange for military protection from the claims of Burma and Siam.  The Sultan also demanded a ransom of Britain in the amount of 30 thousand Spanish dollars.  But the negotiations did not end with anything, the British simply occupied the island.  Light calls the island by the name of the Prince of Wales.  The Sultan made several attempts to return the island, but in the end agreed to a ransom of 6 thousand.  Light begins to erect a military fort Cornwallis and lays the first city of Georgetown. </p><p>  Malaysia in the form of Penang Island remains part of the British Empire until the beginning of the 20th century.  For some time, the island played a large role as a trading port, but the advent of the Singapore port has changed everything.  Penang became less visible, but at the same time continued to live its own life.  In 1826, the island entered the Straits Settlements colony.  In 1946, it became part of the Malay Union, then the state of the Malay Federation, in which it gained independence in 1957.  In 1963, the island became part of the state of Malaysia as part of Penang. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Peneng's equatorial climate makes it very comfortable to stay.  The average annual temperature on the island is 28 degrees.  Water off the coast is in the region of 25-30 degrees.  The equatorial climate of the island is marked by seasonality.  The so-called ‚Äúdry‚Äù period lasts from June to September and from December to March.  The rainy season is in April-May and October-November.  However, this division is very arbitrary, since precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Penang rains are common, but they are usually light, it often rains at night, and the sun shines during the day.  In mountainous areas the temperature is more moderate, an average of 22 degrees. </p><p>  Weather in the resort areas of the island throughout the year is quite flat.  The temperature fluctuates by no more than 1 degree, the hottest month is May, the average daytime temperature is 30 degrees, and rainy days at this time are 8-9, which allows you to plan a vacation at sea in May.  The length of daylight hours is on average 8.5 hours, the least of the sun can be seen in November, December, when daylight hours are reduced to 7 hours, the most rainfall during the same period. </p><p>  The mild, even climate makes the island attractive for tourism all year round. </p><p>  Penang is located in a zone of high seismic activity, there are earthquakes in Sumatra and Indonesia, the echo of which reaches the island.  However, in the entire history of observations on the island there were no destructive shocks and tsunamis that would threaten people.  Even during the powerful earthquake in Sumatra 2012, Penang experienced only a slight wiggle.  Floods are more likely cataclysms in the equatorial climate, so in September-December 2014 the island suffered the largest flooding, which caused significant damage to the population.  However, the authorities very quickly eliminated all the consequences of the disaster. </p>

Today, Penang has become a place of settlement for expats (foreign, most often European, specialists), whole European colonies are being created.  In connection with such a great ethnic diversity on the island, one can hear a very different speech.  The official language, as in all of Malaysia, is Bahasa Melaya or Malay.

The deep Buddhist roots reflected in the worldview of people who are very friendly.  There are always a lot of smiling people, it is almost impossible to face aggression.  Although the inhabitants of the island often very expressively speak in elevated tones with active gestures, but this is only a reflection of temperament.  The island is notable for its high security, one can rarely hear about violence or robbery, although fraud, of course, exists, especially in tourist places. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  A long history, in which several cultures intertwined, led to the fact that a unique environment was formed on the island, in which there were responses from various traditions.  Penang, whose attractions are an important part of tourism programs, provides great opportunities for educational excursions. </p><p>  Penang, which was a part of the British Empire for a long time, has retained many features of colonial culture.  Georgetown's old colonial area has retained a unique look, combining features of British classical architecture and Chinese traditional buildings.  Here you must definitely find the "blue house", this mansion is among the ten most outstanding estates in the world.  The city center is a monument protected by UNESCO.  Walking in these streets is a real adventure, it can be done with a guide or on your own, there is the opportunity to take a bike and explore all corners of the city. </p><p>  Penang is not in vain known as the ‚Äúpearl of the East"; it harmoniously combines the features of Indian, Chinese, Malay cultures.  Of the most interesting, it is worth mentioning the seven-tiered pagoda of Ten Thousand Buddhas, which is located in the temple of the Highest Bliss, it is the largest temple in Asia.  The height of the pagoda is 30 meters, you can climb it to explore the surroundings.  The serpent temple, built in 1850 in honor of the Chinese monk, the healer and protector of all living things, including snakes, will cause undoubted interest among tourists.  Many snakes live in the temple, ministers assure that they are deprived of poison, but this is not the main thing, here you can see the historical building and look at the life of the monks.  It is also worth seeing the Burmese Buddhist temple, a visit to its rather large area can turn into a fascinating quest, there is an elevator, an attraction for donations, and many beautiful corners.  The Indian quarter will plunge the atmosphere of real India, with its brightness, spice, music and temples. </p>

    <p>  Penang Bridge is another impressive attraction.  Its length is more than 13 km, it is the longest bridge in Asia and the third in the world. </p><p>  To see the city from a height, you can climb Mount Penang, whose height is 800 m. </p><h2>  Kitchen </h2><p>  Penang Island is considered to be a true Asian gastronomic capital.  Here you can taste real Indian, Chinese, Malay, Thai cuisines.  Time magazine called Petanga's best food service the best in Asia, gastronomic tours are organized here.  Since there are a lot of restaurants with authentic Asian dishes, it can be difficult to figure them out without a guide.  ‚ÄúPearl of the East‚Äù allows you to taste dishes of the most outstanding national cuisines of Asia in one place.  Aborigines consider char kway teow the main dish of their island, which translates as fried noodles.  But the name is misleading, so rice noodles are the only obligatory component of this dish, the cook adds the rest at his discretion, and this can be chicken meat, shrimp, seafood, fruits, vegetables and, of course, spices and sauces. </p><p>  Fried rice is another dish that you can try in every restaurant and never find one like it.  The freshest fish on Penang is also prepared in thousands of different ways, and an excellent result is always obtained.  Asam Lux - a spicy fish dish is the island's trademark and is included in the rating of ‚Äú50 most delicious dishes in the world.‚Äù  There are many versions of laks, you can spend a whole tour comparing these dishes in different restaurants.  The beauty of Penang is that a variety of dishes are placed close to each other, and sometimes in the same restaurant, and it‚Äôs all very inexpensive. </p>

    <h2>  Features of rest </h2><p>  The main attraction for tourists is the beaches of Penang.  Of course, in their grooming and infrastructure, they are inferior to the beaches of Phuket or Bali.  But their charm is that there are much fewer people, and you can combine lying on the beach with educational and entertaining tourism.  The main beaches are Batu Ferringhi, Teluk Bahang, Tanjung Tokong.  Batu Ferringhi and Tanjung Tokong are located near Georgetown, have a well-developed infrastructure, you can get various water attractions, eat in a good cafe, rent any equipment.  Teluk Bahang is located on the territory of the national park and gives an unforgettable feeling of unity with nature, here, of course, the service is more modest, but it is more than paid for by the beauty of nature and the low population.  Although every year this beach is becoming more civilized and attracts more and more people. </p><p>  Holidays at sea in May, June and September will be not only a great way to sunbathe, but also get acquainted with a unique culture, cuisine, get in touch with tropical nature.  This is the main specificity of Penang - here you can combine the usual beach holiday with trips to nature parks and sightseeing tours. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Getting to Penang is very easy.  Air traffic Moscow-Malaysia is well established.  You need to fly to the capital of Kuala Lampur (a direct flight will take almost 10 hours), and from there drive to the island by boat or fly by domestic flight.  There are also tours to Malaysia with arrival at Bayan Lepas (it is 15 km from Georgetown), which is connected by direct flights to almost all Asian capitals and many international airports. </p><h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  Penang is the best place for lovers of active and informative holidays, there are a lot of places worth visiting.  It is also an excellent place for walking.  First of all, you should go to the Waterfall Gardens to see a unique collection of tropical plants, here some species of exotic birds and animals are also presented.  The park is very beautiful, waterfalls and tree shadows create a pleasant coolness, so you can go here even on a hot July day. </p><p>  The Pulau Payar Marine Park is another great place to spend time, here you can see the coral reef and its inhabitants, as well as a huge number of inhabitants of the underwater world. </p><p>  It will be interesting for tourists to visit a tropical fruit farm, here you can drink juice from freshly picked fruit and see how exotic fruits grow.  You can continue walking in the butterfly park, which presents more than 300 species of tropical butterflies, in the Bird Park with 800 species of birds, in the Forest Museum, in the Penang National Park. </p><p>  In addition to walking, you can devote time to the study of the national cuisines of the Asian region, enjoy plenty of rides on a variety of water attractions, spend time shopping in large shopping centers near Georgetown. </p><p>  Today, <span>Malaysia,</span> where <span>vacations</span> are so inexpensive and varied, is rapidly entering the TOP of the best tropical destinations for recreation.  Penang seeks to offer the best for tourists entertainment.  Free time can be devoted to excursions around Georgetown on a double-decker bus.  You can buy a tour to a real Malay village to see the life of people far from civilization.  There, tourists will be shown the traditional crafts, rites and dwellings of the Malay natives. </p><p> Museum lovers can visit the military museum, in which the life of British defensive units of the 19th century is preserved and reconstructed;  Penang Museum, which tells about the history of the island and presents objects of art and crafts of the inhabitants of the region, the Suffolk House estate of Captain Francis Light, an unusual owl museum, which contains more than 1000 figures of owls from a variety of materials. </p><h2>  Where to stay </h2><p>  Tours to Malaysia offer a choice of accommodation within Georgetown or in small suburbs.  Beach lovers can stay in the immediate vicinity of the coast.  If you wish, you can laze in the territory of the butterfly park or even in the national reserve to feel the fusion with the pristine tropical nature.  However, traditionally, tourists prefer to stay within the boundaries of Georgetown, and from there visit different points of the island.  Transport on Penang is very well developed and very inexpensive, and hotels in the city offer the best conditions. </p><h2>  Practical information </h2><p>  Malaysia, where vacations are so attractive, is a country of visa-free visits for Russians.  If the trip lasts no more than 30 days, then no visas are required. </p><p>  Penang is in the UTC + 8 time zone, that is, the difference with Moscow is +5 hours. </p><p>  The national currency of Malaysia is the Malaysian ringgit, other currencies in the country are used little.  You can exchange money at banks or at numerous exchange points where the exchange rate is traditionally more profitable.  For exchange, it is most convenient to take US dollars.  Plastic cards are accepted everywhere, except for markets and transport, but care should be taken, since Malaysia is in the zone of high risk for operations with bank cards. </p><p>  As in all Asian countries, on Penang it is worth observing additional sanitary safety measures and be sure to stock up on medicines and insurance before the trip. </p>
