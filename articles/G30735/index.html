    <p>  The biggest fears in September are caused by huge rainfall, sometimes causing flooding.  But the strong wind makes Thailand in September the best place for surfers.  One should not even dream about sea cruises and calm sailing during this period of time.  However, the air temperature in September here varies between 28-32 degrees, so tourists are quite able to lie on the beach and perfectly tan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Which cities to visit </h2><p>  If you are planning a trip to Thailand at the end of September, then do not choose the northern areas.  The best resorts in this period will be: Samui, Pattaya, Bangkok, Krabi and Phuket.  In other cities, it is better to relax from November to March, when the heavy rainy season ends. </p>

    <h2>  What to do in Thailand? </h2><p>  To know in advance about possible ways to have a good time here, you can study the reviews of tourists.  Thailand in September, as they say, is one of the best places for a measured family vacation.  If you do not like the crowd, then this period is quite suitable for you. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In September, tourists get great pleasure from the local landscapes.  The lack of crowds of vacationers, pleasant cool weather make it possible to walk around the surroundings and get out on excursions. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  If the main purpose of tourists is to sunbathe and visit the beach, then you need to choose vacation spots very carefully so that the probability of a storm is not high in the coastal area.  It is also worth paying attention to the total number of cloudy days in September.  A good option would be a visit to Phuket.  However, the beach will not be as busy as in season, it may even be empty.  Often raging waves and gusty winds interfere with a calm swim.  Even the water in September is cloudy, unlike turquoise and clear in winter. </p><p>  But September beach attracts professional servers.  It is this weather that is needed for their sport.  However, it is better for beginners to put off water skiing until the sea subsides. </p><p>  It is not recommended to go to Krabi province for a beach vacation.  The best places to relax on the beach in September are Samui, Koh Tao and Phangan.  It does not rain very long, and the water in the sea is relatively calm, although cloudy days are not excluded. </p>
