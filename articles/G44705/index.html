On this day there was an event which, with bated breath, was waiting for the inhabitants of this ancient city.  Today, when one’s own story is being rewritten and a new view of it is being actively introduced, it is especially important to know the truth about the events of those years.  In particular, anyone who questions the feat of those who helped liberate Kiev (1943) should be reminded of the crimes of the Nazis. </p><p>  It’s even hard to imagine what the consequences of a longer stay of the <span>Third Reich’s</span> troops in the city could have been if about 100 thousand civilians had been shot in Babi Yar in just two years of occupation, the population had dropped to 180 thousand, and 150 thousand inhabitants of Soviet Ukraine besides their will sent to work in Germany. </p>

    <h2>  The situation at the front in early November 1943 </h2><p>  On August 26, the battle for the Dnieper began, which followed one of the most famous operations in the history of wars - the battle on the <span>Kursk Bulge.</span>  Soviet troops had to force an impenetrable water barrier, the western coast of which was turned by the Wehrmacht troops into a powerful defensive line, called the “Eastern Wall”.  At the same time, the Germans expected that Soviet troops would launch an offensive in the winter and cross the Dnieper after ice was established on it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a result of the success of the offensive, parts of the Red Army captured bridgeheads on the right bank of the Dnieper and reached the river north and south of Kiev.  Thus, the prerequisites for a powerful autumn offensive were created. </p><h2>  The liberation of Kiev from the Nazi invaders: preparation for the operation </h2><p>  Initially, the command of the First Ukrainian (former Voronezh) Front was supposed to inflict two blows at once.  The main one was to be carried out by the Bukrinsky bridgehead, located 80 km south of the city of Kiev, and the auxiliary - from the north.  In accordance with this plan, during October attempts to attack were made twice.  However, both times the attacks from the Burkinsk direction were unsuccessful, but the bridgehead was expanded, which was located in the Lyutezh area north of Kiev.  It was decided to use him for a decisive assault, the purpose of which was to liberate Kiev.  At the same time, the troops on the Burkinskiy bridgehead were ordered to “tie up” the Wehrmacht forces there, and if favorable conditions were created, break through the front and begin to move forward.  For these purposes, a <span>military trick</span> was applied <span>.</span>  In particular, so that the enemy does not notice the transfer of the 3rd Guards Tank Army, the armored vehicles at the Bukrinsky bridgehead were replaced with mock-ups that were supposed to mislead the enemy pilots making reconnaissance missions. </p>

    <h2>  Opponents before the battle of Kiev </h2><p>  By early November, the Red Army in the Kiev direction was in service with about 7 thousand guns and mortars, 700 aircraft and 675 tanks and self-propelled guns.  The enemy had as many fighters and bombers.  However, the number of guns and artillery, as well as tanks, the Red Army had a slight advantage.  At the same time, to protect the city from the north, the German command ordered the construction of 3 fortified defensive lines, the presence of which should significantly complicate the movement of our troops. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The liberation of Kiev (1943): the first stage of the operation </h2><p>  The offensive was launched on the morning of November 3.  First, a powerful artillery bombardment was carried out, followed by a blow from the west, bypassing Kiev.  It was carried out by the 60th and 38th armies with the support of the forces of the Fifth Guards <span>Tank Corps.</span>  A real air battle ensued, during which 31 enemy aircraft were shot down, and in total the Soviet aces made 1,150 sorties.  Fierce fighting went on the ground.  As a result, at the end of this day, it turned out that our strike force had advanced along the entire length of the front to a distance of 5 to 12 km. </p><h2>  Events of November 4, 1943 </h2><p>  The liberation of Kiev was somewhat delayed due to adverse weather conditions.  The fact is that throughout the day on November 4 it was drizzling rain.  To increase the pressure of the attacking Soviet troops, the First Guards Cavalry Corps and reserves, including the First Czechoslovak Brigade, under the command of L. Liberty, were introduced into the battle.  In addition, from the evening, the offensive, which continued at night, was attended by units of the Third Guards Tank Army, speaking in the light of the searchlights, which sowed panic among German soldiers. </p>

    <h2>  November 5 </h2><p>  Even early in the morning, Soviet tanks reached Svyatoshino and blocked the highway connecting Kiev with Zhytomyr, thereby cutting off the Kiev group from the rest of the Nazi forces.  All day there were battles involving infantry, artillery, aviation and armored vehicles, during which the enemy suffered huge losses and was forced to retreat. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  November 6th </h2><p>  Finally, late at night, Soviet soldiers entered Kiev.  The city was liberated quite quickly, since the Red Banner was raised above it at 00:30 and by 4 o’clock in the morning the cannonade in the city had finally subsided. </p><p>  At the same time, it was estimated that the troops of the First Ukrainian Front defeated 2 tank, 9 infantry and one motorized divisions. </p>

    <h2>  The final stage of the operation </h2><p>  Since in early November the command of the <span>German Army</span> Group South was planning a counterattack in the area of ​​Krivoy Rog, Nikopol and Apostolovo, she could not use her reserves, represented by tank and motorized divisions, to hold the capital of Soviet Ukraine.  This circumstance accelerated the liberation of Kiev from the Nazis, and during November 7, the troops of the First Ukrainian Front also managed to free the city of Fastov.  However, by November 10-11, the reserve German units arrived to help the retreating Wehrmacht troops, and the first serious German counterattacks began.  However, a week later (November 13), Zhytomyr was released.  The offensive was so powerful that parts of the Seventh Army Corps of the Wehrmacht stopped retreating, only reaching the 50th km south of Kiev.  At the same time, by the end of November, the 13th and 60th armies reached the border east of Korosten and north of Narovli, Ovruch and Yelsk. </p>

    <h2>  results </h2><p>  The liberation of Kiev (date: November 6, 1943) was of strategic importance for the situation on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War.  During this operation, the troops of the Soviet Union defeated nine infantry, one motorized and two <span>tank divisions of the</span> Wehrmacht, captured and destroyed 600 tanks, 1,200 guns and mortars, as well as 90 aircraft.  An important bridgehead was created along the coast of the Dnieper with a length of 230 km and up to 145 km in depth, which later played a significant role in the battles for the liberation of the territory of Right-Bank Ukraine.  In addition, the Soviet command was able to disrupt the counterattack prepared by German generals in the Kirovograd direction. </p><h2>  Miscalculations </h2><p>  The Soviet military leaders who planned and carried out the operation, which resulted in the liberation of Kiev, made some mistakes.  In particular, since the advancing units of the Red Army did not succeed in destroying the main enemy forces, after November 15, he was able to launch a counterattack and until December 22, our troops could not achieve a noticeable advance on this sector of the front. </p><h2>  Manpower losses </h2><p>  The death toll from both warring parties reached several thousand.  In particular, the following figures are given in Soviet historiography to indicate the losses of the Red Army: 6491 people were killed, 24,078 - injured.  As for the Wehrmacht troops, 389 servicemen were killed and 3018 wounded. </p>

    <h2>  Press response </h2><p>  The liberation of Kiev and the success of Soviet troops on the territory of Right-Bank Ukraine caused a wide resonance.  Particularly striking were the articles in the English and American press, which regarded this event as a major defeat of the Third Reich.  For example, in a message from the famous London radio, it was noted that when the Wehrmacht troops occupied Kiev, the Nazis boasted that not far off was the complete defeat of the Red Army throughout the southeast, and after the liberation of the capital of Ukraine, Germany itself began to hear the ringing of the funeral bell. </p><p>  Now you know how the liberation of Kiev took place, as well as what were the losses of the warring parties, and how the results of this operation influenced the further course of the Great Patriotic War. </p>
