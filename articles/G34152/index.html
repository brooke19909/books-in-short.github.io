A similar topic is of interest to many citizens.  Especially those who make appointments to doctors via the Internet.  Users are required to provide the information previously indicated.  Otherwise, you will have to make an appointment with a specialist by making a personal visit.  Next, we will consider all the features of obtaining compulsory medical insurance policies, as well as examine information about the series and numbers of these securities.  All this is not so difficult to understand. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is the series and Oms policy number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2203450.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Policy - what is it? </h2><p>  Where to look at the number and series of the policy of compulsory medical insurance?  First, a few words about what kind of document. </p><p>  <span>Compulsory medical insurance policy</span> is called paper of the established form.  It allows you to receive free services in state polyclinics, hospitals and other medical institutions working under the compulsory medical insurance program. </p><p>  Without this paper, you will have to either pay for the service or put up with the fact that the doctor simply will not accept a citizen. </p><h2>  Paper types </h2><p>  Where is the series and the number of the compulsory medical insurance policy?  The first thing to remember is that today there are several forms of studied paper.  Depending on the type of document, the answer to the question posed will change. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="OMS series and policy number where to look" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2203451.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are old-style policies.  They are represented in different forms.  For example, very old policies look like small yellow books with one spread.  Inside, data is recorded about the citizen, as well as about the effect of the paper. </p><p>  Such certificates have already lost their relevance.  Now people are using new <span>policies.</span>  <span>This is</span> a blue sheet placed in a special envelope.  On the front side, data about the citizen is written, on the back - information about the validity of the extract. </p><p>  But that is not all.  Most often, citizens wonder where the series and number of the MHI policy are when it comes to the new form of the document.  The mentioned paper is represented by a small plastic card.  There is almost no data on it that is understandable to an ordinary citizen. </p><p>  Earlier in Russia there was another form of the policy - a universal electronic card.  She was to replace SNILS, TIN, passport and some other civil papers.  But since 2017, the mandatory issuance of these cards has been canceled.  Therefore, this form of policy does not have a place in practice. </p><h2>  Where to get </h2><p>  Many are interested in where you can get a compulsory medical insurance policy of a new sample (including traditional ones). </p><p>  A similar service is provided: </p><ul><li>  some public hospitals; </li><li>  multifunctional centers in certain regions; </li><li>  insurance companies. </li></ul><p>  Most often, citizens simply need to contact the selected insurance organization (Rosgosstrakh, SogazMed and so on) with the appropriate statement.  Then, after about a month, you can pick up the finished paper.  Prior to this, the applicant is issued a paper temporary policy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="date of issue of the Oms policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2203452.jpg"></div>

First you need to get a similar paper.  Only after that it is worth considering the number and series of the document.  Otherwise, there will be no such components. </p><p>  The package of documents for the policy depends on who the applicant is.  Adult citizens must show: </p><ul><li>  passport; </li><li>  statement indicating the type of policy; </li><li>  a certificate from the place of registration; </li><li>  SNILS. </li></ul><p>  For children, the package of papers is slightly different.  It includes: </p><ul><li>  insurance certificate; </li><li>  proof of residence; </li><li>  passport of one of the legal representatives; </li><li>  birth certificate; </li><li>  Application completed by one of the parents. </li></ul><p>  Children after 14 years of age can independently apply for a compulsory health insurance policy.  Until this time, you will have to resort to the help of parents. </p><p>  Foreigners also have the right to receive study paper.  And they also need to know where the number and series of the MHI policy are located (new or old - this is not so important).  In this case, the previously listed documents must be accompanied by translated copies of passports / birth certificates and migration cards. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oms policy series and number of a new sample" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2203449.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Cost </h2><p>  How much does it cost to make a study paper?  The answer to this question needs to be clarified before contacting a particular insurance company. </p><p>  All compulsory health insurance policies are free.  No duties or additional payments under applicable law are provided. </p><p>  The exception is VHI policies.  Various fees are charged for them (on average - 60,000 rubles per year).  More accurate information can be obtained from a pre-selected insurance company. </p><h2>  Old copy number and series </h2><p>  Where to look at the series and the policy number of the compulsory medical insurance?  The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems.  After all, an important point is the type of paper used. </p><p>  Let's start with the old samples.  If you look closely at them, then on the front part from below, a citizen will find 2 rows of numbers.  These are the components that interest us. </p><h2>  Temporary Document </h2><p>  Where is the series and number of the compulsory medical insurance policy acting temporarily?  A similar topic interests few citizens.  Often, people simply do not use temporary forms of study paper.  And therefore, the search for a series and a number is not necessary. </p><p>  However, the temporary policy also has these components.  Usually they are printed in the upper right corner of the issued sheet.  A digital line of 16 components is what we need. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Oms plastic policy number" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2203453.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Decryption on old policies </h2><p>  We found out where the series and the number of the old-fashioned medical insurance policy are.  But how can you read the numbers found? </p><p>  As in the previous case, on the bottom of the policy there is a series of 16 digits.  The first 6 is the document number, and the remaining 10 is the series.  That's all.  Now you can easily sign up to the doctor via the Internet. </p><h2>  New designs </h2><p>  And where can I find the series and number of the OMS plastic policy?  A similar question interests the bulk of the population. </p><p>  The thing is that plastic samples of the studied paper now do not have a series.  These documents have only a number.  Where to see him? </p><p>  Just look at the bottom of the plastic card from the front.  There is a combination of 16 digits.  This is the policy number.  As we already said, the document no longer has a series. </p><h2>  Back side </h2><p>  But that is not all.  Particularly attentive citizens drew attention to the fact that the studied paper on the back side has another combination.  What it is? </p><p>  On the reverse side of the policies of the compulsory medical insurance of a new sample in the lower part is a series of numbers of 11 components.  For citizens, it has no semantic value.  But why then is this component necessary? </p><p>  The combination in question is the series and number of the form on which the policy itself was printed.  Recording is not used in everyday life. </p><h2>  Release date </h2><p>  And where is the date of issue of the compulsory medical insurance policy? </p><p>  This item is not on the plastic cards of the established form.  In paper copies of policies it takes place. </p><p>  In the case of old policies, you need to look at the bottom of the document.  There, under the series and number, you can find the date of issue. </p><p>  The paper form of the new form contains information about the registration day on the back side.  There is the seal of the insurance company and the signature of the authorized person. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new compulsory health insurance policy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2203455.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  We found out where the series and the number of the MHI policy in one case or another can be detected.  In fact, understanding the topic under study is not difficult.  The main thing is to determine what form of the document in question, and also carefully study it.  Visually determine the number and series of paper is not difficult. </p><p>  Universal electronic cards do not provide for either a series or a policy number.  They only have a unique identifier combination.  It serves as a replacement for the mentioned elements. </p>
