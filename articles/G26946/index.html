    <h2>  For the whole family </h2><p>  Triple rooms of the standard type are located on the upper floors.  Here, to other delights, the opportunity to view the surroundings and drink coffee in the fresh air in the evening is added.  The rooms have all the amenities, appliances and new furniture.  At the choice of tourists, it can be white or brown.  Guests note that this is an excellent guesthouse for relaxation without any complaints.  The rooms are not too large, very reminiscent of the Soviet past.  But there is everything you need in order to sleep and relax.  It is very convenient that the on-duty group of house masters is constantly working here.  If a sink clogged, a pipe leaked, or another trouble happened, feel free to call. </p><p>  A huge plus is Euro windows and a mosquito net.  The estuary is nearby, only 30 meters, so the insects get out in the evenings.  Repair and its innovations came in handy.  In the absence of annoying insects, boarding house ‚ÄúTatyana‚Äù (Koblevo) looks even more attractive.  Reviews emphasize that every year it becomes only more comfortable here.  The territory is ennobled. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house tatyana koblevo 2016" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1439337.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Superior rooms </h2><p>  They are located on the third floor.  These are rooms with an increased area, so they are perfect for a large family and just for lovers of comfort.  There is a spacious balcony, large plastic windows with mosquito nets, an enlarged bathroom. </p><p>  Many tourists are interested in how organized the holiday in Koblevo is.  Reviews say that, despite all the advantages, it remains a Soviet resort in essence.  The service can not be called bad, but the friendliness and warmth inherent in European recreation areas are clearly not enough.  The second minus is people smoking on balconies.  However, this applies not only to this resort.  After all, since there are no specially designated rooms for this, you have to put up with this state of affairs. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  This is a great option for a budget holiday.  Pension Tatyana (Koblevo, 2016) invites tourists to spend their vacations in accordance with their wishes.  The price depends on the month of residence, however it is quite low.  In general, varies from 215 to 320 UAH (about 520-770 rubles) per day per person with meals.  If you plan to have lunch while walking in the surroundings, you can take a package without meals.  In this case, the price is even more interesting, from 60 to 160 UAH (about 150-380 rubles).  Children under 5 years old stay free of charge, and from 5 to 12 a discount applies.  The sooner you decide to get a ticket - the better.  When booking in advance, there is an interesting system of bonuses and discounts. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Rest Koblevo pension Tatiana" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1438435.jpg" width="350"></div>

    <h2>  Catering for tourists </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews - just great.  A delicious porridge is prepared for breakfast, hot and very tasty.  The soups are delicious, not every cafe can offer such a quality.  Sandwiches, snacks, once a week red caviar, fruits and vegetables - that is, no one will remain hungry.  But rations for the tour are very modest.  In the set is a bun, water and juice. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Clean sea, fresh air, comfortable rooms and delicious food - this is what distinguishes the Tatiana boarding house in Koblevo.  Photos taken here delight in high brightness and contrast.  They will please you with pleasant memories for a long time.  Compared to other recreation facilities, where they drink alcohol and smoke barbecue without any control, it is very quiet, comfortable and decent here.  Great nature and the ability to go on excursions - this is an added bonus to your vacation.  Be sure to come here with the whole family. </p>
