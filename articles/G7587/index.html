Usually its value differs from that which is reflected in the middle.  57 subch.  "Special Card Operations" on the day the report is approved.  This is due to the fact that financial institutions use an internal rate that does not coincide with the Central Bank rate when revaluing foreign exchange transactions. </p><p>  The resulting difference is considered to be total.  Since the amount of payment made in rubles in the amount corresponding to the amount in foreign currency is adjusted for differences, they are reflected in the same account as the main amount of travel expenses.  It could be cf.  08, 44, 26, etc. </p><h2>  Commissions </h2><p>  They are charged for servicing corporate cards.  In accounting, commissions are included in other expenses and are reflected in the corresponding subaccount.  91. </p><p>  The amount and procedure for writing off remuneration are established in accordance with the tariffs of a banking organization.

The latter, as a rule, is withheld from the proceeds received from the sale of goods and credited to the account of the trading company. </p><h2>  Collection of slips </h2><p>  A slip is a terminal check.  The procedure and frequency of their collection is determined in the terms of an agreement signed with an acquiring bank (a credit company that organizes card acceptance points and provides services for servicing the entire complex of operations in them).  At the same time, a slip register is compiled without fail.  It indicates the number of checks and the total amount. </p>

The first significant changes were noted by users of the C1 8 2 program version. Accounting of corporate cards in the newest application has become even easier.
