But Moscow is rapidly changing and expanding; today it is hard to imagine that in the place of modern shopping centers and restaurants there was once a sparsely populated village. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.8267074" data-lng="37.437525999999934" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/2/4/0/5/2405.png"></div><p>  More details about what facilities are located near the Tushinskaya metro station are described in this article.  It also presents interesting facts from the history of the area. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  Tushinskaya metro station was opened in 1975.  It is located between the Spartak and Skhodnenskaya stations, on the Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya line. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.metrowalks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Metro - photo" class="if uuid-2404848" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2404848.jpg"></div><h2>  Architecture features </h2><p>  Tushinskaya metro station includes two lobby - south and north.

Of course, local residents do not suffer from a lack of public transport.  The question of how to get to the Tushinskaya metro station from the center of Moscow is especially relevant for many.  In the capital, traffic jams are observed even on weekends.  Therefore, it is better to travel within the Moscow Ring Road exclusively by metro.  Near the metro station "Tushinskaya" is a bus station.  From here you can get to some cities located in the north of the Moscow Region. </p><p>  How to get to the metro Tushinskaya from the city of Istra?  By bus number 372, which runs daily.

Buses daily leave from the Tushinskaya metro station to the cities of the Tver Region - Staritsa, Rzhev, Ostashkov.

There are also many restaurants in this lively area - the Hermitage, Chaykhona No. 1, Gruzinka, Venice, Liga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="roomfi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="shopping center &quot;Holiday&quot;" class="if uuid-2404864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2404864.jpg"></div><h2>  Tushino city </h2><p>  In the documents, this settlement was first mentioned at the beginning of the 16th century.  In 1938, Tushino received the status of a city.  After 22 years it became part of Moscow.  Active construction here began in the late thirties, and before that there were villages located along the banks of the Khimki and Skhodnya rivers.  Where does this name come from - Tushino? </p><p>  The toponym comes from the nickname of the owner of the village, which was once located on the site of the modern district.  The name of the boyar was rather unusual - Vasily Kvashnina-Tusha.  The origin of such an inconsistent nickname is unknown.  However, there is a version that, on the contrary, the boyar got this name thanks to the name of the locality that he owned. </p><p>  The village of Tushino existed before the time of Ivan Kalita.  He also had another name - Korobovskoye.  By the name of another owner.  But this name did not take root. </p><p>  Tushino became famous in the Time of Troubles.  At the beginning of the seventeenth century, False Dmitry II settled here.  For some time, Muscovites called the impostor nothing more than a Tushino thief.  In troubled times, the village was ruined, however, the guardsmen began to rob this area after the then owner fell into disgrace to Ivan the Terrible. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lenta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="False Dmitry in Tushino" class="if uuid-2404875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2404875.jpg"></div><p>  In 1812, where the Tushino metro station is located today, the French visited.  Nothing of historical significance happened here in those days, if you do not count, then the soldiers of the Napoleonic army killed several peasants. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, a hosiery factory was opened here.  Workers who worked at the enterprise took an active part in the revolutionary movement.  In 1934, the construction of a working village began.  At the time of joining the capital in the city of Tushino there were already over sixty streets. </p><h2>  Directions Stratonauts </h2><p>  The modern name of the passage received in 1964.  It was named after the dead stratonauts Usyskin, Fedoseenko, Vasenko.  The choice of name is also associated with the close location of the Tushino airfield. </p><h2>  Tushinskaya street </h2><p>  During the years of the city of Tushino, this street was called differently - Vokzalnaya.  The settlement became part of the capital in 1960.  Four years later, Vokzalnaya was renamed Tushinskaya.  The metro station is located at the western end of the street.  On Tushinskaya there is a shopping center "Holiday", a complex "Red October" and a factory of reinforced concrete products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="moskva.naydidom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tushino district" class="if uuid-2404881" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2404881.jpg"></div><h2>  Tushinskaya Square </h2><p>  This small area is located between Stratonavtov passage and Volokolamsk highway.  It got its modern name relatively recently - in 2013.  There is a bus station on the square. </p><h2>  Vishnevaya Street </h2><p>  The sonorous name was offered by local residents.  In the early sixties, the street was called Oktyabrskaya.  But the trouble is that in Soviet times there were too many toponyms formed from the word "October" in Moscow and other cities.  Not far from the places where the Tushinskaya metro station was opened in 1975, there was another Oktyabrskaya metro station.  To eliminate the same name, they decided to rename one of the Moscow streets.  Cherry sounds much better than October.  There are several cafes and restaurants (Veneto, Dragonfly, Hermitage).  Cherry intersects Tsiolkovsky street.  In the east, the streets of Meshcheryakova and Dolgova adjoin it. </p>
