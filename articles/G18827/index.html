    <h2>  Kazan River Station: History </h2><p>  From the very moment Kazan emerged, its development history has been closely connected with one of the largest rivers in Russia - the Volga.  It was she who contributed more to the development of the economy and politics of the Tatars of the Volga regions.  Thanks to this beautiful river, Kazan has become the center of intersection of trade routes of Asia and Europe.  The Great <span>Volga Trade Route,</span> even under the <span>Kazan Khanate,</span> passed through this river. </p><p>  The river port of Kazan has a curious origin. </p><p>  From the Volga through the river.  Bulak and Kazanka merchant ships caravans hit the bazaars of Kazan.  And already after the Volga region and the Moscow state joined, the vessels of merchants from Western Europe began to come here, who went further along the Volga across Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Peter I recognized the importance of this marina and established the Kazan Admiralty in 1718.  Thanks to this, shipbuilding began to strengthen, and, thus, the Russian fleet began to gain strength.  Shipyards Upper and Lower Uslon significantly increased the number of ships and vessels, both merchant and military. </p><p>  It is important to note that information has remained that the galley called ‚ÄúTver‚Äù in 1767 approached the Tainitskaya tower (in the Kazan Kremlin) in May 1767.  She was Catherine II. </p><p>  In connection with the development of shipping, river ports began to be built.  Among them is the river port of Kazan.  Already at the end of the XIX century it was the second on the Volga in size after the port of Nizhny Novgorod.  The movement of steamboats (passenger) quickly began to improve.  And after the construction of the Volga-Baltic Canal was completed, Kazan began to be called the <span>port of 5 seas.</span> </p><h2>  Transformation of the river port: description </h2><p>  Today's Kazan river port has undergone significant changes.  The modern marina, functioning today, appeared much later.  A wonderful project was presented by the Moscow Institute for the Design of <span>Transport</span> Facilities <span>(River).</span> </p><p>  New, very convenient and roomy port.  The mooring wall extended for the whole kilometer.  It should be noted that the Kazanka river was forced to change the old channel for the convenience of ships. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="River port (Kazan): excursions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/1114448.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  By its administrative status it is a rural settlement of Zelenodolsky district of Tatarstan. </p><p>  What can you see here?
