In particular, many manufacturers in recent years have minimized the release of push-button phones.  With all the advantages of a traditional design, developers do not show interest in this category of devices.  The market is periodically replenished with new models, but their functionality and technical stuffing are not nearly comparable with the capabilities that are offered in touch models.  Against this background, many connoisseurs of push-button devices were pleased with the appearance of the Samsung GT 5611 model, which although it does not reach premium smartphones in its characteristics, it is not included in a number of modest budget ‚Äúhandsets‚Äù.  However, the value of the device is not only in filling the empty segment, but also in a distinctive style. </p><h2>  Phone Overview </h2>

    <p>  The model occupies the middle segment in the niche of button models and is positioned as a functional and modern phone in a classic version.  I must say that the device is an ideological continuation of the device S5610.  Modifications are very similar both externally and in their characteristics.  Nevertheless, there are fundamental differences between them.  So, compared to the <span>Samsung S5610,</span> 5611 has a large amount of internal memory and an expanded selection of color <span>options</span> .  Also, in the process, many note a more responsive menu control.  But there are also changes for the worse.  For example, the model lost a flashlight.  The rest of the device is a traditional monoblock device, which is equipped with a good camera and modern means of communication. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Model Features </h2>

    <p>  If we consider the model even by the average parameters that the latest versions of smartphones have, the conclusions will be sad.  It remains only to recall that this is a <span>push-button telephone,</span> which is not peculiar to technological sophistication.  But in the case of comparison with advanced touch devices, there are several qualities that are worth paying attention to Samsung 5611. A review of the characteristics of the device will help to identify these advantages: </p><ul><li>  weight - 91 g; </li><li>  dimensions - 4.97 cm in width, 11.9 cm in height and 1.3 cm in thickness; </li><li>  body type - push-button monoblock; </li><li>  processor frequency of the model 5611 - 460 MHz; </li><li>  display - TFT 2.4 "; </li><li>  the screen resolution of the device is 240 x 320; </li><li>  color gamut - 262 thousand; </li><li>  call - polyphony and vibrating alert; </li><li>  camera - 5 megapixel module; </li><li>  supported signal standards - Edge, GPRS, 3G; </li><li>  built-in memory - 250 MB; </li><li>  additional memory - the ability to use microSD 16 GB; </li><li>  wireless data transmission channels - Bluetooth; </li><li>  the battery is 1,000 mAh. </li><li>  additional optional - MP3-player, ChatON service, FM-radio. </li></ul><h2>  Case and device design </h2>

The model is presented in several colors, but, as a rule, Samsung 5611 versions in gray and black are available in stores.  Both options look solid, stylish and even with a hint of presentability.  The design is made in the classic form factor.  Strict, but pleasant and hand-friendly lines form a rather overall case.  But users accustomed to smartphones will not be afraid of such sizes.  You can not say about the mass - the device is quite heavy, but this aspect is even pleasing to many. </p><p>  In terms of quality of materials, the device does not cause special admiration.  For the most part, the body is made of plastic.  Although the back cover is represented by metal, which adds to the Samsung 5611 phone sophistication and nobility.  In general, the design of the device is implemented with dignity, in any case, not many of the button models of the same segment can compare with it. </p><h2>  Functionality and Ergonomics </h2><p>  There is no need to talk about the advantages of the processor, since it is still not a smartphone and the owner of such a device will have to abandon modern demanding applications immediately.  But the rest of the model will not disappoint.  The Samsung 5611 provides Internet access via 3G technology, wireless data transfer, proprietary applications from the developer and a good selection of games with a music player. </p><p>  These and other features will need to be controlled using a 5-way joystick and keyboard.  Actually, for the sake of these tools, those who did not appreciate the advantages of sensory analogs acquire this model.  The menu is organized according to the traditional scheme and is represented by pictograms.  The owner has the opportunity to create a "desktop" of the actual icons, as well as create buttons with quick access.  As already noted, the management in the Samsung 5611 is implemented with good responsiveness, although there are still unusual nuances.  For example, after closing the menu, the next entrance to it will be carried out in the same section where the previous work was completed. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The phone has a lot of outdated solutions that have passed from previous generations of button mobile phones.  This also applies to the display, which plays on models with Retina screens.  And it's not just the size and resolution.  The device is equipped with a 262,000 color TFT-display.  The number of pixels per inch does not allow you to enjoy image quality, although you can read texts without much difficulty.  Moreover, font size settings in the model are provided.  It is also worth noting the protection of the Samsung 5611 screen in the form of reinforced glass.  This not only provides strength to the display, but also protects the surface from minor scratches.  By and large, it makes no sense to expect ‚Äúpictures‚Äù from such high-quality devices, since they are not intended for watching movies, but for solving practical communication problems. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  But the Samsung developers have implemented the camera more than worthy.  Although the segment of functional push-button phones is not a great choice, this model has strong competitors in the form of Nokia 515 and Philips developments in the X5500.  And if the Finnish device has an advantage due to its compact size and high-quality sound, and Philips wins due to the capacious battery, then the Samsung 5611 phone outperforms its competitors precisely in comparing cameras.  And this despite the fact that all three devices are equipped with 5 megapixel modules, that is, they are identical in nominal characteristics.  The advantage of 5611 in photography is provided by the excellent quality of pictures in any conditions.  The camera in this case allows you to capture small text with the ability to read it.  Also, the advantages of shooting are supported by the presence of autofocus and LED backlighting, which is not found in every smartphone. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The model attracts buyers largely due to the combination of a classic form with a keyboard and decent functionality.  The owners note that the developers managed to create a beautiful and solid phone with which it is not a shame to come to a business meeting.  There are also positive feedback about the means of communication.  It is in these parameters that the classic handsets, it would seem, are forever behind the smartphones.  Nevertheless, the ability to use 3G technology, games with applications and a music player, coupled with a decent memory capacity, make the Samsung 5611 look different. Reviews emphasize another advantage that elevates the model even over high-tech smartphones.  This is a battery.  Although the battery capacity is modest, the phone can do without recharging for 2-3 days in normal use. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2>

    <p>  The list of claims against this device is no less wide.  If we talk about the most serious comments, then the creaking keyboard and problems with the speaker will come first.  As for the keyboard, in the process of pressing you can hear unpleasant sounds of friction of the plastic.  This does not affect the function of typing, but aesthetically, it does not bring pleasure either.  The flaws of the speaker are perhaps the most unpleasant flaw of this model, which is expressed in a dull sound during the conversation.  There are other shortcomings of Samsung 5611: how to turn on the flashlight or, on the contrary, turn off the sound of the camera shutter - these questions remain unanswered by the owners.  It is possible that technically the device allows you to use the LED backlight as a flashlight, but there is no special function in the menu for this.  The same applies to turning off the sound of the camera with the speaker setup. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2>

    <p>  When evaluating this phone, it‚Äôs still worth making a discount, since such models are in demand only among a narrow category of people, and manufacturers are not trying to develop this area.  However, the device itself is interesting without reference to the traditional concept of convenient push-button phones.  First of all, the device deserves attention due to its design.  If you buy a cover for Samsung 5611 in a suitable texture, you will have every chance to create the impression of a premium expensive device.  The large dimensions and solid weight only emphasize its claim to exclusivity.  If you delve into the technical stuffing and functionality, then the opinion here will not be so obvious.  The phone can not be called poor options, but the lack of navigation systems, a high-precision large display and a powerful processor still affects the nature of operation.  However, these and other shortcomings are easily covered by the advantages of the traditional keyboard case of the model, convenient in ergonomics and pleasant to the eye. </p>
