Temple on the Sparrow Hills</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Surely every traveler who has planned a trip to a particular city, for himself is a certain tourist route - a list of places that you should definitely visit.  In this list of must-see sights, each includes those objects that meet its tastes and interests.  But there are also such memorable places that are becoming objects of mass pilgrimage, without a mandatory visit to which any trip loses its meaning.  You cannot argue - no one will believe you!  - that they were in Paris, but did not see the Eiffel Tower.  To be in Egypt and not look at the magnificent pyramids - what rubbish!  Therefore, whether you like it or not, you will have to include a couple more places in your route in order to get initiation into real travelers.  And such a place in Moscow, in addition to Red Square, are the Sparrow Hills.  In Soviet times, they were renamed Leninsky, now historical justice is restored, and the right name was returned to the right bank of the Moscow River.  Vorobyovy Gory in Moscow is an outstanding place of the city, visiting which you can enjoy the true beauty of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sparrow Hills in Moscow" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/461295.jpg" width="300"></div>

This is a high steep coast with ravines, in which there are a lot of springs.  This place was chosen by people in ancient times.  Here is the famous Mamonovo settlement, the settlement dates from the 8-7th centuries.  before.  n  e.  and 6-7 centuries.  n  e.  But the name of this place came from the village of Vorobyov, located on the right bank of the Moscow River.  The village belonged to a certain priest Vorobyov, he sold it to Princess Sophia Vitovtovna.  Apparently, she really liked the local beauties.  Sparrow Hills in Moscow have always been loved by Russian tsars, princes and other nobles.  After all, here one could not only admire the beautiful views, relax from the bustle of the city, but also hunt nicely: roe deer, wild boars and hares were always abundant in the forests.  These animals were often seen in the forest zone of the Sparrow Hills until the eighties of the last century. </p><h2>  Nature reserve "Sparrow Hills" </h2><p>  The Vorobyovy Gory in Moscow today is a nature reserve.  This is a cross between a city park and a forest park.  Large sections of forest with natural vegetation, rare species of trees and shrubs are preserved here.  Near each such tree is a plate with a description and approximate age of the plant.  Despite the fact that the Vorobyovy Gory in Moscow is located almost in the very center of the city (from here it is only five and a half kilometers to the Kremlin), large-scale construction has never been carried out here.  And this happened due to the large difference in elevation of the relief, which reaches seventy meters at a distance of three hundred meters from the river bed.  Compared to the gentle left bank of the Moskva River, the right one really looks like a mountainous area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vorobyovy Gory photo Moscow" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/461284.jpg" width="600"></div>
