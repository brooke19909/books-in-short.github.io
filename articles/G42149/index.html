  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fancy Animals: Himalayan Bear</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Himalayan bear is also called the black Asian, white-breasted and even the moon bear.  He got this name thanks to the characteristic white stripe on his chest, which looks like a crescent or a flying bird.  These bears live in Russia in the Far East, in Japan on the islands of Shikoku and Honshu, in the Himalayan <span>mountains, Nepal</span> and other areas located north of India. </p><p>  <strong>Description</strong> </p><p>  This species is slightly smaller than the <span>black bears</span> living in America.  At the withers, the height of the Himalayan bear is from 70 cm to one meter, their body length reaches about 120-190 cm. The weight of adult males is from 85 to 150 kg.  Females are much smaller - on average they weigh 70-90 kg.  The largest recorded Himalayan bear weighed 225 kg. </p><p>  These animals have a wonderful scent - much better than dogs.  However, they cannot boast of good eyesight and hearing. </p><p>  The fur of the bears is pleasant to the touch, thick, short, soft, most often black.  In rare individuals, the color may be reddish brown or dark brown.  On the chest there is a distinctive mark - a sickle-shaped white or pale yellow spot. </p><p>  There are several subspecies of the Himalayan bears.  For example, in Korea, the Far East and northeast China, the Ussuri bear lives - the largest representative of the Himalayan family.  In Japan, you can find a black Japanese bear, smaller.  Its difference is that there may be no white spot on the chest. </p><p>  <strong>Bear breeding and longevity</strong> </p><p>  The mating season of the bears takes place in the summer months, from June to August.  The female‚Äôs pregnancy lasts 7-8 months, and little cubs are born in late winter or early spring, when their mother is still in hibernation.  Most often, two cubs are born, less often - one or three or four.  A newborn teddy bear weighs about 400 grams.  They gain weight very slowly, and by the end of spring they reach only 2.5 kg.  Bears become relatively adult by the age of 2-3 years, and puberty occurs after 3 years. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Females do not bring offspring every year; their next pregnancy occurs only when current children grow up and leave their home. </p><p>  Under natural conditions, the Himalayan bear usually lives for a quarter of a century, and in captivity can live much longer - up to 45 years. </p><p>  <strong>Nutrition and Habits</strong> </p><p>  These animals can create family groups, which include two adults and cubs of several litters.  Bears perfectly climb rocks and trees.  They spend almost half their lives on tree branches.  These are <span>omnivores.</span>  The main diet consists of acorns, pine nuts, leaves.  They like to get and eat insects from rotting trees.  In the summer, they look for the fruits of bird cherry, pine cones, forest fruits and berries.  In mountain streams they fish without disdaining and dead, which is very much during spawning. </p><p>  <span>The Himalayan bear</span> is a very strong and agile beast.  He can even attack wild boars and buffaloes, breaking their neck with a powerful blow. </p><p>  In the middle of autumn, the bears are looking for a suitable place for hibernation.  Usually they choose a hollow tree or a cave.  If in summer these animals can climb up to 3-4 thousand above sea level, then in winter they always go down and settle at the foot of the mountains. </p><p>  <strong>Enemies</strong> </p><p>  In nature, the Himalayan bear has only two serious enemies - it is its brown counterpart and the <span>Amur tiger.</span>  From time to time, conflicts with lynxes and wolves can occur.  But when the bear really grows up, becomes an adult, then there are much fewer people who want to join the battle with it.  In addition, he spends a lot of time on trees, and not every animal can climb there. </p><p>  The Himalayan bear is listed in the Red Books of India, Japan and China.  But in Russia he was deleted from the protection book in 1991, and this species was again on the verge of destruction. </p><p>  This animal can be seen in many foreign zoos.  If in natural conditions the Himalayan bears are considered quite dangerous, then in zoos grown there since childhood, they become quite peaceful and friendly.  These bears are easily trained, so they can often be seen in the circus arena. </p>
