For more than 200 years, the mountain climate and narzan have been helping to treat diseases of the nervous system, respiratory and digestive organs, and cardiology is considered the main focus. </p><p>  In Kislovodsk you can organize a varied cultural program.  Young travelers are sure to be interested in the dolphinarium, water park and circus, and for adults in the city there is an exhibition devoted to the history of Kislovodsk, the unique theater-museum "Grace", the cinema "Soyuz" and the museum of A. I. Solzhenitsyn.  In addition, without exception, everyone will benefit from a walk in an amazing resort park. </p><h2>  Treatment and rest </h2><p>  The heart of the resort is the source of narzan, the first detailed description of which was given in 1773 by one of the members of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.  Sulphate narzan waters have a beneficial effect on digestion, regulate bowel function and increase gastric secretion.  Dolomite narzan improves metabolism, and the waters of the Kumskoye deposit are used both for drinking and for taking carbonic baths. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kislovodsk hotels" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1028270.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are really a lot of indications for treatment at the resort, so <span>Kislovodsk hotels</span> accept tourists all year round.  The complex is annually replenished with new hotels and resorts.  For serious treatment, it is best to choose institutions with good equipment and qualified medical personnel, such as the Plaza sanatorium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you just want to relax, breathe in the magnificent air and try the famous narzans, then opt for one of the city hotels.  Read about our most popular hotel complexes in our review. </p><h2>  Opposite Narzan Gallery </h2><p>  In the heart of the resort area is the Grand Hotel (Kislovodsk).  It is impossible not to notice the magnificent three-story building, on the porch of which the doorman meets guests.  The interior is a little surprising in the abundance of sculptural compositions and gilding. </p><p>  It is worth noting that the cost of rooms is fully consistent with the luxurious interior.  Hotels in Kislovodsk in the center (near the famous Narzan Gallery) are far from affordable for all travelers.  A single room will cost 3200 rubles, and the most modest double room - 3600 rubles.  Wealthy tourists can afford a suite (from 6,700 to 10,000 rubles) or a presidential suite (40,000 rubles).  Buffet breakfast is included in the price of the reservation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kislovodsk hotels in the center" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1028266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Grand Hotel Complex (Kislovodsk) offers its guests the following services: </p><p>  - washing and ironing; </p><p>  - beauty saloon; </p><p>  - massage room; </p><p>  - a sauna; </p><p>  - excursion services. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the hotel has a currency exchange, pharmacy, fur and jewelry stores. </p><h2>  Opinion of tourists </h2><p>  Polite staff, comfortable and clean rooms - these are not signs of the best hotel in the city.  Reviews from tourists also note the excellent location in the center and a truly varied buffet.  However, there were some flaws. </p><p>  Most of all, according to the guests, the ‚ÄúGrand Hotel‚Äù needs updating the number of rooms.  A minor redecoration, carpet replacement, and the purchase of modern appliances (flat-screen TVs and a coffee machine for breakfast) would definitely add comfort. </p><h2>  "Panorama" </h2><p>  Hotel Panorama (Kislovodsk) is located at: st.  Krupskaya, house 2. According to the rating of tourists, this is one of the best complexes in the city, in which excellent service is ideally combined with affordable prices. </p><p>  The hotel has a total of 38 rooms of various categories: </p><p>  - standard (from 1500 rubles); </p><p>  - comfort (from 2000 rubles); </p><p>  - junior suite (from 3000 rubles); </p><p>  - luxury (from 5000 rubles); </p><p>  - apartments (from 6000 rubles). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel panorama Kislovodsk" class="if" height="267" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1028272.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <p>  It offers guests all rooms - TV, telephone, refrigerator, air conditioning, electric kettle and dishes, hairdryer.  Wi-Fi is also free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Many hotels in Kislovodsk offer guests food or at least breakfast in a restaurant.  The Panorama complex has opened recently, so the restaurant is not working yet - this is perhaps the most serious minus. </p><p>  Guests celebrate the European level, and while there is no catering establishment, you can look into the neighboring cafes or the Central Market, which is a two-minute walk away.  Narzan Gallery is a 15-20 minute walk away. </p><p>  Guest reviews positively evaluate the Panorama Hotel (Kislovodsk).  High-quality daily cleaning, a set of toiletries, new furniture and appliances in the rooms - now you know the ideal place for budget travelers. </p><h2>  On Resort Boulevard </h2><p>  The Korona Hotel (Kislovodsk) is a modern complex located in the pedestrian zone in the city center.  Five room categories are available for booking: </p><p>  - Single Room; </p><p>  - standard; </p><p>  - junior suite (two-room); </p><p>  - suite (two-room); </p><p>  - Suite (two-room with a balcony). </p><p>  Plasma TV, air conditioning, refrigerator, dishes and an electric kettle, slippers, toiletries, as well as all the necessary furniture - here they care about the comfort of the guests. </p><p>  Kislovodsk hotels, as a rule, set prices depending on the season.  Most expensive is accommodation on New Year's holidays - from 4,600 rubles for a double occupancy, and in summer a one-room double room can be booked for 3,000-4,000 rubles.  Breakfast, safe and Wi-Fi are included. </p><p>  In the Korona restaurant you can taste traditional Caucasian dishes, and in the evenings, sitting on comfortable sofas, visitors love to smoke hookah and listen to live music. </p><h2>  Troubled nights </h2><p>  Resort Boulevard is an incredibly popular place in Kislovodsk, so the guests of the Korona Hotel did not dream of peace and quiet.  Until 12 at night, guests suffer from karaoke and other sound effects.  This is perhaps the main drawback. </p><p>  In addition, travelers note a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãstandard double rooms. </p><p>  Now let's talk about the ‚Äúpluses‚Äù: </p><p>  - New modern furniture and appliances; </p><p>  - wonderful location of the complex; </p><p>  - polite staff; </p><p>  - large portions at breakfast. </p><p>  Today, among travelers, you can often meet families with children.  The Korona Hotel is one of the few where they think of young guests.  There is a playground on site and a cot is available upon request. </p><h2>  Small Italy </h2><p>  On Resort Boulevard there is another, no less popular, hotel - ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù (Kislovodsk). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel venice kislovodsk" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1028264.jpg" width="600"></div>  Despite the ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù name, the interior design is made in a classic style.  There are only 15 rooms in the housing stock:

    <p>  - single standard; </p><p>  - double standard; </p><p>  - studio; </p><p>  - luxury; </p><p>  - apartments. </p><p>  The Venice restaurant is open in the hotel building, where the main emphasis is on Italian cuisine, but traditional Caucasian dishes are also prepared here.  In the morning, guests can go down to the restaurant or order breakfast in their room. </p><p>  Parking, laundry, organization of excursions, transfer and room-service are provided for a fee. </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  Kislovodsk hotels in the city center have the same drawbacks - the noise outside the windows of the many cafes and restaurants often interferes with young guests.  In addition, guests of ‚ÄúVenice‚Äù note poor sound insulation in the hotel itself, old castles in the rooms and the lack of an elevator in a four-story building.  The breakfast system is available by reservation and, according to travelers, the set of dishes on different days is unequal. </p><p>  Main advantages: </p><p>  - good location; </p><p>  - helpful staff; </p><p>  - iron in open access; </p><p>  - water coolers on each floor. </p><h2>  With increased comfort </h2><p>  Hotel "Germaniya" (Kislovodsk) earned almost the highest ratings.  The restored three-story ivory mansion attracts travelers, primarily due to its location.  The hotel complex is within walking distance of the Narzan Gallery and adjoins the spa park, so guests can enjoy the stunning forest air. </p><p>  The following rooms are available for booking: single, double and triple, as well as a suite with a balcony and a deluxe suite.  The price includes breakfast.  The homelike atmosphere in the rooms is created by carpets, upholstered furniture and intricate interior decorations. </p>

    <p>  Guests note that ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù is a very small hotel, so the staff has the opportunity to provide an individual approach to each guest.  Another advantage is the atmosphere of calm and silence, which in itself is a real rest from the bustle of the metropolis.  A large set of hygiene items, delicious home-made breakfasts, coolers in the lobby and a cozy courtyard only add advantages to the hotel. </p><p>  About the shortcomings.  Guests arriving by car were puzzled by the lack of parking.  The comments also touched upon the work of the administrator and the cleaners, who do not always perform their duties with high quality. </p><h2>  Raygond </h2><p>  Raigond Hotel (Kislovodsk) travelers value for unsurpassed comfort and privacy.  A small complex is located away from the bustling Resort Boulevard, where the nightlife of the city is concentrated. </p><p>  A closed area with car parking allows you not to worry about security.  Qualified staff, at the request of the guest, can organize an excursion, a course of spa treatment or a medical examination. </p><p>  Raygond offers its guests superior rooms: double, junior suite and suite.  The most budget option - from 3900 rubles for double occupancy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel corona kislovodsk" class="if" height="301" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1028265.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel also has a small spa center: massage room, pool and Turkish sauna. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Breakfast is served in the Cafe-bar - only here you can try fresh croissants in the mornings.  A buffet is waiting for guests on holidays, and on weekdays there is an ‚Äúa la carte‚Äù format, the menu of which always contains fresh fruits, cereals, dairy dishes and air omelettes. </p><p>  The Raigond Restaurant is a combination of Caucasian hospitality and European quality.  A special menu is designed for receptions, festive banquets and coffee breaks in case of events in the conference room. </p><h2>  Guest opinion </h2><p>  Families with children, single travelers and couples choose the Raygond Hotel due to its secluded location.  Reviews note the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms, as well as the interior, which is simply, but tastefully decorated. </p><p>  A visit to the SPA leaves a pleasant impression, but most often guests remember the pastries and huge portions in the restaurant.  The staff responds quickly to requests. </p><p>  The only thing that upsets the guests is the lack of Wi-Fi and the lack of a coffee machine. </p><h2>  Hotel Plaza </h2><p>  Kislovodsk is one of the main resorts of the <span>Caucasian Mineral Waters,</span> where tourists come from all over the world.  The Plaza SPA Hotels chain leads the Kislovodsk Spa Hotels category. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Plaza Kislovodsk" class="if" height="221" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1028643.jpg" width="479"></div>

    <p>  In the Plaza sanatorium, which was opened in 2005, travelers are waiting for the latest medical equipment, high-class service and maintenance.  The medical center occupies 3 thousand square meters.  meters and has a certificate for 70 types of spa care. </p><p>  A huge sanatorium fund is available for booking - 275 comfortable rooms (one-room, luxury and several types of apartments).  "Plaza" offers guests to purchase tickets (duration of 10 days), the price of which includes: </p><p>  - residence; </p><p>  - medical procedures; </p><p>  - Three meals a day; </p><p>  - entertainment programs; </p><p>  - services of a kids club. </p><p>  Kislovodsk hotels with a swimming pool have always been in great demand among travelers.  Sanatorium ‚ÄúPlaza‚Äù offers not only highly qualified medical services, but also a wonderful relaxation for body and soul: cosmetic procedures, massages, all kinds of wraps, peels and even a rare ritual of climatotherapy.  Guests can also enjoy the swimming pool, hammam and Finnish sauna at any time. </p><h2>  Diet food </h2><p>  Special attention should be paid to the catering service according to the "buffet" system.  The chef compiled an original menu for 14 days, which allows you to get acquainted with the national cuisines of the world.  In addition, next to each dish there is a card with information about calories and diet number.  In case you are assigned fractional meals, the restaurant organizes the issuance of individual containers with fruit slices. </p><p>  The Plaza Resort is always happy for families with children.  However, babies are very noisy and can interfere with other guests.  The Panorama Restaurant has a separate room for young guests - here the walls are decorated with funny pictures and there is everything you need for a fun meal. </p><h2>  Sanatorium or spa hotel? </h2><p>  Most of the reviews positively evaluate the work of the Plaza Hotel.  It really has everything for a comfortable stay - friendly staff, almost a new number of rooms, its own pump room with mineral water, wonderful cuisine, a spa complex and a large selection of medical services. </p><p>  However, some travelers have the impression that over the years this establishment ceases to be a sanatorium and turns into just a resort hotel.  The ticket price does not include very many procedures, often there is a need for additional payment.  However, the choice of all kinds of spa services for the body is really great. </p><p>  A significant drawback is the price.  ‚ÄúPlaza‚Äù is one of the most expensive resorts in the resort, and the cheapest ticket will cost 90 thousand rubles (per 10 days).  For the trip you need a package of documents (insurance policy and various medical certificates), in case of absence, guests will have to undergo an examination on the spot and pay it according to the price list. </p>
