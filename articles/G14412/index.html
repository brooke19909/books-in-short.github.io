  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to live without money</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Due to the recent crisis, many residents of our country were left without a permanent job and therefore began to think about how to survive without money.  In this article I will tell you how to get out of this situation. </p><h3>  How to find the money? </h3><p>  In order to find money, there are not many ways, but some are obviously not worth resorting to.  The best options are to borrow from relatives, friends, acquaintances, take a long-term loan, earn extra money on small jobs.  It is immediately worth noting that a bank loan, however, is unlikely to be issued to you without a permanent place of work, since living without money and paying a loan is not so simple.  The most undesirable option is short-term loans.  Such methods have yielded few good results, since it may take a long time to live without money, and you need to pay them as quickly as possible, and the interest on such loans is simply incredible. </p><h3>  <span>How to save</span> money? </h3><p>  In order to understand how to live without money, you need to learn how to save them.  There are several main ways to save: </p><ul><li>  Plan your expenses.  Determine for yourself all the unnecessary things and cross them out from the shopping list.  Then carefully compare all your current and previous waste and determine if you can replace any other things with more economical options. </li><li>  You can get the most ordinary piggy bank, in which you will dump all the little things that accumulate in your pockets for a month.  You will be amazed when you discover the amount that has formed in the piggy bank later, and this technique will save you from absolutely unnecessary small purchases. </li><li>  Keep your money on credit card.  The constant availability of money in your pocket will tempt you to make all kinds of purchases.  If the money is on the card, you will no longer be able to waste it so carelessly, because there will be several obstacles in front of you.  By the way, for an even greater effect, a credit card should be issued at a bank that does not have a large number of ATMs, so it was even more difficult for you to get to the nearest one. </li><li>  Quit all your bad habits instantly.  Smoking, drinking, slot machines and other habits are now an incredible luxury in your position.  One has only to imagine that in past times, perhaps you smoked your current budget in a month.  Now you should save your money as much as possible.  Stop smoking, drinking, stop eating fast food, as living without money is already difficult, and in this way you will not only save, but also save your health.  You can even replace transport trips with an easy walk. </li><li>  Use discounts.  To buy something, try to use <span>discount cards</span> to get various discounts.  If you do not have them, ask your acquaintances or friends, perhaps they will provide them for temporary use. </li></ul><h3>  How to economically find a job? </h3><p>  After dismissal, many begin to think about starting their own business, but you should immediately forget about it, since it is almost impossible to start a business without money. </p><p>  In order to economically find your job, there are several ways: </p><ul><li>  Post ads to newspapers, upload resumes to job search sites.  This can be done completely free.  Write about all your talents and abilities. </li><li>  Do not ride a car for every interview.  During a crisis, an interview is a very strict test, so you will probably pass a lot of them. </li><li>  Work on temporary jobs.  Who knows, maybe one day they will be able to offer you constant cooperation. </li></ul><p>  Do not lose faith in yourself, and then the potential employer will believe in you, and the money issue will be successfully resolved. </p>
