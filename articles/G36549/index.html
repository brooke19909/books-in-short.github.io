To this achievement he went all his life, with an obsessive dedication, performing one task after another. </p><h2>  Youth </h2><p>  On May 6, 1856, Robert Peary was born.  Cresson, near Pittsburgh, was his hometown.  He also studied on the East Coast, in the <span>state of Maine,</span> from where he went to serve in the US Navy.  Army duty threw him into Latin America, including Panama and Nicaragua, where at that time the Americans tried to build the Nicaraguan Canal to simplify navigation between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. </p><p>  But the real hobby and passion of the young man was the North.  At that time, the topic of the Arctic excited the scientific community and just adventure lovers who wanted to be on the edge of the world.  Almost all the years of Robert Peary's life (1856 - 1920) were devoted to polar research.  Only 15 years were spent among the Eskimos.  Even the daughter of the discoverer Mary was born on an expedition. </p>

    <h2>  First expeditions </h2><p>  In 1886, he first went to the North, finding himself in Greenland.  Travel on this island was organized through the use of dog teams.  Piri was such an adventurer that he wanted to cross the island alone.  However, his Danish comrade convinced the young researcher.  Instead, they set off together, leaving behind about a hundred miles, or 160 kilometers.  At that time it was the second longest voyage on the "green island".  Robert Peary wanted to improve his result, but already in 1888 Greenland was conquered by Fridtjof Nansen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After that, the polar explorer became obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreaching the North Pole, which has not yet been submitted to anyone.  In order not to die in the first expedition, Peary successively studied survival skills for several years in the harsh climatic conditions of the Far North.  To do this, he studied the life of the Eskimos.  Later, the natives of this people will help the researcher in his difficult journeys. </p><p>  Exotic experience was not in vain.  Robert completely abandoned the usual equipment for Europeans and Americans.  Even before this, many expeditions died due to unpreparedness for critical temperatures during their parking.  Tents and bags were used there, which were defenseless against arctic winds and cataclysms.  Eskimos instead built snow shelters, or igloos.  Their experience was adopted by Robert Peary.  The biography of the discoverer says that this man borrowed a lot from the indigenous inhabitants of the North. </p>

    <h2>  Innovations </h2><p>  The first attempt to reach the North Pole was made in 1895.  Before that, there were several more trips to Greenland, where Peary gained experience and knowledge about survival in the harsh conditions of the North.  He created a system of transshipment points to facilitate expedition communication.  With regard to transport, preference was given to dogs, while their number was invariably greater than required. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Robert very carefully selected the inventory, guided by the rule that only one that has the minimum weight and can bring maximum benefit should be taken on a hike.  Extra things could turn out to be a burden slowing down the researcher, and every hour is expensive in the North, since the weather changed regularly with enviable surprise, and life support resources were calculated every minute. </p><p>  The psychological work within the team of polar explorers was also important.  Piri adopted the experience of army discipline.  In his expeditions, the authority of the chief was unshakable.  The orders given to them were carried out immediately, thanks to which it was possible to avoid deviations from the solution of the assigned tasks. </p>

    <h2>  Target - North Pole </h2><p>  All this knowledge and skills was applied in 1895, but that attempt was unsuccessful.  In addition, many suffered from frostbite, including Robert Peary himself.  The North Pole deprived him of eight toes, which had to be amputated. </p><p>  The second attempt took place only five years later - in 1900, when Peary was able to improve his health and solve organizational issues.  This time he managed to move forward, but he never reached the goal. </p>

    <h2>  Conquering the North Pole </h2><p>  In 1908, the sixth Arctic expedition of Piri was organized.  This was his third attempt to conquer the <span>North Pole.</span>  A team of Americans and Native Greenlanders participated in the campaign.  The many-month path to the goal included a long wintering on the ice.  Through certain sections of the route, some participants returned to the mainland to report the results.  Slowly but surely, Robert Peary made his way to his goal.  What he discovered, it became clear on April 6, 1909, when his people set a striped star flag in the snow, in the place where, according to calculations, there was a pole.  Here the team stayed for 30 hours, after which it turned to the side of the house.  The return took place on September 21, 1909. </p><p>  The traveler died in 1920, covered in glory.  Shortly before that, the US government made him Rear Admiral. </p>
