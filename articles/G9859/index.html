  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We understand: what is the registry?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now the ability to use a personal computer is absolutely impossible to surprise anyone, but even experienced users may have questions.  One of these questions may be: what is a registry?  At first it seems to be something very incomprehensible, complicated, so you don‚Äôt need to climb there at all.  Indeed, attempts to do something, and even more to fix it, if you do not know what you are dealing with, will be superfluous and can only do harm.  But in fact, everything is very easy and simple.  Register - what is it?  Information and information without which an operating system called Windows will not be able to function normally. </p><p>  Few people know what the registry is, and even more so that only when the system starts, more than one thousand calls pass to it, with active work on the PC this number can exceed ten thousand.  Such an answer, of course, is not enough to fully reveal the essence of the concept. </p><p>  What is the Windows registry?  As already mentioned, this is information that ensures the correct operation of the system.  That is, it can be detailed information about all users, more precisely their profiles, various properties of folders existing on the computer, application icons or shortcuts, all kinds of installed equipment, as well as all the ports that are used. </p><p>  Windows OS has a lot of versions and the registry features in each of them can be very different from each other.  Where is all <span>this information stored?</span>  Some components are stored directly in the RAM of a personal computer and are deleted after the session.  Writing and reading information from the registry is ongoing.  For example, when installing a new program, all the necessary information that will be required to run it and work correctly is immediately saved in a separate file.  When you <span>install a printer,</span> scanner, or some other device, the database immediately records where the driver is located, and when you run the program or device, all the information that is needed is read from there. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The registry can also be considered as a special tool for working with a computer, because it is with its help that each person can make the system "slow down" and work impossible, and vice versa, so that the speed becomes maximum.  If there are any problems (the so-called "glitches") when working with a computer, this means that some incorrect settings have appeared in the system that cannot be implemented. </p><p>  It remains to understand what could be the most dangerous results of incorrect work with the registry.  In the event that the user deletes something very necessary or somehow damages the registry itself, it is likely that the operating system will no longer boot.  It is according to this scheme that most known viruses operate: they try either to spoil files that contain all the information, or to block access to them.  With such problems, you should immediately contact specialists in order to save your <span>personal data whenever</span> possible <span>.</span> </p><p>  So, we figured out what the registry is.  This is all information that provides the user with a comfortable and proper operation with the operating system.  If any damage or problems interacting with the computer occurs, the first thing to do is check the PC settings database, because this is the most vulnerable spot for dangerous viruses.  If you are not sure what exactly needs to be corrected or deleted there, it is better to entrust this matter to a professional who will accurately correct all the shortcomings and return the system to its original state.  The value of the registry cannot be overestimated, because this is the heart of the entire OS, and you need to be very careful with it. </p>
