  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is a processor?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every person who has recently acquired a computer is interested in what a processor is. </p><p>  In fact, this is a small chip that is designed to execute program code.  To answer the question of what a computer processor is, simply - this is one of the main elements of its <span>hardware.</span> </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the architecture of this component is constantly progressing and changing, only the tasks that face this device remain constant. </p><p>  Everyone who is interested in <span>what a processor is will</span> certainly be interested in its parameters.  The main ones are as follows.  Power consumption, performance, <span>clock speed</span> and architecture.  It used to be that each CPU was created for a particular computer system.  It is not surprising that people tried to get away from such an expensive and not very effective method. </p><p>  It was then that manufacturers began to produce serial models, the division into types and classes began.  Thanks to this approach, it was possible to change a damaged element almost instantly. </p><p>  What is a processor these days - a tiny silicon board, on the surface of which there are many contacts, and inside it is a complex semiconductor structure, consisting of millions of transistors. </p><p>  Considering that the number of elements that are part of various models is significantly different, there are differences in the architecture of the elements. </p><p>  Moreover, even if it is the same for two processors, there can be significant differences in the process itself, memory sizes and other things.  The number of cores may vary.  What is a dual-core processor? It is a multi-core element that was promising a few years ago.  Now their time is gone, and the first places are occupied by much more complex components. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Each architecture or core has its own specific labeling that designates them.  Be that as it may, manufacturing companies are steadily moving toward increasing the total number of cores, increasing <span>computer performance.</span>  Of course, those programs that were created before the appearance of such a thing as multicore will not function faster on systems with multiple cores. </p><p>  Their number is not the only important characteristic.  In order to understand what a processor is, it is necessary to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch characteristics as cache size, bus speed, and its clock speed. </p><p>  One should not lose sight of such an indicator as the number of threads - it reflects the throughput of the system.  The more of them, the better the machine functions. </p><p>  All the same principles apply to the size of the cache (internal processor memory that compensates for interruptions from the operational). </p><p>  Accordingly, such a frequency.  The higher it is, the more efficient the computer. </p><p>  The bus is an element due to which there is a connection between the processor and the controller of the motherboard.  Of course, these elements are also progressing rapidly, manufacturers are competing in a speed race.  There were and remain two large competing processors manufacturing companies on the market.  These are Intel and AMD.  Their rivalry is very beneficial for ordinary users - because they get more and more high-speed products. </p><p>  It is worth noting that now the normal <span>temperature of the processor</span> is less than fifty degrees.  If it is higher, then you need to try to process it with thermal grease.  If this does not help, there is a possibility that the system specialist has become dusty and needs to be vacuously cleaned. </p><p>  As you can see, the processor is one of the fundamental components of a computer, the performance of the entire system as a whole depends on its power.  The main thing is to monitor his condition.  This is what a processor is. </p>
