  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holidays in Norway.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Holidays in Norway</span> are a unique and stunning view of the mountain landscapes and the huge number of coastal bays and fjords, which every day at dawn go out into the sea with an uneven line across the coast.  The most beautiful fjord here is Lucy, which stretched out its possessions for more than 40 kilometers.  In addition, around this bay you can see thousand-meter cliffs that have been rising above this paradise for more than 1000 years.  Also, rest in Norway gained great fame due to the Prekestulenna cliff, whose peak represents an unusually flat surface of about 25 square meters. </p><p>  It is worth noting that more than a thousand tourists every year choose last-minute <span>tours to Norway</span> just to climb here again on the steepest slopes in the world, and after reaching this peak, admire the picturesque view.  The highest point above the Lucy fjord is the Kierag cliff, which rises above sea level by more than 1000 meters.  On this mountain is the local attraction Kieragbolten - this is a small round stone that is not known to be stuck directly above the fjord between 2 vertically directed rocks. </p><p>  So, as you already understood, the main occupation at this resort is active sports, or more precisely, the conquest of numerous mountain peaks.  So this resort is a great opportunity to engage in professional mountaineering.  At your service there are prepared a huge number of routes, each of which has its own level of difficulty and is accompanied by experienced climbers - specialists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, in winter, ski resorts called Geilo and Trysil are opened here, which are famous for their strong and reliable facilities and the latest snow slopes.  These tourist resorts most often open in early November, and finish their work only in May.  Here you will find ski slopes both for very young beginners and for already inveterate professionals.  In general, there is absolutely everything for outdoor activities, ranging from cross-country trails and unique bobsleigh and snowboard trails to small ski schools.  Only here you can be offered absolutely safe riding on deer, dog sledding and special snowmobiles. </p><p>  But do not think that all active leisure in Norway will end only with structures connected with the mountains.  Also, fishery competitions are often held here, in which everyone can check their luck.  Quite often, tourists come to this country only to catch as many large fish as possible in the waters of Norway.  And this is accompanied by local rivers and lakes.  In large rivers, salmon will always be waiting for you, and in lakes trout is most often caught.  In addition, almost all mountain rivers have everything necessary for rafting, which is an extreme rafting of people on a raging river.  Also, excursions provide for numerous hikes and long hiking ascents, which can sometimes be accompanied by trips in carts or right on horseback. </p><p>  The atmosphere of this country is largely saturated with the ancient <span>Viking era</span> and various popular beliefs and myths about elves, gnomes and trolls.  It is the fabulousness and beauty of the places that make you buy last-minute trips to Norway and return here again and again. </p><p>  In general, a vacation in Norway is a good reason to spend several weeks in the fresh mountain air and diversify everyday life with active entertainment and sightseeing programs.  So enjoy your vacation in this country, and if you have not been here, be sure to go. </p>
