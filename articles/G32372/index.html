The article reveals the most interesting aspects of this attraction, so that you can decide exactly whether it is for you to go to it. </p><h2>  What does the Vladimir Church look like </h2><p>  The famous architect Vasily Bazhenov put a lot of effort into creating not just a temple, but a whole work of art, and he succeeded to the fullest.  It‚Äôs enough to just look at the photos to see this.  A bright temple, high spiers that cross into the sky, and a spectacular entrance staircase are no worse than in European castles, will impress any tourist, even far from religiosity. </p>

    <p>  The church has 2 symmetrical belfries, which are located on the sides of the building, and the facades are decorated with double aerial porticos. </p><p>  The church consists of two temples.  The lower, the Nativity of Christ, accepts everyone to join the services.  The upper church is named after the famous <span>Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God,</span> and there is no access to it, since the staircase is in disrepair.  If we talk about architecture, the first temple is an oval room, to which the belfries and the rectangular refectory between them are attached. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ensemble of the church also includes a small but rather high chapel, made in the general style, which was supposedly designed by the architect I.I. Tamansky.  Unfortunately, the author of this creation is not exactly established. </p><p>  The beautiful appearance is complemented by a beautifully manicured garden around, which ministers take care of.  Various flowers bloom here all summer.  Moreover, there is also a small garden nearby, where vegetables and fruits are grown. </p><h2>  What is famous for Vladimir Church </h2><p>  The Vladimir Church is primarily interesting for its unusual style, which is also called Russian Gothic.  It differs in that it looks more like a building from a good fairy tale than like gloomy European temples.  And if the latter are decorated with evil gargoyles, then the Vladimir Church shows us the faces of saints. </p>

    <p>  It is hardly possible to find something similar in all of Russia.  A very spectacular building is the Vladimir Church.  Unfortunately, Bykovo cannot boast such beauty today.  The fact is that the estate is gradually falling into disrepair, while the temple looks much more well-groomed. </p><p>  On the territory of the attractions are also a summer blooming park and large ponds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Church history </h2><p>  The church existed in a modern place since ancient times.  Initially, it was only a wooden building, but then, at the beginning of the XVII century, it was rebuilt by constructing a stone temple. </p><p>  The modern church was built later.  It was designed by one of the most famous architects of Russia at that time.  Vasily Bazhenov was able to create a real architectural masterpiece that inspires people to gain faith.  The building was completed in 1789, and almost a century later a separate chapel appeared near it. </p>

    <h2>  Icons </h2><p>  The most famous icon in the church, without a doubt, is the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God.  It is located right behind the altar, to his left.  It is believed that the icon helps believers, and it really seems that this is so, because it is hung with rings, chains and crosses of people who received the long-awaited help. </p><p>  The ministers of the church are proud of another masterpiece - the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  It is noteworthy in that the emperor Nicholas I himself gave the owners a family. Both icons can be seen today in the church. </p><p>  Inside the temple is beautifully painted, and many paintings are painted directly on the ceiling and walls.  All this splendor has been carefully restored, and today causes genuine delight among church visitors. </p><p>  Surprisingly, despite all the hardships that the church went through, the creations of famous domestic artists - the Vasnetsov brothers, are still preserved in it. </p><h2>  Vladimir Church today </h2><p>  Survived all the hardships and became more beautiful over the past years, the Vladimir Church.  Bykovo, the estate of M. M. Izmailov, unfortunately, is gradually declining.  However, the flow of tourists here does not stop, which is especially noticeable in the summer, in hot weather.  In autumn, the church is also often visited, because at this time of the year the Gothic features of the temple are especially clearly visible. </p><p>  In the Bykovo estate there is actually something to admire.  Vladimir Church, Bykovo - both attractions are located in a picturesque area.  They are surrounded by tall trees, and in summer you can enjoy a walk in the flowering park. </p>

    <h2>  Manor Bykovo, Ramensky district </h2><p>  The estate of <span>M. M. Izmailov, the</span> favorite of Catherine II and the Governor-General of Moscow is another interesting place.  It is located in Bykovo, Ramensky district.  However, not Izmailov‚Äôs house has survived to this day, but a later version built at the end of the 18th century by new owners under the leadership of the Vorontsov-Dashkovs.  The house had to be rebuilt, only the foundation remained from the old building. </p><p>  After the Vorontsov-Dashkovs, the house was sold by Ilyin, and in Soviet times it was privatized.  At one time it was used as a shelter for homeless children, and then as a sanatorium for patients with tuberculosis.  Over the years, the interior of the once luxurious estate has changed beyond recognition. </p>

    <p>  Now it is not recommended to go inside the building, but there is definitely something to see from the outside.  So, the main element that attracts the attention of visitors is the magnificent caryatids located at the very top of the columns supporting the balcony. </p><p>  Around the estate today you can‚Äôt see the former splendor, but even just walking along the shady alleys is a great pleasure.  Tourists especially like to visit the old arbor, which has survived since the time of Izmailov. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Those interested in visiting the church will probably want to find out a detailed route to such attractions as the Vladimir Church and Bykovo.  How to get there is actually a pretty common question.  Fortunately, the temple is located near the capital, only a couple of kilometers away, so there should not be any problems with transport. </p><p>  You can get there by train to Usadba station, and then by buses No. 23 and No. 39.  You can also get there simply by bus from Moscow at No. 424 to the Temple stop. </p><p>  You can also use taxi services to get to the monuments of Vladimir Church, Bykovo.  The driver will probably know the address who will take you, so it‚Äôs not necessary to know the exact route. </p><h2>  Opening hours </h2><p>  When visiting attractions, be careful.  Outside at any time of the day you can see what the Vladimir Church (Bykovo) looks like.  Opening hours must be specified in order to enjoy the interior of the temple.  Since <span>this is a church,</span> we advise you to dress appropriately, it is advisable to have modest closed clothes and a scarf on the head of women. </p><p>  Services are held daily in the Vladimir Church.  Every day they begin at 9.00, and on holidays, daytime, evening or night can be added to them.
