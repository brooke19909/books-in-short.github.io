    <p>  The complex itself harmoniously blended with the surrounding nature.  It is beautiful from the outside, but also inside strikes with interiors.  The first pleasant impression arises when you go from the street to the lobby. </p><p>  The rooms in the main building and the bungalows are no different.  All of them are spacious, comfortable and have great views.  It can be seen that the hotel is far from new, but maintained in good condition.  Rooms are cleaned daily.  Maids also change towels every day.  You can ask to clean the apartment at a convenient time for you. </p><p>  The rooms are well equipped and have beautiful interiors.  Each room has air conditioning, allowing you to create comfortable conditions for vacationers. </p><p>  As for food, all tourists are very pleased with it.  The food offered in the restaurant is tasty and varied.  Every day there are seafood on the tables, which is very pleasing.  Fruits are also presented in a wide assortment.  There are enough meat dishes.  With the large selection that is offered at the buffet, everyone can choose something delicious for themselves.  It is very nice that the restaurant has no queues, and all dishes are regularly updated, you can take your time.  For those vacationers who are planning an active excursion program (after all, this is Greece), Possidi Holidays Resort Hotel 5 * can offer half board (breakfast and dinner), because tourists will still not be in time for lunch.  In general, the hotel administration and staff are very responsive, attentive and try their best to help. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="possidi holidays resort suites hotel 5" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1476685.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Very good employees are on duty at the reception, they settle quickly, while they do not extort presents for more suitable conditions.  If you do not like the number with something, they will replace it for free.  As for the service, the complex is pleasant in every way. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  The hotel is located on the shore, but nevertheless there is a road between it and the beach, it must be crossed.  The movement on it is not strong, rather, even rare, not far from a dead end.  To the beach to go no more than three minutes.  On the coast, sunbeds and umbrellas are paid.  The water in the sea is very clean and has an incredibly beautiful color.  Halkidiki in September is the best choice for a holiday in Greece.  The fact is that the local coast is not as prone to winds as other places.  Yes, the water in many bays is warmer than in the open sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="possidi holidays resort hotel 5 reviews" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1476687.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is good for those tourists who love a relaxing pastime on the beach.  But if you belong to those people who, in addition to the sea, still want to enjoy the sights and do shopping, then you may not like it here.  The nearest village is very small and consists of only one street with a couple of restaurants, there is no special entertainment.  For this reason, knowledgeable tourists recommend renting a car at the hotel and quietly do exploring the stunning places of Halkidiki.  Greece is an interesting country with amazing places, there is something to see. </p><p>  Those who do not want to take a car for some reason can contact the hotel guide, they will certainly tell you the most worthwhile tours, although it is very difficult to choose something here, I want to see as much as possible. </p><p>  The hotel makes the best impression.  Especially pleasing to a small number of people on the beach.  There is no noisy crowd of holidaymakers.  Here you can relax and enjoy the sea, sun and nature carefree. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Possidi Holidays Resort Hotel 5 * is a wonderful place for a vacation away from the hustle and bustle of cities.  If you are looking for privacy and want to indulge in doing nothing at the beach, then here you are.  But partygoers will definitely not like it here. </p>
