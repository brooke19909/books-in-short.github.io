Short review</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The island of Cyprus attracts beach people from all over the world with opportunities to relax in the mild Mediterranean climate, swim in the <span>azure sea</span> and sunbathe in plenty on a sand or warm pebbles.  Therefore, the tourist flow to this wonderful island is growing from year to year.  But where are the best beaches in Cyprus?  It is difficult to unequivocally answer this question.  It all depends on what value you put in the concept of ‚Äúbest beach‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best sandy beaches of cyprus" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/209666.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  It is clear that the sea must be clean.  But almost the entire coast of the island is studded with ‚Äúblue flags‚Äù - signs guaranteeing excellent water quality and areas for recreation.  In addition, <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãurchins</span> and <span>poisonous jellyfish</span> are not found in the local water area <span>,</span> which cause so much inconvenience to tourists in exotic countries.  All the best beaches in Cyprus are municipal, which means that access to them is free for everyone, even if there is a five-star hotel on the shore.  At the same time, rescuers are on duty on them, there are first-aid posts and a shower with <span>fresh water.</span> </p><p>  This, so to speak, is the basis.  Next is a matter of taste.  Someone likes the waves and the fresh wind for surfing, someone - a smooth entry into the sea to splash the kids.  Which is better: sand or pebbles is a topic of endless debate among beach people, but in Larnaca both disputing camps will be satisfied.  In this resort you can find areas with golden gray sand, as well as areas with pebbles.  Many travelers with young children believe that the best beaches in Cyprus are located in Larnaca, because here the bottom drops very smoothly.  And in these places there are areas with black volcanic sand.  By the way, there are relatively few tourists in this resort, which allows us to call it a ‚Äúromantic coast‚Äù. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where are the best beaches in Cyprus" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/209670.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In Limassol, you can also find many sandy beaches.  But here immediately upon entering the water there is a great depth, which, of course, is convenient for adults.  True, the sand in the recreation area is yellowish-gray.  But what if you do not tolerate pebbles in any form?  Then the best sandy beaches of Cyprus are for you in Protaras and Ayia Napa.  Almost everyone recognizes this.  White as alpine snow, soft as a feather bed, without stones, the local sand gives the sea water a bluish tint.  True, Ayia Napa is a favorite place of youth.  It‚Äôs crowded and noisy on the coast, and in the evenings, life here is in full swing - not a perfect place to relax with young children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The best beaches of Cyprus" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/209671.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  For pebble lovers, the best beaches in Cyprus include Paphos.  Even those who wish to jump into the water from the rocks can find suitable places for themselves there.  But there is sand there - in the village of Latchi, located near the city.  At least the divers speak of Paphos only in enthusiastic colors.  And surfers choose <span>Coral Bay</span> in this region <span>.</span>  Fans of all kinds of amusements will find for themselves a lot of interesting things in the Geraskipu recreation area, which is four kilometers from the city.  But for those who seek solitude, we can advise Lara Bay - there are few tourists there, but you can watch how green turtles are grown. </p><p>  What are the best beaches in Cyprus in the northern part of the island, which is currently considered Turkish-occupied territory?  And there are pearls of their own.  Famagusta surprises with its snow-white sand.  But the resort of Kyrenia will suit everyone.  The city itself has all the opportunities for diving.  Five kilometers to the west, a beautiful sandy beach, protected from wind and waves, with a steep approach to the sea - there is no better place for kids to find it.  Full European level beach service is located in Karaoglanoglu. </p>
