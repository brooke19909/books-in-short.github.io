    <h2>  <span>Myth of Ancient Greece</span> "Apollo and the Muses" </h2><p>  The myth was created long before the advent of Christianity.  Therefore, the original version has undergone folkloric folk changes.  However, the researchers were able to almost completely recreate the original.  This is due to the fact that the myth is written in the style of epic prose, which is easy to distinguish from "folk" folklore.  The myth "Apollo and the Muses" describes the raising of God to Olympus.  The main gods sat on this mountain.  There has always been intrigue and enmity.  Almost every god had his own enemy or envious person.  Constant noise.  And among this fuss Apollo appears, accompanied by 9 muses.  He plays Kifar.  Muses sing and dance around him.  The gods immediately began to listen spellbound.  Even the formidable Zeus did not utter a word.  Eagle, Hera, Artemis - all looked at the arrivals.  Their singing made them forget about troubles and just enjoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Myth of Ancient Greece Apollo and the Muses" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38575/1013072.jpg" width="404"></div>  The main message of this myth is the search for harmony in art.  9 muses represented various sciences and arts.  The legend tells the reader that even the best of the best can afford to be lost in music.  The supremacy of Apollo is the personification of the superiority of the beautiful.  He is like a person who is inspired by creativity (for which muses are responsible).

    <h2>  Apollo </h2><p>  The myth "Apollo and the Muses" assigns a significant role <span>to the god of light</span> - Apollo.  He is one of the most revered in Greek mythology.  A lot of sculptural compositions are dedicated to him.  Even after thousands of years, Apollo is still a household name, which denotes the physical strength and beauty of a person. </p><h2>  Muses </h2><p>  Muses are patrons of the arts.  Their images are also still used in many languages.  For example, the well-known word "music" takes its roots precisely in ancient Greece, only then did it mean art as a whole.  According to legend, the muses were born from Zeus himself.  Each woman is responsible for a particular science or branch of art.  Muses come to mortals to inspire them.  For this, they build temples for the goddesses and write poems.  Almost half of the muses are responsible for poetry.  The myth "Apollo and the Muses" describes them dressed in snow-white robes and wreaths.  In addition to singing, the goddesses also lead round dances, to which other inhabitants of Olympus later join. </p>
