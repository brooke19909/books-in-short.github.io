According to the Federal State Statistics Service, in Russia every second banknote of 5,000 rubles is fake. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="counterfeiter at work" class="if uuid-2961877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2961877.jpg"></div><p>  The Bank of Russia strongly recommends checking money for authenticity based on at least three signs.  We will talk about how to check a bill of 5,000 rubles without using special devices in this article. </p><h2>  Banknote History </h2><p>  <span>The five-thousandth note</span> is the largest among Russian banknotes.  It was first put into circulation after the October Revolution, in 1918.  The decision was made by the interim government in connection with hyperinflation.  At that time, the depreciation of money occurred at least tenfold. </p><p>  In the entire history of the existence of the banknote, it is known that it was issued as the largest bill.  However, over time, due to the repeated fall of the economy, the country turned into one of the smallest. </p><p>  Under the interim government, banknotes were printed with the emblem of the Russian Empire - the double-headed eagle, but already in 1918 the emblem of the RSFSR was depicted on the reverse side.  After that, until 1923, a bill of 5,000 rubles underwent various modifications. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ru.m.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="1995 banknote" class="if uuid-2959300" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2959300.jpg"></div><p>  The following changes occurred only in 1992.  On July 14, printed ‚Äúfive thousandths‚Äù with the image of the famous buildings of Moscow on both sides in dark blue and blue colors were put into circulation. </p><p>  The following year, on January 25, a new denomination of 5,000 rubles was issued.  Changes were made on the front side, the back remained the same.  The bill changed colors from blue to red.  On the front side was the flag of Russia on the dome of the Senate building.  In 1994, additional watermarks were added, but apparently everything remained the same. </p><p>  In 1995, green notes began to be issued depicting the Millennium of Russia monument, behind which the St. Sophia Cathedral of St. Petersburg is visible. </p><h2>  About the modern bill </h2><p>  The usual red-orange banknote for us was issued by the government in 2006 and still exists.  It depicts the city of Khabarovsk: on the front side, a monument to Russian statesman of Eastern Siberia Nikolai Nikolayevich Muravyov-Amursky is visible, and on the back there is a bridge over the Amur River.  You can verify the authenticity of a bill in 5000 of the old and new type without special equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="golos-narodu.com.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="printing of real banknotes" class="if uuid-2961875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2961875.jpg"></div><p>  At the heart of the bill is high-quality cotton paper with multi-colored fibers added to it.  On both sides, you can clearly see the intersecting fibers of red and blue, forming a protective pattern between them.  If you look at the clearance, the bill is covered with numerous watermarks.  On the back you can find a metallized strip with a hologram.  A five-thousandth banknote has its own peculiarities, therefore, we will describe in detail below how to check a banknote of 5000 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Magnifying Glass Check </h2><p>  A close examination of the front side reveals a graphic image in the form of schematic conifers and deciduous trees, bears, the Amur tiger and other representatives of the flora and fauna of the Khabarovsk Territory on the far bank of the Amur.  On the reverse side, there are lines with a microtext ‚Äú5000‚Äù on a decorative diving and iridescent ribbon. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="counterfeit note" class="if uuid-2961873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2961873.jpg"></div><p>  When the bill is tilted from the front side on a plain field, rainbow stripes appear under the numbers representing the face value of the banknote.  The coat of arms of Khabarovsk also changes its color from purple to golden green. </p><h2>  To the touch </h2><p>  For people with impaired vision and as additional protection against counterfeiters, three-dimensional symbols and micro-holes are printed on a 5000 bill. It is very easy to check them by touch.  You just need to know in which areas of the bill these identification marks are located, besides there are not so many of them. </p><p>  On the front side under the number of the bill on the left are special labels for visually impaired in the form of three horizontal stripes and two points.  At the end of the inscription is the text "TICKET OF THE BANK OF RUSSIA".  All this should feel good to the touch, since these lines are embossed.  Try to close your eyes and touch the identification marks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  To the light </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="fake and real clearance bill" class="if uuid-2961876" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2961876.jpg"></div><p>  Another reliable sign that allows you to check a 5000 bill for authenticity is used more often than others: you need to place a banknote on a light source.  On the front side, immediately below the <span>emblem of Khabarovsk,</span> you will find micro-holes in the form of the number "5000".  At the same time, tactile holes are not felt at all. </p><p>  Using this method for determining the authenticity of banknotes, one can find watermarks depicting a portrait of Nikolai Nikolayevich Muravyov-Amursky, which is made in tones from white to gray with smooth color transitions.  Next to the face is clearly visible figure "5000" of a lighter shade.  The rainbow dotted stripe in the gap becomes one solid line with the numbers "5000" facing each other along the entire length of the bill. </p><h2>  Using ultraviolet radiation </h2><p>  How to check a bill in 5000 for authenticity with ultraviolet?  For this, special equipment is needed - a lamp with a certain emission spectrum.  UV lamps can be purchased at any store.  In the dark, when the lamp is on, the bill sharply changes its color, becoming bright blue.  At the same time, paper fibers are clearly visible on it and hidden identification marks are clearly distinguished.  The metallized strip on the back acquires a bright yellow color, and the figure "5000" is displayed in the frame on the right side, which is invisible under normal lighting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="fake among banknotes 5000" class="if uuid-2961874" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2961874.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, checking bills with 5000 ultraviolet light is easier.  As practice shows, every adult can cope with this task.  The main thing is to understand exactly how a five thousand rubles banknote should look in unusual lighting. </p><h2>  Using infrared radiation </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="IR radiation sample" class="if uuid-2955973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/97794/2955973.jpg"></div><p>  Devices with infrared radiation are most often installed in banks.  At the box office stores use ordinary ultraviolet lamps.  With the help of infrared radiation, you can easily check whether a real bill is in 5000. Like an ultraviolet lamp, infrared is sold in specialized stores. </p><p>  With such lighting, almost the entire pattern disappears from the banknote.  The front side almost completely turns into white paper, on which the contours and outlines of the banknote familiar to us are barely visible.  The back side saves only some fragments of the picture.  A more detailed view of the bill under infrared lighting can be in the photo above. </p><h2>  Polarization </h2><p>  Another way to check whether a real bill is 5,000 rubles is to establish the presence of a special polarizing coating, which is only in one part of the bill on the front side.  The image of the emblem of the Bank of Russia, if you look at the banknote directly, has a metallic luster, which disappears if you look at the bill at a large angle.  A simple check can be carried out without special devices, however, complete information about the polarization coating of a banknote can only be detected using a special filter. </p><p>  A polarizing filter is often used by photographers to give a special effect to their pictures.  It allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image.  Most often, such filters are installed in bank cash desks.  The filter is a small box a little larger than a bill with a polarizing film.  The device can be easily purchased at specialized trading floors.  Its cost is low due to mass production. </p><h2>  How to verify the authenticity of a banknote of 5000 rubles by number? </h2><p>  When issuing banknotes with a face value of 5,000 rubles, another level of protection is used in the form of the serial number of the bill.  It is printed twice on the front side.  In the lower left corner, two letters and seven numbers are printed in green ink.  Gradually, the font size increases from smaller to larger.  And in the upper right corner the same number is applied in red paint, but the letters are written in large font, and the numbers are smaller. </p><p>  The creation of such protection is carried out on a printed form by strong pressure on the paper.  The result is a slight deformation on both sides of the banknote.  The most common (but not the only) numbers on the banknote 5000 rubles: </p><ul><li>  AB 47747 **; </li><li>  BA 38769 **; </li><li>  BV 53847 **; </li><li>  BA 59769 **. </li></ul><p>  You can check a banknote of 5000 by number online on the Internet or through the special application ‚ÄúBank of Russia Banknotes‚Äù.  This software was specially created by the Bank of Russia for new banknotes in denominations of 200 and 2000 rubles, but with it you can find out the authenticity of banknotes of different denominations. </p><p>  Now you know how to check a bill in 5000 in several ways.  To do this, it is not necessary to have bank devices in the arsenal for checking the authenticity of banknotes, however, guaranteed authenticity can be identified in the bank. </p><p>  Five thousand rubles is the most frequently forged bill among Russian banknotes.  In order to qualitatively fake any banknote, it is necessary to observe many requirements, since high-quality paints and paper are used in the creation of paper money, the composition of which is kept in strict confidence. </p><p>  Counterfeiting is one of the most serious crimes against the state economy.  It is prosecuted by law and regulated by 186 articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. </p>
