    <p>  Cons of Orient Resort Hotel 4, according to holidaymakers themselves, are insignificant and temporary.  This is the need to modernize the building, which, judging by the hints of the health resort itself (and there is no smoke without fire), is scheduled for the winter season 2014/2015. </p><p>  We note that in terms of the level of service and organization of the boarding house for its common people, the hotel complex has already reached modern lines after rebranding.  Moreover, the discount, originally included in the price of the tour, honestly more than compensates for the aforementioned drawback.  Therefore, lovers of relaxation in the velvet season (and it lasts until the end of October) - hurry up: in view of the discount, the hotel complex offers a more than attractive tour at a price.  Perhaps that is why, if you want to save on an excess menu and annoying animation for buying interesting excursions, it makes sense to choose Orient Resort Hotel 4. </p><h2>  Hotel in the Turkish Riviera </h2><p>  The coast of the province of Mugla, where the hotel under consideration is located, together with the coast of the province of Antalya is unofficially called the Turkish Riviera (modeled on the French Cote d'Azur).  This region of the Country of Stars and Crescent annually in the holiday season attracts about 13 million tourists from different countries.  A powerful resort infrastructure has been created here, providing the possibility of a comfortable resort vacation of any star, at the choice of vacationers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This riviera is washed by the waters of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.  It is the water area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Aegean that provides the opportunity for a family beach holiday for the resort of Fethiye.  Orient Resort Hotel 4 is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãworld famous beaches - Calis, Calis, a beach on the island of Chevalier.  This land is decorated not only with the sea, but also with mountains and forests ... There are opportunities with excursions to visit the numerous monuments of antiquity.  The city of Fethiye, which has a magnificent panoramic view of its gorgeous bay, coastal islands, including the island of Rhodes, attracts paragliding enthusiasts from all over the world (flying on a special parachute towed by a boat).  Vacationers, in addition to a wonderful holiday, have a rich program of outdoor activities here: rafting on mountain rivers, and trips to mountainous areas by jeeps.  Probably you (and even more so if the readers are ladies who use appropriate cosmetics) have heard of the Dead Sea (Oludeniz).  This world famous natural wonder is located here: 14 kilometers from Fethiye.  We will discuss this in more detail later in our article. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2>

Orient Resort Hotel 4 - the hotel is not large and not small - medium.  It is located one and a half kilometers from this city and is in the first line, only 50 meters separate it from the city beach of Calis.  The beach, although not sandy, is very comfortable for walking barefoot, covered with the smallest pebbles.  This medium-sized hotel complex includes one four-story building with two facades (from the city and from the pool area) with a spacious rectangular main pool, a compact game pool with slides and a children's pool located on the sea side.

    <p>  On the west side, Orient Resort Hotel 4 is decorated with neatly planted manicured gardens.  There is a private beach at the hotel complex, 1 km away, to which a free hotel bus runs to the shuttle.  Both beaches are not sandy, they are covered by pebbles.  However, pebbles are so small that the inconvenience of walking on it barefoot is not felt. </p><h2>  Living rooms </h2><p>  There are 150 rooms in the Orient Resort Hotel 4 (Fethiye) hotel building.  The rooms have a balcony and a bathroom with a toilet.  Plumbing bathrooms - at a height, it includes either a multifunctional shower, or a bathtub with hydromassage.  Individual air conditioners work properly, in rooms - modern LCD TVs.  There is a telephone, hairdryer, and a free minibar.  It is possible to use a safe - for a fee. </p><p>  The situation in the rooms is maintained in the framework of the economy class, characteristic for 2004 (when the last <span>major overhaul</span> was carried <span>out).</span>  Plumbing is in good condition (staff is constantly monitoring this).  On the floor there is a dark green or dark gray <span>carpet.</span>  The walls and ceiling are painted white.  Beds, bedside tables, chairs correspond to the economy style category and are matched to the tone of the interior.  We will make a reservation that all this, of course, will change in the winter of 2014 (during the modernization of the hotel complex), from flooring to furniture.  According to the network corporate standards of the hotel business, if we think logically, it should reach the ‚Äú4 * +‚Äù level, similar to the Orient Hotels Roxy Resort 4 (Turkey, Kemer) single-system hotel network with it. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2>
