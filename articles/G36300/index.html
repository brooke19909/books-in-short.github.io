  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Natural sciences are characterized by their methods, approaches and objects of research.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Natural sciences - a complex of sciences, based on natural phenomena of nature, without the intervention of the human factor;  section of natural science. <br>  Traditionally, the natural sciences include such disciplines as geography, biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, geology. <br>  Natural sciences are characterized by their methods, approaches and <span>objects of research,</span> different from others. </p><p>  The basis of the natural sciences is the study of nature, its laws and laws of development, a fundamental role in the study of which observation plays.  Based on this method, from ancient times, bit by bit, a person collected knowledge about the world around him, analyzed and systematized them in order to use them later on for his needs.  The enormous contribution made through observation and which became the basis for all subsequent studies was made by such great scholars of antiquity as Aristotle, Plato, Pythagoras, Herodotus and many others.  However, for a deeper, internal knowledge and identification of the essence of all the occurring phenomena, observations alone were not enough, and the person began to conduct experiments.  One only has to remember the endless experiments with materials and substances that alchemists did in their inextinguishable desire to find an elixir of eternal youth, a philosopher's stone and other wonderful substances, in the pursuit of which so many discoveries were made.  Or recall names such as Christopher Columbus, <span>Isaac Newton,</span> Vasco da Gama, Einstein, Galileo Galilei, Fibonacci, Magellan - all of them were enlighteners and promoted science, often even at the cost of their own lives.  But despite any obstacles, the natural sciences continued and continue to develop, because they are always relevant and necessary.  Through their study, humanity can more fully meet its needs, finding ever new ways to solve problems.  Thus, the natural sciences are characterized by progress and are a driving factor in development. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In general, when studying nature, a person has always been guided primarily by an analytical approach, in other words, by the method of reductionism (from Latin reductio - reduction).  So, trying to explain one phenomenon, we are forced to consider its individual parts, component units.  To explain the physiology of the human body, we move on to its structural components: the organs that make up their cells and in the end we come to some indivisible part, the starting point of existence.  Through the knowledge of the microworld, we discover the universe. </p><p>  All this led to the multiple stratification of all the so-called fundamental sciences into separate disciplines, as well as ‚Äúfrontier‚Äù sciences, which are at the junction of the main directions.  Nevertheless, all sciences remain interconnected, through their assimilation and interaction, new branches of various disciplines arise, hierarchy and systematization appear.  Due to this, the natural sciences are characterized by interpenetration and orderliness. </p><p>  In addition, the natural sciences actively interact with other branches of natural science: technical, applied, social.  This is especially intense with the latter, since the natural and social sciences and humanities have similar methods and a common object of research - a person who is both part of society and part of nature. </p><p>  At the junction of natural and <span>technical sciences</span> , bionics appeared. <br>  A unique, interdisciplinary science, which includes technical, natural and <span>social sciences,</span> is the ecology. <br>  From the foregoing, we can conclude that the natural sciences are characterized by many factors, the main of which are their direct relationship with nature, deep significance and interconnectedness. </p>
