    <h2>  Fraternal Sea, Golden Sands </h2><p>  Holidays in this place are gaining more and more popularity.  It is worth noting that the name ‚ÄúGolden Sands‚Äù is popular.  This is not a sanatorium.  This is a beach located on the banks of the <span>Bratsk reservoir</span> in the Nukutsky district of the Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug.  Not so long ago, the 35th anniversary was celebrated here.  In fact, the Nukutsky region has several birthdays.  It was formed for the first time in 1938, in January.  A decree of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was issued, according to which part of the Alarsky became the Nukut aymak.  But in 1962, this area was liquidated.  After 10 years, the administrative division was returned.  As a result of this, the Nukutsky district arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Road to the beach </h2><p>  From Irkutsk you can reach the beach in several ways: through Kutulik or through Nukuti.  How far are the Golden Sands.  <span>The</span> fraternal <span>sea</span> from Nukut is located about 350 kilometers.  This road is much better.  When choosing a route, it should be borne in mind that this particular path is 50 kilometers longer.  After the Nukut, there is a good gravel road.  Promotion on it is not difficult. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden sands on the fraternal sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1172624.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for the road through Kutulik, its coverage leaves much to be desired.  The path between this settlement and Hadahan is practically impassable.  There was once an asphalt road.  Little is left of her.  The whole road is covered with deep potholes, pits and peaks.  If you feel sorry for the suspension, then it is better to go along the first route. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  So, you decide to visit the Golden Sands.  The fraternal sea is not so close for someone.  To get to the beach, you need to go to the Moscow highway and move to Zalare.  In the place where the sign "Balagansk - Novonukutsk" is installed, you need to collapse.  After several kilometers, the road diverges.  Turn right here. </p><p>  Novonukutsk is the last large-scale settlement on the way to the beach.  It is worth noting that in a local cafe you can try real Buryat poses.  Of course, do not forget about the vehicle.  It should be refueled.  There are no gas stations in the villages.  This should be considered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before reaching Hadahan you need to turn left.  Here is a field road made of gravel.  Melkhitui is the last settlement, and then - ‚ÄúGolden Sands‚Äù.  The fraternal sea can be seen after about a kilometer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="fraternal sea golden sands vacation" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1172623.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  On the beach </h2><p>  It is worth considering that entry to the beach is paid.  The cost is 100 rubles.  At the same time, the time spent on the beach does not affect the price.  Immediately there is a strip of birch forest.  It is here that many tourists set up their tents.  And beyond the forest - Golden Sands.  The fraternal sea meets everyone with warm water and a shallow shore. </p><p>  The sand on the beach is shallow and yellow.  The bottom of the reservoir, like the <span>shore, is shallow.</span>  The main advantage of this place is that the water warms up well and quickly.  But lovers of diving this place will not like it.  Deep places begin far from the coast. </p><p>  There is no garbage here, as everyone who drives to the beach is given special bags.  After they can be put on the road.  Filled bags are collected by special machines and transported.  As for the toilets, here they are wooden.  If there is no own tent, then if necessary it can be rented.  For this, a special fenced "place of increased comfort" was created.  The tents are strong and reliable. </p>
