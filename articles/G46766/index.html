  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The basis of ancient technology: how to make modules for origami.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Origami is a hobby that is gaining more and more popularity both in Russia and in Europe.  The reason for this is the unprecedented beauty of the resulting crafts, bright, colorful and unusual.  Origami can be described as a hobby, and as a medical and rehabilitation program for those who need to restore hand motility, and as a pleasant pastime for all family members on long winter evenings. </p><p>  Origami's homeland is China, although art has flourished in Japan.  Today, it‚Äôs considered good practice to be able to fold figures from a sheet of paper, and in Japan even preschoolers can do this perfectly.  Of course, traveling around the world, origami has changed: today you can find figures on the Internet that are completely unusual for the culture of the East. </p><p>  There are 4 origami techniques in total: the simple is what we knew how to do in childhood: <span>paper</span> caps <span>, boats</span> , etc .;  modular - more on that later;  kusudama - creating crafts in the form of a ball from various modules;  wet origami - a recent discovery that allows you to give crafts expressiveness and smoothness of lines. </p><p>  The second type of origami is the most common and most universal.  Its basis is the origami module: a triangle that can be connected with the help of grooves to other triangles of the same kind.  The connection method will immediately become clear as soon as the first module is in the hands of the wizard.  But here's how to make origami modules - that's the question!  Nothing complicated when the technique has already been worked out, but creating your first module is quite difficult.  The search engine gives a lot of links for the query "how to make modules for origami", but the scheme is the same everywhere - and you can figure out the "teapot" only after seeing the video tutorial "How to make triangular origami modules".  There are several points that I will try to clarify now. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first one.  The blank for the modules should be rectangular and always in the same proportion.  The standard A4 sheet is best suited for creating the right blank (of course, if you have not purchased a special kit for creating origami - but then the diagrams are attached to it, so questions usually don't arise).  So, the sheet can be cut with a sharp knife into 2, four, 8, 16 or 32 parts.  Each size serves its purpose - for example, when creating origami ‚ÄúFestive Cake‚Äù modules of four sizes are needed.  The standard module is one sixteenth of the sheet.  This is a size that allows both material to be spent economically and products to be obtained in normal dimensions. </p><p>  We turn to the technique of how to make modules for origami.  We fold the workpiece along, then immediately across and deploy it.  The resulting long rectangle indicates the middle of the fold line.  Now bend to it on both sides of the edge so that a triangle is obtained.  Since the rectangle was long, two strips on each side will remain below the triangle.  We bend them to a triangle, we also bend the edges in small triangles.  The result was a detailed triangle of a neat appearance.  It remains only to fold it in half with a flat side out.  Now you can see the pockets into which you can insert other such modules. </p><p>  There is only one detail left that is essential for answering the question of how to make origami modules.  This is a selection of paper.  The density of the same standard A4 sheet is best.  To get bright toys, you can use any colored paper, but it is better to give preference to dense grades.  There are suggestions to make toys from stickers.  You can simply paint the white sheet in the color you need.  Experienced craftsmen claim that the flowers are especially delicate if made from paper napkins.  There are crafts made from newspapers and even ... from dollars!  In general, there would be paper - but we should not hold fantasies!  Have pleasant minutes of creativity! </p>
