    <p>  Chalet "Rook" (Samara) is located on the right bank of the Volga, near Pervomaisky Spusk.  Tourists are offered two-story and three-story cottages for 4 and 8 places, respectively, a hotel and residential complexes, where you can buy rooms at relatively inexpensive prices.  All the proposed premises are equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay: there are TVs, upholstered furniture, refrigerators, equipped bathrooms, etc. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, one of the important advantages of Rook is that children under 5 years old can stay for free if they do not need a berth.  The second positive nuance: vacationers are offered a large number of different entertainments: baths, a sports ground, a zoo, sports equipment rental.  Children can relax in the creativity room with animators. </p><p>  The cost of living here is slightly higher than at other recreational facilities, in addition, it changes almost every month.

You can get to the base using water transport from the Kinap marina or by car. </p><h2>  "Lighthouse" </h2>

    <p>  Those who seek solitude and want to forget about the bustle of the city should think about visiting camp sites in Samara and the Samara region.  One of them is the Park Hotel.  The facility is located 120 kilometers from the regional capital and territorially already belongs to the city of Togliatti.

The cost of living in a hotel ranges from 2000 to 6000 rubles per day.  You can get here from the bus station in Togliatti by bus and trolley. </p><h2>  "Russia" </h2><p>  It is also worth considering the Samara camp site on the Volga, among which stands out "Russia", located opposite the Studenny ravine in the national park "Samarskaya Luka".  Here holidaymakers are offered a choice of cottages for 6 and 16 people, as well as summer houses for 2, 4 and 6 people. </p><p>  The key difference between this base and the others is that you can‚Äôt go here for a day or two, the minimum stay is a week.  The cost of the permit varies depending on the time of year.  The most requested months are July and August.  At this time, the price of rest ranges from 700 to 1200 rubles per day, the daily rent of a house for 6 or 16 people is 5500 and 15000 rubles, respectively, meals are paid separately. </p><h2>  "Upper Forest" </h2>

    <p>  The beauty of these places and the fresh river air - this is what makes tourists carefully choose camp sites on the Volga.  Samara and its remoteness from noisy vacation spots here also play a big role.  Near the city is the base "Upper Bor", designed for 71 vacationers.  It is here that lovers of extreme relaxation often go, since here you can ride all-terrain vehicles in the vicinity. </p><p>  Athletes will also feel comfortable here, as they are invited to spend their free time in the gym, play a game of badminton or billiards, and also play tennis.  The cost of living ranges from 1,500 to 9,000 thousand rubles, however, as evidenced by the reviews, the prices are worth it.  The base is located only 40 kilometers from Samara, you can get there by electric train, you will only need to get to the station "Mastryukovo". </p><h2>  "Aviator" </h2><p>  If we look at Samara camp sites on the banks of the Volga, we can come across Aviator, a place for rest, located near the village of Volzhsky.  Near the sandy beach are wooden log cabins and guest houses.  Many tourists come here because of the relatively inexpensive prices and the opportunity to admire the tranquility of the Volga - in this place the water almost always behaves calmly. </p><p>  It offers vacationers rental of household and water equipment, as well as sports equipment.  Accommodation prices here are based on the fact that the houses are booked by entire companies.  The reservation for one room costs from 10 to 15 thousand rubles per day, while for each additional place you will have to pay another 500 rubles. </p><h2>  "Spark" </h2>

    <p>  If you do not want to relax in the city, it is best to go to campsites on the Volga: Samara is literally surrounded by similar institutions.  One of these is the Iskra, built near the village of Podgora on the river bank.  The base is located in the Samara Luka National Park and has its own sandy beach. </p><p>  Here you can rent a summer house of various capacities and categories ("A", "B" and "C").  The base is mainly focused on water recreation, so there is a lot of relevant infrastructure: boats, catamarans, kayaks, bananas, etc. The prices for daily living here range from 500 to 1100 rubles at the peak season (June-August) , in the remaining months, prices are slightly lower.  Meals are not included in the price and amounts to 580 rubles per day. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Samara hostels, reviews of which are mostly positive, are very popular among the local population.  Most often, city dwellers go on holiday to Sosenki, Rook, Mayak and Verkhny Bor, and each time they are satisfied with a high culture of service, quality service and constantly updated infrastructure. </p><p>  Some guests of camp sites located far from Samara note a lack of staff, which negatively affects the overall quality of service.  On the territory of bases built far from major highways, the administrator can perform the functions of a maid and a porter, which, according to the guests, is not entirely correct. </p><h2>  As it was before? </h2>

    <p>  Earlier in the region there were more recreational facilities.  Especially popular was the Bereg camp site (Samara), with dedicated buses going there twice a day.  Unfortunately, in the late 1990s it ceased to be in demand, and therefore it was closed. </p><p>  In total, about three dozen bases that previously existed in the region were closed.  The reasons for this were very different: undeveloped infrastructure, remoteness from settlements, poor service.  Some properties were purchased by the new owners and began to generate revenue again after repair and re-equipment. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Samara camps are mostly open year-round, but there are those that close for the winter.  Before planning a vacation, it is best to clarify the working hours of the base, the cost and living conditions, since these parameters can change periodically.  Also, be sure to specify what conditions are offered for children if you plan to relax with the whole family. </p><p>  Reviews say that it is best to go on vacation in early June, as it is at this time of year that tourist centers offer a large number of discounts and last-minute packages that you can take advantage of.  However, if you didn‚Äôt succeed, you should not be upset, because even at the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù time of the year you can easily choose the cheapest one from a large number of bases and save a tidy sum. </p>
