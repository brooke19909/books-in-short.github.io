  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a paper cone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No one knows for certain who first came up with how to make a paper cone.  But the fact that he made a real discovery is a fact!  It seems to be such a simple matter: just grab the right upper corner of the rectangular sheet with the thumb and forefinger of your right hand, make an angle on top of it and wrap it with your other hand, grabbing the upper left corner of the sheet with it.  The tip obtained as a result of this action is rolled up several times, fixing the ‚Äúbag‚Äù. </p><p>  It all takes even less than a minute!  But how widespread is the use of paper cone in everyday life!  Firstly, paper bags are an indispensable way of packing small products: seeds, seeds, sweets, nuts.  And until the time that the plastic bag was invented, in stores all the products that were sold by weight were packed exclusively in such bags: sugar, peas, pasta, and cereal.  Only the sizes of these packages varied. </p><p>  In the last century, one who did not know how to make a cone out of paper would have been looked at least with surprise, to say the least.  With the help of such a paper bag with a cut off in the most bizarre way, the housewives used to decorate the culinary products.  The cream was laid in a cone made of <span>waxed paper</span> and by extruding it, they "drew" patterns on cakes and pastries, and sauces - on dishes with cold snacks. </p><p>  And who doesn‚Äôt know how to make a liquid filter with a cone from toilet or <span>blotting paper</span> ?  Or an elementary disposable funnel from plain paper?  By the way, gardeners and gardeners use the miniature "funnel" method for planting small seeds in the garden so that the crops are more uniform and not very thickened. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On elective courses in physics, children were shown experience on how to warm water in a paper cone.  After all, it can happen that suddenly someone turns out to be unexpectedly in a place divorced from civilization!  And of the things he has only one lighter and a sheet of paper.  And if this one of the physics lessons knows that the thermal conductivity of the paper is great and therefore, until the water in the bag boils, the newspaper does not burn even in the surprising case when tongues of fire lick it from all sides.  Great, isn't it?  But you can use this discovery only if a lost person knows how to make a paper cone. </p><p>  A primitive bag or the so-called paper cone can turn into a traveling disposable washbasin.  You simply roll up the sheet, fix it so that it does not unfold, make a small hole - you can even not at the very tip, but from the side, hang it on a branch and pour water into it.  Under a thin stream it is quite possible to put yourself in order. </p><p>  Of course, if there is a body of water in the vicinity, an adult can wash directly in it.  But in cases where it is difficult to get to the water, for example, the place is rather swampy, or a young child is in the group, then the skill of how to make a paper cone, which easily turns into a wash basin, can help everyone out. </p><p>  And what else can you do in a minute with a paper sheet and the ability to fold it into a bag?  Please: a disposable cup - one, a shout - two, a lampshade on a lamp - three, a primitive <span>sound amplifier,</span> that is, a ‚Äúhearing aid‚Äù - four.  And if time is not very running out and you just want to fantasize, then the use of a paper cone in decorating a room, decorating a table and making details of fancy dress is presented in the widest possible way. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Indeed, a clown hat is nothing more than a fancifully decorated cone of a certain diameter of the entrance.  But Pinocchio's nose is a thin and long paper cone with an elastic band.  However, for convenience, the cone for the cap or nose is made not from a rectangular sheet, but from part of the paper circle.  For a cap, you need a circle with a segment cut out of it, and for the nose, on the contrary, a small segment of the circle. </p><p>  But the masterpiece of the creative use of the paper cone is the corrugated collar of the prince or Pierrot, assembled from many elongated cones of thin wrapping paper.  These snow-white or gentle pastel tones cones with a bell having a diameter of 3 cm or less are strung on a thread drawn across the section at the thin end of the cone.  The resulting "beads" are wrapped around the gate in several layers and thus fixed.  You can put fabric circles on top and bottom of this corrugated collar - so it looks richer and more natural.  The more cones and the thinner their bell - the more chic this piece of fancy dress looks. </p><p>  So, we conclude: if you know how to make a cone, then you will not disappear in a difficult situation, nor in a masquerade will you be left without the most original costume.  By the way, the opening of the cone is universally used by inventors in many objects that surround us: flashlights and headlights, heat reflectors, megaphones and horns, various sockets for filling.  Yes, just look around with an interested picky look! </p>
