    <p>  Within the framework of the company Oxnardts, reviews about which you can meet both positive and negative, and it is very problematic to decide which ones are true and which are not, trading is practiced with the support of specialists.  The manager, which is allocated for each individual client, gives instructions in terms of opening and closing deals.  In theory, <span>this trend</span> can make a decent profit, but is this the case with Oxnardts?  Reviews are divided into two categories: some talk about the average return on the account in the amount of 40-50% for a week, while others talk about a complete drain of the deposit. </p><h2>  What stories do company customers tell? </h2><p>  By studying the activities of Oxnardts, reviews can be found with descriptions of identical, far from favorable situations.  It all starts with the fact that company managers call their customers, who offer their help in trading for a commission within 5-7% of the profit.  Initially, a request is made to replenish an account in the amount of $ <span>100</span> to test the professionalism of the latter.  To encourage cooperation, full deposit insurance is often offered, which reduces the risk of losing money to almost zero (there is always the possibility of cooperation with scammers).  After the client replenishes the account, on the first day he receives a profit in the amount of 15 to 25 dollars.  The following is an urgent recommendation to put an amount of $ 1,000 or more, which the company's customers are willing to do.  As a result, the deposit merges into zero, and there can be no talk of any further cooperation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  An attempt by an experienced trader to withdraw money </h2>

    <p>  One experienced trader, seduced by the offer of <span>the project manager</span> Oxnardts.com, reviews about which he did not bother to look for himself in connection with the minimal risks and profitability of the offer, faced an interesting situation.  After the first successful transaction, which is practiced with all customers of the company, a template proposal was received to replenish the account by at least $ 1,000.  $ 1,200 was deposited into the account.  As a result, the client was offered a deal with a risk of 25%, which is a severe violation of even the most aggressive money management.  This is what alerted the trader.  As a result, the planned deal, which, fortunately, was never opened, went into minus.  After clarifying the situation and several more open unprofitable positions, it was decided to withdraw money, but it was not so simple. </p>

    <h2>  Complex withdrawal scheme </h2><p>  The cash payment scheme, which was a continuation of the story with the deal, the risk of which was 25 percent, was a worthy conclusion to the story.  According to the trader, the procedure was not only delayed for a rather long time, it was also accompanied by rather impressive commissions.  $ 50 was withdrawn from the account to pay the commission for the "SWIFT" transfer and closure of the trading cabinet.  Also, 2% was taken away from the deposit, which allegedly appeared as payment for services for the withdrawal of funds.  As a result, most of the funds were saved, but now the trader Oxnardts broker does not recommend anyone.  Similar stories are described from review to review, but the end of each of them is far from successful. </p><h2>  Claims to customers, or What say bidders who managed to earn? </h2>

    <p>  The Oxnardts.com project, which is a commonplace for complaints and reviews, is widely known as a highly dubious office.  Traders who simply decided to test the <span>quality of the</span> company's <span>services</span> and did not use the help of managers have very interesting experience in withdrawing funds.  People say that the first conflicts with a company begin when, after successful trading, attempts are made to withdraw funds.  So, one of the participants of the www.oxnardts.com project left feedback about the problems that he had to face when filling out an application for withdrawal of funds.  The manager found a huge number of reasons, according to which the withdrawal of money was simply impossible.  Sounded even the most banal words that trading with robots is prohibited.  The outcome of the events was successful.  The funds were sent not to a <span>bank account,</span> as it should be according to the rules of the company, but to the WebMoney wallet. </p><h2>  Full kitchen and only </h2>

    <p>  Many traders are looking for the answer to a very interesting question about how to invest and not lose.  Feedback (Oxnardts) can be met as pushing for a partnership, and radically turning away from it.  Now we will talk about how people lost with the company.  There is a fairly large percentage of customers who have completely lowered their deposits or simply could not withdraw them after successful trading.  People write about the loss of such amounts as 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000 and even 15 thousand dollars.  There is even information that if a client of a company initially enters a sufficiently large amount of funds, communication with him is completely lost, and all contacts cease to respond sharply.  Whether this is true or anti-advertising, everyone will have to judge for themselves before deciding on a partnership. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Reviews, comments help to make an impression about the broker Oxnardts.  A review from experienced trading participants forms a more or less rational perception.  We can definitely say that the company, in essence, is very controversial.  Beautiful advertising and a professional website are opposed to persistent calls from managers and far from ideal documents for the right to work in the field of financial services.  In contrast, customer reviews differ.  Some comments tell success stories, while others describe the illegal actions of the company with the loss of the entire deposit for the trader.  Information inconsistency interferes with the rational assessment of Oxnardts, and a decision on a possible partnership will have to be made, guided only by its proven arguments and information that can also be found and analyzed independently.  All responsibility for the decision will be assigned only to the person who made the decision on partnership.  It is worth remembering that there is no easy money in trading in financial markets. </p>
