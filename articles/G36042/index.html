    <h2>  Dynamic shooting in extreme conditions </h2><p>  The Blackmagic Micro camera is one of the most compact cameras, suitable for attaching to quadrocopters and covert filming of a reality show.  You can install it on a helmet, a radio-controlled helicopter, a hang glider, a skateboard and other devices, receiving unforgettable and original shots. </p><h2>  Remote control </h2><p>  The remote control function, which is one of the characteristics of Blackmagic cameras, allows you to shoot at a long distance, which is convenient when placing the camera on cars or radio-controlled helicopters and in dangerous places.  Camera functions such as aperture and sharpness adjustment, recording and its stop are configured using a special remote control.  Remote monitoring of the status, sound level and battery charge is carried out by connecting to wireless signal transmitters via a composite output. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Original and universal design </h2><p>  Blackmagic Design cameras are compact in size and have expansion ports that create customized solutions for remote monitoring and control.  In terms of size, the camera is slightly inferior to the company's mounts, which makes it the most compact and miniature in the entire line of electronics.  The case of the Micro Cinema camera, like that of the similar Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera, is made of lightweight and strong magnesium alloy, thanks to it, shooting can be carried out in absolutely any conditions.  On the front panel are the keys through which the camera is controlled.  You can control the shooting process remotely. </p>

    <h2>  Super 16 Digital Motion Picture </h2><p>  The Super 16 sensor mounted on the Blackmagic Micro camera allows you to shoot with an extension of 1080 HD with a dynamic range of thirteen steps.  The result is a cinematic-quality image that is different from action movies and DSLR cameras: there are no exposure defects, and there are a lot of details in the shadow and light areas.  Superb image quality can be obtained even in poor lighting conditions using ISO values ‚Äã‚Äãbelow 1600. </p><h2>  Integrated ProRes and RAW Recorder </h2><p>  Blackmagic cameras have a built-in recorder that allows you to record a 12-bit image without interference and distortion, which are often found in files of amateur action and DSLR cameras.  Micro Cinema supports ProRes and DNG RAW: 12-bit files contain all the necessary data received from the camera‚Äôs matrix, so that you can adjust the exposure and white balance even after shooting.  ProRes allows you to get small files with increased recording time.  Materials in both formats are immediately ready for color grading and editing, as the camera kit includes DaVinci Resolve for Windows and Mac. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Camera Compatibility with Professional Lenses </h2><p>  An active Micro Four Thirds mount is built into the Blackmagic camera, thanks to which it is possible to install professional optics for television, photo and film shooting, depending on specific requirements.  Aperture, focus and zoom are remotely controlled remotely via an expansion port.  Stable shooting under dynamic conditions is made thanks to MFT lenses that support image stabilization. </p>

    <h2>  Convenient management </h2><p>  There are buttons on the front panel of the camera, thanks to which you can quickly adjust the settings depending on what conditions are put forward for a particular shoot.  All settings can be displayed via composite or HDMI input.  Micro Cinema Camera is equipped with several keys: fast forward and rewind, start and stop recording.  LED type status indicator shows battery level, recording status and memory card full. </p><h2>  Professional sound </h2><p>  The Micro Cinema camera has an omnidirectional stereo microphone that reduces noise interference, which guarantees high-quality sound recording.  Wireless and <span>directional microphones</span> and line signal devices are connected via a 3.5 mm jack.  The internal microphone of the camera is muted when audio is input from an external device. </p><h2>  Powered by external power </h2><p>  An LP-E6 battery is installed on the rear panel of the camera, which is used when working in remote mode.  When outputting images via PAL / NTSC or HDMI outputs, the battery level is displayed, so this parameter can be adjusted remotely.  The LED indicator indicates the need for charging, and you can connect the camera to external power sources using an adapter cable with a 12 V input. </p><h2>  Ultra-compact Studio Camera </h2><p>  Blackmagic Studio Camera is a modern model of a broadcast camera designed for shooting live.  Its body is made of magnesium alloy characterized by the strength and lightness.  The model has a viewfinder with a diagonal of 10 inches, phantom power and connectors for connecting microphones.  The installed optical module makes it possible to connect to the video mixer through a single cable, which expands the functionality of the camera, opening up access to two-way communication, SDI-interface and status indicators. </p>

    <h2>  HD and Ultra HD Resolution </h2><p>  Video materials in 4K and Ultra HD resolution are now available to all Internet users on specialized resources.  Image resolution in Ultra HD is 3840x2160 pixels, which is four times higher than 1080 HD.  Data transmission at maximum speed is provided only by the Blackmagic 4K camera for correct recording of the broadcast program. </p><h2>  Micro four thirds </h2><p>  The Micro Four Thirds mount in Studio Camera allows you to connect a wide range of adapters and lenses.  Working in stationary conditions or on small projects may require photo optics, and large-scale live broadcasts may require professional lenses.  Installation of any necessary lenses is possible thanks to third-party adapters along with the PL mount, so the camera can record and broadcast the most ambitious events. </p><h2>  10-inch Full HD viewfinder </h2><p>  Studio Camera is equipped with a large viewfinder - a massive ten-inch display with the highest resolution, which ensures a wide viewing angle and high image detail.  You can reflect focus marks, view the reverse video signal, and change camera settings.  The liquid crystal display has a long life and pleases users with high-quality images even in bright conditions. </p><h2>  Data transfer via optical interface </h2><p>  The optical module, which provides the ability to connect the camera to the on-air video mixers via one thin cable, can be installed on the Blackmagic Studio Camera.  The interface simultaneously processes Ultra HD and HD video with integrated sound, indication signals, remote control and two-way communication.  The standard fiber optic connection allows you to transfer images from cameras located at large distances from the studio. </p><h2>  Work indication </h2><p>  The camera monitors the status indication used by the ATEM live switchers.  The signal along with the image is transmitted to the Blackmagic Studio Camera from all ATEM video outputs.  The indication is turned on automatically by outputting the image from the camera to the air and saved when combining signals from different cameras.  On the front panel there are light indicators that allow you to determine which particular camera is broadcasting video on the air. </p><h2>  Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera 4K </h2><p>  This compact studio camera is designed for live production.  It provides work with Ultra HD and HD-formats, is equipped with an MFT mount and is controlled via SDI-interface using a video mixer.  Other functions are also provided - a built-in backup battery and microphones, support for displaying status and two-way communication, color correction tools, outputs for setting B4 lenses and a panoramic head.  No similar camera has such a wide functionality. </p>

    <h2>  Multi-camera broadcasts </h2><p>  Its compact size and versatility make it ideal for live broadcasts.  It is almost invisible and can be installed anywhere, so when creating programs you can get video from various angles.  The Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera can be placed on stage during events, on aircraft for panoramic shooting of large-scale events, or can be used in conjunction with professional lenses for studio work. </p><h2>  Original design </h2><p>  In the review of the Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera 4K camera, its design is worth mentioning separately: the case is made of high-strength magnesium alloy, and its dimensions do not exceed the dimensions of the bayonet mount.  Using the latter, you can mount lenses with MFT mounts, and the B4 adapter allows the installation of classic broadcast optics.  From any ATEM switcher, the camera is controlled through a software SDI output, which allows you to remotely change parameter settings, focus and enlarge the image, adjust black level and gamma, color balance, and choose aperture values.  The control outputs for the B4 panoramic heads and lenses are contained in the expansion port, while all of the above functions can be used with just one cable. </p>
