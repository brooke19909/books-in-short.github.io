    <h2>  About city </h2><p>  Before talking about the hotel, it is necessary to devote a few words to the city itself.  It is located at the foot of the Horn of the Old Planina on the south side, in the famous Sunny Beach for many tourists.  Its history goes back to antiquity.  And the city received its name Sveti Vlas (or St. Vlas) in honor of the Slavic god Veles, the patron saint of trade.  It seems that this saint still helps residents.  So the city from year to year is becoming more popular.  Although the status of a seaside resort he received in 1963.  And one of his young services is the 3 * Hotel Sveti Vlas. </p><p>  Bulgaria (reviews about hospitality do not need confirmation) is famous not only for its picturesque nature and healing climate, but also for its rich historical heritage. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The settlement of St. Vlas was founded in the II century by the Thracians.  Today, there are no longer preserved ancient monuments of architecture.  However, not far from it is the town of Nessebar.  In it you can visit the Old Metropolitan Church dating back to the 5th century.  Its walls still keep the tradition that the church was erected on the ruins of the temple of Apollo.  Four centuries younger is the New Metropolitan Church of St.  Stefan.  The ancient structure captures the achievements of Bulgarian and Byzantine architecture.  We have survived the frescoes and carved iconostasis, the throne and the department of the bishop, preserved from the era of the Bulgarian Renaissance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sveti vlas hotel bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41269/1569447.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  You can also visit the Church of St.  Paraskevi and Christ Pantokratov.  Their base dates back to 13-14 centuries.  Both buildings have lavishly decorated facades using glazed ceramics and white stone.  All these sights can be visited on your own or take excursions that Sveti Vlas offers to its guests (hotel, Bulgaria).  Reviews about him are said to be one of the most attractive services in Sunny Beach. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The hotel with the same name of the city is a modern low-rise building in several buildings.  An elevator is provided for a comfortable lift.  The interior can be called restrained, but very sophisticated, made in a marine style.

However, a walk to the sea may not seem boring.  She is brightened up by the original assortment of shops and shops that are rich in Sveti Vlas, Bulgaria.  Guest reviews, however, point out other advantages of this resort.  For example, a modern amphitheater or marina of Marina Dinevi.  The last structure is quite impressive in size and holds about 300 yachts.

Hotel Sveti Vlas 3 * (Bulgaria) reviews characterize as one of the most convenient and worthy services of Sunny Beach.  In addition, the hotel is located in a quiet area with picturesque and well-groomed adjacent territory. </li><li>  In second place was the cleanliness of the territory and hotel rooms.

    <ul><li>  The next advantage is the kitchen of the Sveti Vlas hotel (Bulgaria).  Reviews note a variety of menus and quality service.  If you wish, you can arrange a romantic dinner on the balcony-terrace in the room.  The restaurant staff will help with serving and meals. </li><li>  And, finally, Russian tourists liked the picturesque view of the green reliefs and the sea from the rooms of the Sveti Vlas Hotel (Bulgaria).  Reviews Dinevi Marina are noted as a particularly attractive place to relax.  Walking along the waves of the Black Sea, fresh air, modern technology and the friendly sun have turned it into a local attraction. </li></ul><h2>  Minuses </h2><p>  Despite the high quality of service, Russian tourists still found a couple of shortcomings: </p><ul><li>  The hotel, as mentioned, is located in a quiet area, and therefore there are no noisy entertainments like open discos and clubs.  Rest in the hotel "Sveti Vlas" (Bulgaria) reviews of tourists relate to the family, complete harmony and comfort.  And for young people, the choice of this service is unlikely to become permanent. </li><li>  The lack of equipped beach is also saddening.  Sun loungers, umbrellas and private shops with drinks are all that can be found on it.  The rest of the entertainment is provided by the yacht club. </li></ul>
