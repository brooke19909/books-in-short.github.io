The cost of an additional cleaning service is 500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xn--b1aah2akabnfdl1j.xn--p1ai" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pool in the sauna." class="if uuid-3129328" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/3129328.jpg"></div><h2>  Stocks </h2><p>  Guests receive discounts on the following conditions: </p><ul><li>  The action "The 5th hour as a gift!"

Everything is very neat here - sofas, floor, walls, pool, etc. </p><p>  The second huge plus is the presence of a deep, clean pool, with clear glass, a geyser, a waterfall.  Many are pleased that the water in the pool is moderately chlorinated. </p><p>  The third and most important advantage of the sauna, according to visitors, is the steam room - Turkish and Finnish.  Staying in them, according to reviews, gives many guests a lot of pleasure.  The Finnish sauna is very small, but, according to visitors, it is already pleasant that it is.  The girls at the reception can get the necessary dishes: forks, plates, corkscrew, glasses, etc. </p><p>  Often, guests indicate the shortcomings of the institution, which include: </p><ul><li>  The presence in the rooms of only one shower room is not enough for six to eight guests. </li><li>  The depth level of the pool is even and too deep - you won‚Äôt be able to sit and relax in it, you can only "hang", clinging to something. </li><li>  The pool is too cool. </li><li>  There is no kettle or cooler in the rooms.  A kettle with boiling water is available at the reception.  And to drink tea, you need to worry about this - leave the room and contact the administrators. </li><li>  The minus customers also call the inconvenient location of outlets. </li></ul><p>  And yet, according to the guests, ‚ÄúSeven Islands‚Äù wins in many respects in comparison with other similar institutions.  According to customers, the main advantage of the sauna is adequate prices.  Facility confidently recommend visiting friends. </p>
