    <h2>  Market positioning </h2><p>  The world market is not so rich in unique products that do not have a specialized niche that determines the purpose of the goods.  GoPro Hero 4 Black Edition is considered a universal device that is designed to record video in any environment.  There are no restrictions: shooting under water, in frost and heat, in <span>quicksand</span> or in outer space.  In any case, the device will fulfill its task. </p><p>  But such an extensive functionality has the other side of the coin - high cost.  The retail price of an action camera ranges from 30-35 thousand rubles, which causes the dissatisfaction of many potential buyers.  However, as practice shows, there is no other way out, because this is the only gadget in the world that can shoot video material in extreme conditions, so it‚Äôs better to put up with the cost. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Full set </h2><p>  No matter what kind of sport a potential buyer is involved in, before purchasing GoPro Hero 4 Black he does not need to worry, because the manufacturer has provided all the needs of users and provided his product with decent equipment.  For shooting under water and in conditions of high humidity, the owner will find a waterproof case in the kit that can cope with pressure at a depth of 40 meters.  The box also has a skeleton cover for the case, however, its installation violates the tightness of the structure and, judging by the reviews of professionals, reduces the practicality of the action camera. </p>

    <p>  Customers will also like the gadget mount system.  In the process of testing, it was not possible to find an item on which it is impossible to attach GoPro Hero 4. The instruction in Russian, which is included in the kit, will appeal to all residents of the CIS countries, because all users will have to understand the controls before starting operation. </p><h2>  When it comes to absolute quality </h2><p>  Rich equipment, an attractive box and multifunctionality have always been the hallmark of Chinese companies, positioning their low-cost products at global online auctions.  Therefore, it is not surprising that many enthusiasts in their reviews begin to compare an expensive gadget with consumer goods, because in the world market it is not customary to provide multimedia devices with decent equipment.  However, the opinion about the product changes with its detailed study. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The GoPro Hero 4 action camera has no flaws.  If we are talking about the body - then it is made of very high quality plastic.  No gaps and uneven joints can be detected.  The interface cables do not hang when connected, and the mount has a very convenient and rigid fixation.  All components are perfectly matched to each other, and it is impossible to find fault with them. </p><h2>  Strange box </h2><p>  The first thing that the gadget owner draws his attention to is the size of the device and ease of use.  The GoPro Hero 4 miniature camera is very compact and weighs only 80 grams.  However, many users are confused by the huge size of the button and the strange lens that does not hide in the case after turning off the power.  Everything is explained quite simply - large buttons are convenient to press if the camera is placed in a protective case.  And the stillness of the lens allowed to reduce the size of the device. </p><p>  No less strange, the action camera looks complete with all the mounts, in a protective case.  But as they say, they only meet on clothes.  Millions of people in the world prefer the functionality of this device, rather than the external beauty.  Therefore, professionals recommend that beginners come to terms with the strange look of the camera and get to know more about management and operation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Work autonomy above all </h2><p>  The huge lithium-ion battery not only claims half the total weight of the GoPro Hero 4 Black Edition camera, but also occupies almost the entire space inside the gadget.  The manufacturer provided the device with a very powerful battery with a capacity of 1160 mAh.  The action camera consumes a little - 4.4 watts per hour, but the battery life directly depends on the quality of shooting and the operation of wireless interfaces.  For example, when you turn off the LCD screen and the WiFi module, you can continuously shoot 3 hours of video at 720p resolution with a frame rate of 120 FPS.  Upgrading to 4K even with a lower frame rate (up to 30 FPS) will reduce the GoPro Hero 4's battery life by three. </p>

    <p>  As for the battery pack, the installation and removal of the battery is in full order.  A standard unit with a reliable latch is used, as in conventional digital cameras.  The battery compartment is located below, and its accidental opening is completely excluded. </p><h2>  Interfaces &amp; Connectors </h2><p>  In the media there is a lot of negative feedback from users regarding the implementation of the interface panel by the manufacturer.  Firstly, the removable plug, under which the HDMI and USB ports are hidden, as well as the slot for installing memory cards, is puzzling.  The cover that covers the compartment is not attached to the device in any way, and there is no protective mechanism in its mount.  With frequent use of connectors, the plug wears out and is able to independently open during operation and, accordingly, get lost. </p>

    <p>  A step into the past was made by the manufacturer and the installation of the mini-USB interface.  Now the owner of the GoPro Hero 4 Black needs to always carry the appropriate cable with him (to reset data to a computer outside the house).  The same goes for the micro-HDMI port.  A rather strange approach to customers from a well-known American manufacturer. </p><h2>  Ease of use </h2><p>  The GoPro Hero 4 manual states that an action camera has a touch-sensitive LCD screen, and this is in doubt for many beginners.  However, after a detailed review, it is found that it is impossible to find fault with the quality of the display.  The sensitivity of the sensor is good, it reacts the same in different weather conditions, regardless of temperature, and this is pleasing, because many owners have already encountered problems with the inoperability of the touch display on smartphones in extreme cold. </p><p>  The GoPro Hero 4 miniature screen matrix demonstrates decent color reproduction.  A little confused by the brightness of the display, it is understated.  In their reviews, many experts claim that the picture can be made juicier in the settings, but this change will greatly increase battery consumption.  If we talk about the convenience of viewing the footage, then it simply does not exist.  The smallest details on the miniature display cannot be discerned.  The touch screen is convenient only for controlling an action camera. </p><h2>  Advertising is the engine of progress </h2><p>  Deceived customers can consider themselves users who wish to shoot at high resolution 4K (3840x2160).  The manufacturer, having launched the GoPro Hero 4 ad, missed one point - at the maximum resolution, the camera shoots at a frequency of 15 frames per second.  It is one thing if the camcorder performs static shooting, and a completely different situation with objects moving at high speed.  The result is disappointing: a slide show from which only high-quality photographs can be selected. </p>

    <p>  Professionals in their reviews recommend shooting video at FullHD resolution (1920x1080 dpi).  In this case, the matrix will read information at a speed of 60 frames per second, and this is enough to create high-quality video material or film.  It is completely unclear why the 480p mode is needed, which accelerates the matrix to 240 frames per second.  Four identical frames in a video (60x4) to reduce screen flicker - this is an obvious bust. </p><h2>  All about shooting quality </h2><p>  In the media there is a negative from some potential buyers regarding the lack of autofocus on the GoPro Hero 4 camera. Review and testing of the device, conducted by experts and enthusiasts in different parts of the world, have proved that the camcorder does not automatically focus in extreme conditions.  The lens is not capable of processing data even at a frequency of 15 frames per second.  The camera perfectly receives and processes data without autofocus. </p><p>  To improve the quality of shooting in the device provides several useful functions.  In low light conditions, you can turn on the Auto low light mode, however, the gadget owner should be prepared for the matrix sensitivity to be lower, which will affect the image quality when watching video at high resolution (analogue to ISO in cameras).  The ProTune mode, which is able to create a motion effect, has proven itself well. </p><h2>  Extreme Camera </h2><p>  When it comes to the quality of photos taken with the GoPro Hero 4 camera, user reviews are disappointing.  Like any other device for recording video (we are talking about webcams and other video cameras), the gadget did not work with the photo capabilities.  Fine manual adjustment allows you to change the device settings and force the 12-megapixel sensor to take a high-quality picture, but for this you need to securely lock the action camera, and the object of shooting should be a stationary object. </p>

    <p>  The serial shooting claimed by the manufacturer at 3 frames per second and the automatic matrix adjustment function for night mode do not cope with the tasks.  As a result of testing, not a single expert was able to get closer to the quality of images taken with conventional digital cameras, popularly referred to as ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù. </p><h2>  Software and Management </h2><p>  A rather strange decision of the manufacturer is to equip your product with a wireless WiFi interface.  The GoPro Hero 4 Black camera can act as an access point and make connections with any mobile devices wirelessly.  And if the reader thinks that the manufacturer gave him a router, then he is mistaken, and this would be a great solution for many users. </p><p>  Convenience includes the possibility of connecting an action camera with a smartphone based on the Android OS.  There is special software that provides functionality for full control of not only the camera itself, but also the video recording process - a wireless control panel.  A rather interesting decision of the manufacturer in terms of program access to the hardware of the device: all the light indicators and sound devices are completely subordinate to the control from the smartphone.  A forgetful user will always find where the camera is hidden, you just need to make the speaker emit sound alerts from the phone. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  The GoPro Hero 4 camera will definitely appeal to all lovers of outdoor activities, because in fact nothing similar simply exists on the market.  As a device for shooting video, the device will fully satisfy even a demanding customer: a lot of modes, resolutions and quality management will allow the owner to create a full-fledged film, and not shoot amateur video.  The manufacturer approached the solution of convenience and safety perfectly - with an action camera you can play football under water, protection is 100 percent. </p><p>  There are also negative points, however, they relate more to the overestimated requirements of buyers who have not yet learned how to distinguish cameras from video cameras.  For lovers of high-quality photos, the GoPro Hero 4 will definitely not work.  The owner will have to take care of the reliability of fixing the plug on the interface panel, it is very easy to lose it, but it is impossible to purchase, since the manufacturer did not worry about this and did not provide the necessary component to retail. </p>
