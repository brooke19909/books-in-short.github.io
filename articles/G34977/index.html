Attractions to visit</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vacation is an infrequent event, so people try to plan it in advance.  Someone wants to spend it at sea, someone goes to the mountains.  Some people prefer traveling to Europe or Asia.  But what to do if you want to spend your vacation profitably, but there is no money for a trip abroad?  Then you should pay attention to the sights of Russia.  A great option would be Vereya - a small provincial town located in the <span>Moscow region.</span> </p><h2>  Vereya - the western gate of Moscow </h2><p>  Vereya, whose sights are connected with its history, was founded at the turn of the XIII-XIV centuries.  The history of the city has always been connected with Moscow.  Chronicles tell of the battles between Russians and Lithuanians near this settlement.  Subsequently, Vereya becomes a defensive point of the capital.  The pillars became a symbol of the city, and among the people he received the nickname "Western Moscow Gate." <br>  In the XVIII century, the city began to develop as a center of trade and crafts.  Here, leather, shoe and blacksmithing developed.  Fishermen wove a net of seine, which became known not only in Russia but also abroad. </p><p>  During the Patriotic War of 1812, Verea was captured by the French.  Here they built fortifications to protect the Smolensk tract, along which provisions were brought to the French.  But soon Napoleon and his army were forced to leave the city and, leaving him, Bonaparte ordered the troops to destroy it. </p><p>  Vereya was unable to recover from the plunder.  The remoteness from the railroads also played a role.  From a large shopping center, it turned into a small county province.  Currently, about 5 thousand people live here, so the city is considered the smallest not only in the Moscow region, but throughout Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to Vereya? </h2><p>  The city is located in the west 95 kilometers from Moscow.  You can‚Äôt get here directly by train.  The nearest train station is 25 kilometers from the city.  But you can get to Vereya by bus.  From Moscow, several long-distance flights go here at once.  You can also visit the village by car.  The journey here will take approximately 1.5-2 hours. </p><p>  What is the best way to plan your trip?  It should be borne in mind that Vereya is a small city, so all of its inspection can take about a day.  Most tourists come here in the morning, on the very first bus, and leave on the last flight on the same day.  Sunday is not the best choice for a trip.  Museums and shopping malls are closed on this day, so you won‚Äôt be able to visit them.  What are the sights of Vereya worth visiting in the first place? </p><h2>  Verey Churches </h2><p>  Ancient churches are what Vereya is famous for.  Attractions of this kind are the main reason for traveling here.  Most of the temples and cathedrals need restoration, but this is what attracts tourists.  Indeed, in Moscow and the Moscow region there are almost no such traditionally Russian landscapes. </p><p>  The oldest surviving church of Vereya is the Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ.  It was built in 1552 in honor of the capture of Kazan by the Russian troops.  According to legend, its construction began by decree of Ivan the Terrible.  Before the revolution, the remains of General I.S.  Dorokhov - the hero of World War II and the liberator of the city.  After the revolution, the cathedral was sacked by the Bolsheviks.  However, now it is actively being restored; church services are being held there. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

The Church of the Intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary was erected in the 19th century and is still working.

    <p>  The Church of the Epiphany of the Lord was built in the XVIII century on the site of an old wooden church.  It was built of white brick in the Baroque style on the donations of a local merchant.  Known for the icon of Admiral Ushakov.  Now the temple is almost completely restored, services are held here. </p>

    <h2>  Manor Bykovo </h2><p>  <span>Architectural monuments</span> are not only within the city of Vereya.  The sights, reviews of which are most widespread, are located a few kilometers from the village.  Here is the <span>estate of Bykovo,</span> which is known for its <span>Vladimir Church.</span>  <span>The temple</span> is a unique monument of pseudo-Gothic.  It was built in the XVIII century by order of <span>M.M.</span>  <span>Izmailov,</span> who at that time was the owner of the estate.  It differs from most churches in that it is made in the European, and not in the Russian style.  The manor itself is now abandoned, but the temple is working as usual. </p>

    <h2>  Monument to Dorokhov - the liberator of the city </h2><p>  However, churches and temples are only a small part of what the city of Vereya is famous for.  Attractions can be seen everywhere.  One of them is a monument to the liberator of the city during World War II - General I.S.  Dorokhov.  The monument was unveiled at the beginning of the 20th century in honor of the centenary of the country's liberation from the French.  After the outbreak of the Civil War, the monument was destroyed.  The remains of the general, stored in the city, were looted, and the bones themselves were thrown into the ravine of the Protva River.  At night, the residents of Vereya, risking their own lives, collected the remains and buried them.  At the site of the monument was a monument of Karl Marx, but it was also destroyed during the Great Patriotic War.  The sculpture of Dorokhov was restored only in the 50s of the XX century at the request of the residents of the city.  And after the collapse of the USSR, the remains of the general himself were found and reburied. </p><h2>  Museum of Local Lore Vereya </h2><p>  What museums can Vereya offer visitors?  The sights of these lands are not very diverse, but even in these conditions, the Museum of Local Lore of the city is always open for tourists.  It was founded recently, in 1996, but exhibitions are regularly held there.  The main exhibits are antique items: sewing machines, irons, gramophones, samovars, mirrors.  There is also an exposition dedicated to the Great Patriotic War. </p>

    <p>  The sights of Vereya and its outskirts are known for retaining their historical appearance.  Despite the proximity to the capital, the city was able to maintain a provincial lifestyle, which attracts tourists.  It is definitely worth visiting Vereya for those who want to feel the spirit of a traditional Russian village with its wooden houses and stately churches. </p>
