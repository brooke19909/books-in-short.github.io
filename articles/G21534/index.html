Translated from Thai "bo phut" (bo phut) means: "cadaveric lily."  This is the name of one of the largest flowers in the world - rafflesia.  This huge, pungent smelling flower once grew in these places, but with the advent of tourism the island disappeared. </p><p>  The beach, named after this strange plant, combines the activity of the partying Chaweng and Lamai and the tranquility of the quiet Bang Rak and Chongmon.  Here you can relax as lovers of romantic solitude in the shade of palm trees, so lovers of bright and noisy leisure time in luxury and club restaurants.  Both are abundantly represented in this part of the island.  To accommodate tourists on the beach, there are many hotels of various levels: from inexpensive guesthouses for backpackers to luxury five-star hotels that can satisfy the most demanding tourists.  One of the most popular options is the Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * hotel. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis samui bophut 3 reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2090645.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Getting to know the resort </h2><p>  When choosing a hotel here, you should remember that Bophut Beach is part of the administrative district of the same name, including a number of other beaches.  Often in booking sites you can find confusion in their description. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bophut beach itself has a length of about 3 km, the closest major supermarkets are Macro, BigC and TescoLotus.  Whichever of the hotels here was chosen, as the reviews assure - Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * or any other, in each of them the guests will find the opportunity to eat and relax. </p><p>  There are few entertainments nearby (i.e., within walking distance), but those who wish can easily get to Chaweng by tuk-tuk or moped.  The resort is recommended mainly for lovers of a relaxing holiday.  More active will have to make forays to Chaweng and other ‚Äúparty‚Äù places on the island. </p><p>  The advantages of the beach include: </p><ul><li>  the presence of a wide selection of hotels; </li><li>  the opportunity to live in the atmosphere of an authentic fishing village; </li><li>  few people; </li><li>  proximity to the airport; </li><li>  Great location in relation to Chaweng Beach. </li></ul><p>  The disadvantages are that here: </p><ul><li>  there is a lack of entertainment; </li><li>  the surface of the territory is covered with rather coarse sand; </li><li>  there is considerable depth near the shore, so the rest here is not suitable for families with small children. </li></ul><h2>  What is the hotel Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * (Bophut)? </h2><p>  The institution is positioned as an economy class hotel for leisure and business trips.  From the windows of the bright and stylish Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * (Bophut) a beautiful sea view opens.  Modern rooms with a balcony-terrace, guests have the opportunity to use free Wi-Fi, water, coffee and tea are offered.  The convenience of vacationers is provided by the availability of round-the-clock service, as well as the opportunity to receive food and drinks at any time of the day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * (Bophut) is located near the fishing village (on foot can be reached in 15 minutes) and from Chaweng beach (for 15 minutes can be reached by transport).  Guests enjoy relaxing here by the pool or in the bar, kayaking in the bay.  Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * (Bophut) is the only international hotel of this level in Bophut. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis samui bophut 3 reviews 2017" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2090654.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Ibis Samui Bophut Hotel 3 * is located, according to reviews, in a great place where vacationers can swim, sunbathe, engage in water sports and enjoy delicious dishes.  The institution is 6 km from Samui Airport, Chaweng Beach is 7 km from the hotel, and the coast of Bophut Beach is 100 meters from it.  At a distance of 500 m from the hotel is the city center, the pier is a 5-minute walk. </p><h2>  How do vacationers characterize this place? </h2><p>  Tourists who have left reviews about Ibis Samui Bophut 3 * (Samui) in the networks, call the area in which the institution is located quite fussy, lively, perfect for vacationers of various categories, with excellent conditions and for those who are looking for peace and quiet, and for those who like fun.  The area is densely built up, tourists share their opinions, the buildings are located along a road stretching from the roundabout.  The beach in different places has a different width: on the road it is very narrow, then it expands to a decent size.  Near the coast there are resorts and expensive villas, affordable housing for budget tourists can not be found here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But it is abundantly present in the depths of the island.  True, prices, even in budget options, are higher than in institutions of areas not so demanded by tourists.  Among them, the three-star Ibis is widely known among the guests of the resort. </p><p>  According to the authors of the reviews, many of our compatriots every Thursday go out to eat and relax in the nearby fishing village of Fisherman Village. </p><p>  Near the hotel, vacationers share, there are many cafes, 7/11 shops, bars, pharmacies, exchangers.  This is very convenient for those who are not inclined to walk - no need to go far. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis samui bophut 3 thailand bophut" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2090647.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Description </h2><p>  The comfortable, attractive buildings of the modern hotel are located on the idyllic coast of the famous beach, surrounded by lush tropical greenery. </p><p>  The institution belongs to the well-known hotel chain Ibis.

Shadows here, holidaymakers say, are not enough.  The sand strip is not too wide, but accommodates everyone to sit on it.  Usually there are few vacationers on the beach, mainly tourists prefer to relax in the sun loungers at the hotels.  There are practically no territories near the hotels located on the beach.  Despite the fact that the road runs close, it is always calm and quiet. </p><p>  Vacationers call the sea calm, not particularly transparent.  Near the shore, the bottom is rather shallow, 1.0-1.5 m from the shore, but if you go 1 meter deeper, silt begins there, and the bottom becomes slippery.  Depth builds up pretty quickly.  Boats and boats are parked in many places.  There are many cafes, shops and restaurants on site. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ibis samui bophut 3 samui" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2090641.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Guests are happy to recall the time spent at the hotel.  The institution is called at least small, but perfectly clean.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.  No one here has misunderstandings or conflicts.  As pluses, vacationers call the location of the hotel, clean territory, good breakfasts, comfortable rooms.  The minus is considered to be not very convenient entrance to the sea and insufficiently thought out organization of placing things in the rooms.  The place is recommended as a great option for relaxation. </p>
