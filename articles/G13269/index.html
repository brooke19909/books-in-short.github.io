More than 60 kilometers separate it from the capital of Turkey - the well-known Antalya.  The Taurus Mountains rise above Kemer.  The local microclimate differs significantly from the climate of the same Antalya, despite the proximity of these cities.  Precipitation (both in winter and summer) is less than in the Turkish capital.  In the summer it is quite hot and sunny, most of the year in Kemer there is excellent weather.  Tourists in Kemer are always waiting, they are welcome all year round.  From a wide variety of all kinds of hotels, my eyes run up.  These are private pensions and expensive five-star hotels.  If you are determined to visit Turkey, we suggest you stay in one of the best four-star hotels called Sultan Beach.  Kemer is pleased to welcome you! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sultan Beach Kemer" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15127/234591.jpg" width="550"></div>
