The region has a well-developed infrastructure, tropical climate and good beaches.  The resort welcomes guests throughout the year.  Let's see what is attractive for tourists resort Sanya in China? </p><h2>  A bit about the resort region </h2><p>  Sanya resort (China) is attractive for vacationers for many reasons.  All categories of tourists will like to relax here.  A rich underwater world, clear water - ideal conditions for diving.  A large selection of hotels allows you to choose accommodation to your liking.  Lush tropical vegetation creates stunning conditions for relaxation.  Sanya resort in China is a great place to relax for Russians.  Our compatriots are always welcome here.  In many places you can see signs with inscriptions in Russian. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.britannica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Resort Sanya China" class="if uuid-3142786" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142786.jpg"></div><p>  Sanya is a resort located on Hainan Island.  The population of the city is more than 600,000 people.  For China, this is a modest figure, but for the island it is quite decent.  The resort is convenient in that it has its own international airport.  Therefore, getting to the place of rest is not at all difficult.  The airport is called Sanya Phoenix.  It is located just 15 kilometers from the city.  This is very convenient, since the road to any hotel takes a few minutes.  But at the same time, airplanes will regularly fly over your head on vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The resort of Sanya (China), or rather the island of Hainan, is sometimes called "Eastern Hawaii", because they are located at the same latitude.  The island is washed by the waters of the South China Sea.  Here, more than 300 days a year, sunny and clear weather reigns, so the resort receives tourists year-round.  The main feature of the region is that it is the only place in China with a tropical climate.  The average air temperature in the resort throughout the year ranges from + 24 ... + 26 degrees.  The hottest months on the island are August and July.  The temperature during this period reaches +29 degrees.  The summer months are hot enough.  If you do not like high temperatures, it is better to choose another time to relax.  The golden period for a holiday in the resort of Sanya (China) is considered to be November-May.  With typhoons in the region, the island is an ideal place for windsurfing. </p><div class="photo" data-original="victortravelblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="China city Sanya" class="if uuid-3142791" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142791.jpg"></div><p>  When it is better to go to the resort of Sanya (China), it depends on your preferences and goals of relaxation. </p><h2>  Bays and beaches </h2><p>  The city of Sanya in China is the country's main resort.  Most of the hotels are located in the suburbs and the nearest bays - Yalongwan, Sanya and Dadonghai. </p><p>  All the beaches of Sanya resort in China are municipal.  They are equipped with everything necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãsunbeds, umbrellas and other amenities.  The local coast has gently sloping sandy beaches.  Water in the sea always pleases with warmth and constant purity.  The cleanest sea is off the coast of Yalongwan.  Here, the water is a little cooler than in other places, but more calm.  The largest diving centers are located here.  But surfers most often for some reason prefer Dadonghai, although its beaches are very often very crowded.  Not only tourists, but also the local population prefer to come here.  I must say that the Chinese come to the coast not only for swimming, but also just to admire the beautiful expanses of water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The beaches in Yalunvan are calmer, there are much fewer people.  If you want to have fun, then in the evening you have to go to Sanya. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.mandarinoriental.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya weather in January" class="if uuid-3142828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142828.jpg"></div><p>  Sanyavan Bay is located near the Sanya Airport.  Its infrastructure is just developing.  The main disadvantage of the resort area is that all its beaches are located across the road.  The sea in the bay is not as clear as in other places, but this is offset by stunning landscapes. </p><h2>  Dudanhai Bay </h2><p>  Dudanhai Bay is located near the city of Sanya (China).  Its beaches are rightly called the most beautiful in the country.  Dadonghai is a sandy coast stretching for several kilometers.  The azure sky, snow-white sandy coating and sea water are what awaits you in <span>Dadonghai Bay.</span>  Tourists are very fond of this place, since the whole nightlife of the resort is concentrated here.  The coast has numerous nightclubs, cafes and restaurants.  The whole bay is decorated with thickets of palm trees, mangoes, pineapples and flowering cacti.  Dadonghai is the busiest part of the resort.  The bay is the most developed and equipped.  It was here that the first Russian tourists came in due time, thanks to whom the development of the region began in the future.  There are many entertainment facilities in the bay, most of which are located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Same Mol store.  There is also a fruit market.  The entire infrastructure of the resort is focused on the rest of Russian tourists.  All establishments have Russian-speaking staff, signs and menus in restaurants are also in Russian.  The bay is known for its intense nightlife.  On its territory you can find hotels with the most different prices.  Sanya (China), including Dudanhai, offers hotels of different levels, among which there are international establishments and modest hostels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Weather in Dudanghai Bay </h2><p>  At Sanya Resort in China, summer reigns throughout the year.  However, the high season in Dudanhai Bay lasts from November to May.  There is no bad weather at this time.  In winter there is no rain, but the temperature ranges from + 20 ... + 25 degrees.  At night, the temperature can drop to +15 degrees.  Many tourists consider summer not the best time to relax in Dudanhai Bay, as it often rains and the temperature reaches +35 degrees.  Even the sea warms up to +30 degrees. </p><h2>  Dudanhai Bay Hotels </h2><p>  There are a lot of hotels in the resort of Sanya (China).  On the first line in Dudanghai Bay are the most respectable hotel complexes with pools, gardens and a wide range of services.  These resorts offer rooms with coastal views.  For their guests, hotels exhibit umbrellas and sunbeds on the beach.  However, the resort is focused on all categories of tourists, so there are more budgetary establishments here.  They are located a little further from the coast, but also within walking distance from the sea. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yana.kiev.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya china reviews" class="if uuid-3142841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142841.jpg"></div><p>  The most popular establishments in Dudanhai are: Sanya Marriott Hotel Dadonghai Bay 5 *, Dadonghai Hotel Sanya 5 *, Dadonghai Hotel Sanya 5 *, Sanya Rainbow Sea View Holiday House, Sanya Yu Hua Yuan Hotel 4 *. </p><h2>  Yalongwan Bay </h2><p>  Yalongwan Bay is considered the most expensive and respectable place to stay in the resort of Sanya on the island of Hainan (China).  Its coast stretches for 7.5 km and has the shape of a crescent.  Local beaches are sandy.  And the clear water off the coast in sunny weather becomes turquoise.  The bottom is visible at a depth of ten meters.  Since there are coral reefs, the conditions for diving and snorkeling are just perfect. </p><p>  The beaches of Yalongwan Bay are open to visitors at any time of the day, unlike the coast of Dadonghai.  The width of the coast reaches 30-50 meters.  There is shallow water, convenient for families with children.  Sanya resort in China, including the coast of Yalongwan Bay, is family-friendly.  Local beaches are good even in winter, as the water temperature here never drops below +21 degrees.  The best time to visit the resort is November-March. </p><p>  The coast has a developed infrastructure and is equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The swimming area is fenced off by buoys, for which it is forbidden to swim.  Rescue workers are always working on the coast, who are watching the tourists vigilantly.  Beach accessories are available to everyone. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easytourchina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya resort town" class="if uuid-3142891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142891.jpg"></div><p>  There are cafes and restaurants along the coast, however, the prices are much higher than in the city center or in Dadonghai.  Behind them stands a green park area with lush tropical vegetation.  Tall trees form a shady alley through which it is very pleasant to walk in hot weather.  There are also children's carousels and a rope park. </p><h2>  Yalongwan Coast Hotels </h2><p>  The first line on the coast of the bay is built up with five-star hotels with ponds and parks, sculptures and flowers.  Such hotel complexes boast well-equipped recreation areas, playgrounds and other infrastructure. </p><p>  Among the most famous hotels it is worth paying attention to: Sanya Marriott Yalong Bay Resort &amp; Spa 5 *, <span>Cactus Resort Sanya by Gloria</span> 5 *, Yalong Bay Universal Resort Sanya 5 *. </p><h2>  Yalongwan Bay Reviews </h2><p>  According to tourists, the coast of the bay fully meets the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa relaxing holiday near the sea.  Picturesque beaches and tropical nature are a nice addition and a chic place for photo shoots.  Vacationers note the absence of annoying insects on the coast, so there is no need to use repellents.  Active entertainment is available on the coast, so relaxation is never boring. </p><h2>  Sanya Bay </h2><p>  The coast of Sanyavan Bay is the closest to the resort town of Sanya.  Sanya Bay is the longest beach in the region.  But among our tourists it is not very popular.  Most often, holidaymakers prefer to relax on the coast of Dadonghai and Yalunvan.  Mostly locals come here.  The length of the beach reaches 17 km and a width of 20-30 meters.  At low tide, the water recedes tens of meters.  Sanya Bay boasts a gentle approach to the sea without stones and pits.  Along the entire coast stretches forest park.  Tropical plantations separate the beach from the road behind which the hotels begin.  There is no equipped promenade on the coast.  For convenience on the beach equipped with wooden flooring.  Green spaces with flower beds flaunt along the coast. </p><p>  In the bay is the artificially created Phoenix island, which is connected to the land by a bridge.  Futuristic skyscrapers that look very unusual are built on the coast.  With the arrival of twilight, illumination turns on.  People come here to enjoy the sunset and the laser show. </p><p>  The coast of the bay has a standard infrastructure.  There are shops, hotels, cafes and other facilities.  Near the beach is the airport. </p><h2>  Hotels Sanya Bay </h2><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city beach there are about two hundred hotels, apartments, hostels and guesthouses.  Here you can find housing for any wallet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gotur.kz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya China prices" class="if uuid-3142887" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142887.jpg"></div><p>  Among the best institutions can be identified: Wyndham Sanya Bay 5 *, Narada Sanya Bay Resort 5 *, Grand Soluxe Hotel &amp; Resort, Sanya 5 *, Howard Johnson Resort Sanya Bay 5 *. </p><h2>  Travel Reviews for Sanya Bay </h2><p>  Even in January, the weather in Sanya Bay is warm.  The air temperature in winter reaches + 30 ... + 35 degrees.  And the air temperature in the coastal area does not fall below +26 degrees.  By the way, it is the winter period that is most successful for recreation, since in the summer the probability of typhoons is high.  During the high season, from October to May, calm weather reigns in the bay with a refreshing breeze. </p><p>  Tourists leave positive reviews about holidays in the Sanya Bay.  According to holidaymakers, water off the coast is sometimes a little muddy due to a suspension of sand, but this does not interfere with relaxation.  The beach has a good transport interchange, it is very convenient to get to it.  The picturesque coast is equipped with everything you need.  The only serious drawback that exists on the beach is the sand fleas and midges, because of which you have to use repellents.  The rest of the coast makes the most pleasant impression. </p><h2>  Search for a tour operator </h2><p>  If you decide to go to Hainan, you will have to search for a good tour operator in China.  "Rus-tour" may be one of the possible options.  The company has been working in this area since 1992 and has established itself on the good side.  It has a network of extensive contacts on the island and its own representative office.  Many tourists believe that it is not so easy to find a good tour operator in China.  ‚ÄúRus-tour‚Äù, unlike other companies, offers direct flights to Hainan Island, so there is no need to make transfers and lose valuable time. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.harbinice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya China Hainan Island" class="if uuid-3142892" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142892.jpg"></div><p>  The company offers its customers the opportunity to buy last-minute tours at a bargain price and take part in promotions and sweepstakes.  In addition, you can get a good discount on accommodation in the "hotel of the day."  To learn more about all the promotions and offers, contact the representative of the tour operator in your area.  The company regularly expands the geography of activities, opening its representative offices in new cities of the country. </p><h2>  The best time to relax in the resort </h2><p>  The holiday season in the resort of Sanya in China continues throughout the year, due to its favorable geographical position.  No wonder that the region is considered the main health resort of the country.  Despite the fact that the island is warm at any time of the year, they still emit high and low season.  What time is better to relax, it's up to you.  The first surge of tourist activity in the resort begins in late September.  High season lasts until May.  At this time, a lot of tourists come to the island, and prices for accommodation and food, of course, are skyrocketing. </p><p>  If you want to save, then you can buy a summer tour.  Due to rain and heat, few tourists come to the resort, so the cost of trips is reduced, as evidenced by numerous reviews.  Sanya (China) is a great place to relax.  However, experienced travelers do not recommend coming here in February.  The fact is that at this time, local residents celebrate the New Year.  Holidays last long enough, so many institutions do not work for a long time, which affects the quality of rest. </p><p>  Our compatriots often prefer to spend holidays away from their homeland.  Therefore, they leave for Sanya in January.  The weather at this time in the resort is cold by the standards of the island.  But for us it is quite acceptable for relaxation.  January is a good time for a vacation if you want to not only swim, but also see the sights of the region.  There is no heat and rain at this time.  In the middle of winter, swimming is quite possible, but in the daytime, since it can be a bit cool in the morning and evening hours, the air temperature drops to + 14 ... + 16 degrees.  Another feature of the rest in December and January is the cold currents.  In general, at this time, the swimming season is unstable. </p><p>  Experienced travelers believe that March is the best time to relax at the resort.  It is at this time that the most comfortable temperature is observed.  In the daytime, moderate warmth pleases guests, which favors sightseeing trips, and in the evening pleasant coolness comes.  The sea in March warms up to +28 degrees, creating the best conditions for a beach holiday. </p><p>  Do not forget that the island is not just a resort, but also a health resort.  Very often people come to Sanya not only for the sake of the sea, but also for healing.  The island has thermal springs that treat gastrointestinal ailments, rheumatism, osteochondrosis and skin diseases.  In addition, the climatic conditions of the region have a beneficial effect on the health of people with chronic problems.  If you want to take a wellness course of procedures, it is better to come to Sanya in the winter. </p><p>  In general, everyone chooses the best time to relax for himself, depending on the purpose of the trip and financial opportunities. </p><h2>  Sanya Resort Reviews </h2><p>  Sanya is a great place to relax.  Among tourists, there was some prejudice about the resort.  But experienced travelers in their reviews dispel all myths.  Some people think that Sanya is just as dirty as it is throughout Asia.  This is actually not the case.  Sanya is a very clean and beautiful resort, which was created for a comfortable stay. </p><p>  On the Internet you can see many reviews regarding sand fleas on the beaches of the island.  But the situation is not so terrible.  Animals are not available on all beaches, and its bites are not terrible.  Using repellents very easily solves the problem. </p><p>  Sanya is an incredibly green resort.  Such an abundance of flowers and vegetation you are unlikely to see anywhere else.  If you want to fully enjoy your vacation, you should see the local attractions that are natural in nature.  Tourists recommend visiting interesting places on their own, since trips purchased from tour operators are quite expensive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.fiercepharma.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya China resort in summer" class="if uuid-3142899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/3142899.jpg"></div><p>  In Sanya, it is good to relax our compatriots.  Nobody speaks English here, but many know Russian.  In shops and cafes you will surely find people who can explain everything to you.  The resort has many Russian catering establishments that have not only our names, but also offer menus in their native language.  In general, communication problems do not arise. </p><p>  Sometimes tourists write that Sanya is a resort for senior citizens.  But this is not at all true, since there are a lot of places on the coast where you can have fun.         ,   ,     . </p><p>       .      .    .       ,        .    -         . </p>
