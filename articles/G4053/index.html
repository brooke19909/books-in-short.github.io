    <h2>  Disadvantages of "Dolphin", according to tourists </h2><p>  But tourists leave not only positive opinions about holidays on the island of Corfu.  "Dolphin" is a hotel, reviews of which are often negative.  We list the main shortcomings noted by guests who rested here: </p><ul><li>  the rooms are in need of repair, in general, the situation looks rather shabby, although all the equipment works well; </li><li>  to enter the sea without special shoes is impossible, because the bottom is strewn with small sharp stones; </li><li>  a lot of people from other hotels come to the beach, occupying the loungers of the guests of the "Dolphin", and no one is watching this; </li><li>  dirty dishes in the restaurant, they give only one set of devices for the whole meal (sometimes you have to eat watermelon with a fork stained with fish), they don‚Äôt tidy up the tables, they can serve drinks in broken glasses; </li><li>  not enough outlets in the rooms; </li><li>  maids clean rooms when they want, so they can come early in the morning or late in the evening; </li><li>  the hotel has a lot of mosquitoes and other insects, but the administration does not take any measures to eliminate them. </li></ul><h2>  Should I go here to rest? </h2><p>  It is safe to say that all tourists should visit Corfu.  "Dolphin" - a hotel whose prices do not quite match the quality of service.  Despite what he considers a four-star complex, a rare tourist will give him more than three stars.  It is worth paying attention to the shortcomings that can seriously ruin your vacation.  Those to whom they seemed insignificant will enjoy the hotel.  This quiet place will be a good option for families with children, as well as for business people, elderly couples and even friendly companies. </p>
