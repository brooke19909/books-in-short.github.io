    <p>  No country can usurp any flower, forbidding other nations to use it as a symbolism.  Therefore, the same flowers are sometimes found among the symbols of different countries.  In the first place in terms of prevalence is an orchid.  Perhaps because its flowering lasts all year.  Many countries have chosen this flower as a symbol, indicating a constant desire for development.  But the first to take for himself an orchid as a national symbol of Singapore.  This happened in 1981, after an amateur gardener from this country first found a natural hybrid orchid.  The flower was named Wanda Miss Joakim.  The second most popular is a white rose.  After all, she is a <span>symbol of faith</span> and love.  For example, the emblem of Finland depicts nine roses at once.  The flower <span>symbol of France</span> is a lily.  Iran has a tulip.  Alpine edelweiss - in Switzerland.  Some countries have two flower symbols.  So, the Japanese chose sakura and chrysanthemum for themselves, the Australians - eucalyptus and acacia, the Italians - cyclamen and daisies. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  National symbol of wales </h2><p>  In some countries where there is a particular addiction to flowers, even certain areas, regions and cities have their own floral symbolism.  Indicative in this regard is the United Kingdom.  Some of its territories have their own flower symbols: Scotland - thistle, England - rose, Northern Ireland - shamrock.  The symbol of Wales is the daffodil. </p>

    <h2>  Saint david </h2><p>  The patron saint of Wales - Saint David - is a real person.  According to one version, he was the son of the ruler of Powys - the medieval kingdom that occupied the eastern part of Wales.  Many legends are associated with his name, one of which relates to the symbolism of the kingdom.  After all, the daffodil is not the only symbol of Wales.  During the battle with the Saxons, St. David suggested that the Welshmen attach green stalks of leeks to their headdresses to distinguish themselves from their enemies.  Perhaps it was this advice that played an important role in the outcome of the battle - the victory of Wales.  Since then, leek has become its symbol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There was another legend about Saint David.  It was as if he had the appearance of an angel who predicted death after some time on a specific date - March 1.  Since then, the saint began to fulfill his Christian mission even more zealously.  David founded about a dozen monasteries, healed the sick, led an ascetic lifestyle.  Indeed, he died on March 1, the opinions of historians differ regarding the year, but approximately it was 590.  David was buried in Pembrokeshire, there was built a cathedral in his honor. </p><h2>  Why is the symbol of Wales a daffodil? </h2>

    <p>  In the XVIII century, the Welshmen recognized St. David's Day as their national holiday.  And, of course, they began to celebrate it in the spring - March 1, on the day of the saint's death.  During festivals and street festivals, the Welsh people dress up in national clothes, to which leeks and daffodils are attached. </p><p>  Daffodils in Wales bloom on March 1, so residents believe that this happens specifically in honor of their beloved saint.  These <span>flowers symbolize the</span> emergence of a new life.  In the 19th century, the Welsh officially recognized that the daffodil was the second symbol of Wales. </p><p>  There is also another version of why the daffodil became the floral symbol of this land.  The word "cenhinen" in translation has two meanings: "daffodil" and "leek".  To prevent confusion, both plants became symbols of Wales.  In addition, a lot of daffodils really grow on this earth, there you can see whole fields of these beautiful flowers. </p><h2>  Proud Daffodil - a symbol of Wales </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the daffodil symbolizes the birth of a new life.  At the same time, it is also a symbol of narcissism, cold beauty, selfishness.  Many remember Greek mythology and a handsome young man who remained soullessly indifferent to the nymph Echo in love with him.  The young man was punished for neglecting love.  He was doomed to love his own <span>reflection in the water.</span>  According to the myth, the daffodil grew up exactly at the place where the Greek youth admired his reflection and even died of this love.  Different peoples have different attitudes towards this flower.  For example, Italians consider it a flower of passion and give it in recognition of love. </p>
