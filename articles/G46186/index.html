As the locals say <span>, Odessa</span> must be heard, inhaled and even tasted.  The famous resort falls in love at first sight, and unwittingly succumb to its magical charms, imbued with the local color. </p><p>  For each hospitable city opens in a special way, and we will try to highlight the most interesting places in Odessa, which are impossible not to visit. </p><h2>  Business card of Odessa </h2><p>  Of course, the Potemkin Stairs is the most famous landmark in the city of humor.  Leading to the Seaside Boulevard, it is deservedly considered a beautiful building.  If you look from the bottom up, the stairway rising to the sky seems endless.  The main entrance from the sea has 192 steps and 10 flights, which not everyone can overcome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Odessa" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345695.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is interesting that the local attraction has a special philosophy: flights of stairs - these are life stages passed, and each step symbolizes a day or year spent.  The man standing below is just starting his way, which he considers incredibly long and difficult.  And from above, the seemingly absolutely direct calling card of Odessa seems to make it clear that the life lived was short, and many of its episodes were completely erased from memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A magnificent sight is loved by couples in love and newlyweds traveling to the picturesque Potemkin Stairs to capture the happiest day of their lives.  Therefore, listing the most interesting places in Odessa for a photo shoot, one can not help but mention an architectural monument filled with deep meaning. </p><h2>  Seaside Boulevard </h2><p>  Everyone who has climbed the monumental staircase is expected to meet with Primorsky Boulevard, which offers a wonderful panorama of the technically equipped sea station, which is a monument of modern art.  A small street is considered the front facade of the city from the sea. </p><p>  The visitors die away at the sight of the simple and elegant buildings built in the classical style, which Odessa is famous for.  Interesting places for tourists are saturated with an unusual flair of charm, and at night, under the light of illumination, when each <span>tree glows with</span> colorful lights, walks along the boulevard become even more valuable.  A visit to the luxurious urban ensemble in the dark will open new doors to where you could not look into the sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Odessa interesting places for children" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345699.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Unusual walk will give the museum under a glass dome, which stores the ruins of an ancient Greek settlement and is considered a new landmark of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Underground catacombs </h2><p>  Having overcome all the flights of stairs and admired the wonderful view of Primorsky Boulevard, we descend into the famous catacombs, because not all interesting places in Odessa are on the surface.  The unique underground labyrinth is considered the longest and most confusing in the world.  In the former quarries, interconnected, lived the poor and displaced, bandits and criminals.  For the criminal world, the dark catacombs with a length of more than three thousand kilometers were home, and gradually labyrinths appeared on the city map, keeping many secrets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Odessa interesting places for tourists" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345702.jpg" width="553"></div>

    <p>  Unusual views of underground galleries, stone collapses, mysterious crossroads attract tourists who set off with an experienced guide who will tell you a lot about the catacombs and how to navigate them.  There are frequent cases when daredevil loners were lost in caves, and their searches dragged on for several days. </p><h2>  Palm alley </h2><p>  Tired of the oppressive silence and gray tones of the lost world, we set off for a picturesque corner filled with bright colors.  A fascinating summer vacation is a great opportunity to visit all the interesting places in Odessa.  The palm alley, creating a unique atmosphere of the resort, delights guests of the fabulously beautiful city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Slender rows of palm trees, pleasing to the eye, growing among a lush flower garden, can be seen only in the warm season, and in winter, exotic trees live in greenhouses, where they are carefully looked after by specialists. </p><p>  It is symbolic that the city, called South Palmyra, has finally acquired exotic "beauties." </p><h2>  Perfume fountain </h2><p>  After a walk along the palm alley, I want to sit down under the shade of the spreading trees and feel the refreshing spray of water.  Now you can go to the City Garden on Deribasovskaya Street, where in 2004 the most <span>unusual fountain</span> in the world opened. </p><p>  Considering interesting places in Odessa that will attract the attention of all women, we‚Äôll tell you about a landmark with a wonderful aroma, because instead of water, perfumes flow with the delicate smell of the sea and acacia once an hour.  Thrifty ladies collect magically smelling liquid in bottles to spray it at home and mentally transport themselves to a city that has no equal in beauty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Odessa for youth" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  City garden </h2><p>  The city garden, which attracts with a special aura, will amaze everyone with the green riot of trees and well-groomed flower alleys.  On the benches you can take pictures with bronze sculptures of L. Utesov, O. Bender, K. Vorobyaninov, and the entrance is guarded by sculptures of lions brought from France. </p><p>  The working musical fountain, openwork arbors and original antique lamps support the romantic atmosphere, which is saturated with the park.  This is another wonderful place to relax in the fresh air and take many spectacular photos. </p><h2>  Flat house </h2><p>  No wonder they say that every building in the city is unique.  Ancient buildings compete with each other in beauty, but there will not be a single winner in this battle: they all deserve to be in first place.  Speaking about interesting places in Odessa, one should not forget about the local attraction, bearing several names.  Therefore, we continue the memorable journey through the sunny city and go to the so-called Flat House, which is surprising everyone who sees it for the first time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the most interesting places in Odessa" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345803.jpg" width="596"></div>

    <p>  The name of the architect who presented the unique structure is not known to anyone.  True, no one planned to erect a mysterious building, which at a certain angle seems flat.  It's all about optical illusion and a banal lack of funds.  In order to save money, architects brought down two walls in such a way that from above the house began to resemble a triangle.  Trying to find a clue, tourists even go around the building and study it from all sides. </p><h2>  Corner of old Odessa </h2><p>  Of course, in one article it is impossible to consider all the interesting places in Odessa.  Sights endowed with the status of a mini-museum in the open air, created in order to attract tourists to the history and culture of the city, deserve to be sure to visit there. </p><p>  The exhibition is an art object, which contains exhibits telling about the life of past centuries.  On the site located near Gogol Street, you can see a female statue transferred from the cemetery, a marble well, part of the openwork arbor and many more sculptures preserved from the 19th century.  Wrought iron humpback bridge perfectly complements the atmosphere of antiquity. </p><h2>  Odessa: interesting places for children </h2><p>  An unusual museum with ‚Äútasty‚Äù sculptures made of whimsical material will be extremely popular with kids.  Located on Deribasovskaya street, it receives guests annually.  Museum employees maintain a certain temperature, because chocolate can melt from the heat or become very fragile in the cold. </p><p>  The wonderful-smelling exhibits delight the eye for about ten years, but a year after making the sculptures, it is not recommended to eat them.  For an additional fee, the children will be told the story of the discovery of cocoa and all the curious facts regarding a delicious treat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Odessa sights" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345804.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Here you can observe the creative process of the birth of sweet paintings with a variety of subjects: white and black chocolate with the addition of dyes are poured on a level board in turn.  Be prepared that your baby will not pass by a souvenir shop filled with sweet figurines as well as those asking for hands. </p><h2>  Night clubs on the beach </h2><p>  However, young people who come to a flourishing city to rest for glory will not have to be bored.  The unique Itaka night club, located right on the beach in the most elite area, welcomes all guests until dawn.  A two-level colorful restaurant with dance floors is of great interest to tourists who dream of a pleasant pastime. </p><p>  At Ithaca Club you can have a bite to eat at the sushi bar or spend the night in a luxurious restaurant enjoying live music.  And the concert hall, which hosts eminent pop stars, will give unforgettable minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="interesting places in Odessa for a photo shoot" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1345806.jpg" width="600"></div>
