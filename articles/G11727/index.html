    <h2>  Holidays in Crete </h2><p>  The main part of Russians for their first trip chooses the mainland of this country.  But, having enjoyed their holidays in megalopolises, many begin to think about visiting the Greek islands - Rhodes, Crete, Kos, Korfa, etc. Each of them is beautiful in its own way, so often the question of choice arises very sharply. </p><p>  Crete - the largest Greek island - is located at the intersection of sea routes between Europe and Asia, apparently, therefore, it is believed that it was here that the oldest civilization was born.  This means that in addition to a great holiday there is the opportunity to see many unique places.  There are many resort towns and villages on the island.  Each of them is good in its own way.  And one of them is Amudara. </p><h2>  Hotel selection </h2><p>  This resort, located on the northern coast of the island, eight kilometers from Heraklion, the capital of Crete, has been considered one of the most popular destinations for several years, including for Russian tourists.  There are many reasons for this.  In Amoudar, sandy beaches, proximity to the capital and the most famous local attractions, a short transfer, well-developed infrastructure - restaurants, shops, clubs, taverns, a wide selection of hotels - all this becomes an undoubted plus when choosing a place to stay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Clean and tidy territory, friendly staff, good rooms - all this can be obtained at a relatively low price. </p><p>  Armonia Beach Hotel, despite its three-star category, left the vacationers with the best memories.  The rooms were always well cleaned, and at that time when there was nobody, the furniture was new, the mattresses were comfortable.  The only drawback is the lack of shampoos and gels in the bathroom.  But this gap can be filled by purchasing everything you need in the nearest supermarket.  By the way, next to the hotel there are two large shops, in which there is absolutely everything.  Some tourists were unhappy that there was no furniture on the balconies. </p><p>  As for nutrition, here all the reviews are unanimous.  The food in this hotel is simply excellent: for the entire duration of your stay, meals can be practically never repeated. </p><p>  The highest score tourists put and the location of Armonia Beach Hotel.  It is convenient to get to all major cities of Crete from it, but the biggest advantage is the proximity to the airport. </p><p>  The beach is sandy, comfortable for swimming.  Some find beach loungers its drawback, but this approach is adopted in almost all Greek hotels. </p><p>  The silence on the territory, a huge amount of greenery and beautiful flowers were also appreciated by our compatriots.  You can walk, breathing fresh sea air, without going out of the gate.  In short, a good hotel for a very economical price. </p>
