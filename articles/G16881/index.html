Born on October 16, 1869, he rose to the rank of lieutenant general.  Perhaps he would have achieved even greater successes in his military career, but his tragic and unjust death interrupted his lifeline. </p><h2>  Real last name </h2><p>  The real name of Konstantin Konstantinovich is Mamantov, and the emphasis should be placed on the second syllable.  It was changed consciously, thanks to Trotsky.  It was he who first called Konstantin Konstantinovich Mamontov.  Although in all the track records and orders she was written correctly.  It is assumed that Trotsky did this in order to hide many of the exploits of Konstantin Konstantinovich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mammoths konstantin konstantinovich" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1323124.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <h2>  Education </h2><p>  Mamontov Konstantin Konstantinovich received his first education in the cadet corps.  He studied at the Nikolaev Cavalry School, which he graduated in 1890. After him, he received the rank of cornet of the Life Guard. </p><h2>  Military service </h2><p>  Konstantin Mamontov in military service since 1888.  After graduating from college, he was enrolled in the equestrian grenadier regiment, where he served for three years.  Then he transferred to the Dragoon Kharkov regiment.  But after a short time he was expelled to the cavalry reserve.  In 1899, Mamontov K.K., thanks to a petition, was accepted into the Don army and sent to the third Cossack regiment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mammoths konstantin konstantinovich biography" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1323126.jpg" width="250"></div>

He fought in the First Chita <span>Zabaykalsky Cossack</span> Regiment, which was under the command of General Mishchenko.  He returned to the Don army already with the rank of foreman and was determined to be an assistant commander in the Cossack regiment. </p><h2>  World War I </h2><p>  During the First World War in 1914, Konstantin Konstantinovich fought as a commander in the nineteenth Don Cossack regiment.  A year later, under his leadership, the sixth regiment was transferred, which a little later entered the team of General Popov. </p><h2>  Civil War </h2><p>  In 1917, Konstantin Konstantinovich Mamontov returned to the Don, to the Lower Chirsky village.  In 1918 he created a partisan detachment, which penetrated into Novocherkassk.  Then in the Steppe campaign smashed the cavalry of Dumenko and Budyonny.  He spoke with a detachment against the Bolsheviks of the Don district. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mammoth general k" class="if" height="269" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1323122.jpg" width="250"></div>

    <p>  As a result, he was proclaimed an honorary Cossack in the Lower Chira stanitsa.  Until the end of 1918 he led the national teams and regiments.  When the VSYUR was formed, Mamontov was appointed commander of the First Don Army, then the second Cossack Corps, and in 1919 the fourth. </p><h2>  Horse raid </h2><p>  In the same year, Konstantin Konstantinovich Mamontov led the cavalry, consisting of several corps and the remains of the cavalry division.  In <span>December, the group</span> came under the leadership of Wrangel.  He left Mamontov to command only the fourth corps, subordinating him to the youngest in rank, General Ulagay.  Offended Mamontov left the group and went alone to the Liman station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He wrote a petition to the Don ataman, demanding the resignation and transfer to any other position, even an ordinary.  The reason indicated that he did not want to obey Wrangel and Denikin, when they, in turn, did not reckon with his experience and rank.  The Don ataman and commander Sidorin supported Mamontov and returned to his command the selected military units. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mammoths konstantin konstantinovich general lieutenant" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/1324008.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In response, Mamontov and his group inflicted multiple defeats on the Budenovskaya cavalry.  Konstantin Konstantinovich was the most capable in military affairs, especially in the role of commander.  His decisions, although often bold, were carefully considered and competent.  He was able to use the mobility of cavalry and thanks to this he achieved many successes. </p><p>  In 1920, Mamontov Konstantin Konstantinovich, Lieutenant General, came to Ekaterinodar to participate in the meetings of the Supreme Circle of the Terek, Don and Kuban.  The honorary Cossack was greeted with enthusiastic applause.  The situation turned so that the leadership of the circle, according to Mamontov, was to remove not only the Wrangel commander, but also Denikin from the post. </p><h2>  The mystery of the death of a general </h2><p>  Mamontov Konstantin Konstantinovich, commanding all the armies, really could achieve many successes.  Moreover, he enjoyed great authority among the Cossacks.  But Mammoth fell ill with typhoid.  As a result, he was seriously ill for a long time.  When the general had already begun to recover, and his strength began to return to him, he unexpectedly passed away. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="konstantin konstantinovich mammoths" class="if" height="379" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1323128.jpg" width="288"></div>

    <p>  His death struck everyone and, of course, caused a lot of suspicion.  But no one even tried to thoroughly check these conjectures.  Even despite the fact that Professor Sirotinin, after examining the corpse, was inclined to the version of poisoning.  The general had many enemies, including among rivals in command.  But the truth, who could poison him, remained hidden.  General Mamontov K.K.  He died on February 1, 1920, and was buried in the Catherine‚Äôs Cathedral, in the tomb. </p><p>  Partially, the secret of the death of Mamontov Konstantin Konstantinovich was ajar thanks to his wife.  She published in 1964 in one of the magazines how the general was killed.  According to her, her husband was poisoned.  Moreover, this was done in the hospital by a medical assistant who was making injections.  He injected Mammoth poison right in front of her eyes, ignoring her protests and resistance.  After that, the paramedic fled from the hospital.  And it became almost impossible to find who ordered the assassination of the general. </p>
