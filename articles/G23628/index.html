Tourists for this country are an unusual rarity.  However, we will try to find interesting sights here that could attract them. </p><h2>  Niger: getting to know the country </h2><p>  Regionally, Niger belongs to West Africa, although geographically the country is located in the center of the northern part of the continent.  If you look at the map of the state, then its outline can resemble a potato with a small appendix appendix in the southwest.  It is there that the <span>capital of Niger</span> - the city of Niamey - is located and a large part of the country's population is concentrated. </p>

    <p>  The area of ‚Äã‚ÄãNiger is 1.27 million square meters.  km, the population is about 16 million people.  In terms of state structure, this is a presidential-parliamentary republic, which gained its independence in 1960.  Prior to this, the territory was a colony of France.  The latest history of the country is a series of popular uprisings, revolutions and military coups. </p><h2>  Niger: country details </h2><p>  The state <span>has no access</span> to the oceans.  It borders on seven other African <span>countries: Algeria,</span> Libya, Nigeria, Chad, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Niger is one of the hottest countries in the world.  And one of the driest.  About 80% of its population lives in the southwest, where the only full-flowing river in the country flows - Niger.  By the way, the name of the state comes from it.  And even later, all black people on the planet began to be called this word. </p><p>  The Republic of Niger is predominantly flat.  Only in the far northwest is the Air Mountain range up to 1900 meters high within the country.  A typical Niger landscape is sparsely populated deserts with sparse vegetation.  The two largest rivers of the country: Niger and Komadugu-Yobe.  In the southeastern part, Lake Chad enters the territory of the state. </p><p>  The soil cover of Niger, of course, is extremely poor, which raises the question of the development of full-fledged agriculture.  But the bowels of the country are quite rich in minerals.  So, there are significant reserves of <span>uranium ore,</span> coal, phosphorites, limestone and gypsum.  Recently, geologists have also discovered deposits of oil, copper and nickel ores.  In terms of reserves and volumes of uranium mining, the Republic of Niger is confidently among the top ten countries in the world. </p><p>  The modern economy of Niger is underdeveloped.  It is based on mining, meager agriculture and is heavily dependent on foreign cash assistance.  It mainly grows peanuts, sorghum, <span>sugarcane, and</span> cattle.  The country has small enterprises for processing agricultural raw materials. </p><p>  The Republic of Niger is a country in which there is no railway at all.  The construction of highways and railways is one of the main tasks for the current government at the present stage.  In cities (small and large), goods are still transported by horse-drawn carts, as well as decrepit trucks, which can fall apart on the go. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Population and standard of living </h2><p>  Niger is often confused with neighboring Nigeria, a prosperous and rather wealthy country.  But the Republic of Niger is an incredibly poor state.  The volume of GDP per capita here is only 700 dollars.  According to this indicator, the country is in the "honorable" 222nd place in the world.  In the ranking of states by the index of HDI (human development), Niger also ranks low from year to year. </p>

    <p>  The state emblem is interesting, which to many Europeans resembles the face of a circus clown.  In fact, it depicts the usual things for every inhabitant of this country: the hot scorching sun, the head of the local zebu bull, the hunting arrow and the inflorescences of the cirrus. </p><p>  Niger has the highest fertility rate on the planet.  To give birth to 5-7 children per life for a local woman is a common norm.  Obviously, 2/3 of the Niger population with these indicators are children and youth under the age of 25 years.  The average life expectancy of Nigerians is 52-54 years. </p>

Literate can be called only every third in this country.  Despite the fact that the law requires education at the age of 7-15 years, many children (especially from villages) do not attend school.  There are only two higher educational institutions in the country: the Institute of Black Africa in Niamey and the Islamic University in Sai.

    <h2>  Republic of Niger: Attractions and Tourism Potential </h2><p>  Annually, the state is visited by no more than 60 thousand tourists.  These are mainly travelers from other African countries, as well as the French.  To get a visa, a European needs to be vaccinated against cholera and yellow fever. </p><p>  What to see in this hot African country for a tourist?  First of all, the European guest will be clearly interested in and amazed at the life and living conditions of the Nigerians.  To do this, go to the countryside of the country.  Local residents build their homes from straw or clay.  Those who are richer can afford to protect their homes with clay blocks.  Near traditional dwellings, you can often see the likeness of terraces or arbors made of straw and branches, which are held on curved pillar poles. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the residents of Niger are very friendly and welcoming.  They are not afraid of cameras, as in other <span>African countries,</span> and are happy to take pictures with tourists. </p><p>  Of the cities, you should definitely visit the capital Niamey, Agadez with its ancient quarters and fortifications, the former capital of Niger Zinder, as well as the mysterious town of Dogonduchi. </p><h2>  Niamey and its attractions </h2><p>  Niamey is the capital and largest city in Niger, with over one million inhabitants.  This is a completely prosperous and modern village.  Niamey today means high-quality roads, modern buildings and bright street lighting.  Foreign tourists are surprised by the amazing transparency of the sky.  At night in Niamey you can spend hours viewing the starry sky. </p>
