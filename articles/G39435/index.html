    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The city of Murom was first mentioned in 862 in the Tale of Bygone Years.  At that time he was under the rule of <span>Prince Rurik.</span>  1127 was marked by the allocation of the Murom-Ryazan land into an independent principality.  This happened under Yaroslav Svyatoslavich.  As a result, the city has significantly changed, it has become richer. </p><h2>  Moscow period </h2><p>  In the middle of the sixteenth century, where Murom is now, an army gathered under the leadership of Ivan the Terrible with the aim of campaigning in Kazan.  The construction of the first stone temples in the city dates back to the same time.  In the seventeenth century, Murom was considered a major craft center.  Since then, the city has been famous for its mountains. </p><p>  The formation of the architectural appearance of Murom took place in the nineteenth - early twentieth century, as large fires of 1792 and 1805 destroyed most of the old wooden buildings.  The city was built according to the general plan of I.M. Lem, approved by the Empress Catherine the Second in 1788.  According to this document, where Murom is located, the laying of streets should have been strictly perpendicular.  As a result, the city began to consist of neighborhoods measuring 250x150 meters.  The established order was disrupted in the 1980s.  At that time, the central Murom streets were blocked by multi-access houses according to the project of the chief architect of the city of Bespalov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murom city of Vladimir region" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/459146.jpg" width="600"></div>
