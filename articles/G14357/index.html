  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much do tablets of different brands cost?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Tablet computers</span> at the dawn of their appearance were positioned as devices that could "kill" laptops.  But that did not happen.  Still, there is something in these touchscreen gadgets that does not allow them to fully compete with familiar laptops.  And their percentage in the modern market of mobile devices is not so high.  However, there are people who suit them.  And a completely logical question appears.  How much does a tablet from a specific manufacturer cost?  Try to answer this question.  But first, some general information. </p><h2>  What is a tablet? </h2><p>  A tablet is a mobile device with a touch screen, created on the principle of a smartphone, but different in size.  <span>The tablet computer</span> can be with screen sizes of 7, 9, 10 and 12 inches.  It all depends on the specific manufacturer, model and status of the device.  The first tablets were created by Apple after the triumph of their iPhone smartphone.  Then the tablets were positioned as devices for entertainment.  No one intended to use them for productive work.  But everything has changed.  So the question arose sharply about how much the tablet costs?  But the answer is not as simple as it seems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.himama.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does a tablet cost?" class="if uuid-2357419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357419.jpg"></div><p>  In fact, almost all tablets are devices with an increased screen size and good performance.  Only apple products of the Cupertino company of the same name can boast of relatively high prices.  All other gadgets of this kind are quite affordable for the average user.  Of course, it all depends on the model, hardware platform and device status.  But especially the prices do not differ.  Horse racing is negligible.  So how much does a tablet cost from different brands?  To answer this question, you will need to consider the devices of the most popular manufacturers and look at their prices. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does a Samsung tablet cost?" class="if uuid-2357420" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357420.jpg"></div><h2>  Apple iPad </h2><p>  These are probably the most expensive tablets in our ranking.  And it does not matter what the hardware platform of these devices is.  The price will still be sky-high.  How much does an Apple tablet cost?  It all depends on what year the device is manufactured.  The price of the iPad 32 GB in 2017 starts at 23,000 Russian rubles.  But there are also various modifications.  For example, a ten-inch iPad Pro will cost 46,000 Russian rubles.  And it is in the basic configuration.  The most affordable tablets from this manufacturer are iPad Air and iPad Mini devices.  They cost 20 and 22 thousand rubles, respectively.  The buyer receives a high-quality device with wide functionality and proprietary iOS on board.  The hardware platform of these tablets is such that they will be relevant for another 2-3 years for sure.  And in the secondary market, you can purchase these devices even cheaper.  There, the price tag for the iPad Mini starts at 8,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vpnanswers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does the Tab tablet cost?" class="if uuid-2357421" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357421.jpg"></div><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab </h2><p>  These tablets are cheaper than "apple", but also very good.  It should be noted that Koreans have long been fighting with the Cupertians in this segment.  So how much does the Samsung tablet cost?  The answer to this question depends on the model of the device, its year of manufacture and positioning.  So, for example, the Galaxy Tab 2017 release with 8 gigabytes of internal memory, 7 inches of screen and a dual-core processor on board will cost almost 9,000 Russian rubles.  And the lite version of the same tablet is only 5,000. But this is the most budget option.  There are higher class models in the arsenal of Koreans.  So, a ten-inch Galaxy Tab 3 with 16 gigabytes of internal memory will cost 14,000 Russian rubles.  A modification of the same version - at 15,000. And what about the premium segment?  There are such models in the Samsung catalog.  For example, Galaxy Tab S3 costs as much as 46,000 Russian rubles.  But it has a quad-core processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM and 32 built-in and ten-inch screens with 2K resolution.  A stylus is included with the device.  So, how much does the Galaxy tablet cost, we already know.  Let's move on to other manufacturers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does the Lenovo tablet cost" class="if uuid-2357422" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357422.jpg"></div><h2>  Tablets from Lenovo </h2><p>  The products of this company occupied the budget and mid-price segments.  The company‚Äôs catalog contains very interesting devices that cannot be found from other manufacturers.  One of these gadgets is a tablet computer from the Yoga series, which can easily turn into a laptop when you connect a keyboard.  How much does the Lenovo tablet cost?  The price of the already mentioned Yoga, for example, starts at 10,000 Russian rubles, and the Pro version will cost 44,000 already. But there are quite budget models that can cope with many tasks.  The price tag for them starts at 6,000 Russian rubles and grows exponentially, based on the hardware platform, version of the operating system, case materials and screen diagonal.  The same tablets from "Lenovo" work well.  These are almost the most reliable devices in the modern market for mobile gadgets.  And the availability of these tablets makes them truly folk products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.did.ie" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does the Galaxy tablet cost?" class="if uuid-2357423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357423.jpg"></div><h2>  Tablet PCs from ASUS </h2><p>  Such devices are not profile for this manufacturer.  He prefers to produce laptops, computer components and smartphones.  But there are some interesting tablets in his catalog.  The only trouble is that not all of them are available for the Russian region.  How much does a tablet from ASUS cost?  Prices for these devices start at 8,000 Russian rubles.  But these are the simplest models.  And representatives of the top Transformer line are available to Russian consumers at a minimum price of 40,000 rubles.  The most expensive in this line is ASUS Transformer 3 with a ten-inch screen, 8 gigabytes of RAM and 512 gigabytes of read-only memory.  This is truly the most powerful tablet of all.  And its price tag is ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù - 90,000 Russian rubles.  For premium and high performance you have to pay. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.svyaznoy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How much does the Samsung Galaxy tablet cost?" class="if uuid-2357426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43514/2357426.jpg"></div><h2>  Tablets from Oysters </h2><p>  This manufacturer gives Chinese tablets for purely Russian goods.  And he does it well.  How much does the Oysters tablet (‚ÄúTab‚Äù) cost?  These are very budget devices, so the price will not make you horrified.  The simplest models will cost 1,800 Russian rubles.  These are lightweight entertainment gadgets.  Modern games are not included in the list of available entertainment.  If you need a tablet that would pull WoT Blitz at least at the minimum graphics settings, then you need to choose a model from 3,000 rubles and above.  The most ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù models from Oysters boast good performance and a ten-inch screen.  But even they will not overstep the limit of 20,000 rubles.  The equipment of this manufacturer is the most affordable in this rating.  However, not everyone will like the quality.  A kind of Chinese "but name." </p><h2>  Drawing tablets </h2><p>  This is a completely different type of device.  These tablets connect directly to your computer and are used by professional designers, artists, and animators.  The most famous company that produces devices of this type is the American Dell.  How much does a Dell drawing tablet cost?  The price tag for a device of this type starts at 100,000 Russian rubles.  However, there are more affordable models from Wacom.  In any case, this is a narrow-profile product designed for professionals in the field of graphics.  A graphic tablet is completely unnecessary for the average user. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, we figured out the question of how much the Samsung Galaxy tablet (and not only it) costs.  The price tag for the device depends on the year of manufacture, the hardware platform, performance, quality of the materials used, the diagonal and screen resolution and the brand itself.  Each manufacturer (except, probably, Apple) has a budget segment model.  And mid-range devices that can satisfy any user are also available.  The main thing is to carefully study the market and understand what exactly you need.  And there is no shortage in the assortment. </p>
