    <p>  For many tourists, the issue of nutrition is important.  What does the Aqua Hotel Resort Spa offer?  Like almost all hotels in the resorts of Egypt, this one provides meals according to the popular all-inclusive scheme, which provides full meals throughout the day, as well as drinks that can be obtained at one of the local bars.  Reviews say that the food here is really good - the dishes are always fresh, and the cook every day tries to diversify the menu.  Meat, fish, side dishes, slices, salads, fresh fruits and traditional oriental pastries are served in sufficient quantities to the table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There is also an √† la carte Gondola restaurant on site, where guests can enjoy masterpieces of Italian cuisine, as well as fish and seafood dishes.  The restaurant is open in the evenings, dinner is paid separately, and it is better to book a table in advance. </p><h2>  How far is the beach?  Water activities </h2><p>  Immediately it is worth saying that the Aqua <span>Hotel Resort Spa</span> is located on the second coastline - the distance to the beach is about three kilometers.  Naturally, a road and a boardwalk leads to the beach, a walk along which will take about 30 minutes. Nevertheless, not all tourists like the prospect of traveling such a long distance every day.  That is why the hotel provides guests with a free shuttle to the beach and back.  The bus starts to run from 8 in the morning until sunset. </p><p>  The beach here is public, however not too crowded.  There is a pontoon, as well as a calm cleared backwater, where parents with children like to have fun.  There are enough sun loungers and umbrellas on the shore, however, you need to pay for their rent, although not too much.  Here, tourists can get clean beach towels, and chilled drinks can be bought at the local bar. </p><p>  Naturally, here vacationers can have fun and engage in active water sports.  In particular, you will have the opportunity to swim in boats, catamarans, ride a boat and water ski, try yourself in windsurfing and parasailing.  Near the coast there is a large lively coral reef, so tourists like to swim with masks, watching the underwater life.  Those who wish to go scuba diving can visit the local club of divers and even take short training courses. </p><h2>  Can I take a child with me?  Conditions for children </h2>

    <p>  There is really beautiful, well-groomed territory, a huge pool that is cleaned every day, many picturesque corners where you can be alone with nature - here you really feel like in a fairy tale.  The rooms are quite spacious.  Despite the fact that not some rooms are furnished with not too new furniture and appliances, everything works perfectly.  Many thanks to the tourists leaving the chef, who, by the way, goes out to the guests room almost every evening - the pastries are simply amazing, and the choice of dishes is impressive. </p><p>  The only drawback is the relatively large distance to the beach, but it is fully offset by the relatively low cost of living at the Aqua Hotel Resort Spa.  Sharm el Sheikh is a great place for a beach holiday with the whole family, and this hotel will help reduce costs, while providing comfort and homeliness. </p>
