    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  On the northern outskirts of the village flows the river Kashinka (left <span>tributary of the Volga),</span> in honor of which the neighboring region is named.  The settlement itself has a small territory, according to the 2012 census, about 3.8 thousand people live in it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  The village of Kesova Gora (Tver region) is the oldest settlement in Tver.  It was mentioned in the chronicles of 1238, however, in those days it was called Kiasova mountain.  According to local history studies, the village was named after the Tatar prince Kias, who then lived nearby in his residence.  Later, the village became part of the Gorodets camp of the Bezhetsky district, and then the entire Kesogorov region passed into the possession of the Kashinsky district.  In its structure Kesova mountain stayed until 1929.  The heyday of trading activity in the village fell on the middle of the 17th century - then more than 770 souls lived in it in 300 yards.  Later, the village became part of the territory of Tver governorship, and after 1796 - part of the province. </p><p>  As is known from the annals, this area belonged to the przorozovsky family until almost the middle of the 19th century.  The last owner of Kesovaya Gora was Varvara Yuryevna Trubetskaya.  Since 1929, the village belongs to the Bezhetsky District of the Moscow Region, and since 1935 it has been part of the Tver Region. </p>

    <h2>  Sights of Cesova Mountain </h2><p>  All the ancient buildings of the village were destroyed by a catastrophic fire in 1740.  After many architectural monuments were rebuilt, however, historical landmarks could not be completely restored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Only the Nicholas Church built in 1800, which, by the way, is still valid, has survived to our days.  Locals call it the Nikola-Grachi Temple, since it is located at the junction of two streets - Sovetskaya and Grachi.  Unfortunately, two churches (John the Baptist and Transfiguration) were destroyed during the Great Patriotic War. </p><p>  Not far from the village you can see the parks preserved from the lordly estates - Troitsky and Baykovsky. </p><p>  In the mid-20th century, the village received two additional streets, and in 1950 their number reached 20. The reason for this expansion was the mass exodus of peasants from the villages.  A little later, another 15 streets with wooden buildings were laid in Kesovaya Gora.  The road passes on the main Moscow street, which connects two small areas.  Local administration buildings, a bus station, a club, a police department and monuments to the heroes of the Second World War and V. I. Lenin are located there. </p><p>  In the center of the village preserved ancient wooden <span>two-story houses</span> that convey the atmosphere of that time.  Even now, in this Russian outback you will not find buildings above three floors. </p>

    <h2>  Kesova Gora today </h2><p>  The village has several industrial enterprises.  On the territory of Kesovaya Gora there is its own bakery, a dairy plant, a <span>meat processing enterprise</span> and an agricultural plant.  Moreover, even its own flax mill is functioning here, of which there are not so many today. </p><p>  You can get to the village both on the highway and by train.  At the end of the 19th century, railway communication was opened.  Now to the station Kesova Gora can be reached by train Moscow-Rybinsk.  In addition, from the bus station of the village there are suburban buses and minibuses with which you can get to nearby settlements. </p><p>  From cultural institutions in the territory of this settlement there is a museum of local lore and a regional House of Culture.  There are also registry offices, a hotel and a hospital. </p><p>  Weather in Kesovaya Gora corresponds to the climate <strong> </strong>  neighboring Russian regions - warm and humid summers, snowy, cold winters.  In summer, the temperature reaches 20-25 degrees, in winter there are frosts up to -16.
