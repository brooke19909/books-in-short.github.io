  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rating phones by quality and cost</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year, dozens of new models enter the mobile phone market.  Each of them occupies a certain niche in its segment.  Phones are also distributed by price, technical specifications, features, etc. But at the end of the year, to summarize, it‚Äôs worthwhile to find out what the rating of phones in terms of quality looks like. </p><h2>  Classification </h2><p>  To make such a list, you must immediately clarify what is meant by quality and what are the evaluation criteria.  The most important judge in this distribution is always the buyer.  The technical characteristics indicated by the manufacturer do not always correspond to the real indicators.  Therefore, all that the user is talking about is the main reason to place the model at one or another step. </p><p>  In addition, when compiling a rating of cell phones in terms of quality, you need to pay attention to several basic indicators that buyers most often look at.  Among them, of course, the appearance, as well as technical specifications, screen, camera and OS.  The rest of all the points are only a pleasant addition, or an unnecessary element. </p><h2>  2016 year </h2><p>  I must say that 2016 was a very fruitful year.  Many manufacturers have released their flagships, thereby recalling themselves or strengthening their position.  As usual, the most sensational was the race between Samsung and Apple.  The developers tried to get ahead of each other once again and release smartphones faster. </p><p>  As a result, we got a very high-quality and cool Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, also the brand new Apple iPhone 7, and the burnt Samsung Galaxy Note 7. It‚Äôs difficult to judge who won whom.  Each has its own subjective opinion, therefore, making up the rating of phones according to the quality of the 2016 release, these models must be put on one level.  At the moment, the main drawback of these flagships is the huge price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Chinese breakthrough </h2><p>  It is worth mentioning separately about Chinese smartphones.  In the past year, they became a real "explosion", which stirred everyone and everything.  People really threw their branded phones to buy, although cheap, but a very high-quality and reliable device from China. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone rating by quality" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559455.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the story with Chinese gadgets has long been controversial.  There are still those in the world who believe that if Made in China is written on things, then it is unusable and will live a couple of weeks.  In fact, it turned out that the Chinese are very creative in creating new models.  Gadgets have become unusual, everyone stood out even among his brothers.  This is probably why some Chinese models even topped the ranking of cell phones in quality (2016 release). </p><h2>  Rating </h2><p>  Turning directly to the list of the <span>best phones, I</span> must say that creating an objective rating will not work.  There are such models that could be placed immediately on one line.  There are also smartphones that are very good in quality, but due to the high price, they also cannot take first places. </p><p>  Therefore, you immediately need to tune in to the fact that this is a subjective rating of phones in terms of quality, which, of course, each has its own.  This is due to the build quality and affordability, because someone can afford a smartphone for 60 thousand rubles, and for someone it is the salary for the year. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Popular phones </h2><p>  It's no secret that for an average user who does not pursue a dual camera, screens with 4K resolution and the latest processors, the average acceptable price for a smartphone is up to 15 thousand rubles.  In the category you can find good models, which in 2016 became popular among buyers.  For this money, you can buy a phone with a Full HD display, 1-2 GB of RAM, 5-8 megapixel main camera, etc. </p><p>  As mentioned earlier, it is difficult to make an objective rating of cell phones in terms of quality.  Therefore, the following list of smartphones is conditional. </p><h2>  Russian hope </h2><p>  Highscreen Power Ice from a Russian manufacturer has become an interesting model and quite popular.  Although it was assembled in China, there are no complaints about the case and materials.  This is a mid-range phone.  The best feature this phone has got is price / quality.  It does not coincide with the rating.  He has an average display - 5 inches.  Good resolution of 1280x720.  By the way, there is even 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory in it.  It is very convenient that there is support for two SIM cards, as well as a capacious battery, which is always famous for Highscreen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone price quality rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559446.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Chinese state employees </h2><p>  In this budget segment are two Huawei Honor: 5A and 5X.  Although their price differs almost twofold, nevertheless both relate to cheap models.  The quality rating of mobile phones is due to its reliability.  In general, Huawei has long been positioning itself as a brand.  Therefore, the Honor line was a pleasant surprise for those who are watching this company. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The Honor 5A model turned out to be almost the same as the previously mentioned Russian Highscreen Power Ice.  The only difference is the Chinese‚Äôs weak battery - only 2200 mAh, and its powerful 13 megapixel main camera.  Also, the price difference is almost 4 thousand rubles. </p><p>  But the second model Honor 5X is a more powerful device.  It has a 5.5-inch screen, which already goes into the category of "shovels".  Naturally, a good resolution is also put to such a display - 1920x1080.  With memory and cameras, everything is the same here as with the younger brother.  They increased his battery to 3000 mAh. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone quality rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559447.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Meizu Series </h2><p>  Further in the ranking are two very cool Chinese phones - Meizu M2 Note and Meizu M3 Note.  Very similar smartphones that many have come to love.  Moreover, sympathy for them began precisely with the younger model.  The M2 Note has a 5.5-inch display and a resolution of 1920x1080. Its technical specifications are average.  It has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal.  There is support for two SIM cards.  The main camera received 13 megapixels, and the front 5 megapixels. </p><p>  But Meizu M3 Note has the best features that any phone should have - ‚Äúprice + quality‚Äù.  He received a high rating due to these advantages.  Its main difference from the previous model is the improved technical characteristics that made the smartphone more powerful.  And, of course, the appearance of a fingerprint scanner.  In addition, there is a version of 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal.  There is also a hybrid slot and a powerful 4100 mAh battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cell phone rating by quality 2016" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559449.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Winners </h2><p>  Concluding this budget rating of phones by quality, it is worth mentioning the unconditional winners.  These are Xiaomi Redmi 3S and Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro.  The first price is about 9 thousand rubles, the second - up to 13 thousand rubles.  In general, Xiaomi is not the first year that has pleased us with its phones.  Their devices are very cool.  It is also pleasant that everyone can find a model in a comfortable price segment. </p><p>  Redmi 3S was released this summer.  It has a five-inch display with a small resolution of 1280x720.  It was one of the first phones to be controlled by the new Android 6.0.  The memory here is 2 / 16GB.  Good 13MP main camera.  A capacious 4100 mAh battery, especially considering the size of the display.  Immediately there was a newfangled fingerprint scanner. </p><p>  Redmi Note 3 Pro is a cut above.  He first appeared at the beginning of this year.  To date, more than 110 million devices have already been sold.  The phone has a 5.5-inch screen with FullHD resolution.  There is also a 4050 mAh battery, which, in principle, lasts for two days.  Here, as ordered two SIM cards, the availability of which has become the standard.  Especially nice 3 GB of "RAM." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mobile phone rating by quality" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559451.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The best of the best </h2><p>  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to talk about more expensive models that users liked the most.  Again, it must be said about the subjectivity of the following list.  Indeed, the whole world considers some models to be the best, but there are those who got here due to their features. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  LeEco was previously not widely known.  This company became popular in Russia in September 2016 after it showed the world Le Max2.  The cost of this phone ranges around 20 thousand rubles.  Its main feature is the lack of audio output.  Perhaps you immediately tell about the seventh iPhone.  But it was in this Chinese smartphone that the analog audio output was first removed.  The American manufacturer later accepted this idea and embodied it in its new flagship. </p><p>  The rest of the Le Max2 is also not inferior to many branded models.  It has 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal.  The screen is almost frameless and has 5.7 inches.  The display resolution is high - 2560x1440.  Surprised by the presence of a camera of 21 megapixels.  There is, of course, a fingerprint scanner and many other surprises. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quality push-button phones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559448.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Two fighters </h2><p>  It so happened that the rating of phones by quality for this year is not headed by any of Apple or Samsung.  The new ‚Äúseventh‚Äù models occupy a common stage in order to avoid disputes and conflicts.  Although objectively, many believe that the Americans are still a little lost to the Koreans. </p><p>  Apple iPhone 7 Plus costs about 65 thousand rubles.  In addition to the 32 GB version, there are also 128 and 256 GB.  The phone itself has become a novelty in many ways.  He received the new iOS 10. His screen is 5.5 inches, which for many will seem standard.  There is 3 GB of internal memory.  The battery for such dimensions is small - 2900 mAh.  The main feature of the new model is the dual main camera, which is really impressive.  Although in fact the lens is only the third in quality among all (the main competitor is Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, second place is on HTC 10).  But the front, perhaps the best - at 7 megapixels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone firms rating by quality" class="if" height="255" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1559533.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</span> costs a little cheaper - 50 thousand rubles.  The screen, both in the curved model and in the standard one, is 5.5 inches.  Resolution 2560x1440.  I was pleased with the 3600 mAh battery, although sometimes I want it even more powerful.  Also, the main feature was the camera, which not only received a bunch of lotions, but also has its own special technologies.  Photos from a smartphone look very interesting.  By the way, there is more RAM here than the ‚Äúapple‚Äù - 4 GB.  There is also a slot for a memory card.  Fans were glad that they returned support for two SIM cards. </p><h2>  Flawless </h2><p>  If there was a beauty rating, then unconditionally the first place would be occupied by Huawei Honor 8. It is difficult to convey in words how beautiful this model is.  Although, again, the concept of beauty is a subjective thing.  Nevertheless, the Chinese worked hard to release such a magnificent device into the world.  In addition to its external advantages, it turned out to be quite powerful. </p><p>  The display is 5.2 inches with a resolution of 1920x1080.  There are 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal.  The battery, although it has only 3000 mAh, works in tandem with a special energy-saving mode.  There is a fingerprint scanner that can be configured for other commands.  The cameras received 12 and 8 megapixels. </p><h2>  Rest </h2><p>  In general, this expensive rating can be continued for a very long time.  This year, a huge number of flagships really came out and each of them is worthy of attention.  Therefore, it is worth mentioning the LG G5, which received additional modules the very first.  The smartphone has become one of the leaders in camera quality.  Not inferior to its technical characteristics. </p><p>  It is also important to mention the powerful Chinese leader - OnePlus3.  The smartphone has become a real "boom".  He came out this summer and immediately won the honorary title of ‚Äúflagship killer‚Äù.  In fact, at the moment it is the most powerful model.  His main trump card was the emphasis on technical specifications.  He quickly walked around the famous brand name test devices at Antutu.  This is due to the presence of 6 GB of RAM, as well as the latest version of the processor and video chipset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phones rating by quality 2016" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559450.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And another winner in the race for the championship was ASUS Zenfone 3. Stylish and attractive smartphone fell in love with many buyers.  The manufacturer positions the model as a camera phone.  But, in addition to the advantages of the lens, the phone has excellent technical indicators. </p><h2>  Buttons in fashion </h2><p>  It would be foolish to think that with the advent of touch screens, push-button phones will cease to exist.  In fact, there are those people who do not want to learn or get used to the touchscreen.  Some are much more comfortable to have a phone with buttons.  Therefore, such models still exist on the market and will exist as long as there is demand for them. </p><p>  The rating of <span>push-button phones</span> is as subjective as the list of the best touch flagships.  But still there are a couple of models that stood out from the crowd and were recognized by customers.  Among them there are also very expensive ones, there are also budget ones. </p><p>  By the way, if you make a rating of phones by the quality of communication, then, most likely, the buttons would take first place.  Nevertheless, among them there are not only those who are distinguished by an excellent communication module, there are long-livers, owners of excellent displays, clamshells and dual-SIM models. </p><p>  As this year showed, BQ BQM was able to lead the quality of push-button cell phones in quality.  The company has created a number of very high-quality devices.  For example, the BQ BQM-2000 Baden - Baden is a compact cute ‚Äúclamshell‚Äù that has a stylish design, comfortable keys, useful modes and clear notifications.  Such a phone costs about 2.5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The BQ BQM-3200 Berlin boasts an excellent screen.  Its size is 3.2 inches, which is quite a lot for models of this segment.  Most of all, this unit is suitable for men, as it has a rough appearance and large size.  Its cost is about 2.5 thousand rubles.  The company also has a good model that supports several SIM cards BQ BQM-2408 Mexico.  And this is not as usual - two, but as many as four ‚ÄúSIM cards‚Äù.  That is, the phone is a real monster of mobile communications.  It costs about 2 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone quality rating" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559445.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the BQ BQM, Samsung continues to release push-button phones, which this year stood out with its robust Metro B350E.  The popular BlackBerry with the Q10 model also works in this segment.  A feature is the presence of a QWERTY-keyboard.  But the disadvantage is considered a very high price - 12 thousand rubles.  Continues to produce push-button phones and Fly. </p><h2>  South Koreans </h2><p>  This year has been difficult for Samsung.  Here is the story of the closing party of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. Although, objectively, the phone would become a leader in quality.  But the revenue was brought by the updated and improved Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. </p><p>  In general, the rating of Samsung phones by quality this year is simple.  Phones appeared as if prices were rising and technical specifications improved.  First came the budget <span>Samsung Galaxy J1.</span>  It has a screen of 4.5 inches, low resolution, average quality of the camera.  In general, it is a good branded ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  It costs about 7 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Following him appeared the older model <span>Samsung Galaxy J5.</span>  It has increased in size, and the technical characteristics have become much better.  Samsung Galaxy Note 5 continued the magnificent series.  He became very stylish, attractive, powerful.  The screen turned out 5.7 inches with a high resolution of 2560x1440.  There is even 4 GB of RAM and a choice of 32 or 64 GB of internal.  An excellent camera, a capacious battery and the efficient operation of the stylus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="quality push-button cell phones" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/1559452.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Well, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which was mentioned earlier, completed this rating.  Of course, this model has become the best not only among the Korean, but also among all the other flagships of this year. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  Top-end smartphones in 2016 turned out to be very impressive.  Thanks to them, you can even make a rating of phone companies by quality.  Thus, it turns out that in the first / second place we have two leaders - Samsung and Apple.  Again, we will not push their foreheads together, so just assume that we have two winners. </p><p>  Next up is Huawei, which this year has taken an even larger percentage of the global market - 9.3.  For comparison: back in 2012, it occupied only 3%.  Next is Lenovo.  A company that is always in the top five.  Sometimes higher, sometimes lower, but always stably afloat.  Well, Xiaomi and LG complete this rating, which this year also showed their competitive flagships.  Moreover, if Koreans have long been on the market, then the Chinese have taken a leading position in just a few years. </p>
