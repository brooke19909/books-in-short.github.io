  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Singing fountains in Moscow: a dedication to beauty</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Citizens are always waiting with special trepidation for April, because at the end of this month - on the 30th - the fountain season opens.  Most admirers have singing fountains in Moscow.  And Tsaritsyno, Muscovites' favorite leisure park, is the location of such fountains. </p><h2>  Musical Fountain in Tsaritsyno </h2><p>  Tsaritsyno Park is one of the oldest in the capital, the lawns and shady alleys of which still remember the walks of Tsarina Catherine the Great and her court.  Not surprisingly, the first singing fountain in Moscow is installed here. </p><p>  In 2006, reconstruction began in Tsaritsyno Park.  At the same time, a new fountain was being developed.  And already next year, at the end of April, its grand opening took place.  The light and music fountain is located on the island in the shape of a horseshoe.  The fountain looks like a huge bowl, because its diameter is as much as fifty-two meters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="billi-gatez.livejournal.com" data-author=": billi_gatez, "><img itemprop="image" alt="The Singing Fountain in Tsaritsyno" class="if uuid-3144359" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3144359.jpg"></div><h2>  Technical support </h2><p>  The singing fountain in Moscow, in Tsaritsyno Park, is unique in its technical characteristics.  Thanks to special pumps, the height and pressure of the jets can be adjusted remotely. </p><p>  The fountain has about 900 jets.  Their height and speed depend solely on the musical composition that is currently being presented to the court of listeners.  Water drawing is closely connected with special lighting effects.  The light show is provided by more than 2500 thousand special lamps that illuminate not only the fountain itself, but also the bridge that is thrown over the ravine. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The musical repertoire of the singing fountain in Moscow was selected especially carefully.  During a walk in the park there is an opportunity to enjoy the masterpieces of classical world music not only from foreign but also from domestic composers.  In addition, the speaker system is installed so that music can be heard anywhere in the pond.  In the autumn-winter period, the fountain is canned, as the equipment does not tolerate subzero temperatures and can fail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vao-moscow.ru" data-author=": Maxim, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyn fountain photo" class="if uuid-3144363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3144363.jpg"></div><h2>  Circus "Aquamarine" </h2><p>  There is one unique place in the capital - the circus of singing fountains.  In Moscow, they are located in the building of the Izmailovsky Concert Hall.  Colorful circus shows "Aquamarine" will delight not only the kids, but also their parents. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.72561899999999" data-lng="37.673500099999956" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/6/3/5/15635.png"></div><p>  The show is a unique mix of styles, ideally selected: dancing, acrobatics, dancing fountains, light shows and music.  Everything was mixed in grand magnificence.  In the circus pool there are about forty tons of water, the width of the water part of the show is about 23 meters, so guests who are worried that nothing will be visible from the last rows calm down immediately after seeing an incredible scale. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The beauty of the performance is visible from anywhere in the circus pavilion, designed for a thousand spectators.  A water and light show, selected for each circus performance, immerses the audience in the atmosphere of the holiday and gives incredible sensations. </p><h2>  Moscow fountains </h2><p>  Singing fountains in Moscow can be found in several more places: in the Gorky Park of Culture and Rest and in the Kuzminki area. </p><p>  In 2014, the dancing fountain resumed its work in Gorky Park, which is the decoration of the entire park complex.  His work has one small nuance.  If you are a guest and while walking, you decide to admire the singing fountain in Moscow, keep in mind that musical performances are held only four times a day: 12.00, 15.00, 18.00 and 20.30 hours.  Each show lasts about half an hour, and the light show starts at 22.30. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.2do2go.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fountain &quot;Music of Glory&quot;" class="if uuid-3144353" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3144353.jpg"></div><p>  Another singing fountain in Moscow is organized in the Kuzminki district.  It was created for the 60th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War rather as a monument.  The Music of Glory fountain has a special repertoire consisting of several musical parts: </p><ul><li>  "Battle". </li><li>  "Mourning." </li><li>  "Salute of Victory." </li><li>  "Military Waltz". </li></ul><p>  If you listen to the music, it seems that the fountain is mourning for those who fell in battle. </p><p>  On ordinary days, the water complex functions like a regular city fountain.  Musical compositions and water shows are broadcast on holidays. </p>
