When is its replacement necessary?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A modern washing machine is a device that is of great importance in every home.  The device has a complex structure, where all components are interconnected.  And it would seem that such a simple detail as a belt on a washing machine, in case of a malfunction, can stop the entire washing process.  If this part has become the cause of the malfunction of the entire device, then you can repair it yourself, without the help of a master.  The main thing is to know where to buy a belt for a washing machine of a suitable model and how to properly assemble it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="washing machine belt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1543010.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  What is its significance? </h2><p>  Despite the simple structure, the <span>belt drive</span> is of great importance and is an integral part of the washing machine.  It connects the engine and the pulley, the tandem of which drives the drum during the execution of the washing program.  When the connecting mechanism breaks or flies, the machine stops washing. </p><p>  It is worth noting that this element is not present on all modern models.  For example, the belt on the LG washing machine is not provided.  The drum with the engine on these devices is connected directly.  According to manufacturers, this technology can reduce vibration. </p><h2>  Reasons for the malfunction </h2><p>  When the link connecting the motor and the drum flies for the first time, in most cases this does not lead to serious consequences.  This may occur due to exceeding the maximum load limits of linen or imbalance.  Just put the belt on the washing machine.  If such a malfunction occurs periodically, you will have to find out its causes.  There may be several: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  During operation, the belt became unusable.  This is the main reason.  Most likely, he just wore out and therefore requires replacement. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to buy a belt for a washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1543008.jpg"></div></li><li>  Incorrect pulley mounting.  Due to the constant vibration during the spin cycle, it may become loose.  In case of diagnosing this problem, the bolt or nut with which it is attached to the drum shaft should be tightened. </li><li>  The engine mount is loose.  It must be checked and tightened if necessary. </li><li>  Deformation of the shaft and pulley.  The reason may be a violation of the belt transmission during the washing process or factory defects.  If this is a recently purchased machine, you should contact a service center to diagnose and repair or replace the washing machine. </li><li>  Relaxed cross.  The shaft is attached to the tank using this element.  The cross during operation could burst and cause imbalance.  It is necessary to change and tighten the mounting bolts. </li><li>  The pulley or belt on the washing machine was not installed correctly.  This often happens after a recent repair.  If you cannot fix the problem yourself, it is better to call a qualified technician so as not to damage other parts of the device. </li><li>  Faulty and worn bearings.  This is part of the supporting structure, which provides a uniform load on all parts of the apparatus during washing and provides an uninterrupted swing process at high speeds. </li><li>  Often a belt drive breaks in <span>narrow washing machines.</span>  It is simply rubbed during washing on the body. </li><li>  The resulting crack on the pulley.  This part is made of brittle metal, and if malfunctioned, it crumbles, which leads to wear on the belt. </li><li>  In the case when the washing machine has not been used for a long time, the belt loosens and breaks during the washing process. </li></ol><h2>  How to choose a belt for a washing machine? </h2><p>  If the cause of the malfunction is established and to eliminate it is necessary to replace the connecting motor and drum device, new questions arise.  Where to buy a belt for a washing machine and how to choose it? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to change a belt" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1543007.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Masters advise to purchase component parts for household appliances only in specialized stores with certified products.  You should not buy parts through bulletin boards, even if it is not used.  There is a big risk to get a low-quality product. </p><p>  All drive belts differ in several ways: </p><ul><li>  length; </li><li>  type of profile of wedges (J and H) and their number; </li><li>  marking. </li></ul><p>  To choose the right belt for the washing machine, it is best to look at the markings on the old product.  It consists of five numbers and a letter, for example 1023 H7. </p><h2>  Replacing the belt on the washing machine: instructions </h2><ol><li>  The device is disconnected from the power supply. </li><li>  The washing machine is rotated so that there is easy access to its rear wall. </li><li>  Unscrew the bolts on which the protective cover is held. </li><li>  The old product is removed, and in its place a new one is installed in the following way: the belt is first put on the engine, then, turning the shaft, pull on the pulley.  The principle is similar to pulling a bicycle chain. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="belt replacement on the washing machine" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1543009.jpg"></div></li><li>  The belt fits exactly into the groove. </li><li>  To check the operation, the pulley is turned several times. </li><li>  The protective cover is inserted into place and fixed with retaining bolts, the washing machine is installed back.  Repair belt replacement work completed. </li></ol><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  If the binding motor and drum device became the cause of the malfunction of the washing machine, then before changing the belt, you must purchase a suitable product with the appropriate marking.  The repair process itself is quite simple.  It can be carried out independently, without calling the master. </p>
