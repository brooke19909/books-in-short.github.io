  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reforms of Stolypin</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the agrarian question was the main one in Russia.  At that time, tsarism adhered to an economic policy that was aimed more at maintaining a noble land tenure, which was in decline.  The state sought to actively intervene in the relations between the peasant and the landowner, resorting to various measures with a "police" goal - to weaken the peasant confrontation, protecting landowner interests. </p><p>  After the convocation of the New Duma, Peter Arkadyevich Stolypin is appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers.  The situation in which Russia was then required radical changes.  The person who could implement them was Stolypin.  Changes began in the early 1900s. </p><p>  <span>Stolypin's agrarian reforms were</span> carried out on the basis of the decree of 1906 of November 9. </p><p>  The objectives of the new changes pursued several. </p><p>  Reforms of Stolypin, in the first place, were aimed at creating in the villages a solid foundation of strong owners who would support the autocracy.  To achieve this was supposed to be a split of the peasantry.  In other words, strong peasant farms, split off from the bulk, were supposed to restrain the onslaught of the revolution in the countryside. </p><p>  The second goal pursued by Stolypin‚Äôs reforms, the socio-economic one, was to destroy the community and develop private farms.  <span>The labor force,</span> which turned out to be in abundance, was supposed to be sent to support the rapidly developing industry in the city. </p><p>  The third goal - economic - was to ensure the development of agriculture and further industrialization in the country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Thus, Stolypin and his reforms would eliminate the backlog of Russia from the advanced states of the world. </p><p>  Changes were to be implemented according to a scheme that included sequentially conducted and interrelated activities.  The main directions <span>of Stolypin‚Äôs reform</span> were: </p><p>  - formation of <span>private property</span> ; </p><p>  - elimination of communities; </p><p>  - the formation of a peasant bank; </p><p>  - cooperative movement; </p><p>  - resettlement of peasants; </p><p>  - agricultural activities. </p><p>  By a decree of November 9, significant changes were introduced in peasant land ownership.  People got the right to leave the community with assignment to each leaving plot of land.  It should be noted that not all peasants agreed on the upcoming changes.  The government has therefore taken measures to forcibly eliminate communities. </p><p>  According to the tsar‚Äôs instructions, in 1906-07 the Peasant Bank received part of the specific and state lands.  Allotments were supposed to be sold to fill the land deficit.  At the same time, the peasants were significantly reduced credit, they presented benefits.  With the help of the Bank, an active influence was carried out.  So, for peasants who bought land for private use, payments decreased. </p><p>  Peasants were also given the right to resettle without any restrictions.  At the same time, government bills were received for arranging people in new places.  The resettled peasants were provided with medical care, expenses for public needs, and road construction were covered. </p><p>  Credit relations have allowed the development of consumer, sales, <span>production cooperatives.</span>  Peasants created butter and dairy cooperatives, consumer shops, agricultural societies. </p><p>  The main obstacle to the development of economic progress was considered a low farming culture, as well as the illiteracy of most producers.  During the reforms, the peasants received large-scale assistance in the form of specially formed agro-industrial services.  The work of these organizations was aimed at conducting training courses on introducing advanced and studying the intricacies of existing forms of production. </p><p>  Despite the widespread scope of the proposed changes, they crashed.  The reasons due to which the conceived course was not implemented are considered many factors.  Among them, of course, is the death of Stolypin himself.  In addition, historians note the limited nature of the peasantry, its unpreparedness for change.  However, if Stolypin‚Äôs reforms were implemented, then, according to researchers, Russia would have avoided the <span>October Revolution.</span> </p>
