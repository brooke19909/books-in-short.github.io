    <h2>  Wedding </h2><p>  <span>A few days later, the biography of John of Kronstadt was colored by a significant event.</span>  <span>The young man received a proposal to enter into a legal marriage with an Orthodox girl Elizabeth.</span>  <span>She was the daughter of the abbot of the cathedral in Kronstadt.</span>  <span>Up to this point, the hero of this article did not even think about getting married.</span>  <span>John was like an angel in the flesh and his thoughts never bowed to the joys of married life.</span>  <span>But John considered the coincidence of the marriage proposal and the recent dream to be an indication from above.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>Soon, a young graduate of the Academy became the married husband of Elizabeth, daughter of the head of St. Andrew's Cathedral.</span>  <span>And after some time John accepted the ordination and took office as a priest of this temple.</span> </p><h2>  Unexpected offer </h2><p>  <span>The married life of a young couple began with a scandal.</span>  <span>On her wedding night, the shepherd turned to Elizabeth with a proposal that shocked her.</span>  <span>John of Kronstadt (biography, diaries and other information about the saint is in church libraries) said that there are quite a lot of happy couples in the world.</span>  <span>But nevertheless, grief prevails in the general mass.</span>  <span>He desired that they, together with Lisa, serve all the unfortunate and afflicted.</span>  <span>And the newly-made priest wanted to do this in complete moral purity.</span>  <span>John invited his wife to remain brother and sister.</span> </p><p>  <span>It was difficult for a healthy, beautiful, young wife to understand and accept such a request.</span>  <span>She did not immediately come to terms with such a terrible, but essentially angelic lot.</span>  <span>Elizabeth repeatedly complained to her father.</span>  <span>He, in turn, reported to the bishop about the strange behavior of the new shepherd, hinting that John could become a victim of his own pride.</span>  <span>But the young priest was adamant and did not heed the insistent demands of the spiritual authorities to return to normal family life.</span>  <span>Soon there was a resolution of this drama, which almost became a tragedy.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Sign from above </h2><p>  <span>Once, the bishop himself summoned John and began to put pressure on him with special force.</span>  <span>The priest apologized and said that there was no God's will for such an act.</span>  <span>After that, the bishop darkened in his eyes, and a panagia (an oval image of the Mother of God worn on a gold chain) fell off his neck and rolled with a knock on the floor.</span>  <span>Vladyka himself fell to his knees in front of the young shepherd.</span>  <span>The bishop, who has significant religious experience, immediately realized on whose side justice is.</span>  <span>He instantly realized that the young man is God's chosen righteous man, to whom the Almighty has prepared a special way.</span>  <span>We can say that from this moment the spiritual biography of John of Kronstadt began.</span>  <span>The priest was no longer pestering with demands for the performance of conjugal duty.</span>  <span>Over time, and his wife Elizabeth completely reconciled with a heavy lot.</span> </p><h2>  Liturgical feat </h2><p>  <span>What did he consist of?</span>  <span>Immediately after John became a shepherd in St. Andrew‚Äôs Cathedral, he held a sacred liturgy there until the end of his life.</span>  <span>And he did it daily without holidays and weekends.</span>  <span>Even illness did not stop his religious zeal.</span>  <span>The shepherd came to St. Andrew's Cathedral by four in the morning and was preparing for the service.</span>  <span>Each of its liturgies took place with a huge confluence of Orthodox people.</span> </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="john kronstadt biography diaries" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14097/1721556.jpg" width="424"></div></h2><h2>  Charity </h2><p>  <span>The hero of this article was distinguished by a lively sincere love for people.</span>  <span>Immediately after the service, he went to the slums of Kronstadt.</span>  <span>He blessed, talked, distributed everything that he had in his pockets.</span>  <span>Often John of Kronstadt, whose biography and family were described in this article, returned home without money, boots and outerwear.</span>  <span>Sometimes Elizabeth complained to her bishop about the fact that sometimes there is nothing to eat at home, and the priest gives everything to the poor.</span>  <span>But then she understood the meaning of his actions.</span>  <span>After all, this was not a whim, but a punctual fulfillment of the gospel command: give to the one who asks.</span> </p><p>  <span>With his own money, John founded the House of industriousness.</span>  <span>There, during the day, up to a thousand thirsty and poor could receive food.</span>  <span>Kronstadsky also founded a monastery in honor of John Rylsky, a school for the poor, workshops, a hospital and much more.</span>  <span>But his main mission was the healing and rebirth of human souls.</span>  <span>The priest possessed the gift of miracles and healing.</span> </p><h2>  Salvation from Suicide </h2><p>  <span>Once, Father John was walking along Kronstadt, returning to his home.</span>  <span>In one of the squares he saw a girl sitting on a bench.</span>  <span>On her face the shepherd read the strongest spiritual torment.</span>  <span>Father came up and offered his help.</span>  <span>It turned out that the young girl was on the verge of suicide.</span>  <span>From the current life situation, she simply did not see another way out.</span>  <span>Many years later, the woman wrote in her memoirs that at that moment Father John, with a pure kind word, sparked hope in her soul.</span>  <span>She followed him to the temple and, with the help of faith, changed her own life, determining the purpose and meaning of existence.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Wonders </h2><p>  <span>Once the hero of this article was invited to a noble woman in St. Petersburg.</span>  <span>She could not be born in any way.</span>  <span>When the priest arrived at the house, the doctors shrugged: the fetus died in the womb.</span>  <span>Sepsis and mother's death were inevitable.</span>  <span>John of Kronstadt (a biography for children about this saint is present in many books on Orthodox subjects) asked everyone to leave the room where the woman in labor was moaning loudly in hot delirium.</span>  <span>The shepherd knelt down, raised his hands to heaven and began to forgive God to heal the woman and the child.</span>  <span>Kronstadsky prayed for half an hour.</span>  <span>Then the father left the room with a blush on his cheeks.</span>  <span>His gaze burned with divine power, and incomprehensible holy words flowed from the mouth: ‚ÄúThe Lord was pleased that the baby would be resurrected.</span>  <span>Mother is alive.</span>  <span>A boy was born. "</span> </p><p>  <span>The miracles that God performed through the prayer of John became public property.</span>  <span>In St. Andrew's Cathedral, where the shepherd served, a lot of people came.</span>  <span>Thousands of telegrams and letters were also received (even from abroad) asking for help and prayer.</span>  <span>John of Kronstadt did not refuse anyone - neither Jews, nor Muslims, nor Christians.</span>  <span>The glory of the priest was such that during trips from one city to another, crowds of people met him all the way.</span>  <span>When approaching the vessel or carriage on which the shepherd rode, they knelt.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Prophecies about the fate of Russia </h2><p>  <span>St. John of Kronstadt, whose biography is known to all believers, was a divine prophet.</span>  <span>One of his most famous predictions concerns the fate of the Russian state.</span>  <span>At the beginning of the twentieth century, John preached from the pulpit that our country would face severe trials.</span>  <span>According to the saint, the rebellion rebellion will cause the ruin of the Russian lands.</span>  <span>The shepherd mercilessly exposed the liberals, socialists, nihilists, for which he was fiercely hated by them.</span>  <span>Somehow, he was lured into a rich mansion by tricking him, saying that a dying person needs communion.</span>  <span>As soon as the priest entered, he was seized and crucified on the bed, and then stabbed in the groin several times with a knife.</span>  <span>But the criminals were not Russian people, so the priest hid this attempt to avoid pogroms.</span> </p><p>  <span>Shortly before his death, St. John of Kronstadt, whose biography is in many religious encyclopedias, wrote another prophecy about Russia.</span>  <span>We give it verbatim:</span> </p><p>  <span>‚ÄúWhat will happen to Russia?</span>  <span>If seditioners reign, the country will be ruled by enemies of the Orthodox faith.</span>  <span>Their main goal is to deprive the church of freedom, property, original splendor and enslave the Russians, as well as all fraternal peoples.</span>  <span>Pitiful and insane our intellectuals.</span>  <span>By their frivolity, they lost the faith of their fathers, which is a vital pillar in all troubles and sorrows.</span>  <span>These madmen do not understand that if, thanks to their efforts, Russia abandons God, the tsar will be taken away from her, and the Russian lands will be fragmented into many fragments.</span>  <span>And then the time of the Antichrist will come.</span>  <span>If the country is not cleared of a large number of chaff, then it will soon be empty.</span>  <span>This is the fate that many ancient cities and kingdoms were wiped out by the justice of God from the face of the earth for their departure from the faith. ‚Äù</span> </p>
