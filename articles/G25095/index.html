Millions of tourists fly here every year in search of adventure, hot sun, warm sea and ripe fruit.  Among the ten Caribbean islands, Saba Island is especially fond of active travelers. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  Saba was inhabited by wild tribes as early as 1300 years ago.  Christopher Columbus, making his second expedition, discovered it and was the first European to set foot on the wild land.  The island for several hundred years passed from one state to another during the European wars for territory, and in the end in 1816 was recognized as the possession of the Netherlands.  Today, the island is part of the Lesser Antilles archipelago and is part of the Netherlands.  He is very loved and visited by tourists. </p><p>  Saba Island is the peak of the long-extinct Mount Sineri volcano.  This is another attractive tourist attraction.  This is the highest island of all the Caribbean islands, so there are no rivers.  The island is divided by a kind of natural line - one part of it is dry, with a steep rocky coast, overgrown with thickets of cacti.  The other, leeward side, is a riot of greenery and flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="everything-everywhere.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saba's pier" class="if uuid-3239875" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239875.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Saba Island in the Caribbean Sea is located at a considerable distance from the main land mass.  Unfortunately, there is no direct communication with him, so you will have to make two or three transfers.  If you get from Russia, it is better to do a transplant in Paris.  This will save a few extra hours.  After this, you need to get to St. Martin.  It so happened that this is the only place from where you can get to the island of Saba.  Between St. Martin and the study site about 50 kilometers.  You can use air traffic.  You will be flying for about fifteen minutes, but it is worth knowing that the airport on the Saba island - Juancho-Irauskin - is the most dangerous in the world.  The length of its runway is only 400 meters, and this distance is enough to take off and land exclusively light-duty vehicles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="18.3055106" data-lng="-65.00070349999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/9/8/1/17981.png"></div><p>  On the island of Saba, you need to get a unified guest visa for the Caribbean islands.  Even if you have a Schengen visa, you still need to get a visa. </p><p>  Ferry services are much better developed.  Despite the fact that the ferry is on the way for about three hours, this time will fly by unnoticed by the contemplation of the magnificent Caribbean landscapes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelbook.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saba Airport" class="if uuid-3239913" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239913.jpg"></div><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  The climate on the Saba island is stable year-round, and it is tropical.  Due to the peculiar arrangement, one side of the island, the eastern one, is drier and the opposite wet.  This is due to the trade winds that blow from the east.  They maintain a year-round temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.  It is important to know that the place under study is at an impressive distance from the routes where storms and tornadoes rage.  Therefore, the island of Saba is almost always quiet sunny weather. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The animal and plant world is rich, but has its own nuances.  If you love animals and are accustomed to visiting all kinds of contact zoos and shows on vacation, then here you will miss it.  But the paucity of animals is more than compensated by all kinds of birds and reptiles.  For example, on the island of Saba, rare species of lizards and a tree frog live. </p><p>  The vegetation on the island is pleasing to the eye.  Despite the fact that one part of the Caribbean Netherlands is dry and rocky, the second half is full of vegetation and the splendor of flowers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.smithsonianmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rocky beach" class="if uuid-3239871" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239871.jpg"></div><h2>  National Marine Park </h2><p>  Each Caribbean island has its own unique attraction.  And this is a very attractive nuance for tourists.  Saba is a national park.  Interestingly, the park is called the territory of almost forty hectares, which includes a long extinct volcano.  One part of it rises, the other is covered with water.  Its depth is about three hundred meters.  The underwater part is a kind of lake and is very similar to a paradise for lovers to explore the seabed and admire the underwater world.  Underwater caves, drains, numerous coral reefs - there is where to roam.  However, it must be remembered that all sea expeditions and dives require the permission of the local administration.  You need to buy it.  All funds received from tourists are used to maintain the park itself, which has received international awards several times as the only marine park of its kind in the world. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.deeperblue.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Diving on the Saba" class="if uuid-3239934" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239934.jpg"></div><h2>  Walking </h2><p>  In addition to water activities, local hotels and guides offer walking tours and volcano walks.  As already mentioned, the volcano has long died out, but from the top a magnificent view of the ocean and the whole island opens.  It created the likeness of an observation deck surrounded by cliffs.  It is rather difficult to get to it, as the path runs through the rainforest.  You need to be prepared for the fact that the trail leads uphill, so people suffering from respiratory diseases should be careful, because the higher uphill, the less oxygen.  This can adversely affect pressure.  Be sure to wear comfortable flat shoes.  It's ridiculous, but the majority of injuries on the island happen precisely because tourists neglected the basic safety rule - comfortable shoes. </p><p>  As you move through the forest, you can find bird nests that, without fear of humans, peek out from the foliage, take pictures on the ledges of the rocks, and, of course, breathe in the purest tropical air.  Walking starts from the island’s largest city, Windwardside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sportdiver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="boat trip" class="if uuid-3239937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239937.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Saba Island is quite small compared to the rest of the land of the Caribbean archipelago.  The flow of tourists here is about fifty thousand tourists a year.  In vain, many people think that due to poor attendance, the island's housing stock leaves much to be desired and cannot provide maximum amenities.  On the contrary.  Saba lives on tourism.  There are about twenty hotels on the island, but the service is top notch.  Some hotels provide unique services, such as accommodation with their pets.  For them, the staff also created paradise conditions.  The owner can only choose the necessary options.  The following hotels are very popular: </p><ul><li>  Queens Garden Resort &amp; Spa; </li><li>  Scout Place Hotel; </li><li>  "Celera Dunia Boutique Hotel". </li></ul><p>  These are large hotels built according to European standards.  The housing provided by local residents is distinguished by local color and peculiar placement.  The choice for every taste. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.saba.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Saba Village" class="if uuid-3239869" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3239869.jpg"></div><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Saba Island, like any tourist resort, provides a wide selection of drinks and dishes that will appeal to even spoiled gourmets.  The basis of all dishes is seafood, which is delivered to the kitchen in the early morning.  Fresh catch is brought by fishermen daily.  Chefs can prepare European dishes on the order of visitors, but it is better to try the local cuisine to immerse yourself in island life.  The kitchen is not distinguished by a special set of spices, such as, for example, an oriental, but an unusual combination of herbs with seafood and vegetables to everyone's taste.  It is worth noting the delicious cocktails that are made from the freshest fruits and vegetables, which you will not find on the shelves of a big city. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Due to its location, Saba Island is visited only by travelers who crave active entertainment on and under water, and also want to enjoy the peace and beauty of nature.  However, those few Russian tourists who managed to visit a paradise, argue that it is worth it.  The remoteness of the resort is more than compensated by delicious food, magnificent views, interesting rare excursions and, of course, the caring attention of not only hotel staff, but also local residents in general. </p>
