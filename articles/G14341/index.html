    <h2>  Regions </h2><p>  Kemer, named after the mythological character Chimera, is famous for its mountain landscapes, unique air with the smell of pine needles and eucalyptus and pebble beaches.

A large number of them can be seen near the Attaleia Holiday Village HV-1. </p><p>  Alanya is without a doubt the best place for children.  Shallow sea and gentle sand attract families with kids here.  And the air, filled with aromas of cedar, pine, fills the body with vigor and energy.  In this region there are many club hotels with stunning territories, a variety of activities for both children and adults, for example, Eftalia Village Hotel HV-1. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simena holiday village hv 1" class="if" height="276" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23628/519322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The number of bars in Kamelia will also impress fans of such establishments and is a record for hotels of this class on the Turkish coast.  So, in the Champion Holiday Village HV-1 hotel, located near Kemer (in the village of Beldibi) there are only three bars. </p><p>  So, to the services of tourists: </p><p>  - The bar located by the pool will treat foreign and Turkish drinks with soft drinks and alcohol from morning until 1 in the morning.  Nearby there is an institution that offers delicious snacks from 12 to 18 to everyone. </p><p>  - A bar in the water park - for water entertainers, soft drinks and low alcohol drinks and light tasty snacks are offered from 10 am to 6 pm. </p><p>  <strong>-</strong> Another bar, located among the hotel's retail shops, offers you to relax and refresh yourself after an exciting shopping experience.  This establishment works around the clock </p><p>  - <strong></strong>  Throughout the beach season, the hotel has a bar where you can enjoy local quality wine and a variety of beers all day long.  You can have a snack with delicious cheeses.  Live music in the evenings and the sound of the surf will add romance to the atmosphere prevailing here.  The bar is open from 10 am to 2 am.  You can listen to music until 23.00. </p><p>  <strong>-</strong> Near the Relax pool (children who can swim when they are 6 years old) there is a bar that is happy to offer guests an excellent selection of drinks, and for those who do not want to leave its territory during lunch, a variety of snacks. </p><p>  <strong>-</strong> Near the pool bar and on the beach there are two houses, where from 11 am to half past five in the evening you can taste the traditional local dish - Gozleme. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="holiday village hv 1" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23628/517736.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <p>  - Disco-bar - there is one more institution that will be glad to guests (in the Fulia hotel from 23.00 to 2 am). </p><p>  Of course, Kamelya Holiday Village HV-1 cannot ignore hamburger lovers.  Hamburger House is located on site for them. </p><h2>  The opinion of vacationers about the hotel </h2><p>  Numerous positive reviews from Russian tourists suggest the high level of this hotel.  Among the qualities that do not leave them indifferent and cause a desire to return, they call: </p><ol><li>  Very beautiful and large area located between the three hotels. </li><li>  A varied diet. </li><li>  Nice, big beach. </li><li>  Polite service staff and usually quick resettlement.  Difficulties can arise only during the high season, when there may be a shortage of available rooms. </li><li>  The opportunity to use many services on the territory of the five-star hotels "Celine" and "Furla", accommodation in which is much more expensive than in "Camellia". </li><li>  An excellent team of animators who do not let bored adults as well as children, unobtrusively drawing them into sports or dance entertainment. </li></ol><p>  Of the shortcomings of the hotel, old rooms are most often noted, but the administration successfully copes with this problem, as the number of rooms is updated there every year, new buildings are being built in place of the oldest.  Due to the large number of vacationers at the height of the season, there may be a shortage of sunbeds on the beach or by the pool, but the staff is trying to solve such problems quickly. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The cost of rest at this hotel depends on the month when you want to relax there and the number of nights spent there.  The longer the rest, the lower the price.  So, the approximate prices for a room per day, subject to 2 adults staying in it, in 2014 were (in May, October): $ 260-300 for Delux, Junior Family Room - $ 350-380, Suite Room - $ 450-520.  At the height of the tourist season, the cost can increase by 50-100%.  Rest in a standard room will be cheaper and will cost $ 150-300. </p><p>  If you are a fan of self-rest, you can book a room directly on the hotel website and book a transfer from the airport there. </p><h2>  Alternative </h2><p>  If for some reason you couldn‚Äôt get to Kamelia, although you really wanted to, or just want to relax in another region of Turkey, but in similar conditions, there are many large Holiday Village HV-1 hotel complexes of the same price category.  They are located on the entire Turkish coast. </p><p>  In the Side region, Side Holiday Village HV-1 is just a few kilometers from the Kamelia. </p><h2>  Kemer region </h2><p>  In the village of Camyuva in 2001, the Simena Holiday Village HV-1 complex began operation, which covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã125,000 square meters.  m. Located 400 m from the sea. </p><p>  The following numbers are available: </p><ul><li>  284 rooms of standard type 23 sq. M; </li><li>  64 Family rooms 56 sq. M (with two bedrooms); </li><li>  17 royal suites 105 sq. M (living room and two bedrooms); </li><li>  4 villas in two levels of 200 square meters (three bedrooms and a living room, two bathrooms with a jacuzzi). </li></ul><p>  On the territory of the hotel, all residents are offered paid and free service. </p><p>  Paid: </p><ul><li>  car rental; </li><li>  first-aid post; </li><li>  beauty salon, dry cleaning; </li><li>  motor water activities; </li><li>  room service. </li></ul><p>  Free services at <span>Simena Holiday Village</span> HV-1 include: </p><ul><li>  night disco; </li><li>  fitness center; </li><li>  Turkish sauna; </li><li>  beach game sports; </li><li>  table tennis; </li><li>  animation and more. </li></ul><h2>  Alanya </h2><p>  Built in 2000 on the seashore in the village of Avsalar, the Gypsophila Holiday Village HV-1 hotel complex has been attracting lovers of this region for many years.  The hotel consists of two- and three-story cottages with spacious rooms and free internet.  The area occupied by the hotel is 50,000 square meters.  m. Despite its considerable age, the rooms in the hotel (with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30-35 sq. m.) are in good condition due to the ongoing work on their restoration. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="omer holiday village hv 1" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23628/517738.jpg" width="530"></div>

    <p>  An excellent sand and pebble beach, a varied animation program, sports entertainment make this hotel a favorite vacation spot for people of different generations.  Speaking about sports, I want to note that they do not charge for a game of billiards, rackets, balls, which is very rare in Turkish hotels.  And of the shortcomings, we note that <span>beach towels</span> are issued free of charge once during arrival, then they are replaced for money.  Judging by the reviews of tourists vacationing there, many travel agencies when selling tours do not consider it necessary to warn about this fact. </p><p>  Another hotel that can attract the attention of fans of club hotels in this region is Eftalia Holiday Village HV-1, which is distinguished by high service, excellent living conditions, beautiful architecture and a territory of 37,700 square meters.  m resembling an oasis.  This hotel is universal.  It is suitable for both business people (planning business meetings and conferences), as well as for young people, young children or the elderly.  Efthalia Holiday offers an extensive range of services, many of which are free.  Vacationers here will enjoy a variety of delicious food in three restaurants, two of which are a la carte, snacks and drinks for every taste in 5 bars located throughout the territory. </p><p>  Whatever region and hotel you choose, know that the success of your vacation will primarily depend on the mood with which you go on vacation.  Hotel flaws will be visible when you look for them.  But, you see, you came to this hospitable country not to sit in your room, but to swim in the gentle sea, get acquainted with its interesting history, attend excursions, which are offered a lot for any wallet and age, and just enjoy your vacation. </p>
