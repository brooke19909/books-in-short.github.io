    <p>  Families who love a secluded and quiet holiday, prefer their own recreation centers.  Clean and fresh air, as well as birdsong and unity with nature - all this gives a positive attitude throughout the vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the described area there are a large number of bases that are located at a short distance from the city.  Many families try to book rooms for them for the entire summer period, leaving for work right from there.  Guest house Mikli-Olgino is one of such recreation centers. </p><h2>  The benefits of relaxing at the bases </h2><p>  Very popular are bases for tourist vacations, which are located directly near the lakes.  In most cases, they host guests throughout the year.  In the summer you can have a great rest from the bustle of the city, because, as a rule, the bases have their own beach.  And in the winter you can have a good time skiing, or doing ice fishing. </p><p>  Another plus in favor of these recreation centers can be called budget.  As a rule, they consist of small houses that are designed for one family with children or a group of friends.  All of them are located in a common protected area, but at the cost of this type of housing is considered inexpensive. </p><p>  Visitors have their own kitchen or barbecue in the courtyard, which will help organize meals, and this will significantly save the family budget than visiting restaurants or cafes.  But if you do not want to cook, you can eat in the common dining room.  On the territory there is a playground, there is an opportunity to rent roller skates or entertain yourself with rides on the water. </p><h2>  Hotel "Shchuchye Lake" </h2>
