  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How was the tax reform of Olga - Princess of Kievan Rus</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Princess Olga was the first ruler in the history of Russia to adopt Christianity.  This wise and courageous woman had to take the reins of power after her husband, Prince Igor, was killed and her son Svyatoslav was too small to rule.  The years of rule, during which many events occurred, including the tax <span>reform of Princess Olga,</span> fell on the period from 945 to 962. </p><h2>  Olga's revenge </h2><p>  The princess was famous not only for her beauty and determination, but also for her intelligence and wisdom.  Having brutally cracked down on her husband‚Äôs murderers, she began to deal with political issues, manage vigilantes, complainers, and also receive ambassadors and perform other duties of the ruler. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kaini-ktisis.blogspot.am" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Icon of Princess Olga" class="if uuid-2486205" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/2486205.jpg"></div><p>  The wife of Princess Olga, Prince Igor, was killed by the Drevlyans after he demanded a repeated tax from one house.  <span>Prince Mal, the</span> manager of the Drevlyans, wanted to capture Kievan Rus by marrying Princess Olga.  However, the cunning plan of the wise ruler in one fell swoop crossed out all his intentions. </p><p>  The princess managed to kill the Drevlyan ambassadors three times, and then, inspired by the victory, she gathered an army and went to the enemy.  However, she could not immediately besiege the city of Korosten.  Then Princess Olga ordered from each house to bring her a tax in the form of three pigeons and three sparrows.  Having hooked a tinder to each bird and set it on fire, she released the birds, which, feeling freedom, flew to their native nest.  Burning birds helped burn the wooden houses, and the fortress was taken. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Olga‚Äôs next action is tax reform.  She wanted to streamline the tribute system, because of which the princess‚Äôs husband died, and instead of ‚Äúlyudia‚Äù she introduced ‚Äúlessons‚Äù, that is, a fixed fee, which they had to pay from a divided area of ‚Äã‚Äãland. </p><p>  The reform of the princess included a certain amount of tribute and a clear payment deadline.  In contrast to the ‚Äúpolyudia" this type of tax was a more civilized type of taxation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tax collection" class="if uuid-2486213" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/2486213.jpg"></div><p>  Olga's <span>tax reform</span> was carried out once a year, and the tribute itself consisted of products, furs and handmade products. </p><h2>  Graveyards </h2><p>  However, this was only the beginning.  The princess introduced such a thing as graveyards.  These innovations were small centers subordinate to princely authority.  Now every government center was required to accept tribute.  Subsequently, trade was carried out on graveyards. </p><p>  It turns out that Princess Olga, who has been carrying out tax reform for more than a year, has prudently created territorial units under the authority of a local prince.  Thus, control was under her control, since the prince could always fight back any dissatisfied with the policy of the ruler. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.fondsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baptism of Princess Olga" class="if uuid-2486188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/2486188.jpg"></div><p>  Two centuries later, pogosts turned into an administrative district. </p><h2>  People </h2><p>  What were people like?  Before the reign of wise Olga, the Grand Dukes collected tributes using the annual detour, which took place in winter.  In fact, it was a robbery, as those in power could collect tax from the same yard twice, which caused discontent and indignation of the payers. </p><p>  Olga's tax reform made it possible for people who brought tribute to receive a special princely seal.  This meant that they could no longer re-tax them.  This reform helped the wise princess to identify objectionable to her subordinates.  Most local princes lost their power because they did not fulfill the conditions of the ruler, and their lands lost their former independence.  And although Olga‚Äôs tax reform was not widely publicized, it was of great importance for Ancient Russia. </p><h2>  Tax collectors or tiuna </h2><p>  Princess Olga appointed tax collectors or tyunas, who had long been called ‚Äúcattlemen,‚Äù since they took tribute in kind.  Gradually, Olga's tax reform improved from year to year.  As a result, commodity-money relations developed. </p><p>  Instead of cattle, they began to pay tribute in a special form resembling metal money. </p><h2>  The result of the reign of Princess Olga </h2><p>  In addition to the fact that Princess Olga, as the ruler, was the first to adopt Christianity and was elevated to the rank of saints, she facilitated the life of the people with her reforms, concentrated power in Kiev, divided the state into separate administrative centers, and introduced taxation.  Now the tax was a fixed amount, everyone knew about the terms of payment, and it was strictly forbidden to levy tribute to those who had fulfilled their debt. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Equal-to-the-Apostles Prince Vladimir and Princess Olga" class="if uuid-2486198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/45418/2486198.jpg"></div><p>  Everyone knows that the grandson of Princess Olga became the first prince to baptize all the people.  Over the years, the people in epics and legends will sing not only the lifestyle of Princess Olga, but also her reforms that contribute to the strengthening of Kievan Rus. </p>
