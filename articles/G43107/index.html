Such lighting items are widely used in modern interiors and have a number of advantages.  What specific characteristics do the lighting fixtures under consideration have?  How do consumers respond to them?  Let us consider all these questions in more detail below. </p><div class="photo" data-original="greenwashinglamps.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halogen lamps for power chandelier" class="if uuid-3114195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3114195.jpg"></div><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  Halogen lamps for chandeliers are very similar to conventional incandescent lamps.  Their main feature is that tungsten wire is used to produce products of this type, which is twisted into a spiral. </p><p>  As for the lamp itself, it is presented in the form of a glass bulb, in the central part of which there is an incandescent body, and its entire cavity is filled with a special gas, which is a combination of iodine and bromine vapors.  It is thanks to the features of the work of these vapors inside the lamp that the life of the lighting element increases. </p><p>  Bulbs of halogen lamps for chandeliers are distinguished by their heat resistance, which is due to the presence of quartz in the composition of the material from which it is made.  Due to the high heat resistance indicators, lamps of this type can be manufactured in small sizes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halogen lamps for a 12 volt chandelier" class="if uuid-3114183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3114183.jpg"></div><h2>  Scope of use </h2><p>  Halogen lamps are distinguished by their ability to very brightly illuminate the room in which they are located.  That is why they are usually used in suspended ceilings.  Such products go well with stretch ceilings, perfectly reflecting in them and giving a certain peculiarity to the overall picture of the interior. </p><p>  Halogen lamps are also often used for installation in car headlights.  Lamps of this type, having large dimensions, are actively used for street lighting. </p><p>  Such a great popularity of lamps is caused not only by a high degree of light output, but also by resistance to voltage fluctuations, as well as the durability of lighting elements. </p><h2>  The advantages of halogen lamps </h2><p>  In reviews of halogen lamps for chandeliers, it is very often noted that this type of lighting device has a lot of advantages over similar objects.  The pluses include: </p><ul><li>  bright lighting; </li><li>  the lack of dimming of the light flux even with prolonged use of the device; </li><li>  small sizes of objects, due to which they can be used as spotlights, as well as for decorating ceilings; </li><li>  the ability to create different types of lighting in the room (from bright beams of light to scattered points). </li></ul><p>  In addition to all these positive features, it should also be noted that they all have energy-saving properties, which are ensured by excellent color reproduction and improved brightness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="warisanlighting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halogen lamps for chandelier 220 volt" class="if uuid-3114187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3114187.jpg"></div><h2>  Kinds </h2><p>  From the general list of types of halogen lamps, it is worth highlighting the most common: </p><ul><li>  linear (the most powerful ones are used, as a rule, to create projector lighting); </li><li>  with an external bulb (they look like a familiar incandescent lamp, they have two types of base - E27 and E14); </li><li>  with a light reflector (the most popular lamps, because they do not have a negative effect on the eyes and do not tire them); </li><li>  infrared (the most economical version of the lamp with a powerful luminous flux created by reflected infrared radiation). </li></ul><p>  As for the color characteristics of all of the listed lamps, the devices in question may have different color options: </p><ul><li>  lactic; </li><li>  white; </li><li>  transparent. </li></ul><p>  In addition to all this, some of the most modern halogen lamps for chandeliers are made of glass that has the ability to absorb ultraviolet rays. </p><h2>  About lamp power </h2><p>  Speaking about the power of halogen lamps for chandeliers, it should be noted that the type of lighting under consideration is notable for its economical operation.  This is due to the relatively low power of the products. </p><p>  All halogen lamps are divided into two groups depending on the power indicators: </p><ul><li>  with high voltage (110, 220 and 240 volts); </li><li>  with low voltage (6, 12 and 24 volts). </li></ul><p>  Speaking about the light transmission power, it is worth noting that this indicator is 100 Ra.  An advantage of the lamps of this type is the fact that they are characterized by an increased glow temperature - 2900-3200 K. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.crompton.com.au" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halogen lamps for chandelier" class="if uuid-3114181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3114181.jpg"></div><h2>  How to choose a lamp </h2><p>  How to choose the halogen lamp for the chandelier (pictured) or for single lighting?  Practice shows that in this case it is necessary to be guided not only by personal preferences, but also by security considerations. </p><p>  So, if it is planned to install lamps in a room where an increased level of humidity is regularly observed, then in this case it is worth giving it to low-voltage <span>halogen lamps (12 Volts).</span>  More powerful devices are ideal for a chandelier, however, in this case, you should pay attention to its dimensions and the number of built-in lamps.  It should be noted that with the help of low-voltage lamps, the so-called "starry sky" is often created.  Halogen lamps for 220 Volt chandeliers are great for use in large rooms. </p><p>  Depending on individual preferences, you can choose lamps that emit warm yellow or cool white lighting.  It should be noted that the second option is ideal for those rooms in which the eyes are constantly straining (school, office, office, etc.), and the yellow shades look great in any other places. </p><p>  Modern manufacturers of lighting products supply the market with colored halogen lamps that can be successfully fit into any picture of the interior. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ledsmagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halogen lamps for the chandelier how to choose" class="if uuid-3114207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3114207.jpg"></div><h2>  About manufacturers </h2><p>  When considering options for halogen lamps in a store, you should definitely pay attention to their manufacturer.  Currently, a list of companies producing the best lamps with the best performance indicators, including: </p><ul><li>  Osram; </li><li>  Optima </li><li>  Koito; </li><li>  MTF. </li></ul><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  MTF lamp reviews often state that products delivered by it are indispensable for installation in car headlights.  The same applies to lamps from Osram, which, in addition, are often used to illuminate large retail areas, as well as home and office premises. </p><p>  As for the domestic "Optima" lamps, in the comments of consumers you can often find opinions that they combine the ideal quality at a low price.  Such lamps can be afforded by any person (regardless of their income level). </p><p>  And finally, a few words about the products manufactured by the Japanese company Koito.  This manufacturer presents to the market an excellent selection of quality fixtures for every taste.  The reviews about them very often say that this company attracts the attention of customers with a large selection of lighting models, as well as their quality level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hubpages.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Halogen lamps for chandelier reviews" class="if uuid-3114198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47201/3114198.jpg"></div><h2>  Price </h2><p>  Speaking about the cost of halogen type fixtures, it is worth noting that it can vary depending on the brand, as well as on the level of product quality.  So, the average cost of lamps in the Russian market can be from 40 to 350 rubles.  The price will be based on the useful life, type and capacity of the products. </p><p>  In reviews of products of this type, it is often noted that the cost of a product is far from always an indicator of its quality.  When choosing lamps, it is best to focus on the comments left in their address by other users. </p><p>  Do you use halogen lamps? </p>
