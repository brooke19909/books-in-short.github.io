    <h2>  Screen size </h2><p>  Screen sizes in entry-level devices start from 3.2 inches.  Although rare, it is still possible to find gadgets with just such a diagonal.  But it‚Äôs not very convenient to work on it: a small display and text in small print on it are difficult to parse.  Similar problems arise when watching a video, which will also be illegible.  Increasing the diagonal of the display to 3.5 does not solve the problem.  Although this diagonal was personally recommended by Steve Jobs, but it is no longer relevant.  It is inconvenient to work on a device with a similar diagonal.  From a position of ergonomics, devices with a <span>touch panel</span> diagonal of 4 inches are slightly better.  But for comfortable work on a smartphone, it is better if its diagonal is in the range from 4.3 to 5 inches.  It is with this size that it is not so difficult to control with one hand.  At the same time, the text and video on it will be very legible.  And the gameplay on such a smart phone will bring only pleasure (of course, only with the appropriate hardware).  But devices with a display diagonal greater than 5 inches can be considered not very convenient.  With such dimensions, controlling with only one hand is quite problematic.  Yes, and in his pocket it will be quite difficult to place and will have to buy a separate bag for transporting the smartphone.  But at the same time, text and video on such devices, of course, will be much better. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Resolution </h2><p>  Of course, screen sizes in modern touchscreen smartphones play an important role.  They combine simultaneously the functions of input and output of information.  But the diagonal of the sensory part in itself is only part of the problem.  When choosing a new device, you must also take into account the resolution of the display, that is, the number of dots (their second name is pixels) in width and length.  For example, the device‚Äôs diagonal is 5 inches, and its resolution is 800x480.  In this case, the image will be grainy (individual pixels can be disassembled with the naked eye) and it will not be very convenient to work on a smartphone.  Therefore, when choosing a new smartphone, you need to take this parameter into account.  For devices with a diagonal of 4.3 to 4.7 inches, the resolution is 1280x720 (it is also sometimes abbreviated as 720p).  If this value turns out to be greater, then it‚Äôs okay - the picture will only get better from this.  But for gadgets with a diagonal of the touch panel from 4.8 to 5 inches, 1920x1080 is better (its second designation is 1080p). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what screen size" class="if" height="491" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/873985.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Technology </h2><p>  The screen size of the phone and its resolution are important factors for ensuring comfortable operation on the device, but another important component of this system is the display matrix.  More precisely, the technology by which it is made.  Today there are only three of them: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  The first of these is TFT.  It is outdated today and is used only on entry-level devices.  Its main drawback is image distortion at viewing angles that are close to 180 degrees. </li><li>  The second type of matrix is ‚Äã‚ÄãSuper AMOLED.  It is devoid of the main drawback of the previous one, but you can find such a technical solution mainly only on Samsung devices. </li><li>  The most widely used today is the IPS technology.  Its main difference from Super AMOLED is its improved color rendering.  That is why most of the manufacturers of mobile devices paid attention to it. </li></ul><p>  As a result, the most optimal choice today is precisely those devices whose screens are based on the IPS technology: they have excellent viewing angles and color reproduction is an order of magnitude better. </p><h2>  Another important nuance </h2><p>  The last important parameter that allows you to get the maximum image quality on the touch surface of the device is OGS technology.  Its essence is that there is no air gap between the surface of the screen matrix and the upper touch glass.  That is, they are a single whole.  Due to this, viewing angles significantly increase (they practically reach 180 degrees) and the picture on the display of a mobile phone is not distorted.  This technology is implemented on premium devices and partially on the most advanced gadgets in the middle price range. </p>

    <h2>  Recommendations </h2><p>  Now let's summarize and give an answer to the question of what screen size should be in the phone and with what parameters.  The diagonal should be from 4.3 to 5.0 inches.  At the same time, for gadgets with diagonals of 4.3 -4.7 inches, the resolution will be optimal 1280x720, and for devices 4.8-5.0 this parameter should be equal to 1920x1080.  Also, the matrix underlying the display should be implemented using the IPS technology, and OGS technology should be implemented in the device.  It is these screen sizes with such parameters that will provide the most comfortable level of work on a smartphone. </p>
