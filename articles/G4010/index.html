Outlets are conveniently located, you can get to it by any public transport.  A large assortment of goods, including local Crimean vegetables and fruits, clothes, shoes makes this market universal for most visitors. </p><p>  The central market of Feodosia offers products on average at a price lower by 20-30 rubles than in stores and supermarkets.  It is often used as a wholesale base by the owners of local cafes and restaurants. </p><h2>  Mode of operation and location </h2><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="45.0246958" data-lng="35.37875199999996" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/2/4/5/5/12455.png"></div><p>  The market in Feodosia is located on Oktyabrskaya Street.  Trolleybuses and minibuses go to it.  The stop has an identical name - ‚ÄúCentral Market‚Äù. </p><p>  The central market operates from eight in the morning until six in the evening.  However, many pavilions work longer for several hours, especially in the warm season of the year.  The market in Feodosia is located in the tourist area, so there are always a lot of people.  If you do not want to spend half a day in lines, it is better to come to the market at a time when there is not a large flow of customers.  As a rule, it‚Äôs 10-12 in the morning, as well as lunch and afternoon: from 14:00 to 16:00. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Assortment of goods </h2><div class="photo" data-original="gorod24.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fruits on the market in Feodosia" class="if uuid-2990596" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2990596.jpg"></div><p>  The market in Feodosia mainly specializes in food.  There are pavilions that sell local fruits and vegetables.  A comparative analysis of prices showed that on the central trading platform of Feodosia you can buy a regular set of food products (carrots, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, beetroot, cabbage, etc.) at an average price 10-15% lower than in local supermarkets and food stores.  Also, they sell fresh meat, fish, dairy products, and groceries somewhat cheaper.  That is why this market is chosen by those who want to save. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gorod24.online" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Vegetables on the market in Feodosia" class="if uuid-2990597" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2990597.jpg"></div><p>  But also in the central market they offer other necessary things in everyday life.  Including here, various household chemicals, cosmetics, clothes, shoes, children's goods, flowers are sold cheaper.  On the territory there is a cafe, small snack bars where you can have a bite to eat. </p><p>  The central market in Feodosia, like many other Crimean ones, offers tourists souvenir products.  Here, you need to pay for it several times less than in retail outlets near the coastal zone of the Black Sea.  There are also pavilions here that sell healing Crimean mountain teas and local honey. </p>
