These festivities were an essential element of the Hellenic public life.  The winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece became the most famous and honorable citizens of their polis.  Perhaps that is why every young man wanted to take part in agonies in order to demonstrate his strength and valor to everyone.  During such festivities, an atmosphere of justice was created in which a person could demonstrate his skills, achievements and become the best among the first. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Plato emphasized the crucial role of sports in public life.  The wide popularity of games was associated with the peculiarities of Greek society, where the most important regulator of human behavior was the assessment of a person by the team, his censure or encouragement. </p>

    <p>  It should be noted that the great importance of the Olympic Games is emphasized by the fact that during their holding in Greece even wars ceased.  Citizens of not only mainland Hellas, but also colonies came to the festivities.  Writers and poets also gathered here to read their works to thousands of listeners. </p><p>  The first ancient Greek Olympic Games lasted only 1 day, and later - at least 5. A special society of honorary citizens led the competition.  Under their supervision, game participants trained for about a month before the start of the agonists. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of the introduction of the Olympic Games </h2><p>  According to legend, the most famous competitions in the world originate from Homeric times.  The Greeks themselves in different ways told the story of the origin of these festivals.  Some said that the competition was introduced by the supreme god after his victory over Cronus.  Others claimed that the father of the festivities was the son of Zeus - the ancient Greek hero Heracles. </p>

    <p>  Revived the Olympic Games in 776 BC.  e.  King Ifit.  At that time, Greece plunged into a strip of long wars and feuds.  In this regard, Ifit decided to turn to the gods.  He went to Delphi to the famous oracle.  The Pythia, proclaiming the will of the gods, said that in order to save people from war and disease, it is necessary to revive the Olympic Games.  After this, the king invited the Spartan ruler of Lycurgus to him.  They signed a ceasefire agreement, which should be concluded at the time of the Olympic Games.  Ifit proclaimed Olympia a holy city, which was forbidden to enter with weapons. </p><h2>  Competitors </h2><p>  In order to understand who the winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece really are, you need to figure out who could take part in these festivities.  According to the established rules, only free men of Hellenic origin were allowed to compete, except for those who had ever been convicted or guilty of wrongdoing.  In addition, slaves and foreigners could not participate in the agonies.  Also, women were not allowed to compete in the Olympic Games.  Moreover, they were even forbidden to attend them as spectators.  The only exception was the priestess of the temple of the <span>goddess Demeter.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Interesting facts about the participants of the Olympic Games </h2><p>  Not all free-born Greeks could participate in festivities.  So, there were a number of rules that deprived the working poor Hellenes (small landowners, artisans, traders) of the right to compete in the Olympic Games.  A citizen who decided to participate in the celebration had to prove that he had been stubbornly preparing for the competition for at least 10 months.  He was obliged to train for 30 days under the supervision of game referees.  Also, the Greek was to participate in sacrificial ceremonies.  At the same time, he paid all the expenses on his own.  Thus, participation in the Olympic Games was associated with a long separation from the main activity and the expenditure of considerable financial resources; therefore, it is available only to fairly wealthy citizens. </p><h2>  Ancient <span>Olympic Games</span> Program </h2><p>  During the first 13 Olympics, the program included only one stage run, which was approximately 192.27 m. </p><p>  Hippic (equestrian) agons were first held at the 25th Olympic Games.  First, chariots drawn by 4 horses took part in them.  There was one large stage (950 m) for measuring distance at the hippodrome.  It is interesting that the winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece in equestrian competitions are the owners of chariots, and not participants in the agonies. </p>

    <p>  An important part of the festival was the pentathlon.  This program included running, wrestling, <span>long jumps,</span> javelin and discus throwing.  Athletes jumped into a pit with sea sand from a small height.  At the same time, they held in their hands a special cargo - halters.  Discus throwing originates from the military history of the Greeks.  The weight of the gun was approximately 3-6 kg.  A disk was made of stone, iron, bronze, tin and wood.  Competitions in jumping and throwing, as a rule, were accompanied by playing the flute, and the movements of athletes were in harmony with musical chords. </p><h2>  What was the name of the winner of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece? </h2><p>  The Olympic Games are the largest pan-Greek competitions held every 4 years.  The participants of these agonists were divided into three age groups: young men, beardless and husbands.  It is interesting that Pausanias totaled 18 types of competitions for adults and 6 for boys.  By tradition, the best athlete in a category was proclaimed immediately after the competition at the stadium, and the awarding was held on the last day of the festivities. </p><p>  The winner of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece was called an Olympic champion.  An important part of these festivities was the veneration of the best athletes.  This ceremony consisted of several parts and continued in the homeland of the athlete. </p><p>  Thus, we examined what the winner of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece was called.  Next, we will talk about how the most outstanding athletes were revered. </p><h2>  How and what was awarded the winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece? </h2><p>  The award ceremony for the athletes was held in two stages.  Immediately after the end of the competition, the herald notified the winner's name and city to the entire stadium.  After that, dolichodromes (messengers) went to his policy to tell all the residents the good news.  On the last day of the games at the altar of Zeus, the winner of the Olympic Games and the city where he came from were also announced.  The athlete climbed a bronze tripod accompanied by music.  Then the winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece were awarded a wreath.  After this ceremony, sacrifices were held in honor of the athletes in the temple of Zeus. <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece were awarded a wreath" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/821159.jpg" width="325"></div>

    <h2>  Honoring the winner in your home policy </h2><p>  No less solemnly the winners of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece were revered in their native policies.  The athlete entered the city through the main gate in the presence of all honorable citizens.

    <h2>  The most famous winners of the Olympic Games </h2><p>  A person who is little familiar with the history of these festivities may ask: who was the first winner of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece?  According to legend, for the first time a certain Koreb was awarded the <span>laurel wreath</span> .  He was a simple cook, but managed to win the race.  Namely the name Koreb was the first in the ancient Greek list of Olympic athletes. </p><p>  One of the most famous runners is Astilos from Croton.  He won eight times at different distances in four Olympic games.  Leonilode from the <span>island of Rhodes</span> managed to surpass Astilos <span>.</span>  This athlete won the race twelve times at the four Olympic Games. </p><p>  Later, running was included in the pentathlon system.  The best athlete was determined here in this way: the losers drop out after each competition.  It should be noted that the first winner of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece in the pentathlon system is the Spartan Lampis. </p>

    <h2>  The most outstanding victories </h2><p>  The most famous champion in fisticuffs was Diagor from the island of Rhodes.  He was the founder of a whole dynasty of athletes.  In the middle of the 5th century  BC  e.  his two sons became winners in the Olympic Games (the first - in fist fight, the second - in martial arts).  According to legend, they immediately after the award went to his father and laid wreaths on his head, lifted him on his shoulders and carried him around the field.

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Thus, the Olympic Games originate from 776 BC.  e., when the first wreath was awarded Koreb.  These festivals played a huge role in the life of the Greeks.  To look at the competitions of outstanding athletes came not only the inhabitants of mainland Hellas, but also the colonies.  Participants of the festivities, in turn, have been preparing for the competition for a long time.  They not only physically worked hard, but also invested large sums of money in the organization of sacrifices.  As we have already said, the winner of the Olympic Games in Ancient Greece was called an Olympic champion.  Together with a laurel wreath, he was honored and recognized not only in his native policy, but throughout Hellas. </p><p>  The spirit of competition was fully manifested during various sports agonies.  It should be noted that these competitions were not simple entertainment that had nothing to do with religious rites.  Agons were part of the festivities and were sacred. </p>
