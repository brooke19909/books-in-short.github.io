The deposit is opened exclusively at Sberbank in the name of the orphan by his legal representative.  The minimum amount in this case is one ruble, the validity period of the agreement is three years, a rate of 3.35 percent with capitalization works.

Citizenship, of course, should be Russian.  All that remains is to personally come to the nearest branch of the bank, sign an agreement, open your account and put the minimum amount needed on it. </p><p>  In the event that a person wants to make a deposit for his relative, acquaintance or close person, he will need a power of attorney, which must be issued and notarized.  It is best to take a sample directly at the bank branch in order not to make a mistake with all the required details and wording. </p><p>  In this case, the client receives a power of attorney in advance, and then comes with it and with a passport to the office, which will already act on behalf of another person.  There are no difficulties in this situation, this is a very common form of service.  When you want to open a deposit in the name of the child, then only the option of the program called “Replenish” will be available to the client.  A person independently addresses the department, contributes the required amount (from one thousand rubles) with the possibility of subsequent replenishment.  The donee will be able to dispose of these financial resources only after reaching the age of majority, before that it will be possible to withdraw cash from an open account only with the consent of the guardianship authorities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="life.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank put money at interest to pensioners" class="if uuid-3077385" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077385.jpg"></div><p>  Is it possible to put money at interest in Sberbank Online? </p><h2>  Electronic Contributions </h2><p>  In the event that a person acts as an active client of the bank and is connected to the Sberbank Online system, then he can draw up some deposits through the World Wide Web.  In this case, the citizen receives higher rates, for example: </p><ul><li>  The Save Online deposit provides an income of up to 4.45 percent. </li><li>  In turn, "Replenish Online" gives a bet of up to 4.10. </li><li>  And “Manage Online” makes a profit of up to 3.80 percent. </li></ul><p>  If there is a desire to open a deposit remotely, then first you need to have a debit account or card in the bank, on which you need to put the amount with a minimum deposit.  After that, the following actions are performed: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bankrate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank put money at interest for a year" class="if uuid-3077364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46969/3077364.jpg"></div><ul><li>  You need to go to your personal account. </li><li>  Then choose a section called "Deposits and Accounts". </li><li>  Then the item “Opening a deposit”. </li><li>  Now you need to study the program, choosing the appropriate option, and click "Continue." </li><li>  Then, an application is filled out, where the write-off account, term and amount are indicated. </li><li>  Click "Continue", put a tick "I agree with the terms of the deposit" and "Confirm by SMS." </li><li>  The deposit will then be opened, if necessary, you can get a written version of the agreement at the bank branch where the person is served. </li></ul><p>  Thus, there is nothing complicated in depositing money at interest at Sberbank.

True, there is a significant bonus for them, since pensioners at Sberbank receive the maximum rate on “Manage” and “Save” deposits within the chosen terms, regardless of the amount. </p><p>  How else can I put money at interest to Sberbank to pensioners? </p><p>  In addition, they can draw up a card called “Active Age” in order to receive a pension through Sberbank.  One of the advantages of such a product is the fact that a citizen will be able to receive the rest of the money that is on plastic and an income of 3.5 percent.
