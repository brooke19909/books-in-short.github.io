Perhaps a country with the city of Amman will become one of such points for the seekers of impressions.  What is so remarkable here? </p><h2>  Brief information about the location of the city </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth mentioning which capital of the state is the city of Amman.  After all, it is likely that you have never heard such a name.  Amman is the capital of the mysterious kingdom of Jordan, where Mullah's soothing singing is carried everywhere, and the streets are saturated with the smell of oriental spices.  This is not only a city of Muslim traditions and fascinating sights, but also a modern metropolis, whose inhabitants are not alien to the trends of modern times.  This is a relatively calm, serene place, given the proximity to it of such conflict states as Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iraq.  Amman is also called the white city, because mainly all the buildings in it are made of white limestone.  Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how it can entice meticulously impressed tourists. </p><h2>  A bit of the history of this place </h2><p>  The past of the city of Amman plays a huge role in the development of not only Jordan, but also the entire Middle East.  Mention of this place can be found in the Old Testament, where it is called the capital of the Ammonite state.  Then it was a fairly prosperous city with developed trade and culture.  Then he passed from the hands of some conquerors to the hands of others: Assyrians, Persians, Macedonians.  However, the city soon became part of the Roman Empire under the sonorous name of Philadelphia.  During this period, many temples, termas and amphitheaters were built here, which can be viewed in our time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city got its modern name, Amman, only by the 7th century AD.  And he became the capital of modern Jordan only in 1921.  Today, Amman is a modern metropolis, in which most of the country's population lives.  It has a place both for skyscrapers and for cozy two-three-story houses in which the Ammans themselves live.  The city is located on 14 hills, which gives reason to call it the second Rome.  This ‚Äúmulti-level‚Äù feature makes the capital even more attractive, especially at sunset, when snow-white houses turn into gold and sparkle like a marvelous oriental beauty.  This is the best time to take a photo of the city of Amman. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.trismartgroup.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amman at sunset photo" class="if uuid-2345265" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345265.jpg"></div><p>  Western customs are not alien to the city either, because on its streets you can meet quite European-clad women, which is extremely surprising for the traditions of Muslim culture.  It is even welcomed at the state level. </p><h2>  Sights of Amman </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Down town amman" class="if uuid-2345274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345274.jpg"></div><p>  The capital of the Jordanian Kingdom has many advantages for travelers.  Firstly, noisy bazaars where you can fully feel the bubbling atmosphere of the Middle East.  For example, in the center of Amman, the authentic downtown district of Downtown, is the vast and well-known traditional market ‚ÄúSouk‚Äù.  Also, gold bazaars are concentrated in large numbers here, on which jewelry connoisseurs will be able to please themselves with both traditional oriental jewelry and products from branded manufacturers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.mariamsaifan.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amman Bazaars photo" class="if uuid-2345275" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345275.jpg"></div><p>  Secondly, the oriental cuisine, which is tasteful and sensory, and local extravagant goodies that will please both gourmets and just lovers of tasty food.  It is in the capital that all the best institutions of national cuisine are located. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gallivance.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="National Cuisine Amman" class="if uuid-2345269" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345269.jpg"></div><p>  Thirdly, the proximity of the healing Dead Sea.  From the city of Amman, it is only 35 kilometers away.  To this it is worth adding that the cost of Jordanian hotels is significantly lower than that of Israeli ones.  Our tourist will especially appreciate this feature. </p><p>  Fourth, a large number of cultural heritage rich history.  Many attractions have been preserved in their original form. </p><h2>  The Citadel - the heart of the ancient city </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.geographylists.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Fortress Amman" class="if uuid-2345273" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345273.jpg"></div><p>  This attraction, also known as Fortress Mountain, or Jebel Al Qalya, is located on a hill and is one of the iconic places that is worth visiting in the first place.  The citadel is attractive not only for monuments of different eras.  It is also an excellent observation deck, which offers amazing views of the Arab capital. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Fortress Mountain is a place in which all fortifications are collected.  Excavations are still ongoing.  Archaeologists have already managed to discover the monuments of the Neolithic, as well as various eras, in which the city reached its greatest prosperity.  From the Greco-Roman era here you can see the Temple of Hercules, and from the Byzantine era - a church decorated with Corinthian columns. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.travellanda.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amman Citadel photo" class="if uuid-2345264" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345264.jpg"></div><h2>  The former greatness of Al-Qasr Palace </h2><p>  On the Fortress Hill, the Umayyad Palace rises, the residence of the once ruling dynasty of the same name.  In Arabic, its name sounds like al-Qasr.  Acquaintance with it begins with the majestic cruciform gates, behind which there is a grandiose colonnade, stretching across the entire palace territory.  Once it was an extensive complex of residential and administrative buildings, in which the rulers of Amman lived and made important state decisions.  Here you can freely walk around, view the numerous ruins and imagine the regal grandeur of that time. </p><p>  The palace has a small mosque, also built during the reign of the Umayyad dynasty.  Judging by its size, historians believe that it was intended for the rulers themselves and a narrow circle of their close associates.  There is an assumption that the materials for the construction were the stones of a collapsed Roman temple. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thecollegetourist.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.thecollegetourist.com/top-5-things-to-see-in-amman-jordan/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Umayyad Mosque Amman" class="if uuid-2345268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345268.jpg"></div><p>  The interior of the mosque is quite ascetic.  The square-shaped hall, crowned with a dome, is decorated only with arches carved into the walls.  All optimal conditions have been created for prayer, from which nothing should distract.  Now here is a museum, open to all comers. </p><h2>  The many faces of downtown Amman </h2><p>  As in many cities, all the most important attractions in the royal capital are concentrated in the center.  Which is very convenient for tourists, because it is much more comfortable to see everything at once in one place, and not to travel to different areas, constantly checking the map. </p><h2>  Roman theater </h2><p>  At the foot of the Citadel, there is an amazing amphitheater, which is considered one of the country's cultural symbols.  This structure is hollowed out in a rock in the shape of a deep bowl and consists of three parts.  Its capacity is 6,000 people.  The Roman theater is used to this day, it hosts a variety of cultural events. </p><p>  This place is also notable for the fact that in 1948 it served as a refuge for more than a thousand Palestinian refugees who left their rebellious country during the first Arab-Israeli war and found a new haven in the country with the city of Amman at the head.  By the way, it is their descendants that make up the majority (about 70%) of the modern population of the capital.  There is also a folklore museum and a Jordanian museum of folk traditions. </p><h2>  Roman forum </h2><p>  The Roman Forum is a huge area where people gathered to discuss current issues.  It was considered one of the colossal in the whole empire, because its size is 100 √ó 50 meters.  Near it, you can see dilapidated columns that once formed part of the grand colonnade around the square.  In ancient times, there was also a bazaar where you could buy clothes, food, even weapons.  Now this place has been turned into a cozy square, where you can safely sit on a bench, freshen up a bit near the fountains and watch the life of local residents.  Older citizens love to while away their time at a game of chess, and the younger generation - frolic among the picturesque ruins.  From here you can admire a wonderful view of the Temple of Hercules. </p><h2>  Royal mosque </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.geographylists.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mosque of King Abdullah Amman" class="if uuid-2345272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345272.jpg"></div><p>  The mosque was built by Abdullah I, the ruler of Jordan, in 1924.  It is lined with white and pink stone and is a good example of religious <span>Islamic culture.</span>  In 1987, it was restored by King Hussein and took on a modern look.  This is the largest shrine of the city of Amman in Jordan, local residents treat it with due respect and trepidation.  The mosque also houses the Islamic Museum, where you can learn more about this multifaceted religious phenomenon. </p><h2>  Nymphaeum Fountain </h2><p>  The Romans loved to decorate their cities with fancy gardens and fountains.  So this beautiful masterpiece of decorative art appeared, located just a few blocks from the Roman Theater.  From its name one can guess that it is dedicated to magnificent nymphs. </p><p>  The fountain used to be an impressive two-story marble ensemble, complemented by exquisite stone carvings and mosaics.  It was decorated with statues and heads of lions, from which water flowed.  The capacity of the fountain was estimated at 600 square meters. </p><p>  Excavations began in this place in 1993.  Many finds of historical value were placed in the Amman Archaeological Museum (in which you can see them).  At the moment, the restoration of the fountain is only planned so far, but the condition of Nymphaeum is considered quite tolerable in order to present its former greatness and beauty. </p><h2>  The mysterious cave of Ahl al-Kahf </h2><div class="photo" data-original="dome.mit.edu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cave of the Seven Youths" class="if uuid-2345270" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345270.jpg"></div><p>  The outskirts of the capital will be no less interesting for travelers.  So, in the Ar-Rajib area there is a Byzantine necropolis, in which, according to legend, seven youths are buried.  They are honored both in Christianity and in Islam.  The Bible says that the children were faithful to the Christian religion and did not hide it.  For their faith, they were buried alive in this cave.  And already in the Christian period they were miraculously found alive.  This place is considered sacred, so women should cover their heads before visiting it.  It is also necessary to put on clothing covering hands and feet in advance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nationalgeographic.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Amman in the evening photo" class="if uuid-2345262" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/78233/2345262.jpg"></div><p>  The place where the city of Amman is located is truly unique and interesting from a historical point of view.  It incorporates the features of almost all major eras.  At first glance, completely contradictory cultures organically intertwine here.  That is why Amman is a unique point on the map, in which you can understand the huge diversity of this paradoxical world. </p>
