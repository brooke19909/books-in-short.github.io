That is how the village of Karabulak, Saratov region, became Bazaar.  And the main name of the modern administrative center was assigned from the river, which flows nearby.  Karabulak is a "black stream" in Tatar. </p><p>  Initially, there was a temporary settlement for the nomads of the Tatars and Mordvinians.  Archaeologists have confirmed this by finding Tatar traditional burials in the village. </p>

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bazarny Karabulak Saratov Region" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64828/2082418.jpg"></div>  Founded, according to official figures, in 1692 by the first Russian settlers, Bazarny Karabulak in the Saratov Region once united several large villages and became an active trade intersection.  The decisive factor in this was the timber trade, which this region is famous for to this day.

From a small settlement of 50 yards at the beginning of the 18th century, by the end of the 19th century, it numbered more than 250. Schools, shops, churches (Orthodox and Old Believers), a hospital, a post-telegraph office were built here.  There were artisan tanneries (about 180), cooperage, carpentry, steam mills, a glass factory and a cloth factory.  Tanneries then developed into entire industries with different profiles.  To entertain the population, drinking establishments worked, which did little to please the female half and police officers. </p><h2>  Difficult years </h2><p>  World wars, revolutions, economic disasters, as in all other cities and villages of the Russian hinterland, dramatically affected the process of growth and development not only of Bazaar Karabulak, but also of the entire Saratov region.  The loss of human resources, mainly male labor, the ruin of handicraft workshops, the stagnation of industrial enterprises, as elsewhere in the country, have come up against a powerful economic decline. </p><p>  The terrain and climate here, in the Saratov region, are more conducive to agriculture.  But this did not help the locals in difficult hungry years. </p>

And the next dry summer of 1921 led to sad consequences.  Over the entire <span>Saratov province,</span> more than 85% of the population suffered from hunger.  It was easier in the villages, where the peasants had at least a small opportunity to feed themselves.  Then came the relatively calm years of recovery, when the region managed not only to recreate economic indicators, but also to begin to move on.  A branch of a technical school is opening in Bazarny Karabulak, more than 60% of all chrome and leather is produced in the Saratov Region, the local newspaper Kolkhoznaya Pravda is being published, and labor cooperatives are being created.

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Unfortunately, in 1932-33.  the presence of their own compound did not help the peasants of the Saratov region.  The famine, according to recent historians, did not provoke drought.  The government‚Äôs policy of violent collectivization is to blame.  This led to the desolation of large areas of the country, including a total reduction in the population in the territory of Bazarny Karabulak, Saratov region. </p><p>  In 1939, the village became officially a worker. </p><h2>  Development </h2><p>  Now the administrative center of Bazarny Karabulak on the territory of the Saratov region is located almost 80 km along the meridian.  In terms of population, the figure has long exceeded 10,000, and more than 33,000 people live in the district.  The district center continues to grow and develop, grow both in human resources and manufacturing enterprises.  New jobs are being created, state educational institutions, new houses are being built.  In the postwar years, a poultry farm, an oil and fat factory, a department store, a dairy, a brick, a cannery, and sewing workshops began to work. </p><p>  In the modern administrative center, livestock breeding is purposefully developing.  In addition to milk, here you can buy the so-called marble meat.  This type of meat can be attributed to some types of horse meat.  This is the second reason for the development of horse breeding, and the first is the course on import substitution, chosen by our country. </p><p>  As before, the main vector of development remains sowing and collecting grain.  Local farmers are so professional that in the 2017 season they were able to turn numerous rains in their favor and collect another record crop.  Here the land is generous to its own. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Employment issues </h2><p>  And even now, despite the crisis, there are vacancies in the administrative center of Bazarny Karabulak, Saratov Region.  The employment center periodically holds thematic meetings with residents.  It is possible to offer both permanent jobs and temporary seasonal work. </p><p>  Particular attention is paid to the employment of people with disabilities and people with disabilities.  Contracts are concluded with existing enterprises, and the employer equips the workspace in accordance with the requirements and standards.  This is all the more beneficial since the cost of such conversion is reimbursed by the state. </p><p>  Here you can always find a job to your liking.  It would be a desire and desire to work and benefit their small homeland.  Even in the most difficult times, business leaders found an opportunity to resist and even improve previous performance. </p><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  If you go in and search on the Avito website for Bazarny Karabulak, Saratov Region, then ads will appear with offers to buy-sell houses, cottages.  And there is a popular service for daily rental of cottages.  And this is used by many residents of both the Saratov region and nearby cities.  A great reason to relax from the bustle of the city, not moving away from civilization itself.  All houses and cottages in this beautiful place have been gasified since 1981.  Asphalted roads, street cleanliness, fresh air, untagged by cars and factory emissions. </p>
