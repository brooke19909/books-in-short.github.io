It is necessary to come here at least once to all tourists who have visited this wonderful city.  But of the entire architectural complex that now serves as a museum, the Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin stands out especially.  Photos of this impressive building often appear in the news.  And all because in this building are working apartments of the President of the Russian Federation.  The standard fluttering on the flagpole above the dome of the building serves as a symbol of Russian statehood.  Is it possible for an ordinary tourist to get inside the Senate Palace?  Who is the author of this architectural masterpiece?  You will learn this from our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1195607.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  History of the beginning of construction </h2><p>  In 1775, under the reign of Catherine the Great, legislative reforms took place in Russia.  The supreme body of state power of the empire, the Governing Senate, was established.  Catherine the Second decided to move him from the then capital, St. Petersburg, to Moscow.  In this regard, she issued a decree to erect a new building on the territory of the Kremlin for this important state body.  This privileged part of the city had dense buildings at that time.  The government bought their palaces from the princes of the Baryatinsky and Trubetskoys.  But the place allotted by the empress for the Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin was not very convenient for construction.  Rather, it required a special approach of the architect.  It was a triangular platform sandwiched between the <span>Miracle Monastery,</span> Arsenal and the <span>Kremlin wall.</span>  As a result, only two architects took up the layout: M.F. Kazakov and K.I. Blank.  The first project won the competition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Senate building in Moscow Kremlin style" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1195616.jpg" width="600"></div>

Ordinary workers were paid from ten to thirty-six rubles ‚Äî a lot of money for that period.  Construction has been underway since 1776.  Matvey Kazakov himself supervised the work.  The Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin was presented to the court of Catherine II in 1790.  After examining it, she was very pleased and granted Kazakov two thousand four hundred rubles of a life pension.  The architect really did the titanic work.  His bold design scared even experienced builders.  They say that the workers refused to remove the forests supporting the dome, fearing that it would collapse, because it was held on a layer of one brick.  To encourage builders, Kazakov himself stood on the roof.  Initially, the dome of the <span>Senate Palace was</span> decorated with the equestrian <span>statue of St. George the Victorious.</span>  In 1812, after the capture of Moscow, Napoleon‚Äôs troops dismantled it and took it with them to France.  After that, the statue was replaced by a pillar with the symbol of imperial power and the inscription ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù, since judicial institutions began to be located in the Senate Palace.  After the October 1917 coup, a flagpole was installed on the dome - first with a red banner, and then, since 1991, with the Russian tricolor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazakov Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1195630.jpg" width="374"></div>

The building itself was to embody the ideals of law and justice.  Therefore, the chief architect drew inspiration from the canons of classical antiquity.  The triangular configuration of the entire palace is divided into symmetrical parts by two buildings.  The strict and laconic building of the Senate in the Moscow Kremlin, whose style is the highest embodiment of classicism, was aligned in height and scale with the nearby Arsenal.  The corners of the palace are cut off.  In all three facades of the building there are <span>triumphal arches, the</span> main of which, facing the <span>Senate Square,</span> is decorated with an ionic portico with four columns and a pediment. </p><h2>  The internal structure of the palace </h2><p>  The main focus of the architectural masterpiece, of course, is the Dome Hall.  It was built for meetings of the nobility and was first called White.  Then, when the judicial department moved to the Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin in 1856, it was renamed Catherine.  A marble Shokhin staircase, decorated with floor lamps and sculptures of Themis, leads to this round hall under a beautiful dome.  Now the hall continues to fulfill its function - government meetings are held here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin photo" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1195627.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Is it possible to visit the Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin </h2><p>  Of course, there are other rooms in the palace.  After November 1917, when Moscow again became the capital of the country, the Soviet government met in the Senate building.  In 1918-1922, the palace housed living rooms and an office of V.I. Lenin.  After the death of the leader of the revolution, I.V. Stalin settled in the Senate building.  In 1955, the museum ‚ÄúV. Lenin‚Äôs Cabinet‚Äù was created.  He was there for a long time.  But when in 1994 the working apartments of the President of the Russian Federation were located next door, the exposition was moved to the Leninsky Gorki Museum.  Other things from the era of those years were moved there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Senate building in Moscow Kremlin architecture style" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1195618.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Residence of the President of Russia </h2><p>  It consists of representative and business parts.  The latter includes the offices of the President of the Russian Federation, his assistants, the library and the Conference Room of the Security Council.  The amphilade of the representative part opens from the Armorial or Embassy Hall.  This name is explained by the fact that it is in this room that foreign delegations receive.  The second name came from the emblems of the Russian Federation, with which the hall is decorated.  The representative part occupies almost the entire Senate building in the Moscow Kremlin.  In addition to the already mentioned Catherine‚Äôs Hall, the front office of the President of the Russian Federation is also located here.  Its other name is Small, or Oval Hall. </p>
