If the driver commits the vehicle without an insurance agreement, an administrative fine of five hundred rubles will follow.  To avoid this, it is necessary to take an insurance policy from licensed companies.  Many drivers think about what the cost of compulsory motor liability insurance depends on.  To determine the price of an agreement, you need to know the calculation formula. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.spangler-automation.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="CTP insurance" class="if uuid-2756797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756797.jpg"></div><h2>  CTP </h2><p>  All insurance companies use the same formula in order to determine the cost of insurance for each client individually.  It should be noted that the price of the CTP insurance agreement for a particular person should be the same in any insurance company. </p><h2>  Features Affecting Policy Premium </h2><p>  All tariffs and ratios used by insurance companies are regulated by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  Insurers are not entitled to raise or lower the price at their discretion.  What determines the cost of <span>CTP insurance?</span>  The cost of the premium insurance agreement for each owner of the vehicle is different.  This is due to the fact that many factors are important during the calculation of premiums.  Therefore, before looking for the cheapest offer, you need to understand the procedure for calculating CTP. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.goalcast.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cost calculation" class="if uuid-2756794" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756794.jpg"></div><h2>  Power </h2><p>  If the car has significant power, then, accordingly, the cost of the policy will increase significantly.  Power is measured in horsepower.  The minimum tariff will be 0.6 - for cars with a capacity of 50 horsepower.  The maximum value will reach 1.6 - for cars with a capacity of 150 horsepower. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gagauzmedia.md" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance price" class="if uuid-2756783" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756783.jpg"></div><h2>  Tariff depending on the territory of insurance </h2><p>  What determines the cost of the insurance policy?  This coefficient (used to determine the territory) depends on the place of registration of the owner of the vehicle.  Legislation has established a tariff for any region on the territory.  For example, in the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the highest tariffs are 2 and 1.8.  This is due to the fact that in megacities most accidents happen.  For example, for Chukotka drivers the rate will decrease and will be equal to 0.7.  This rate is less for villages and villages. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Drivers age and experience </h2><p>  The more experience a competent person has and the older he is, the cheaper it will cost him to buy an insurance policy.  Legislation has set a threshold of three years.  Until the driver reaches the experience of three years, he will buy a policy almost twice as high as compared to the average price.  If the owner of the vehicle has significant experience and age is more than 22 years, but it includes an additional person, then the calculation will be made at the highest rate.  For example, a man insures his car.  He is 50 years old, his experience is 30 years.  Additionally, he enters a nineteen-year-old son with an experience of one year.  The ratio of the son will be maximum - 1.8.  And it will be used during the calculation of the premium under the contract. </p><ul><li>  The tariff 1.8 is applied for beginners whose age does not exceed 23 years, and experience less than 3 years. </li><li>  1.7 - for people over 23 years old, but with less than three years of experience. </li><li>  1.6 - is set for people with experience more than three years, but age less than 22 years. </li><li>  1 - used for drivers who have reached the age of 23 years and experience of three years. </li></ul><h2>  Coefficient depending on the number of people included </h2><p>  What does the <span>cost of</span> compulsory motor third party liability <span>insurance</span> depend on?  The premium for the CTP insurance agreement also depends on the number of drivers.  There are two types of insurance: </p><ul><li>  limited policy, (with a list of drivers); </li><li>  without limitation of persons. </li></ul><p>  A motor vehicle owner can add a maximum of five people to a limited <span>insurance policy</span> .  In this case, the rate will not increase and will be equal to one. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  If the owner of the car needs a larger number of drivers, then you need to take a policy without restriction on the list.  In this option, the tool can be controlled by any drivers (who have the right to do so).  What determines the cost of CTP?  When choosing a contract without limitation, a rate of 1.8 is used.  Thus, an MTPL agreement without a list will be eighty percent more expensive than usual. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.walldevil.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Insurance calculation" class="if uuid-2756796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756796.jpg"></div><h2>  Accident rate </h2><p>  What determines the cost of OSAGO for a car?  To calculate the price of the agreement, a coefficient is also taken depending on the presence of an accident.  This coefficient is of great importance during the calculation of the contract price, as it can significantly reduce or increase it.  Each person who has the right to control by law is assigned an accident class.  A newcomer in the first year of insurance is assigned a class No. 3.  Further, each year, the coefficient increases by one, however, a person gets an additional discount on the total cost of the premium, 5 percent.  The largest discount will be 50% and the class will be 13. Moreover, the class and discounts are not saved for cars, but only for a specific person. </p><p>  If the driver has made an accident, he will automatically lose some of the discounts and his class will be downgraded.  If a person initially had class No. 3 (he is a beginner), then he will decrease and turn into 1, and the tariff will be equal to 1.4.  This rate will be valid for three years.  And if during this period a person does not get into traffic accidents, he will again receive class No. 3 and the rate will return to its previous state, will be equal to 1 (without discounts).  If a person with a class of No. 13 got into a traffic accident, then his class will drop to 7, but the discounts will remain in the form of twenty percent. </p><p>  What determines the cost of CTP?  It is worth noting that the accident rate will increase only if the agreement is valid for one policy year.  If, for example, the owner of the car for personal reasons decided to sell the car and terminate the contract, then the next time he wants to insure the car, the class will remain old, as the previous contract was not valid and was interrupted for a year.  Thus, in order to reduce the insurance premium and maximize the class, you need to use the policy for a whole year. </p><p>  The difference in the accident rate from others is that in this case the discount depends on the person.  For example, the driver cannot reduce the power of the machine at his discretion, as he has already acquired it with such data.  But the driver can affect the premium policy through accident-free driving. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wallpaperscraft.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cost of CTP" class="if uuid-2756777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756777.jpg"></div><h2>  Seasonality rate </h2><p>  What determines the cost of <span>car</span> insurance?  The size of the premium of the insurance agreement is affected by many characteristics, one of them is seasonality.  The standard policy is valid for twelve months.  If the owner of any tool does not use the car for a whole year, and for example, only in summer and autumn, then you can enter into an agreement for a period of six months, thereby reducing the price of the insurance contract.  The law allows you to conclude an agreement for at least three months, while the rate will turn into 0.5.  The maximum tariff is equal to one and applies from ten months.  Thus, you can reduce the price of the agreement if the owner uses the car only during the season. </p><h2>  Policy Ratio </h2><p>  When you purchase any funds in another region, you need to transport it to the place of registration.  To do this, you need to get an insurance policy.  The policy intended for the transit of funds is drawn up for a period of 20 days, with a coefficient of 0.2 applied.  The driver acquires this insurance contract and proceeds to the place of registration.  Next, you will need to conclude a new CTP insurance agreement. </p><h2>  Gross violations of the driver </h2><p>  What determines the cost of CTP?  The price of the policy also depends on the actions of drivers.  If the driver violated the law, the rules of the road, then the price of the policy will increase.  For this, a coefficient is applied that is affected by violations.  It will become equal to 1.5 if: </p><ul><li>  the driver provides employees with false information; </li><li>  deliberately creates a traffic accident; </li><li>  violates laws, for example, drives a vehicle in a state of alcohol poisoning; </li><li>  leaves the scene of a traffic accident without waiting for law enforcement officers; </li><li>  transfers the control of the vehicle to a person who is not included in the insurance. </li></ul><h2>  Base rate </h2><p>  The basic tariff is the amount determined by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The base rate is the same, but there are differences depending on the type of vehicle. </p><p>  In order to determine the amount of the base rate, specialists calculate the amount of premiums and payments on them for a certain period.  The coefficient is selected in such a way that the amount of payments is less than the received funds for insurance.  But at the same time, the cost of the policy should not be high so that policyholders can purchase a contract.  The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has the right to lower or raise rates once a year.  Below are the main rates of vehicles. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Motor vehicles </p></td><td><p>  Rate </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Motorcycle </p></td><td><p>  1579 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  TS category "B", "BE" </p></td><td><p>  4118 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Taxi </p></td><td><p>  6166 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  What determines the cost of motor third party liability insurance?  The price of a motorcycle policy, like any other motor vehicle, will depend on the coefficients.  But the main difference in the calculation is the base rate.  The table shows that the rate on a motorcycle is much lower compared to the tariff of other vehicles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.governmentbusiness.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Motor third party liability insurance" class="if uuid-2756781" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756781.jpg"></div><h2>  Owner or policyholder </h2><p>  What does OSAGO cost depend on yet?  There are situations when the owner of a vehicle cannot independently acquire insurance.  In this case, he may transfer the insurance right to another person.  For example, the owner is away and asks his wife to insure the car.  Will the contract value change in this case? </p><p>  The policyholder has no influence on the price of the insurance agreement.  That is, regardless of whether the insured or another person will be the owner, the amount will remain the same.  Only the inscribed driver will have an impact on the final award.  If, for example, the spouse adds to the list additionally herself as a driver, then the cost may change in the future.  This will depend on the accident class of the entered drivers. </p><h2>  Does the cost of OSAGO depend on the insurance company? </h2><p>  By law, insurance companies do not have the right to underestimate or inflate a premium under a contract.  All insurance companies that are licensed to provide this service use the PCA system.  After the conclusion of the MTPL agreement, the company within five days provides information about the agreement to the PCA database.  Thus, the price in all insurance companies should be the same.  If employees claim that they can offer to purchase a contract at a lower price, then you should think about the authenticity of such policies.  Usually scammers offer policyholders at a price half the usual price.  But a fake policy will not protect in the event of a traffic accident.  Therefore, in order to avoid problems, you need to familiarize yourself with the license of the insurance company and only after that conclude an agreement. </p><p>  But sometimes crashes do occur, and the driver loses his discounts.  For example, the owner of the car always insured in one company, but then decided to move to another.  And when calculating the cost of a policy in a new company, the amount comes out much more.  With such a problem, the driver must contact the PCA in order to return all their discounts. </p><p>  What determines the cost of CTP in Rosgosstrakh?  The organization is the largest insurance company in the financial market of the Russian Federation.  She has many clients who come for policies from year to year.  The price of a policy in a company depends on all of the above factors and cannot be lower than in other firms.  Often fraudsters, hiding behind the names of well-known organizations, offer their customers contracts.  Therefore, you must be careful.  Fraudsters usually make one mistake in the name of the company. </p><div class="photo" data-original="carrrs.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Policy price" class="if uuid-2756782" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96684/2756782.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  What determines the cost of CTP?  The price of the policy depends on the characteristics of the vehicle, as well as on the drivers themselves and the type of insurance.  The owners may have the same car and age, but the amount of the policy will differ, since the experience and driving experience of each driver included in the contract is of great importance when calculating the premium.  In order to reduce the cost of the insurance policy, drivers need to be careful while driving, not to commit an accident and comply with traffic rules. </p>
