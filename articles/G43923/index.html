    <h2>  The history of Girona </h2><p>  The old countries of Europe attract travelers from all over the world.  Every street, every house on this continent is a monument.  The country beyond the Pyrenees, from where Columbus and Magellan sailed away in their travels, is especially loved by tourists.  There are dozens of routes called ‚ÄúSpain.  Sights".  Girona is not in last place there.  It is the city with the highest standard of living in Spain.  Catalonia is a thriving region, which is why separatist sentiments are so strong there.  Girona has always been rich and was the residence of the kings of Aragon.  Since 1351, the eldest son of the king was given the title "Prince of Girona" - the official pretender to the throne.  Located close to the French border, the city several times passed under the jurisdiction of France. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Border settlements always absorb the culture of the two countries and thus become even more attractive to guests.  Tours ‚ÄúSpain.  Sights".  Girona, being one of the oldest cities in Europe, is a desirable object to visit. </p>

    <h2>  The oldest fortified area </h2><p>  This city was founded by Iberians, a tribe that lived in <span>Spain</span> from the III millennium BC (the official date of the founding of the city is 79 BC).  With the arrival of the Romans, who were able to assess a militarily advantageous place, a fortification fortified area was built here, and then a fortified castle, which was called Gerunda.  It was intended to protect Via Augusta, the main 1,500 km of the Iberian Peninsula road connecting Rome to Seville in those days.  And today in the old town a small dark street has been preserved - the remainder of that famous tract.  In the entire history of its existence, Girona withstood 25 sieges (only 7 times was taken), the most difficult of which was the 7-month encirclement of Napoleonic troops in 1809.  After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the city fell under Arab rule for centuries.  And this also could not but affect the architecture and general culture of the province.  The city has a unique object - the Arab baths, which have no relation to the Arabs, since it was built in 1129.  It is the only complex of its kind on the entire Iberian Peninsula.  This tourist attraction is included in all prospectuses of tours "Spain, attractions."  Girona carefully guards its historical monuments. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Name legend </h2><p>  In 1015, the city as a result of the final expulsion of the Arabs departs to the Duchy of Barcelona.  The current Girona is so beautiful and peculiar that it has several names.  Here are some of them: a city of thousands of sieges and thousands of legends, the last bridge to Africa, the first boulevard in Europe.  An interesting one of the legends of the name.  She tells how the three-headed monster Gerio, who lives in the Onyar River, ignited a passion for the beautiful Pyrenees.  Hercules himself was a successful rival to him (according to some myths, the founder of Spain). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="girona spain landmarks photo" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/473645.jpg" width="448"></div>  The girl fled from the monster and hid in the forest, which the furious monster set on fire.  The hero killed Gerio, buried his beloved, pouring mountains of stones on the grave, called the Pyrenees.  And the sons of the monster built on the site of the tragedy, on the bank of the river.  Onyar, a triangular fortress, naming it in honor of his father Gironde.

    <h2>  History of the Jewish community </h2><p>  One of the pearls of the city is its old part.  The best preserved quarter of the Jewish community, which appeared in the city in 890 and expelled from it after 600 years by the famous anti-Semites Ferdinand and Isabella.  This is one of the tragic pages in the history of Spain.  Now the quarter is called El-Call (El Call) Aliham.  The richest community in Spain contributed to the rapid prosperity of the city itself.  The Jewish quarter is a monument of medieval architecture.  This object is also recommended for a must visit in all guides called "Spain.  Sights".  Girona honors the memory of the expelled and killed - there is a very interesting museum of the history of the Jewish community. </p><h2>  Center color scheme </h2>

It is called the Rambla de la Lliibertat and is the most lively place in Girona.  There used to be a shopping area in the area, and now there are many shops, cafes and restaurants.  After the defeat of Napoleon, houses in the style of architecture of that time were erected on the site of the city wall, demolished by the French during the 7-month siege, and painted them in various colors of delicate shades.  Open Air Museum - this name is fully consistent with the city of Girona (Spain).  The sights (photos of each of them in dozens of copies from various angles can be seen in various booklets and albums) amaze with their beauty and unusualness.

    <h2>  The capital of cultural tourism </h2><p>  Catalonia is not only the richest <span>province in Spain,</span> but also one of those areas of Europe where cultural tourism is developed.  Here were born such brush masters as Dali, Tapries and Miro.  The city has beautiful museums - art, cinema, archeology, the history of the city, the Jewish community.  The Palau Firal exhibition complex, which hosts exhibitions, fairs and competitions, also operates in the city.  It is located in the famous Parc park, where the Auditori concert hall and the Palau de Congressos palace are located.  The latter are known for hosting the most significant cultural and musical events of autonomy and Spain as a whole. </p><h2>  Tourism Income </h2><p>  The city has another park, the largest in Catalonia, - Deves Park, as well as the ancient Roman wall.  I want to say that books are written about each object of the economic capital, and a simple list of them occupies a page.  The city of Girona (Spain), whose sights thousands and thousands of travelers are eager to see, takes tourism very seriously.  After all, this is an industry that brings substantial revenue to the provincial budget. </p><h2>  Student City </h2><p>  In the eastern part of the city, next to the Cathedral, is the monastery of San Domenech.  It was built in 1253.  This is one of the first buildings in Catalonia, built in the Gothic style and preserved to this day.  Moreover, it is still in use.  Within its walls is now housed the University of Girona.  Indeed, since 1823 the monastery was not used for its intended purpose.  About 1,500 professors work in it, the number of students is over 11,000 people.  Girona is considered a student city.  Most of the country's prestigious universities are in autonomy. </p><h2>  Other attractions </h2>

    <p>  Attractions include the ancient northern gate of San Cristofol, preserved in good condition to this day.  The legendary fortress wall, as befits it, goes around the entire old city.  It is interspersed with towers, of which the highest is the tower of Torre Gironella, which is famous not only for the observation deck at the top, from where you can admire the Old Town, but its history.  Outside its walls from the pogroms of 1391, when 40 people were torn to pieces by a crowd, rogue Jews hid.  The Episcopal Palace deserves attention not only because of its antiquity, but also because it houses the Girona Museum of Art. </p><h2>  You need to see everything </h2><p>  The Cathedral of the city deserves special attention, its decoration and pride.  His story is interesting.  Erected on the site of the Romanesque tomb of the X-XI centuries, it was built from 1312 to 1604, incorporating all the architectural styles that have changed over these centuries - Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque.  He is also famous for his nave, the largest in the history of Gothic architecture - 34 m high, 23 wide. The building is second only to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome by its grandeur and monumentality.  So the question, what to see in Girona (Spain), you can answer: "That's it."  These are the Episcopal Palace and the Church of San Feliu, the <span>Benedictine Monastery of</span> San Pere de Galigans and the Church of San Nicolau, the Monastery of St. Daniel and the Church of St. Philip.  Independence Square is also considered a tourist attraction and is included, like all of the above, in all avenues and guides in this extraordinary city. </p>

    <h2>  Holidays in honor of the patron </h2><p>  Girona (Spain) reviews has only enthusiastic.  Tourists especially celebrate the holidays of this city.  Like any settlement in Spain, it has its patron saint - this is Saint Narcissus.  Not only magnificent holidays are associated with this saint - Fair of St. Narcissus (October 29) and Time of Flowers (third week of May), but also the unique floral decoration of the city.  It is impossible to imagine the beauty of city stairs, decorated with flowers.  You need to see at least photos.  The figured floristry of the city is extraordinary.  This is also why Girona (Spain) is so tempting.  Sights reviews have the most positive, because the beauty of the city is indescribable. </p>
