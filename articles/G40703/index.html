    <h2>  Personal life of Ivan Semenovich </h2><p>  Ivan managed to get married before his own draft in the army in 1916.  Unfortunately, almost no data is available about his first wife.  It is known that she (the name also, unfortunately, did not remain) was a native of the same village as her husband.  A year after their marriage, a son Vladimir was baptized in a young family, baptized as Theodosius.  Ivan Semenovich Kutyakov found out about the birth of his son when he was in the army.  His first wife soon died of typhus. </p><p>  A few years later, on the fiery lines near Ural, the young Kutyakov Ivan Semenovich, whose family was far from last, met his future second wife.  Her name is Claudia Timofeevna, in the nee Dodonova.  Subsequently, they lived happily ever after; son Vladimir called his father‚Äôs second wife a mother and revered as his own. </p><h2>  Kutyakov Ivan Semenovich: books </h2><p>  Since Ivan Semenovich was an extremely well-read person and did not interrupt his own training, later education allowed him to write several works.  For the most part, books are memories of V. I. Chapaev: ‚ÄúThe Combat Path of Chapaev‚Äù, ‚ÄúVasily Ivanovich Chapaev‚Äù, ‚ÄúWith Chapaev on the Ural Steppes‚Äù.  As well as the rout of the Ural White Cossack Army, Red Cavalry and the air fleet in the deserts.  1924. "  Only about eight works, some of them were reprinted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Kutyakov Ivan Semenovich: ‚ÄúKiev Cannes‚Äù </h2><p>  There were no problems with the published works of Ivan Kutyakov.  An exception was the book ‚ÄúKiev Cannes.  1920 ".  This is a manuscript work on Soviet-Polish military operations in the 20th year of the last century.  It expressed personal thoughts and observations of the author.  Like many other participants in the wars, Ivan Semenovich also described the events taking place in the country.  However, it was this book that caused a lot of critical opinions and condemnations from the ruling elite and many of its colleagues.  As a result of public censure, the book was released only once and was not re-released. </p><p>  The book "Kiev Cannes.  1920 "  was called Kutyakov‚Äôs own loop.  The fact is that in his work, Ivan Semenovich talked a lot and colorfully about the organization of the Belopolsky military forces, their armament and alignment.  And at the same time he criticized the actions of the authorities, for his part.  Especially in the book, the activities of the First Horse Guards and other large units of military associations loomed negatively.  According to senior military officials, the book was extremely one-sided.  Moreover, when the book was read by Budyonny, he was especially indignant at the written one.  The reasons were the previous responses of the party workers and their own observations.  He argued that the book absolutely does not reflect the constructive decisions of the ruling circles and tactical moves in hostilities.  Budyonny said that this material should not be published, so as not to embarrass the youth with these statements.  After all, if the thoughts written in the book are inherently unpleasant for the experienced generation, then young people learn everything that they see or feel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  The fate of the book and its admirers </h2><p>  Later, when Stalin conducted the proceedings on this issue, the ‚ÄúKiev Cannes‚Äù loop played a negative role in the fate of Ivan Kutyakov.  He was accused of ‚Äúall mortal sins,‚Äù and the book was the last straw.  Moreover, all those who were involved in the publication of his work, as well as having read, did not report the thoughts expressed there, shared the fate of Ivan Semenovich.  Several people were repressed and subsequently shot. </p><h2>  Martyrology </h2><p>  After all the events that have occurred, we can safely say that Kutyakov Ivan Semenovich is a martyrology of his time.  The concept of ‚Äúmartyrology‚Äù is translated from Latin as ‚Äúa word about martyrs.‚Äù  In a broad sense, it refers to a list of victims of war, martyrs of social and military repression.  In his books, he tells the undisguised truth about what happened to him and his comrades.  In some ways, even too straightforward.  Especially in the "Kiev Cannes", which was mentioned above. </p>

    <h2>  Military career </h2><p>  The military service of young Ivan began at age 19, with his call.  He was sent to Astrakhan for training in an infantry regiment.  After training, he went to the city of Tsaritsyn in the officer rank (non-commissioned officer).  Accordingly, he, as an officer, was appointed to dominate the entire unit.  At this time, the First World War raged.  On it, Ivan Kutyakov moved his subordinates towards the Romanian front. </p><p>  During the 1917 revolution, Kutyakov Ivan Semenovich, whose photo you see in the article, became a Bolshevik.  After short military manipulations, Ivan Semenovich was able to return to his native village.  At that time, V.I. Chapaev was the head of the commissariat and the entire military district in the village of Shalashi (Krasnaya Rechka).  With him, Ivan Semenovich develops the most friendly relations.  A year later (1918), Chapaev headed an infantry regiment, where Kutyakov could easily join.  He was appointed head of the foot scouts, because he was in good standing. </p><p>  After the death of Chapaev, Ivan Semenovich was appointed commander of the 25th Infantry Division, which was originally based in Samara and was called the Samara Division of Zakharov.  After this, Kutyakov‚Äôs military career did not end, and for several years he was the commander of various divisions and detachments.  It is known that in Moscow several years before the execution Ivan Semenovich married one more time, and that son Alexander was born from this marriage, but the marriage quickly broke up.  However, many are questioning this information. </p>

    <h2>  Son Vladimir </h2><p>  Over time, as an adult commander, Ivan returned to his native village, where he remained with his relatives: brothers, parents and son Vladimir.  At that time, he took him with him, and later, after his second marriage, they made up a real full-fledged family.  After Kutyakov was arrested in 1937, his son did not disown him.  For this act, he was expelled from the naval school, which is located in St. Petersburg (at that time - in Leningrad). </p><p>  Time passed, events changed, during which Vladimir Kutyakov sailed.  He was at war, held engineering positions.  He created a good and strong family.  He ended his life in Samara.  After this tragic event, his family‚Äôs ties with the village of Krasnaya Rechka were terminated and are still unknown.  Where and how the direct descendants of the son of the famous Red Army live now are not known for certain. </p>

    <h2>  The character of Ivan Semenovich, according to contemporaries </h2><p>  From the memoirs of contemporaries Kutyakov, he was an unpretentious person, as well as strict rules, especially in relation to himself.  And this is not surprising, given that Ivan Semenovich began his military career when he was not yet 20 years old.  Co-workers and friends noted that Kutyakov was a modest and honest man.  And also he sought to resemble V.I. Chapaev.  He was still distinguished by his undoubted love for weapons and Peter's time.  He knew a lot about Peter I and always tried to express his own opinion. </p><p>  As indicated in the memoirs of his friends, Ivan Semenovich was somewhat embarrassed by his low education, so he studied a lot and capaciously.  He tried to cover everything that was possible: books, opera, ballet, museums, with advantage delved into debates and conversations.  He never used his official position and did not promote relatives and acquaintances in the service, did not arrange for work.  However, he was always hospitable.  When they came to visit him in Moscow, he always welcomed, placed in his house, showed the sights.  In addition, he did not forget his roots and often visited his relatives in the village of Shalashi.  When communicating with him, fellow countrymen noted that he was simple, talkative. </p>

    <h2>  The death of Kutyakov Ivan Semenovich </h2><p>  In the late 30s of the last century, Ivan Semenovich was arrested and, in many opinions, completely unreasonably repressed.  Documents about the arrest of the Red Army soldier are still kept in the school museum of the village of Krasnaya Rechka in the Pugachevsky district.  After conducting a short investigation, he was sentenced to death by shooting.  The execution was carried out a year after the arrest, at the end of 1938.  However, according to other sources, official death found Ivan Kutyakov in the second year of World War II, in 1942, September 23.  In 1956, Ivan Semenovich was posthumously rehabilitated. </p>
