  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Periodization of history</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Periodization of world history is of several types.  There is a generally accepted division on which all the peoples of the world are based ‚Äî this periodization is called classical.  Such periods are distinguished in it: prehistoric, antique, <span>medieval, early</span> new time, new time and modern. </p><p>  The prehistoric period is called primitive times, the study of the history of which is difficult due to the lack of written sources.  Any research is based on found artifacts that archaeologists discover during excavations.  Related sciences such as ethnology, biology, paleontology, geology, palynology, anthropology and archeoastronomy help to research <span>this period</span> .  So began to call this period in the nineteenth century, when interest in the study of history grew to a professional level and overcame historical amateurism.  In principle, this term can be used for any length of time in which writing did not exist.  The inconvenience of introducing precisely this principle of separation is that writing appears among different peoples at different times, therefore there is no unified end to this period. </p><p>  Periodization of history distinguishes after the development of writing the most mysterious and one of the most fruitful periods - the antique.  Usually it is identified with the history of Greece and Rome, but the beginning of the period is considered to be the beginning of the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations.  It was at this time that the first states appeared, economic and diplomatic contacts appeared, for example, with the Ancient East.  There is a written language.  In the social sphere, one can note the advantage of patrimonial relations, the beginning of metal processing and, in connection with this, the rapid development of crafts.  The same period is characterized as the period of construction of chic palaces and entire complexes.  Periodization of the history of the ancient period ends with the fall of the Roman Empire. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Middle Ages begin with the <span>fall of the Roman Empire.</span>  This period at the initial stage is characterized by a certain decline in social relations and the economy.  At this time, barbaric raids on weakened states intensified, which led to the fall of Rome in 410.  After this, such outstanding events as the <span>great migration of peoples, the</span> formation of the state of the Franks, Scandinavia, Moravia and Kievan Rus, Portugal and Spain, the Byzantine Empire can be noted.  The period from the eleventh to fourteenth century is characterized by a gradual crisis of the Frankish state, the subsequent formation of Germany and France.  The emergence of Poland and the <span>Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</span> </p><p>  The early new time is a period from the end of the fifteenth century to the middle of the seventeenth.  At this time, capitalism was emerging, although the feudal system still prevailed.  At the same time, many <span>geographical discoveries,</span> technological progress, the growth of trade and industry, changes in world perception, and the structure of society took place. </p><p>  The periodization of history after the Middle Ages considers a new time, the end of which is considered to be the end of the First World War.  At this time, radical changes took place, various sciences began to develop, in some countries there was a crisis of absolutism, and parliamentary democracy was established. </p><p>  The newest time begins with the end of the First World War.  Distinctive features of this stage are World War II, technical inventions, the formation of peacekeeping organizations, world cooperation, and the development of diplomatic ties at the world level. </p><p>  At the same time, representatives of the Marxist doctrine developed a different periodization of history based on production methods.  In <span>Soviet times,</span> it was significantly supplemented by historians, and therefore, periodization began to be called Soviet.  According to this periodization, there is primitive time, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and communism. </p><p>  Another type of periodization, the so-called ‚Äúflat‚Äù, is based on the development of a separate country, for example, there is a periodization of the history of Russia etc.  In each particular period, those stages are highlighted that are important for the history of this particular country. </p>
