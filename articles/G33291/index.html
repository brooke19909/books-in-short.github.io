    <h2>  Preparation for work </h2><p>  Before checking the Redmond RV-308 vacuum cleaner in operation, it is necessary to assemble it correctly.  First of all, insert the flexible hose into the suction port.  There is a special mount on it, so a characteristic click should sound.  Only after it can the connection be considered reliable.  Next, the hose connects to a wide part of the tube.  And on the opposite - a nozzle is installed. </p><p>  It is selected depending on the type of surface.  Now you need to install the container correctly.  In front of the case there is a special recess.  A dust collector is placed in it with the bottom to a flexible hose and is pressed down with a slight movement.  Be sure to sound a click.  It is removed even easier - the button is pressed and rises up by the handle.  After that, you can adjust the telescopic tube in height and plug the device into a power outlet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="engine for vacuum cleaner redmond rv 308" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1495471.jpg" width="500"></div>
