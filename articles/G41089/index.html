  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life after the dinosaurs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The life of dinosaurs has always been of great interest not only among biologists and paleontologists, but also among ordinary people.  Many scientists are studying it, trying to learn as much as possible about the existence of these prehistoric mammals.  Such interest is caused by the gigantic, unusual sizes of animals and their extinction. </p><p>  The era of dinosaurs lasted about 160 million years, long before the <span>first humans</span> appeared <span>.</span>  The climate in those days was different from what we can observe now.  He was wet and warm.  The terrain was mostly flat.  Earth after dinosaurs has changed significantly.  There were continents and high mountains.  The climate has also become different, more changeable. </p><p>  Life after dinosaurs went a completely different way.  But, nevertheless, humanity is constantly engaged in the study and search for new data on life before and after dinosaurs.  The period of the existence of our planet, which fell on the time before the appearance of the first people, is still not fully known. </p><p>  Life after dinosaurs proceeded in constant changes occurring in the landscape and climate of the planet.  The era of mammals began, which before that were in the shadow of giant animals.  They gradually developed and developed the territory.  Mammals have appeared, which we can observe today.  Whales became masters in the waters of the seas and oceans.  Bats and some birds reigned in the air.  Many species of mammals were very similar to modern animals.  But some have changed and in our time we see them different. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The climate was gradually changing.  He was getting colder.  The landscape of the earth changed with it.  Along with the plains appeared steppes, savannas, prairies.  New plants grew in these territories, and so the diet of animals began to change.  <span>Mammals have evolved.</span>  To digest new food, they needed strong teeth.  In order to take refuge and survive in the steppe it was necessary to run fast.  This period is marked by the appearance of <span>ungulates.</span> </p><p>  Life after dinosaurs was different depending on the continent.  Australia and South America were inhabited by animals that were slightly different from their counterparts from other parts of the world.  For example, little horses.  This is a species of mammals that have nothing to do with ordinary horses, they just look like.  Kangaroo is also a mammal, characteristic of Australia, but at the same time somewhat similar to an antelope. </p><p>  The next stage, which marked the life after the dinosaurs, was the period of the appearance of <span>tropical forests.</span>  New species of mammals gradually mastered all territories of the earth.  Among them there were already many herbivores and predators.  They lived on almost any territory of the Earth: in forests, in water and in the air.  These were already those animals that live on the planet to this day. </p><p>  The last period of evolution on Earth after the era of dinosaurs was the period of the appearance of man.  It is characterized by global climate change.  It was an ice age.  The temperature reached its minimum, and glaciers gradually covered most of some continents.  This process has occurred several times. </p><p>  As a result of <span>climate change</span> , animal evolution also took place.  They adapted to more severe living conditions.  Some have a fur coat.  The sizes of animals also changed.  Superiority was given to larger animals, which were easier to survive in such conditions. </p><p>  Man also conquered new territories.  He gradually mastered the whole Earth and changed the landscape.  People learned to kill animals and tame them.  They cut down forests and plowed the land.  Many <span>herbivorous animals</span> began to live in herds at home.  Life after dinosaurs has already changed significantly.  And by that time many millions of years had passed ... </p>
