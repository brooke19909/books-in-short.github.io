  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian Truth of Yaroslav the Wise</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  "Russian Truth" by Yaroslav the Wise is considered an outstanding monument of the history of Russian law.  Her lists have reached today in a fairly large number.  However, a unified classification was not adopted. </p><p>  The Code of Laws "Russian Truth" was a code of feudal law of Ancient Russia.  Its norms are taken as the basis of court certificates (Novgorod and Pskov), as well as future legislative documents of Russian as well as Lithuanian law. </p><p>  The "Russian Truth" by Yaroslav the Wise appeared after an era in which the unification of the rural population was characterized as a <span>neighboring community.</span>  She, in turn, arose as a result of the decomposition of the family community. </p><p>  ‚ÄúThe Truth of Yaroslav the Wise‚Äù is the oldest part of the legal code.  It reflects the older norms adopted during the reign of the prince.  This part of the code contains sixteen articles, followed by many laws issued by the sons of Yaroslav from the middle of the 11th to the beginning of the 13th century (The Truth of the Yaroslavichi). </p><p>  The basis of the content of the code are acts reflecting the interests of princely administration.  Comparing its individual parts, one can clearly see the expansion of the power of the princes and the princely court. </p><p>  The ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù of Yaroslav the Wise determined the legal status of the population. Moreover, each <span>feudal society</span> included estates, the duties and rights of which were clearly defined by the law as unequal. Inequality was observed both in the relations between estates and in relation to the state. </p><p>  It should be noted that in that era there was a certain static in the development of society, which the state tried to consolidate by law.  The social structure of Russia was based on slavery.  Its most severe manifestations are noted in the 9-10 centuries, in the early stages of the emergence of statehood. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù of Yaroslav the Wise defined the serf as the property of the master, while the serf himself did not possess property. </p><p>  The formation of the feudal class took place gradually.  He included the squad, princes, the local nobility and others.  Civil control was carried out by feudal lords, in addition, they were also responsible for the military organization.  The legislation provided for the collection of tribute and court fines from the population, which went to ensure management functions. </p><p>  For the settlement of the vassal and land relations of the feudal lords, as well as their relationship with the <span>Grand Duke,</span> apparently, there were special agreements.  "Russian Truth" reveals only certain aspects of the legal status of the feudal estate. </p><p>  The legal code of the Ancient State establishes and protection of property.  For infringements, violations, thefts, rather high fines were established. </p><p>  An integral part of the law was the formation of the responsibilities of the population in relation to the government.  Numerous taxes were assigned in the form of quitrents, tributes. </p><p>  In the legislation of Yaroslav, there were some provisions that tried to establish the status of "stink".  Legal acts considered not only the determination of his status, but also legal capacity and obligations.  There are indications of various fines imposed on the smerds.  However, despite the fact that the ‚ÄúRussian Truth‚Äù, if necessary, in a legislative act indicates belonging to a specific (social) group, the concept and status of ‚Äúsmerd‚Äù is interpreted in the code very vaguely. </p><p>  The free population in the cities was provided with legal protection for the acts of Russian Truth.  Particular attention was paid to the merchants, who early began to form associations (guilds). </p><p>  It should be noted that the development of Ancient Russia took place in the same direction as in the largest European countries.  The Russian state of that time is characterized by historians as a country with a highly developed legal sphere and great cultural potential. </p>
