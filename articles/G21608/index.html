    <h2>  UK: Royal Family </h2><p>  Despite the fact that in England there is no strict definition (neither legal nor formal) of the members of the monarch's family, nevertheless, they are usually considered the following persons: the monarch himself (king and queen), the spouse of the queen (if he is not king ), children of the monarch and their spouses, children of the sons of the monarch (i.e. grandchildren on the male line) and their wives (husbands).  The king and queen of Great Britain bear the title Her (His) Royal Majesty, and the rest of the family are their Royal Highnesses.  They are considered princes and princesses.  In earlier times, each member of the monarchical family represented the king (queen) throughout the country, holding responsible public posts.  The transition to a constitutional monarchy has changed a lot in the kingdom of Great Britain: the royal family has lost many of its powers, and today its members perform only social and ceremonial functions both within the kingdom and abroad.  The same applies to the role of the queen in state affairs.  The country is governed by a cabinet responsible for parliament.  However, she has a <span>veto power,</span> and she can, at her own discretion, dissolve parliament and call new elections, etc. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="UK: Royal Family" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/321101.jpg" width="600"></div>

However, during the First World War, when England was in enemy relations with Germany, King George the Fifth renounced Saxon and other German titles, renaming the former dynasty into the House of the Windsor.  The monarchs of this dynasty were <span>George the Fifth,</span> who reigned from 1910 to 1936, Eduard the Eighth, who was immediately succeeded by George Six, the father of the current queen, who ruled the kingdom for 16 years, and Elizabeth II, the now surviving Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  The royal family, in spite of occasional minor scandals, nevertheless enjoys great love and respect in the country.  Any event concerning them, both joyful and sad, the people accept as their own.  In this country, one of the most favorite holidays is the birthday of the beloved queen.
