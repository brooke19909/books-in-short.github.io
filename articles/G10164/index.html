At the very beginning of its existence, this settlement was called Kularo and was a small settlement.  But over time, he grew into a stunning modern city, whose population exceeds 150 thousand people.  Today Grenoble boasts luxurious sights and a chic cultural and historical heritage.  There are a dozen museums here, including the Stendhal Museum, Notre Dame Cathedral, Crypt Saint Laurent, the world famous university and many other architectural objects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grenoble france" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1340624.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  A bit about the city </h2><p>  The city of Grenoble, France, is unofficially called the capital of the <span>French Alps,</span> as it is very close to the mountains.  But at the same time he is considered the most flat on the European continent.  The village is located at the confluence of the Drak and Ysera rivers, it is surrounded by mountain peaks, but despite this fact, the landscape of Grenoble does not look like a hilly even remotely.  Here, ancient architecture harmoniously coexists with modern.  And the same city is considered the university center of the country. </p><p>  Grenoble (France) is a popular and famous city.  Here Stendhal himself was born, and the local population is incredibly proud of this fact.  In 1968, when the village became the capital of the Winter Olympics, it became famous throughout the world.  It is also interesting that a series of events in the sensational novel "Perfumer" takes place in Grenoble. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grenoble france sights" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1340623.jpg" width="480"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Brief History </h2><p>  In the first century BC, in the place where the city of Grenoble is located today (France), the first fortified settlement appeared, which was called Cularo.  Its founder was the tribe of allobrogs.  And in the III century AD, the settlement was given the status of a city.  In 381, he was named Grazianopolis in honor of one of the Roman emperors.  But as a result of linguistic changes, the name Grazianopolis was transformed into the modern name Grenoble.  During its long history, the settlement was also part of the feudal formation of Dauphine and in the kingdom of Provence.  It was in Grenoble that the French Revolution started, which dramatically changed the history of not only the city itself, but the whole country.  That is why French Grenoble is rightfully called the iconic city. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Grenoble <span>(France),</span> whose <span>attractions are</span> known to travelers of the whole earth, placed the Bastille fortress on its expanses.  In the 16th century, a defensive structure was located at the site of the facility.  The Bastille acquired its modern appearance only in the 19th century.  Today, the fortress is only a sightseeing object. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="grenoble city france" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1340622.jpg" width="600"></div>

It connects the Bastille with the historic city center.  In 1934, a funicular was created, the booths of which looked like a twelve-sided and could transport about 15 people at the same time.  In 1976, when the "cable car" acquired its present appearance, it also became an urban symbol. </p><p>  Another local attraction that all tourists are trying to see are three multi-story tower houses.  They were erected at the beginning of the 1968 Olympics.  Despite the fact that the building was built in the middle of the last century, it still has a completely modern look. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="university of grenoble france" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41970/1340625.jpg" width="500"></div>
