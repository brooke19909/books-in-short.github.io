Abzelilovsky is adjacent to the following areas of Bashkiria: Beloretsky, Uchalinsky, Burzyansky and Baymaksky, as well as the Chelyabinsk region.  The length of its territory from north to south is 200 km, and from west to east - 120 km.  The administrative district center is the village of Askarovo.

Winds in the region prevail in a westerly direction; therefore, all adverse emissions from enterprises are sideways. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bashkortostan Abzelilovsky district" class="if" height="278" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/470088.jpg" width="413"></div>  The territory of the district is geographically divided into mountain-forest (western part) and plain-steppe (eastern part) zones.  On the plains, they are mainly engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture.  The mountainous zone is famous for its unique natural monuments and resorts.  Its ridges are Uraltau, Kirkitau and Arendyk, whose height is about 1000 meters.
