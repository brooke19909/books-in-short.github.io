  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Installation methods and solar connection diagram</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The popularity of alternative energy sources is increasing every day.  Solar panels - one of these sources - have an indisputable advantage - inexhaustibility.  Solar panels efficiently collect and accumulate the energy of the Sun, redirecting it to the power of technology. </p><h2>  Features and types </h2><div class="photo" data-original="unsplash.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="solar connection diagram" class="if uuid-3192005" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3192005.jpg"></div><p>  Today, the most common batteries based on photovoltaic polycrystals.  Such models combine optimal cost and a large amount of generated energy;  they are characterized by a crystalline structure and a bright blue color.  The simplicity of the scheme for connecting solar panels allows you to independently install them in a private house. </p><p>  In terms of efficiency, photovoltaic panels are more effective than polycrystalline analogs, despite the fact that their price is higher, and installation is more complicated.  They are characterized by a polygonal shape of the filling elements. </p><p>  Significantly less effective are solar panels made of amorphous silicon.  However, this does not prevent them from being in demand among the owners of country houses due to their affordable cost.  Their production is based on film technology: a layer of micrometers of cadmium telluride is deposited on a surface of high strength.  Despite the low level of efficiency, such solar cell models have high power. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Varieties of solar panels based on the CIGS semiconductor are based on film technology and are highly efficient.  It is worth noting that the amount of energy generated does not depend on the efficiency of the device, since the power of all of them is almost identical. </p><h2>  Benefits of Solar Panels </h2><ul><li>  Eco-friendly installation. </li><li>  Long service life while maintaining performance. </li><li>  No need for expensive repairs, maintenance and service due to a rare failure. </li><li>  Reduced gas and electricity consumption in the home through the use of solar panels. </li><li>  Simplicity of operation. </li></ul><h2>  disadvantages </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.vox.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="connecting the solar battery to the battery circuit" class="if uuid-3192006" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3192006.jpg"></div><p>  Among the most significant disadvantages, the following are noted: </p><ul><li>  The high cost of the panels. </li><li>  The need to install additional equipment for more efficient energy distribution. </li><li>  Solar panels cannot work with devices requiring high power. </li></ul><h2>  Wiring diagram </h2><p>  Solar panels produce energy that cannot directly power electrical appliances.  The necessary voltage is converted using inverters connected to the circuit between the main consumer and the panel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are three main schemes for connecting solar panels. </p><h2>  Offline connection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.azocleantech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wiring diagrams for solar controllers" class="if uuid-3192007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3192007.jpg"></div><p>  The scheme for connecting solar panels, most often used in areas with no centralized power supply network.  Includes high power batteries.  They operate on the principle of energy storage in the daytime.  The generated energy is redirected to the energy network with insufficient lighting. </p><h2>  Backup Connection </h2><p>  The installation diagram and method of connecting the solar battery, suitable for use subject to the availability of centralized power supply via AC.  The backup system is used as a backup option, which is resorted to in the event of an emergency.  For country houses and cottages, power outages are not uncommon, so many consumers resort to additional opportunities for obtaining light and heat. </p><h2>  Serial connection </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.stroy-podskazka.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="serial connection" class="if uuid-3193199" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/3193199.jpg"></div><p>  The scheme for connecting solar panels to a country house, implying excessive energy generation and its subsequent supply to the network.  The method is quite popular and is used in the electrification of private houses. </p><h2>  Installation </h2><p>  According to the above schemes of connecting to the battery, solar panels are mounted on a special design that ensures the resistance of solar cells to the effects of adverse atmospheric influences and forms a specific angle of inclination. </p><p>  A similar design is offered in several versions: </p><ul><li>  Inclined.  Ideal for installation on pitched roofs. </li><li>  Horizontal.  The design, which is mounted on flat roofs. </li><li>  Freestanding.  Solar panels suitable for any type of roof. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wiring diagrams and methods for connecting solar panels" class="if uuid-3192011" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3192011.jpg"></div><p>  For installation, the following connection diagram of the solar battery for the home is used: </p><ul><li>  The frame is fastened with metal angles of 50x50 mm in size, spacer bars - with 25x25 mm squares.  Details provide strength and reliability of the entire structure and give the necessary angle of inclination. </li><li>  To assemble the frame, bolts of 6 and 8 mm are required. </li><li>  Under the roof, the structure is mounted with 12 mm studs. </li><li>  In metal squares, holes are drilled through which the panels are fixed.  Screws provide a strong connection. </li><li>  The frame must be assembled as accurately as possible and without distortions.  The presence of errors and distortions can lead to an overstrain of the system and cracking of the panels. </li></ul><p>  The scheme for connecting solar panels to the balcony or loggia network in the apartment is similar.  The difference lies only in fixing the structure to an inclined surface: it is placed between the end and the wall of the building, always with the access of the sun. </p><p>  It is possible to use the wiring diagrams of solar controllers without the appropriate experience, but installation skills may be required.  Self-installation allows you to save on the services of specialists. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.revisionenergy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="network connection of solar panels" class="if uuid-3192010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3192010.jpg"></div><p>  Experts recommend adhering to several criteria when installing and connecting solar panels: </p><ul><li>  Devices using alternative energy sources are most often placed on walls or roofs of buildings.  A little less often resort to high-strength supports.  The batteries should be oriented in such a way that the shadow of nearby objects does not fall on them. </li><li>  The plates are mounted in parallel rows, while the above rows should not overlap those that are under them.  This requirement must be observed, since partial or total shading can lead to a reduction or cessation of energy production.  Do not exclude the effect of "reverse currents" that can disable equipment. </li><li>  The effectiveness of the panels directly depends on their proper orientation with respect to sunlight.  The entire surface of the battery should receive a full stream of ultraviolet rays.  The calculation of the correct orientation is carried out on the basis of data on the geographical location of the building. </li><li>  The geographic position of the structure also determines the angle of inclination of the structure.  This indicator is based on the latitude of the coordinates of the house;  due to the fact that the sun constantly changes its position over the horizon during the year, the possibility of adjusting the angle of inclination of the panels is calculated.  The maximum correction angle in most cases does not exceed 12 degrees. </li><li>  Installation of batteries is carried out with ensuring free access to them.  This is required to simplify the cleaning of panels from traces of atmospheric precipitation, which significantly reduces the efficiency of battery operation. </li><li>  A wide range of solar panels of different price categories of European and Asian manufacturers allows the consumer to choose the best model. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.entitymag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ways to connect solar panels" class="if uuid-3192012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/3192012.jpg"></div><p>  The main supplier of alternative energy are solar panels, which guarantee high energy efficiency not only on clear, but also on cloudy days.  To provide the building with food, the purchase of special equipment and its proper installation are required.  This can be done both independently and with the assistance of specialists. </p><p>  There are several schemes for installing and connecting solar panels.  Ways to install batteries vary depending on the geographical location, climate in a particular region, powered equipment and electrical appliances, as well as the type of building they are being built on. </p>
