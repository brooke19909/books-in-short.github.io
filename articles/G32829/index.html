Even despite the somewhat higher cost of tours for Turkey, many Russians were satisfied.  The food is quite varied, tasty.  Two or three times a week you can taste delicious red fish.  On the trays there is always an abundance of salads, oriental sweets.  Many celebrate delicious soups. </p><p>  Parents resting with small children, in their reviews, separately note the presence of a blender in the main restaurant.  Not all five-star hotels offer this service. </p><p>  As for the number of rooms, here opinions differ.  Some of our fellow countrymen are unhappy that old televisions are installed in the rooms, although for many this circumstance was absolutely not relevant.  Most tourists come to this hotel complex in order to swim, sunbathe and enjoy the natural environment.  There are several reviews of Russians that at night, even in the high season, centralized air conditioning is turned off. </p><p>  There are also some complaints about the work of the staff.  In the reviews, some express dissatisfaction with the quality of the cleaning of the rooms, as well as the fact that towels are changed infrequently. </p><p>  The beach in the vast majority of reviews by Russians is rated the highest.  It is just a two-minute walk, has fine sand cover and all the necessary infrastructure.  The only drawback that is noted in some reviews is the insufficient number of sunbeds.  You have to occupy the sun loungers in the early morning, as there are no empty seats at noon. </p><p>  To summarize, we can say that the territory, beach, sea and location of the hotel are rated at the highest score - "five", food and service - at the "four".  The "three" are cleaned in the rooms. </p><p>  In conclusion, it can be noted that many of our compatriots express a desire to once again return to this hotel.  Those who are categorically dissatisfied with their vacation are rare units. </p>
