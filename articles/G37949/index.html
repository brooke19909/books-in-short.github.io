Holidays in Iceland in winter and summer</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Iceland is the world's largest volcanic island.  An amazing place where ice and flame coexist is a popular tourist destination.  If you do not know when it is better to go to Iceland, our article will help you understand this issue. </p><h2>  Reasons to visit Iceland </h2><p>  Not all travelers love warm countries and beach vacations.  Some tourists are impressed by the cold beauty of the northern regions.  Iceland is a very interesting area in this regard.  This wonderful country surprises and fascinates with its natural beauties. </p><p>  Iceland is an island nation located on the very edge of Europe.  The country impresses guests with its northern exoticism.  Here you can see contrasting phenomena such as millennial glaciers and hot geysers, roaring waterfalls and lavender fields, beautiful national parks and rocky fjords.  An amazing country can impress even the most seasoned travelers. </p><p>  According to agencies, currently there is a tendency to increase the interest of tourists in Iceland.  But still, the flows of foreign travelers cannot be called powerful.  Not as many tourists enter the country as we would like.  Probably the considerable cost of the rest and flight affects.  And the tourist season on the island does not last long - from June to September.  Many inexperienced travelers wonder: "When is the best time to go to Iceland?"  Much depends on what exactly you want to see in this amazing country. </p><h2>  Some features of the country </h2><p>  Not sure when to go to Iceland?  Choose a high season for your first trip.  It was at this time that the largest number of travelers came to the country, because in the summer warm weather is established on the island.  Experts say that up to 600 thousand guests are arriving in Iceland at this time.  And this despite the fact that the indigenous population of the country does not exceed 320 thousand! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tours to Iceland from Moscow are becoming increasingly popular.  Of course, not many operators are still working in this direction, since it is not as demanded as exotic countries.  The increase in demand for such tours greatly inhibits the geographical position of the country.  Getting to the island state is more difficult than in other directions.  In addition, holidays in Iceland can not be called budget. </p><p>  The restraining factor is the complicated visa procedure.  True, not so long ago there was a tendency to improve the situation.  In the summer, direct charter flights were introduced from Moscow and St. Petersburg to Reykjavik.  How profitable such flights can be understood over time.  Currently, the state of Iceland has been visited by no more than 50 thousand Russian citizens. </p><h2>  Low season </h2><p>  When it is better to go to Iceland, you decide.  The low season on the island, by our standards, begins very early.  In mid-September, most hotels are closed because weather conditions are getting worse, and buses run less and less.  But rest in Iceland in winter is much cheaper than in summer.  Hotels that receive guests in the winter significantly reduce the price in the low season.  The cost of living is getting cheaper by 30-40 percent.  Yes, and renting a car in winter will be much cheaper.  Having a car will allow you to freely move around the island.  The only thing that can interfere with movement is <span>snowdrifts,</span> so the car must be selected wisely so that it can move along snowy tracks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It would seem that no questions should arise when it is better to go on vacation to Iceland.  Of course, in the high season.  But if you think about it, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgoing to the island in the low season is not so bad.  The peculiarity of Iceland lies in its harsh climate, which for tourists may seem unbearable.  But during the low season, you can significantly save on accommodation.  In general, there are advantages at any time of the year. </p><p>  A separate topic for conversation is tours in late autumn and early winter.  New Year holidays and Christmas romance will complement the journey to the snowy country.  In addition, at this time in Iceland you can admire a unique natural phenomenon that makes an indelible impression on all tourists - Aurora Borealis. </p><h2>  The best period for excursions </h2><p>  Tours to Iceland are preferred by those people who want to escape to the ends of the world in order to relax their soul and body.  The island is located near the Arctic Circle and is the northernmost European country.  The fantastic landscapes of Iceland are the craters of active and extinct volcanoes.  Such landscapes seem ethereal to guests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iamreykjavik.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iceland in the spring" class="if uuid-2925299" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925299.jpg"></div><p>  Experienced tourists recommend visiting the Valley of Geysers, seeing the lair of Huckle Volcano and the multi-tiered Gudlfoss waterfall, the noise of which is heard long before approaching it.  Ancient customs and traditions, carefully preserved for centuries by local residents, are no less interesting for tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In order to fully admire all these beauties, it is better to go on a vacation to Iceland in the summer.  At this time of the year, warmer weather sets in, and local landscapes delight guests with lush greenery. </p><h2>  Climate of Iceland </h2><p>  To accurately characterize Iceland, it should be said that it is incredibly contrasting.  This becomes clear at a glance at the landscapes of the island, where hot springs and glaciers peacefully coexist.  The climate of Iceland is quite severe, and the weather is unpredictable.  Most of the island is covered with glaciers.  If not for the warm Gulf Stream, then the country would be subarctic.  But in Iceland, thanks to the Atlantic, mild winters and cool and short summers.  The local climate is considered useful despite the fact that winds blow throughout the year.  The average life expectancy of the local population is 79.5 years. </p><p>  In spring, nature comes to life on the island, and ice floes off the coast.  The air temperature reaches +7 ... + 10 degrees.  Birds return to Iceland from the south, and the landscapes become more colorful.  The meltwater of the glaciers intensively nourish the waterfalls, which are gaining full strength.  In spring, the weather remains unstable and changes very quickly. </p><h2>  Summer season </h2><p>  During the summer period in Iceland comes the time of white nights.  The warmest time on the island is July.  At this time, the air temperature reaches +15 ... + 20 degrees.  July and August in Iceland is the peak of the high season.  According to experts, it is at this time that it is best to visit the Blue Lagoon.  The spa will delight with its open-air hot springs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.studyabroad.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iceland in the summer" class="if uuid-2925298" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925298.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that there are practically no trees in Iceland.  But there is a lot of greenery in large greenhouses and greenhouses heated by underground sources.  A tourist is definitely worth a visit to the Eden Park, which is loved by locals.  Despite the scarcity of the plant world, with the advent of summer, the rarest birds that live here flock to the island. </p><h2>  Autumn in Iceland </h2><p>  September on the island can be considered a relatively "summer" month.  But in October there is a sharp deterioration in the weather, which is explained by the arrival of cyclones.  In November, a dark period begins.  At this time, the sun is low, and the duration of daylight hours does not exceed five hours.  For this reason, the cost of tours from September to April is significantly reduced.  But at the same time, the nature on the island at that time is majestic and beautiful.  A lot of ash is applied to the snowless endless fields by the wind.  The volcanoes of Iceland erupt directly under the ice.  Such a sight is something amazing! </p><h2>  Winter </h2><p>  There is no polar night on the island.  But the sun is at a height of several degrees.  This period lasts from November to early February.  In Iceland in winter you can admire the northern lights.  Active volcanoes, giant glaciers and fjords fascinate with their beauty. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.followmeaway.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iceland in the winter" class="if uuid-2925302" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925302.jpg"></div><p>  Rains are a common occurrence in Iceland.  Most of them fall in autumn and winter.  There are no heavy downpours and thunderstorms on the island.  Precipitation falls in the form of a light drizzle.  Far more inconvenient are the winds that blow here all the time.  On average, the temperature in winter does not drop below zero degrees.  But this does not mean that such a temperature always prevails.  At night, the temperature usually drops to -4 degrees.  In the coldest periods, the island does not fall below -10 degrees.  Snow falls less often in cities, but it melts quickly thanks to the Gulf Stream.  In the inner part of the island, more severe colds are possible.  The temperature here can drop to -20 degrees. </p><h2>  Fishing season </h2><p>  The island has developed fishing sport.  There are so many fish that it is enough for all tourists.  The sea in Iceland is an ideal place for fishing, no one returns without a catch.  The reason for this is the warm Gulf Stream, which brings schools of fish.  The river fishing season lasts from June to October.  At the same time, salmon is best caught.  You can go to sea all year long, but you should pay attention to the weather. </p><h2>  Whale watching season </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but Iceland is one of those countries that attracts nature lovers.  On its coast you can watch such amazing creatures as whales.  The best time to watch them is from mid-spring to September. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inspiredbyiceland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Whales in Iceland" class="if uuid-2925305" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925305.jpg"></div><p>  Places such as Hervey and Fahsaflows are most attractive in this respect. </p><h2>  Valley of Geysers </h2><p>  In the south of the island is the famous Valley of Geysers.  This place is an open-air thermal spa.  Near the sources are equipped institutions for the treatment of various ailments.  Healing water has a rejuvenating and healing effect.  Blue Lagoon is considered one of the symbols of the country.  The average temperature of the water in the springs is approximately +37 degrees.  In winter, locals come here to keep warm.  It is believed that the best effect of thermal baths is observed after taking them in cold and cloudy weather.  In the summer, bathing is quite difficult. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.royalcaribbean.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Thermal geysers" class="if uuid-2925294" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925294.jpg"></div><p>  Not far from the Valley of Geysers is the active volcano Hekla.  The most famous geyser of the valley is the Big Geyser, or Geysir. </p><p>  It is worth noting that local residents actively use hot springs.  The famous valley heats 85% of residential buildings, which makes it possible not to use oil products. </p><h2>  Volcanoes of the island </h2><p>  Iceland is known not only for its amazing geysers, but also for active volcanoes.  In total, there are 35 volcanoes in Iceland.  Eyyafyatlayokudl - one of the most famous among them.  It is located in the south of the island, 125 kilometers from Reykjavik. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hellotravel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Volcanoes of the island" class="if uuid-2925313" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925313.jpg"></div><p>  The last major volcanic eruption was observed in 1821-1823.  Over the next 200 years, it was believed that it was sleeping and was under a layer of ice.  However, in 2010, seismologists in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe volcano discovered significant underground activity, which was accompanied by tremors.  Soon, an active eruption began.  Volcanoes Hekla, Askya, Grimsvotn are not less interesting for tourists. </p><h2>  Black beach </h2><p>  The beaches of Iceland impress with their beauty.  There are not many places in the world that can boast of black sand.  One of them is located in Iceland, in the province of Reinisfj√§ra.  The local coast is called ‚ÄúBlack Beach‚Äù.  It is unusually beautiful and covered with dark boulders and sand. </p><p>  According to legend, large stones were trolls, which were petrified due to the fact that they did not have time to hide from the sun's rays.  The local attraction is the ‚ÄúTroll's Fingers‚Äù - basalt columns that go straight into the sea.  They are perfectly visible from the ‚ÄúBlack Beach‚Äù, which is 180 kilometers from Reykjavik. </p><div class="photo" data-original="adventurousmiriam.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Black beach" class="if uuid-2925311" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925311.jpg"></div><p>  The coast of the province is covered with unusual black sand.  The reason for the appearance of a coating of such an unusual color lies in local volcanoes.  During the eruption, black lava flowed into the sea, after which it froze.  Subsequently, the water for many years broke it into small pieces of pebbles.  Gradually formed black sand.  Now tourists can admire the five-kilometer dark-covered beach.  This place is one of the most popular among visitors to Iceland.  Of course, the local coast is not interesting from the point of view of swimming, but Black Beach is one of the top ten in the world. </p><h2>  Waterfalls </h2><p>  There are many interesting places on the island of volcanoes and geysers that are of interest to tourists.  As a rule, many travelers go to see the natural beauty of the island, which should include waterfalls.  In Iceland, exploring waterfalls is a popular destination for tourism.  Local travel agencies offer jeep tours to enjoy the natural elements. </p><p>  One of the most famous waterfalls is Gudlfoss, which is located near the Eyyafyatlayokyudl volcano.  Its waters flow from a height of 60 meters.  The width of the waterfall reaches 25 meters.  There are other scenic spots upstream.  A striking feature of the stunning waterfall is the rainbow, which can be seen above it in the morning. </p><p>  No less famous is his other brother, Dettifoss, who is considered the most powerful in all of Europe.  It makes an amazing impression on tourists, as it strikes with power.  The waterfall is located on a glacial river in the national park.  Canyons in this region are compared with the Great American.  Dettifoss reaches a width of 100 meters.  The raging monster is white in color, since the source of the river is fed from a glacier having chalky sediments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.extremeiceland.is" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Iceland Waterfalls" class="if uuid-2925314" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2925314.jpg"></div><p>  In Iceland, a two-level waterfall called Gudlfoss is incredibly popular.  It extends over the entire width of the river.  Its upper tier reaches 11 meters, the lower - 21. Fog is the main feature of the waterfall.  During excursions, local guides tell the tourist why it is always damp and twilight reigns here.  G√ºdlfoss is on the golden list of outstanding sights of Iceland. </p><p>  The waterfalls of the island are certainly worth a visit.  They are most full in spring and early summer. </p><h2>  Popular tours </h2><p>  Although trips to Iceland are not as popular as tropical islands, some travel agencies in Moscow and St. Petersburg offer trips to the island. </p><p>  As a rule, tours from Moscow to Iceland include a visit to Reykjavik, the Valley of Geysers, and the southern coast.  The travel plan may be a little different.  A standard tour is designed for seven days, its cost for two ranges from 19-20 thousand rubles.  If you decide to visit the island during low season, the cost of travel will be different. </p><p>  As we already mentioned, Iceland is full of stunning natural beauties worth seeing.  If you wish, you can specify other options for tours, which will include visits to national parks, waterfalls and other attractions.  Directly in Iceland, you can order for yourself not only group excursions in the areas of interest to you, but individual.  Tourism is very actively developing on the island.  And local guides are able to offer a variety of tours based on the wishes of tourists. </p>
