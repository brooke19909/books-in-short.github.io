And the Imatra waterfall itself was formed more than five thousand years ago.  In general, Finland’s waterfalls differ from the traditional concept of this natural phenomenon.  Water does not rush with noise and roar down, it seems to step over thresholds.  Hence the Finnish name - Imatrankoski, because "koski" in Finnish means "threshold".  The base of the waterfall is a stone crevice, through which water rushes with great speed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imatra Waterfall" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/275470.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, this waterfall was especially popular.  In the 20s of the 19th century.  The journey from St. Petersburg to Imatra took two days.  Later, a hotel palace was built here.  After Finland gained independence, there were fewer tourists, but Imatra Falls still had to be beneficial.  The Finns set up a dam and built a hydroelectric power station.  By the way, for its construction invited the best craftsmen and designers.  This hydroelectric power station has become the largest in the country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imatra waterfall" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/275240.jpg" width="600"></div>  Now you can see the mentioned miracle of nature only at a certain time.  Imatra waterfall, the schedule of which needs to be known in advance so as not to come in vain, now looks more like an attraction.  At certain hours and days, water is released when the shutters of the power plant open.  Extreme lovers can also cross the waterfall by <span>cable car.</span>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sights of Imatra </p><p>  Historical monuments, architectural sights and museums - this is what Imatra is famous for.  Waterfall is not its only advantage.  In the vicinity of Imatrankoski, the Grand Hotel Cascade is located (as it was originally called).  The multi-storey white building, decorated with turrets, was built at the very beginning of the 20th century.  In this castle-hotel, Nicholas II once rested.  They say that you cannot find two identical numbers here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights of imatra" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/275486.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  An unusual and somewhat sinister monument is located near the bridge over the Imatra Falls.  This is a figure of the virgin Imatra disappearing under water.  It is believed that the spirit of the waterfall lures suicides into its nets.  No matter how wild it may sound, but every year a lot of people come here who really want to end their lives in this particular waterfall.  At the beginning of the 20th century, a law was even passed in Russia, according to which it was forbidden to sell one-way tickets there.  On both sides of the gorge there are old arbors.  But now it’s unlikely that they will be able to admire the beauty of Imatra, because the edges of the abyss are blocked by several rows of walls - for safety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imatra waterfall timetable" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14440/275239.jpg" width="341"></div>

    <p>  Of interest are the streets of the town itself, in which there are many churches and chapels.  The picturesque nature of Imatra involves walking and admiring the local beauties.  There are also small-town history museums telling about the settlement; ancient manors have also been preserved.  In the summer, tourists will appreciate the local flora.  Especially good is the green of the grass combined with rocks that grow as if directly from the ground. </p>
