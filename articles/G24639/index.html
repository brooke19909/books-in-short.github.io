However, they began to show special interest after it was announced that Sochi would become the venue for the 2014 Olympics.  As a result of the tremendous work on the territory of the city and in its environs, new ultra-modern sports and entertainment infrastructure facilities were created that today make recreation in the Krasnodar Territory even more interesting and comfortable.  Among the best accommodation options, tourists already vacationing in the southern capital of Russia, invariably call the Olympic-Dagomys pension in Sochi, well-known throughout the former USSR.  It is located in a picturesque place with abundant vegetation, surrounded by majestic mountains, a few hundred meters from the sea. </p>

    <p>  Olimpiysky is also a good venue for outdoor activities.  For example, you can use an open area with a platform for 500 participants or rent a platform by the pool (designed for 50 people).  In both cases, lighting, music equipment, and furniture for congresses are provided. </p><p>  In addition, the boarding house has a meeting room where you can hold a business meeting or meeting in a narrow circle. </p><h2>  Pension Olimpiysky-Dagomys: (Sochi): reviews </h2><p>  Since this medical institution has been operating since the beginning of the 1980s, several hundred thousand people from all over the former Soviet Union managed to visit there.  From them you can hear both positive and negative reviews.  If we talk about the impressions of those who spent their holidays at the Olimpiysky boarding house in the past two years, most of them are positive, although some do not like the fact that the color inherent in the boarding houses of the Soviet period was preserved there.  Especially a lot of praise can be heard about those involved in catering, as well as about the cleanliness and condition of the number of rooms.  With regard to issues regarding which tourists express dissatisfaction most often, this is primarily the lack of animation for adults and the remoteness of the beach from the residential building.  The last inconvenience, however, is significantly mitigated by the transfer, which is carried out from 8:00 to 19:00 with a break of 10 minutes.  However, tourists see flaws in this matter, as return flights are carried out with a long break. </p><h2>  Pension Olimpiysky-Dagomys (Sochi): contacts </h2><p>  The address of this is the institution st.  Leningradskaya 7-A.  Before deciding whether it is worth spending a summer vacation at Olimpiysky, you can clarify all the details for free by calling 8 (800) -333-1818 (for calls exclusively from ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù numbers).  You can also call the accommodation service (+7 (862) 252-2011). </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  In the Krasnodar Territory, especially after modernizing the infrastructure in preparation for the Olympics, transport links between settlements and resorts are well developed.  Therefore, those who have purchased tickets to the Dagomys-Olimpiysky boarding house will have no difficulty getting there.  For example, you can take the following route: from Adler airport, take any regular transport to the Sochi bus station, and then transfer to any bus that follows one of the routes N 153, 156, 154, 157 to the Tea Factory stop. </p><h2>  Transfer </h2><p>  Those who want to get to the boarding house and from the boarding house to the airport or railway station with comfort can use the shuttle service.  In this case, they will be delivered to their destination on a foreign car with air conditioning or Toyota Camry.  The cost of the service in the case when the end or starting point of the route is Adler‚Äôs airport will be 750 or 1,500 rubles, depending on the class of car.  If you need to get to the Sochi railway station, then such a service will cost 1,000 or 2,400 rubles, respectively. </p><p>  Now you know what level of service the Olympic Hotel-Sochi boarding house can offer you, and you can make the right choice. </p>
