But agree that for a certain price it‚Äôs nice not to buy just a piece of plastic and iron that can work with two cellular components at the same time, namely a stylish, beautiful, convenient and functional device.  At the same time, the ‚Äúendurance‚Äù of the device plays an important role.  It is unlikely that someone will want to use a phone whose charge lasts for 4-6 hours of battery life. </p><h2>  Introduction </h2>

    <p>  What does all this say?  More recently, LG introduced a device called the Optimus L5.  So, the subject of our review today - II Dual E455 - was a logical continuation of the model of the device that was released earlier.  The smartphone can be without exaggeration called the second part of this story. </p><h2>  Background </h2>

    <p>  Let's agree to call the Optimus L5 the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù of the model we are observing today.  So it will be more correct, agree?  So, the ‚Äúelder brother‚Äù of the object of our review was distinguished by very, very high technical characteristics.  If we take the L5 and compare it with similar models from other manufacturers in this price class, then the advantage of the first will be noticeable to the naked eye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But, as you know, nothing perfect happens in our world.  And if there is any plus, then there will always be a minus on it.  In the case of L5, the smartphone screen became a drawback.  Indeed, the display was quite modest.  And we are talking not only about its diagonal, but also about the quality of image transmission, as well as manufacturing technology.  By the way, we recall that the device was also distinguished by a strict design, which not every user will like. </p><p>  Earlier it was said that the model was saved thanks only to its technical characteristics, which fully justified the price of the device.  Nevertheless, having analyzed the nature of sales and their results, the company's specialists seem to have come to a completely disappointing conclusion.  It is possible that the decline in demand was the prerequisite for the creation of the <span>LG Optimus L5</span> II Dual E455 White.  Engineers wanted to make sure that the defects of the previous model were eradicated, but the advantages remained.  But whether they did it, we‚Äôll see today. </p><h2>  About dvuhsimochnikov </h2>

    <p>  In general, the majority of representatives of the Internet audience about phones that support the function of simultaneous operation of two SIM-cards, did not have a very good opinion.  Many say that dvuhsimochniki issued unfinished and unfinished, with a huge number of shortcomings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Someone will not like the case, then the screen works with an incomprehensible resolution for us.  Very rarely, according to some experts, top-end, powerful and really worthwhile processors are introduced into phones that work with two SIM cards.  And this, in turn, leads to the fact that after a while the device starts to terribly slow down.  In this article we will talk more about this and find out whether this comment applies to the LG Optimus L5 II Dual E455, the price of which is currently about five thousand rubles. </p><h2>  First impressions of the phone </h2><p>  So, here it is - LG Optimus L5 II Dual E455 Black.  Lies in front of us and waits for us to turn it on.  But we will not force events.  First things first.  Some users simply can not get past the name of the smartphone.  <span>Like, this is the</span> second model, revision.  Well, so what?  It‚Äôs time to understand for a long time that the market for mobile devices does not obey such logic.  Immediately, we note that the phone turned out to be more beautiful compared to its predecessor. </p>

    <p>  With the naked eye, the shape change of the <span>LG E455</span> Optimus L5 II Dual will be noticed by those who had the honor to use the "older brother" of our current model for some time.  And this fact played, in the opinion of many experts, a positive role.  Nevertheless, the appearance of the smartphone does not seem toy, such a feeling does not occur.  At the first tactile contact, the lightness of the device is felt.  Needless to say, this only positively affects the overall assessment of this phone? </p><p>  There is no feeling of cheapness of the <span>LG E455</span> Optimus L5 II Dual, which could well be.  But by some miracle, with the help of a method unknown to us, a simple public, the engineers of the company do not let us think about it even for a second.  It can be seen that along with the appearance, the screen size has also changed.  LG designers also took this into account, and, accordingly, took care of the resolution of the phone.  Individual pixels became almost invisible, hidden, although earlier, in the case of the first model, they were viewed very, very clearly.  Significantly increased the quality of image transmission to the display. </p><h2>  LG Optimus L5 II Dual E455.  Design features </h2><p>  In general, in the history of modern smartphones, a certain tendency is clearly traced, associated with the appearance of devices of a particular line.  It consists in the fact that with every new phone that replenishes the corresponding model range, the design changes, but smoothly and almost imperceptibly.  However, who said that if there is a trend, then the rest should not be?  This is just our case.  L5 II has transformed, so to speak, amplitude and stepwise.  Designers of the company knowingly received their salaries: the appearance of the device has changed dramatically, simply, beyond recognition.  Which, by the way, was uncharacteristic for the predecessor of our model. </p>

    <p>  Call a new form, the shell of a smartphone can only be excellent, and nothing else.  The hull lines have been smoothed out, and now they look not strictly, but very soft, in contrast to the right angles, which distinguished the previous model.  After studying the reviews about the device, you can find a huge number of them about changing the appearance.  In general, something, but the design idea for LG employees was clearly a success. </p><h2>  About manufacturing materials </h2><p>  This is mainly plastic.  Of course, it does not make sense to make any sky-high demands on it.  However, let's not forget that plastic, like any material, can be less or more high-quality.  In our case, the latter was used. </p>

    <p>  Note that users themselves can remove the back cover with the LG E455 Optimus L5 II Dual.  The design is based on a considerable number of elements that hold it securely.  At the same time, we won‚Äôt notice any backlash; here it will be quite difficult to find fault with something.  The surface of the back cover is made in textured form, which has practical grounds.  But it is noticeable that the closer to the edges, the more smooth the plastic becomes. </p><p>  What does such a method of manufacturing the back cover mean?  Let us take a look at this from our daily lives.  We all use mobile phones, after which we remove them somewhere.  We put them on the tables and so on.  So, in order not to inflict mechanical damage on the LG E455 Optimus L5 II Dual once in contact with another hard surface, the cover was made textured in the central part.  Indeed, we put the phone not on its edge, but on the back panel.  So that makes sense.  The disadvantage of the textured cover is the fact that it is quickly enough overwritten. </p><h2>  LG Optimus L5 II Dual E455.  Owner reviews </h2><p>  It's time to take stock and give a general description of the device so that users can decide whether to purchase it.  So, first, let's talk about the price. </p><p>  She's not that big.  Five thousand rubles for such a smartphone is a great price, and the company's specialists are well aware of this.  In addition, we can always allocate a certain number of models in the corresponding range in order to compare them with each other.  And then what will we see? </p><p>  The display gives a good image, the screen has a good resolution.  There are no complaints about the quality of the picture (taking into account the price of the device).  There is no need to criticize the performance of the smartphone.  It is quite consistent with the declared level, although it is clearly not worth expecting something beyond the average. </p><p>  For five thousand rubles, the user receives a good device that can be used for work purposes (due to multifunctionality), and for playing undemanding toys, and for surfing the Internet.  In addition, we will not forget about the quality of manufacture.  As noted earlier, nothing creaks, there are no backlashes. </p><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  The weak link of the device is a low-quality camera.  And the battery life will not please everyone. </p>
