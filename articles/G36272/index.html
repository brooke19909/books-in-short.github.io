But, despite such a low classification, this is one of the best hotels in the city.  It belongs to the Cronwell Inn line. </p><p>  The hotel is located in the very center of the city, offers business travelers and travelers comfortable rooms with all amenities.  The hotel is perfectly suited for business trips. </p><p>  In this article we will tell you about how much a berth costs here, what are the living conditions, how is the hotel fed and convenient for travelers.  We will also consider what guests have said about this hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="cronwell.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Ugra&quot; three stars" class="if uuid-2628977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2628977.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get and what is nearby </h2><p>  The hotel is located at: Khanty-Mansiysk, st.  Komsomolskaya, 32. </p><p>  It is best to get to the city by air.  Khanty-Mansiysk Airport is located 5 km from the hotel.  You can fly here from Moscow, <span>Novosibirsk, Omsk,</span> Tyumen, Surgut. </p><p>  From the local hub go no more than 20 minutes by public transport.  To do this, take the bus number 5 or minibuses number 12 and 16. </p><p>  But if you decide to go by train, then it is more difficult.  The nearest train station is almost three hundred kilometers from the hotel.  So it will take a long time to get from the train. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But in the immediate vicinity of this hotel in Khanty-Mansiysk - just a 10-minute drive away - there is a city bus station.  Here comes transport from Novy Urengoy, Nizhnevartovsk and other cities.  And in the summer, ships go to the river Salekhard and Kondinsky. </p><p>  Shopping centers and business districts from the hotel can be said to be close at hand.  So, if you come on a business trip, you practically do not have to spend money on public transport.  But if you need remote areas of the city, then near the entrance to the hotel there are bus stops of different routes. </p><p>  Taxis are also on duty nearby.  In walking distance a beautiful alley, "House of a journalist." </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="61.005638" data-lng="69.01409999999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/5/6/6/6/5666.png"></div><h2>  Khanty-Mansiysk </h2><p>  In recent years, this Russian city in the heart of Siberia has been turning from an ordinary taiga village into a real metropolis.  The fact is that Khanty-Mansiysk was in the center of the oil industry. </p><p>  This, in fact, led to the fact that a lot of people go to the city - both on business and just for fun.  Here is the Cromwell Inn Ugra Hotel.  Since the city itself was built mainly in the XXI century, the buildings here are planned in the original modernist style. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Interestingly, here, unlike most Russian cities, there is not a single monument to Lenin.  The city is located at the confluence of the Ob and Irtysh rivers.  There is an observation deck, as well as a monument to the pioneers of the Ugra region. </p><div class="photo" data-source="https://gelio.livejournal.com/224662.html" data-original="gelio.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Khanty-Mansiysk" class="if uuid-2629243" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/2629243.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Although this city is small (only 98 thousand people live in it), it is one of the richest industrial centers in Russia.  Therefore, prices in Khanty-Mansiysk pretty bite. </p><p>  A room in a hotel for a day can cost from 600-700 rubles (this is the most budget option, far from the center) to 5-6 thousand (this is for a chic complex with a thermal pool and sauna).  As you can see, the scatter is great.  Among the best hotels in Khanty-Mansiysk are called "Tarey", "On seven hills" and "Cromwell Inn". </p><p>  These hotels offer the best value for money.
