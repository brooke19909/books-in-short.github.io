    <h2>  Definition </h2><p>  So, <span>personal income tax:</span> what is it?  This abbreviation stands for the following: <span>a tax on personal income.</span>  That is, it is directly related to citizens.  If you look at the definition of the term, you can notice that we are dealing with the so-called income contribution.  Sometimes it is also called income tax. </p><p>  Pay personal income tax, as already mentioned, almost all citizens.  More precisely, taxpayers who have income.  Not in all cases, but most often it turns out that way.  Some profits are not taxed.  What do you need to pay for, and when can you evade such a payment? </p><h2>  Pay or not? </h2><p>  "How much personal income tax is in Russia for 2016?"  - not the most important question.  Before this, you need to understand what kind of income is taxed by this payment.  Maybe you should not deposit money into the treasury of the state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To begin with, that any income of an individual must be declared.  Moreover, it is taxed.  In this case, income.  But there are some exceptions.  For example, citizens who have received a sum of money or real estate from close relatives do not pay taxes.  Also, transactions with property that the previous owner had disposed of for at least 3 years are exempted from payment.  The inheritance received from close relatives (in practice this is how it turns out) is again not subject to any contributions to the state treasury. </p><p>  It's all.  Payment of personal income tax occurs in all other cases.  If you rent an apartment or real estate, sell property that has been owned for less than 3 years, and just get paid, you will have to give a certain percentage of the profit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax deductions" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1209792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Deductions </h2><p>  PITs have deductions.  This is a kind of reduction in the tax base for certain cases, which leads to a decrease in the amount of the contribution.  There are many standard deductions.  Usually it is customary to mean by them those or other expenses that you will make when you make a profit.  For example, you can simply make a tax deduction if you had any expenses for the sale of the property.  In this case, the income received will decrease by the indicated amount.  The main thing is that you have proof of spending. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most often, for personal income tax deductions are assigned in respect of wages.  A common form is for keeping children.  So, if you have minor children, then you can reduce the tax base.  Not too much, but still.  For the first two children, 1,400 rubles are deducted from income, 3,000 for the third and subsequent, and 3,000 for disabled people. It is very useful to make deductions if you look closely at this idea.  Moreover, you will not have any extra paperwork.  It is enough to provide evidence for deductions.  There are no problems with this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax return" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1209794.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How much to pay? </h2><p>  How much is personal income tax?  This question excites all citizens.  Indeed, it is always important to know what percentage of the income you will have to give to the state.  Especially when it comes to regular and mandatory payments. </p><p>  Answer definitely will not work.  After all, such a process has its own characteristics.  Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that individuals pay 13% of their profits in the form of tax.  But the direct amount may vary in one case or another.  Nothing difficult, right?  It turns out that no matter how much income you receive, it is necessary to subtract 13% from it.  When it comes to treasures and wins, this indicator increases almost 3 times - up to 35%.  Not the most common occurrence. </p><h2>  For non-residents </h2><p>  Not only citizens of the Russian Federation pay income taxes.  They are taxed by all people who make a profit in the country.  So, non-residents too.  These are citizens who are in Russia per year for less than 183 days.  How much personal income tax for them will be?  No need to rely on the required 13% for residents of Russia.  With foreigners, a slightly different picture is obtained.  They pay 30% of profit to the state treasury.  With a large income, quite large payments are received.  Even with all deductions, if any. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1209796.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Now it‚Äôs clear how much personal income tax is in one case or another.  Remember, the standard rate is 13%, for non-residents - 30. There is nothing particularly difficult about this.  How is the amount payable calculated? </p><h2>  Calculations </h2><p>  Everything is simple.  There is a certain formula that you need to adhere to.  The amount of personal income tax, as we have found, varies.  Depending on the so-called tax base.  If you multiply it by the <span>tax rate</span> (13 or 30 percent, respectively), you get a figure reflecting the debt to the state.  The tax base is calculated simply.  If you have no expenses and deductions, then the full amount of the income received is simply taken.  It is multiplied by the bet.  When deductions are made or you had expenses, expenses are taken away from income.  And the numbers already received will be considered the base. </p><p>  For example: a citizen receives 15,000 per month in the form of wages, he has 1 minor child.  The base will be as follows: 15,000-1,400 = <span>13,600</span> . And <span>income tax will be: 13,600 * 13% = 1768.</span>  Nothing difficult, right?  If our citizen does not have children, then he will have to give 15,000 * 13% = 1,950 rubles a month in the form of personal income tax.  That's how simple it really is. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax amount" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1209795.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Report Order </h2><p>  The personal income tax declaration is a kind of report to the tax authorities.  And every citizen must declare his income without fail.  Even if it is not taxed.  This document must be submitted before April 30 of each year.  Around the same time, you need to close all debts and pay taxes.  This practice is common in Russia.  Payments made before April 30 are considered advance payments.  In general, you can defer payment until July 15.  The reporting periods for personal income tax may be different.  In practice, citizens simply make monthly payments.  Approximately the 25th day of each month.  Received a salary - repaid a debt, earned a profit - reported to the state and made the due payment.  This will save you trouble. </p><p>  By the way, the personal income tax declaration is filled out either manually or with the help of specialized programs.  The most commonly used forms are 2-NDFL and 3-NDFL.  To fill out you will need income information, TIN, your passport details, as well as proof of deductions / expenses.  If we are talking about transactions with property, you will also need to stock up with documents on the right to a particular property.  Then simply fill in the lines in the declaration (they are all signed, usually there are no difficulties) and sign it.  You can submit a document to the tax authorities.  Do not forget to attach copies of proof of deductions, as well as property rights and expenses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="personal income tax payment" class="if" height="263" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1209793.jpg" width="450"></div>
