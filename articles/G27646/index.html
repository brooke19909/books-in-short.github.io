  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Obligatory state insurance in the Russian Federation</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  As a result of the Russian reforms that took place in the 1990s, compulsory state insurance, subordinated to a single system with financial resources consolidated with the state budget, was replaced by state extra-budgetary funds: FSS of the Russian Federation;  FIU;  Territorial and federal funds of the MHI. </p><p>  The reform contributed to the creation of certain levers of social protection and a more specific separation of <span>funding sources.</span>  Compulsory state insurance serves as a mechanism to ensure civil interests related to their health, property, life and civil liability. </p><p>  Mandatory state insurance is determined by the specific needs of society.  As an element of industrial relations, insurance activity creates the necessary conditions for the implementation of preventive measures aimed at localizing negative consequences.  In the event of damage from specific circumstances, insurance allows you to compensate for losses in material equivalent, thanks to it it is possible to carry out restoration work, compensation for harm caused in the social sphere, as well as to individual citizens. </p><p>  Thus, compulsory state insurance is a means of protecting the welfare of people and businesses, as well as income-generating activities.  Insurance allows you to reduce the burden on budget expenditures, allows you to solve social security issues, because  is the main element of the social state system.  Thanks to him, large investment resources are attracted to the country's economy as a whole. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Compulsory social insurance</span> (OSS) is part of the state system aimed at social protection of the population, which extends to working citizens, protecting them from possible <span>changes in social</span> and material status from various circumstances, sometimes independent of the citizens themselves. </p><p>  The OSS is aimed at minimizing or compensating for the consequences of circumstances that have made changes to the situation of not only working citizens, but also their other categories, in cases stipulated by law.  For example, in the event of the following social insurance risks: work injury, disability, <span>occupational disease,</span> injury, illness, loss of a breadwinner, pregnancy and childbirth, old age, etc. </p><p>  In accordance with the above, we denote the subjects of compulsory social insurance.  These include employers acting as policyholders, insurance companies - insurers and citizens themselves, who are insured persons.  Moreover, all subjects of compulsory social insurance have their obligations under the concluded OSS contracts.  At the same time, each of them has an OSS relationship: </p><p>  - from the moment of conclusion of the employment contract with the employee at the employer; </p><p>  - from the moment of registration of the UK insurer; </p><p>  - from the moment of conclusion of an employment contract with the employer - with the insured; </p><p>  At present, <span>compulsory pension insurance</span> in the Russian Federation is the main source that forms the future pension. </p><p>  The employer is required to make <span>insurance contributions</span> in the amount of 34% of the payroll of each of its employees.  At the same time, 26% of these funds are allocated for compulsory pension insurance in the Russian Federation, and upon entering the RF PF, they are distributed into two parts of the labor pension, forming the funded part of the pension and insurance.  It is worth noting that each citizen can directly affect the funded part of the formed pension.  for example, to participate in co-financing, work in enterprises with a completely ‚Äúwhite‚Äù wage, and redirect to invest in private pension funds. </p>
