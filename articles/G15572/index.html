In the rays of fame and popularity, Rome, Venice, Milan are still swimming.  Travelers are captivated by an amazing history, masterpiece architecture and world famous attractions.  However, many forget that this country is washed by five seas.  <span>The resort cities of</span> Italy are in no way inferior to the "classic" destinations for a beach holiday - the Maldives, Greece, Cuba, Portugal, Spain and others. </p><h2>  The shores of the five seas </h2><p>  The country, located on the Apennines and the Balkans and occupying southern European latitudes, has access to the coasts of the Mediterranean, Ligurian, Adriatic, Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas.  The azure shores of the peninsula make tourists make difficult choices, and to facilitate it we will make a kind of rating of the resort cities of Italy and try to choose the best places in this paradise of the planet. </p><p>  Inspiring landscapes and unrivaled panoramic views are inherent in each of the recreational areas.  Thanks to an intelligible policy and a decent level of service, the most popular and sought-after places are considered today, which will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Why you should go to Rimini </h2><p>  The list of resort towns of Italy by the sea can be continued without stopping.  But where to start?  Perhaps with Rimini.  Those who have visited here at least once will not mind if this city takes the first place in the ranking of the best resorts. </p><p>  Rimini is the central resort city, famous not only for its azure beaches, but also for the unique combination of modern developed infrastructure and centuries-old buildings that have never been touched by the hands of restorers.  Architectural creations have been preserved in their original form to the present day.  And, of course, luxury five-star hotels will not leave indifferent the most demanding tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.absolutetravel.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort towns of italy at sea" class="if uuid-2540963" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540963.jpg"></div><p>  Rimini is a diverse resort city in Italy.  Nobody will be bored here, as Sunny Beach has prepared a lot of amazing discoveries for both connoisseurs of a quiet family vacation and for fans of youth parties.  Among the attractions of Rimini, which is definitely worth visiting for travelers with children, it is worth noting the "Altremare" - this is the largest Italian amusement park.  In addition to incredible carousels and entertainment venues, the complex has spa centers. </p><p>  Proponents of walks in the evening <span>European city</span> with the most beautiful buildings in Rimini will have something to see, but if this seems not enough, you can continue to get acquainted with Italian culture without difficulty in Pisa, Florence, Naples.  Rimini differs from other Italian resort towns by the sea in convenient transport interchange. </p><h2>  Resorts of the Venetian Riviera </h2><p>  For some reason, when choosing an Italian resort, many travelers do not even consider this option.  And I must say, in vain.  Venice is the capital of love, romanticism, painting and balls.  Resorts in the Adriatic Sea - a great place for a honeymoon.  Each couple of lovers will be able to get here not only true pleasure from excursion programs, restaurants on the water and gondola rides, but also soak up the rays of the gentle sun on comfortable beaches that will entice you into the world of healing thermal waters and relaxation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelb.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the best resort cities of italy" class="if uuid-2540964" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540964.jpg"></div><p>  Unlike Rome, Venice provides an opportunity to relax from the hustle and bustle on the roads of megacities.  Everyone who has been here is enthusiastic about the amazing mix of clean pine air, sea breeze and the scent of a romantic Italian night.  Not far from Venice are the small resort towns of Italy, Lido di Jesolo and Lignano, which are also popular among visitors. </p><h2>  Fairytale nature of Abruzzo </h2><p>  This Italian resort is no coincidence called the eco-symbol of the country.  Abruzzo is the greenest region, which has absorbed all kinds of natural delights and serves as a point of contact for four national parks and several dozens of protected areas.  If you are a nature lover and are confused, choosing among the resort cities of Italy, go to Abruzzo. </p><p>  In L'Aquila, which is 40 km from Abruzzo, the area will inspire with clear lakes, rocky canyons and unique landscape designs, authored by mother nature herself.  Can't imagine a vacation in Italy without cozy restaurants on the coast?  Then head straight from Abruzzo to Pescara.  According to reviews, this is an ideal place for gourmets - in institutions located along the coastline, there is a huge assortment of seafood. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="edition.cnn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort towns of italy at sea list" class="if uuid-2540966" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540966.jpg"></div><h2>  Sandy Apulia </h2><p>  Fans of unforgettable adventures, of course, need to come here.  Puglia is called the kingdom of sand and velvet beaches.  It is not surprising that Apulia took its rightful place in the ranking of top resorts.  Beautiful landscapes of uncharted bays and groves along the coastline attract travelers every year. </p><p>  Extremely long ago, extreme sports have begun to develop in Puglia - for those who are not afraid of difficulties and are eager for adventure.  Individual and group expeditions in the rainforests - isn't it breathtaking? </p><p>  Within the resort town, vacationers are offered to go on a cruise by sea or dive under the water to appreciate the beauty of the bright coral world.  It is impossible to remain indifferent to Puglia.  Many consider this place the best in Italy.  The resort towns located in the neighborhood are Arpi, Taranto, Foggia, Galliano del Capo, Porto Cesareo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travelandleisure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small resort towns of italy" class="if uuid-2540971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540971.jpg"></div><h2>  What's interesting in Ischia </h2><p>  The peculiarity of this resort town lies in its location - outside the mainland land.  This is an island of volcanic origin, washed by the waters of the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Ischia has become famous all over the world for healing thermal springs, therefore everyone who combines a beach holiday with healing procedures feels great here.  Ischia is often remembered as a famous balneological resort with sulfide mud. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, travelers are delighted with the species diversity of the flora and fauna.  The uniqueness of the island gives a series of first-class sandy beaches and rocky headlands carved by the wind.  Getting into one of the lagoons, you can get an unearthly pleasure from the sounds of the surf, heard in the shade of cypresses, pines, olives and cork trees. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.easyjet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="resort towns of italy" class="if uuid-2540985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540985.jpg"></div><h2>  Exquisite and expensive vacation in San Remo </h2><p>  The most expensive and fashionable hotels are concentrated here.  The resort cities of Italy are generally quite expensive, and this is by no means everyone's wallet.  In San Remo come wealthy, famous, influential people who are ready to relax on a high level. </p><p>  The city of San Remo is located on the Ligurian coast, dotted with prestigious private villas and hotels, ready to open their doors to guests.  Among the inexpensive, but trustworthy, it is worth noting such hotels as Via Palazzo, Miramare The Palace Hotel, Hotel Ariston Montecarlo, Lolli Palace Hotel.  In San Remo there are never deserted boutiques and casinos.  Life here is in full swing, regardless of the time of day. </p><p>  San Remo often hosts international music festivals - during this period there are especially many tourists.  It is no coincidence that this resort town is called the "city of flowers" - its ubiquitous fragrant greenhouses and variegated flower beds give a real aesthetic pleasure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sanremonews.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spa towns italy rating" class="if uuid-2540977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540977.jpg"></div><p>  Note: in San Remo, pebble beaches.  Perhaps this is a fundamental moment for lovers of relaxation on the sandy coast.  By the way, the beaches in San Remo are equipped with first-class equipment, so pebbles will not become an obstacle for the most fastidious visitors. </p><h2>  San vito lo capo </h2><p>  Unlike previous resort cities in Italy, this one has an optimal atmosphere for families with kids.  The cozy town of San Vito Lo Capo is located on the island of Sicily.  A picturesque place on the Tyrrhenian Sea is the best suited for a beach holiday with children under 10 years old. </p><p>  The pride of the resort is many kilometers of white beaches, which are considered one of the best not only according to the Italians.  Nowhere in Europe can one find such a thing.  Those who have been here at least once will share their positive impressions for a long time, calling the beaches of San Vito Lo Capo ‚Äúparadise‚Äù.  The descent into the sea is gentle, there are no holes or undercurrents.  Children will be happy enough to splash in shallow water. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.explo-re.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="spa towns italy hotels" class="if uuid-2540981" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2540981.jpg"></div><h2>  And yet, where to go? </h2><p>  Having run through the description of only some popular resort cities in Italy, it is difficult to put one of them at the beginning of the top rating.  Each of the above places for a beach holiday has the right to top the list.  After all, we all have our own ideas about resort vacations.  The preferences of modern tourists are so contrasting and motley, but Italy can be considered the ideal option for a trip.  She managed to embody all types of relaxation: from yoga to a nightclub party, from surfing to exploring historical sites. </p>
