Each of the possible options has a huge number of minuses.  <span>Bank deposits</span> bring too little income, which does not even pay off <span>inflation,</span> often banks simply close.  Although deposits are insured by the state, who wants to spend time and nerves to get their own money back?  Investing in stocks is very risky, because any company can suddenly go broke. </p><p>  In such a situation, people increasingly prefer to invest in physical assets.  For many centuries, for the sake of saving funds, as well as increasing them, people </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Buy gold bullion" class="if" height="351" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10492/8421.jpg" width="570"></div>  buy gold.  Moreover, for so many years the physical form of such an asset has radically changed.  Previously, people bought jewelry and coins made of this metal, but now many people prefer to buy a gold bar.

    <p>  Features of investment in gold bullion </p><p>  Of course, the price of this metal is constantly increasing, but it should be borne in mind that this type of investment should have a long-term perspective.  The fact is that at short time intervals the price of it can even decrease.  At the same time interval of several years, it is growing steadily. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you decide to purchase a gold bar, it will be best for you to contact the bank branches that provide such a service.  When buying gold, the investor must present a document that certifies his identity. </p><p>  Banks offer for sale only the highest grade gold; they are required to have a certificate of conformity for a gold bullion on sale.  His weight </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gold Ingot Weight" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10492/8360.jpg" width="400"></div>  can range from five grams to one kilogram.  Choose what you can afford.  When buying a gold bar is necessarily weighed.  In this case, the balance should have an error of not more than one hundredth of a gram.

    <p>  Acquired ingots must not be damaged or contaminated.  The origin of gold is confirmed by a certificate of conformity, as well as the passport of the factory that produced the gold bar. </p><p>  When buying physical gold, it should be remembered that if you get an ingot on hand, its price will immediately fall.  This is due to the fact that bankers claim that the surface of the <span>noble metal</span> worsens at any touch.  When gold is removed from the bank, the buyer has an obligation to pay VAT, the amount of which is 18 percent of its value.  The tax paid is not refundable even if the acquisition is sold to the same bank.  Therefore, it is better to leave a gold bar in the bank's vault with a special metal account. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gold bar" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10492/8367.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Do not buy gold bars in the secondary market.  In Russia, he is undeveloped.  Resellers' prices are often overpriced, and the quality of gold is dubious.  Selling bullion is also better for banks.  However, do not forget that in the case of a sale, a spread occurs, that is, the difference between the purchase and sale prices, which can actually be attributed to the losses of the investor. </p><p>  Of course, investing in gold bullion in the long run can be <br>  very profitable.  But here it is important to know and take into account many nuances in order not to be disappointed in this type of investment and not to incur losses. </p>
