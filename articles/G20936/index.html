It was introduced by creative needlewomen.  It consists in decorating your home with knitted vegetables and fruits.  In this case, you can choose different options.  Some people prefer to fill the basket with ‚Äúsummer attributes‚Äù and place them in the kitchen in the most prominent place.  Others create panels, and then hang them in the living room or bedroom, while still others prepare interesting objects for their children, which they play with great pleasure.  For us it does not matter for what purpose the reader is interested in the technology of knitting vegetables and fruits.  However, we wish to help in the work.  Therefore, we offer a detailed and step-by-step master class. </p><h2>  Where does the creative process begin? </h2><p>  Before you begin to study the instructions, you need to prepare.  It is best to make crocheted vegetables and fruits from the remnants of yarn.  Although you can also use small purchased skeins.  At the same time, experienced needlewomen advise giving preference to acrylic yarn.  But woolen threads are best purchased for another product.  In addition, it is worth noting that if a child plays with fruits and vegetables, it is more reasonable to consider children's yarn.  There are no strict recommendations regarding the tool.  Therefore, you can bring your idea to life with both a hook and knitting needles.  The only thing, professional masters say that it is much more convenient to work with a metal tool.  And since the knitted fabric should be dense enough, you should choose one that is equal to the thickness of the thread. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.creativeboom.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself knitted vegetables" class="if uuid-3007927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007927.jpg"></div><h2>  How to start knitting? </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen believe that it is best to crochet knitted vegetables and fruits.  And all because this tool allows you to add and reduce loops imperceptibly.  However, it is important to get started right.  First of all, I would like to note that fruits and vegetables are knitted using the amigurumi technique.  Therefore, those who are familiar with her already know the starting actions.  For beginners, we offer detailed instructions: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  We take the prepared yarn. </li><li>  Wrap on a pencil. </li><li>  Carefully remove, trying not to dissolve the loop. </li><li>  Bind, moving in a circle. </li><li>  We make six single crochet. </li><li>  We connect the last and first loops. </li><li>  Pull the initial tip of the thread. </li></ol><p>  However, if desired, you can make knitted vegetables and fruits with knitting needles.  To do this, prepare short hosiery knitting needles and dial three loops on them.  Then knit in a circle, adding and decreasing loops. </p><h2>  Round fruit </h2><p>  Professional knitters recommend starting to master the technology with simple fruits and vegetables.  Therefore, further we propose to study the technology of mandarin execution.  By analogy, you can combine orange, grapefruit, grapes, tomato and apple.  However, the penultimate vegetable must be supplemented with a stalk.  Then fill, slightly tighten the place where the stem is located, inside and fasten the thread.  Then tie the product to the end.  The apple is knitted in a similar way, but ends in a slightly different way.  It should be tied almost to the end, fill and finish.  Sew a twig with a leaf, stretch the needle through the center, slightly tighten, fasten and hide the tip of the thread. </p><h2>  How to tie a tangerine? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vegetables" class="if uuid-3007797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007797.jpg"></div><p>  So, we already found out that knitted vegetables and fruits begin with a set of a small number of loops.  Then, moving in a circle, we need to add additional ones.  When working on tangerine, you can manage the process yourself.  Our task is to get a proportional ball.  To do this, crochet two columns from one loop of the previous row.  The frequency of additions is determined by eye.  When knitting, additional loops should be knitted from one current row.  The first, as usual, and the second - turning the knitting needle on the left side.  We knit mandarin almost to the end, stuff and finish.  We supplement with a twig and a leaf. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Carrot </h2><p>  This knitted vegetable is a cone.  Therefore, picking up the thread of the desired color, the reader will also be able to tie daikon radish and hot pepper.  The technology is pretty simple.  We collect loops and knit the conceived product, moving in a circle.  However, we add loops not in each row, but after two or three.  It is also worth noting that the number of "decreases" should not be too large.  Experienced craftsmen note that to make a neat and even carrot, you should add no more than a fifth of the loops of the current row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="grandmotherspatternbook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vegetables description" class="if uuid-3007932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007932.jpg"></div><p>  Hot peppers are more "thin".  Therefore, the increase must be done at intervals of four to five rows.  But daikon radish, on the contrary, should turn out to be more plump.  This means that the frequency of increases should be increased.  Experts are convinced that it is better to add loops through one or two rows.  As you can see, there is no strict description of the technology for making knitted fruits and vegetables.  Creative work.  This is its appeal and complexity. </p><h2>  Turnip </h2><p>  Children adore a fairy tale about a grandmother and grandfather, who could not manage to extend a root crop of unprecedented size.  However, they have no idea what it is.  If you can‚Äôt find a turnip in the store, you can link it yourself.  To do this, we collect loops and knit three rows in a circle, without making increases and decreases.  In the next three rows, double the number of loops.  Then we knit a row without additions.  And in the next add 1/3 of the total.  Next, we knit without additions for eight to nine rows.  And finally, over the next six rows we gradually reduce the loops.  Then we tie the tip with green thread and complement the vegetable knitted or crocheted with tops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet crocheted vegetables" class="if uuid-3007933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007933.jpg"></div><p>  By the way, by analogy, you can connect radish, beets and strawberries.  But in root crops, a long nose should be made, and the berry should be significantly reduced in size and supplemented with white or yellow specks. </p><h2>  Cucumber </h2><p>  According to most knitters, this vegetable is the easiest to fit.  Knitting begins, as always, with a set of loops.  Then in the next three rows we form, if possible, a smooth circle equal to a two-ruble coin.  Next, we knit six rows without increases.  Then in three rows we make two increments.  And in the next three - two decreases.  Then we knit six rows just in a circle.  And we reduce the loop, trying to make a blunt nose.  If desired, complement our cucumber with a tail and a flower.  Or leave it like that. </p><h2>  Lemon </h2><p>  It doesn‚Äôt matter what tool the crocheted vegetables and fruits are made of.  Knitting needles or crochet knit - this is her own business.  The technology consists in the correct addition and reduction of loops.  However, even this nuance completely depends on the needlewoman.  At this point, we suggest studying how the lemon fits.  Although the process also does not present any difficulties. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting vegetables" class="if uuid-3007936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007936.jpg"></div><p>  It starts with a set of loops.  Then, over fifteen rows, there are increments - three for each row.  Next, just knit 3-5 rows in a circle.  And then we make reductions.  Also, three pieces for fifteen rows.  If you want to make a cut lemon, we knit the product 2/3.  We reduce three loops in the first row, and in the next we change the thread to white.  In the third row, we again turn to yellow and reduce the loops, forming a circle.  Some crocheted vegetables and fruits need to be refined by making streaks or weights.  And lemon is one of those.  Therefore, we take a white thread and divide the cut into six zones. </p><h2>  Raspberries </h2><p>  This delicious summer berry looks very original.  However, it requires the preparation of yarn in two shades - bright and pale pink.  Then we collect loops and we knit the first row without changes.  In the second, double the number of loops.  In the third, add three loops, in the fourth - five.  We knit the fifth and sixth row in a circle, without making increases and decreases.  We stuff our raspberry.  Then in the seventh, eighth and ninth row, we reduce the loop to four.  After breaking the thread and stretching through the remaining loops.  If desired, we tie a green "hat" and a tail.  Or we make several raspberries and attach to a twig.  It is a crocheted chain wrapped around a wire. </p><p>  As you can see, you can use more than one tool when making knitted vegetables.  The description for the hook, as well as for the knitting needles, may imply the work of both tools.  But it all depends on the wishes of the needlewoman.  If such a combination does not seem organic or the craftswoman simply does not possess the necessary skills, all the work can be done with one tool. </p><h2>  Pear </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vegetables master class" class="if uuid-3007937" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007937.jpg"></div><p>  The next fruit can be made using yarn of different colors.  There are green, yellow and red pears.  However, their form is always the same.  As we study the description of knitted fruits and vegetables (crochet or knitting), then we will discuss how to knit a pear yourself.  The first thing we do is loop.  And over five rows we form a smooth circle.  Then we knit a row without changes.  And in the next, add three to five loops.  We knit the next five or seven rows in a circle.  We do not make increases and decreases.  Then, over three rows, we reduce the loops so that in the end we get half of the initial amount.  We knit six rows without increases and decreases.  We stuff the product.  Next, cut half the loops.  In the next row we remove four, then two times two.  Break the thread and pass through the remaining loops.  We tighten the circle, fix the thread and hide from the inside.  We supplement the finished pear with a twig and, if desired, a leaf. </p><h2>  Cabbage </h2><p>  The following knitted vegetable is very interestingly performed.  The description for knitting needles and hooks is based on competent increases.  Therefore, we offer readers detailed instructions.  It begins, as always, with a set of loops.  Then double their number.  In the next ten rows, add six loops.  Then we knit ten rows, moving in a circle and without making increases and decreases.  The next ten rows cut the loops.  Six decreases in each row.  After performing these manipulations, we stuff the resulting head out, break the thread and pass through the remaining loops.  Then we knit six leaves. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted vegetables mk" class="if uuid-3007939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3007939.jpg"></div><p>  We collect and knit eighteen loops in the second row, add seven loops, and in the third - thirteen.  We knit the fourth without changes.  In the fifth, add twenty loops.  We knit the next eleven rows unchanged.  And in the seventeenth row, we reduce the number of loops to forty and we knit two rows without changes.  Next, we reduce thirteen loops, two times nine, then four.  We knit the last row and break the thread.  Then collect the cabbage, laying out the leaves around the prepared bowl. </p><p>  The technology under study is not difficult, and the presented master classes clearly prove it.  Crocheted vegetables or knitting needles are done in just a few minutes.  But it pleases the eye and decorates the interior for a very long time. </p>
