    <p>  A huge role, of course, is played by <span>chairs, armchairs,</span> sofas.  This, perhaps, is the furniture that is definitely in every apartment.  In the old days, the range of this industry was very scarce, which led to the appearance of all kinds of accessories.  The desire to decorate furniture has survived to this day.  In addition to the fact that the chair cover is an excellent accessory, it also protects the upholstery from abrasion and pollution.  Covers for furniture - just a salvation for families who have pets.  Wool, dirt - all this remains on the cloak, which can be easily removed and sent to the washing machine. </p><p>  <span>Covers for furniture</span> can be made in several sets: for everyday use and for receiving guests.  For each day, it is advisable to use something simple and more practical, and for the holiday you can decorate furniture with elegant designer covers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chair Cape" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/98393.jpg" width="600"></div>  The more various furniture accessories, the wider the list of options for original interior solutions.  Furniture covers can make furniture not only more beautiful, but also comfortable.  For example, a foam cape on a chair can provide extra softness.  It can be made with your own hands.  The packing for the cover should be cut out of foam rubber in the shape and size of the chair or stool.  The fabric is selected dense, wear-resistant.  Flax or twill is perfect for such purposes.  From this material it is necessary to cut 2 pieces of fabric in size larger than the foam piece, thereby taking into account the width of the foam and allowances for the seams.  It is also necessary to provide straps for attaching to a chair.  Zipper is sewn to one side of the cover.  When the cover is ready, you need to fill it with foam rubber and decorate it as desired.  As a finish, ordinary buttons are perfect.  You can also complement the cover with embroidery. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet chair cover" class="if" height="468" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/98394.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <p>  Upholstered furniture can also be decorated with various things.  Cape on the chair will protect the upholstery and give the furniture originality and brightness.  Knitted accessories look very advantageous.  Beautiful lace covers are obtained by crocheting.  It is not so important to cover on a chair or a cloak for a chair - you can crochet a ‚Äúdress‚Äù for any furniture.  Acrylic yarn is suitable for the cover.  The color is selected depending on the desire of the hostess.  A knitted cape on a chair can completely cover the entire chair, and only the seat.  The main thing is to initially determine the shape of the cover and take measurements. </p><p>  There are a lot of ideas for creating original furniture covers.  For example, a <span>satin fabric</span> makes an elegant chair cover.  As a complement to such a cover, a satin bow of a contrasting color, which can be placed on the back, is perfect.  Or come up with your own unique option.  Do-it-yourself furniture covers can revive any boring chair or old chair, hide flaws and highlight dignity.  Furniture covers will give cosiness and originality to any interior. </p>
