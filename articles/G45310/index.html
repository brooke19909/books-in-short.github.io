This is the first device in the line of the 400s, aimed at a target audience that is different from most models of the brand.  If you need a <span>smartphone for a child, a</span> fallback option, or you are switching from a regular push-button telephone to your first smartphone, the Lumia 435 is well suited for you. Price and specifications clearly indicate this purpose of the model. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  If the company often prefers win-win classic colors - black and white for expensive smartphones, then bright acid colors do not lose popularity for budget devices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 435" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1031005.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Lumia 435 in shape resembles Asha 503 - the same strict rectangular outlines.  The back cover is made of sturdy, scratch-resistant matte polycarbonate and can be easily removed / put on.  This has not only aesthetic value (having bought several colors, you can change them at least every day), but also practical - if the back side loses its attractive appearance, it is easy and simple to replace it, without the cost of professional repairs and a long search for spare parts. </p><p>  Microsoft Lumia 435 is a very compact model that fits comfortably in any palm.  The back is smoothly rounded, and the weight of the smartphone is correctly distributed to achieve the perfect balance.  The exact dimensions of the model: 11.8 x 6.5 x 1.2 cm, weight 134 g. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The location of the connectors is standard: at the top there is a headphone jack, at the bottom - microUSB.  The physical buttons are located on the right - the volume button and the unlock button.  Both are easily distinguishable and pleasantly pressed.  The left end is completely empty. </p><p>  To replace and install a microSD and microSIM card, you will have to get a battery. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="microsoft lumia 435" class="if" height="482" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1031006.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The display by today's standards is small, but rather standard for budget devices - the diagonal is only 4 inches, resolution is 480 by 800 pixels (density 233 pixels per inch).  Perhaps this is one of the weakest points of the model.  The screen is not protected by either <span>Gorilla Glass</span> or an oleophobic coating.  This means that scratches on it will appear quickly, and fingerprints (and cheeks) will be very noticeable.  So you have to immediately stock up with cleaning wipes for equipment. </p><p>  The low resolution is especially striking when reading text and greatly complicates the viewing of web pages. </p><p>  Bright sunlight is also a problem for Microsoft Lumia 435. Black is losing its sharpness, so be prepared to have to cover the display with your palm (especially when using WhatsApp). </p><p>  But the smartphone has an option that is usually not available in low-cost models - auto-adjust the screen brightness.  It is not very sensitive, but still saves the user from the need to often change its settings manually. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is expected that the viewing angles of the screen are bad, the illumination and saturation of colors drops noticeably if you look at it from different angles.  Auto brightness adjustment improves the situation a little, but still is not able to completely eliminate this drawback. </p><p>  But the screen sensor is very sensitive and responds quickly to touch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lumia 435" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1031001.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features Lumia 435 </h2><p>  The smartphone has a dual-core Snapdragon 200 processor, clocked at 1.2 GHz and 1 GB of RAM.  This allows him to cope with most of the tasks necessary for the average user, to which he is oriented. </p><p>  The internal memory is 8 GB (do not forget that about half are occupied by system files), its increase is possible using microSD-cards up to 128 GB. </p><p>  The battery is quite modest, its capacity is 1560 mA. </p><p>  The smartphone has 2 cameras, but you should not expect a lot from them: </p><ul><li>  The main one is 2 megapixels, there is no flash.  On a small screen, pictures may seem of acceptable quality, but with their increase on a device with a large display, poor quality is very evident.  The same goes for the video shot with its help; </li><li>  Front VGA - equivalent to 0.3 megapixels.  Useful only for video chat in Skype, and even then the result will be rather mediocre. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 435 dual sim" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1030999.jpg" width="594"></div></li></ul><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  Since the Lumia 435 does not claim to be a universal mobile device, its main function, namely, providing the owner with different types of communication, should be implemented as best as possible.  And here the manufacturer did not deceive expectations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The quality of calls at the height, the speaker and microphone work perfectly, and therefore both interlocutors are perfectly audible. </p><p>  The proprietary People Hub application allows you to create a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù contact list and supplement it with information taken from the profiles of your friends on social networks. </p><p>  Of course, the smartphone supports the new standard Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi, as well as GPS. </p><p>  And the Lumia 435 Dual Sim - an exact copy of the 435 model, but with 2 microSIM cards - will allow you to use two tariff plans or a personal and corporate card at the same time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone lumia 435" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1030994.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Interface </h2><p>  Initially, the Lumia 435 smartphone comes with Windows Phone 8.1 installed on it, but it was one of the first to get on the list of devices officially supporting Windows 10. </p><p>  Of course, a modest number of applications is a characteristic drawback of both versions of operating systems, but Microsoft is rapidly increasing their number.  In addition, they also have advantages that deserve special mention. </p><p>  For example, customers are provided with 30 GB of free space in the OneDrive cloud storage, the file exchange with which is very fast and comfortable. </p><p>  Together with convenient and well-debugged Microsoft Office applications, this greatly simplifies the lives of users - because today we often start working with a document on one computer, then transfer it to another, and use mobile devices to make changes to it on the go. </p><p>  Since the price category of the Lumia 435 allows you to use it as a smartphone for children and teenagers, playing music is not the last function in it.  It should be noted that he copes with it quite successfully, and together with good headphones, the volume level and bass allow you to enjoy recordings in all its glory.  So the Lumia 435 is a worthy replacement for a separate music player. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 435 reviews" height="418" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1030996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Step into the Future </h2><p>  With Windows, futuristic movie technology is available even on a budget smartphone.  Cortana‚Äôs voice assistant, Microsoft‚Äôs response to Apple‚Äôs Siri or Google‚Äôs Google Now, is developing quite rapidly and can already perform many functions: </p><ul><li>  start searching for information on a given request (though, do it exclusively in the Bing search engine); </li><li>  recognize and find music; </li><li>  put the smartphone into silent mode during meetings from the calendar; </li><li>  and even tell jokes. </li></ul><p>  But, unfortunately, so far "Cortana" can only translate phrases into Russian, but it is not able to use it as a language for communicating with the user.  Rumor has it that in 2016 this flaw will be fixed, but the exact dates are still unknown. </p><h2>  Cash Issues </h2><p>  How much will the Lumia 435 cost?  The price at the start of sales (February 2015) was about 4.5 thousand rubles.  Now the smartphone has fallen in price a bit, you can find offers with a cost of a little less than 4 thousand rubles.  Since this is a fairly popular and recently released model, it is easy to find in most electronics stores. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lumia 435 price" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1030995.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What do customers think of the Lumia 435? </h2><p>  Reviews on the smartphone, as well as expert opinions, are mostly positive.  Given its value, it performs its functions perfectly. </p><p>  Attractive design is combined with unexpected reliability of the case, which is quite difficult to damage.  The smartphone has good performance, which makes it easy to solve most problems.  Of course, a weak processor makes itself felt - if old games like Angry Birds and Jetpack Joyride run fine, then modern Asphalt 8, Subway Surfers or Temple Run 2 start to hang heavily with the player moving to higher levels and speeding up the game. </p><p>  The battery is enough for a day of fairly active use of the smartphone.  Of course, if you are going to play or watch movies much longer (which is not so convenient on such a small screen), then the battery will drain much earlier. </p><p>  To delay this moment, you can switch to energy-saving mode or use the Battery Saver application, which shows where the battery is being consumed. </p><p>  And what about the camera in the Lumia 435?  Reviews predictably attribute it to flaws.  After all, such a quality of images today few people are satisfied even in a mobile device.  But it is clear that this was one of the victims (along with a small screen) that had to be brought in order to reduce the cost of the model. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone lumia 435" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/1031004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Both versions of this smartphone - with one microSIM card or Lumia 435 Dual Sim - demonstrate an excellent price-quality ratio.  Yes, they have significant drawbacks - a screen, a camera, a weak processor.  But we must not forget that these smartphones cost about 1/10 of the price of the iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S6 or LG G4, so you can‚Äôt measure them by the same parameters.  Build quality, a carefully calibrated balance of capabilities of physical components and the operating system, which allows you to successfully perform most of the standard tasks, the mass of functions that are rarely found in such models, a very modest price - all this makes the Lumia 435 a reliable and affordable workhorse. </p>
