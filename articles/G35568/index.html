This craft is not inferior in quality to even the most expensive similar products from stores, and sometimes in many ways surpasses them.  Because only high-quality materials are used for their manufacture.  Unfortunately, not every person can order such a doll from a good handyman master, due to their high cost.  But almost anyone can independently sew such a thing from improvised materials. </p><h2>  The first step in a big deal </h2><p>  The creation of a beautiful handmade doll begins with the preparation of the necessary materials and product patterns.  Moreover, the fabric should be selected after you have decided on the size and functional features of the craft.  After all, if a child will play with her in the future, then the material for the toy should be as dense as possible, and small details completely excluded. </p><p>  Among the many types of handmade dolls, it is very easy to get confused, since they all look very beautiful and original.  Therefore, first of all, you should decide on the type of future doll.  Let us consider in more detail some of them in terms of popularity: </p><ol><li>  Tilda doll. </li><li>  Pumpkin head doll. </li><li>  Doll Snowball. </li><li>  Waldorf doll. </li><li>  Rag dolls dolls. </li><li>  Jointed dolls. </li><li>  Attic doll. </li><li>  Doll amulet. </li></ol><p>  To sew all these exhibits, you need to have <span>full-size textile doll patterns.</span>  A good master can independently build any pattern, but for beginners it is necessary to have a ready-made blank. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Famous toy </h2><p>  Tilda doll became famous back in 1999, it was then that a trial exhibit was created, which was created by Tony Finger.  Since then, her craft has become in great demand, and a wave of "tildomania" swept around the world.  All crafts with this name are very cute and irresistible.  They have their own characteristics, thanks to which they are easy to distinguish from other handmade dolls, namely: long arms and legs, small face, colorful and only natural fabrics.  Each tilde has its own bright and unique image.  Having a full-size textile doll pattern, you can make any tilde very quickly.  Below is one of such popular dolls along with a pattern. </p>

    <p>  As can be seen from the photograph, the face of the textile doll is made with a minimal image of its parts.  Only the eyes of the craft are depicted, which should be embroidered with thread or sewing on beads.  The cheeks are also slightly browned, for which blush of any color should be used.  The image of such a face is another hallmark of the tilde. </p><h2>  Distant relative </h2><p>  Having figured out the tilde pattern, it's time to start making pumpkin heads.  It got its name for the presence of a large pumpkin-shaped head, but this feature in no way prevents it from being in great demand, but rather, on the contrary, is considered its highlight.  Many craftsmen claim that the pumpkin head is akin to the tilde, although in appearance they are completely different. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Consider how to make a textile pumpkin head doll correctly.  For these purposes, it will be necessary to prepare the same fabric as for the previous sample, as well as acrylic paints for face painting.  The material for the hair can be different, starting with thick threads for knitting and ending with special artificial hair.  The most important component for creating such a craft is, of course, a pattern, one of which is shown below. </p>

    <p>  Such a cute doll will be able to decorate any home, as well as become a great gift for a child.  You should save patterns of textile dolls in full size, because with the help of them you can make a lot of various crafts.  One has only to change the hairstyle and clothes of the product, and it will look completely different. </p><h2>  Charming cutie </h2><p>  For the manufacture of Snowballs, it is also necessary to prepare patterns of textile dolls in full size.  This craft has very interesting shapes, namely, stable legs, so it can stand on its own.  To achieve this effect, you need to sew thick cardboard cut to the soles of the finished doll, cut in the shape of the foot and trimmed with fabric.  She also has a very expressive face that should be painted with acrylics.  Below is a pattern of such a doll. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="textile doll face" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46256/1694611.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <p>  Many needlewomen advise taking <span>linen fabric</span> for sewing the body of <span>the Snowball doll</span> <span>,</span> but, in principle, other natural materials can be used.  The main thing is that they are not too thin and transparent. </p><h2>  Keepers of the Family Outbreak </h2><p>  Among the graceful and beautiful dolls that children are used to playing, there is a completely different kind of crafts.  These are the so-called amulets.  They are not considered toys, although they look childish, very funny.  These include ‚Äúcartoon‚Äù attic dolls and amulets.  The main purpose of such products is to protect housing from all kinds of dark forces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a textile doll" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46256/1694671.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  To make such a handmade textile doll, there is no need to make patterns for it.  Since the doll-amulet can not be sewn, but only wound from pieces of fabric.  But the attic craft is made in a completely different technique, which involves the formation of the head and body of the doll from nylon tights.  Despite the use of rather strange material for her sewing, such a little thing looks very beautiful. </p><h2>  Little nuances </h2><p>  In the process of manufacturing all of the above dolls, it is worth learning some of the nuances associated with their sewing.  For example, clothing for a textile doll can be made of any material, and it does not have to be similar to the image in the photograph.  It should also be remembered that all the patterns indicated in the master classes do not have allowances for seams, so it is advisable to leave a couple of centimeters for stitching the parts when making them.  As for the internal stuffing of dolls, it is best to take syntepuh or holofiber for this. </p>

    <p>  It often happens that beige fabric is needed to sew the doll‚Äôs body.  If the necessary material is not available, it can be painted very quickly.  To do this, you need to use tea brewing, in which a piece of tissue is immersed for a couple of minutes, and then rinsed in running water and dried.  After such actions, the fabric acquires a pleasant beige shade that does not wash off for a long time when washing. </p>
