    <h2>  Geographic location </h2><p>  Eilat is located in the south of Israel, moreover, it is the southernmost point of the country.  It stretches along the shores of the picturesque Gulf of Aqaba, or Gulf of Eilat, in the Red Sea.  This city is far removed from other cities in Israel.  However, if you wish, you can organize excursions to the sights of the country.  In Eilat, there is a port that connects it with countries spread along the coast of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  It is from here that the gifts of the Red Sea go to the countries of the Indian and Pacific Basin. </p><h2>  How to get </h2><p>  In addition to the sea route, you can get to Eilat through the air gate.  In the very center of the city there is an airport of the same name.  Until recently, it served only domestic flights, but with the increasing popularity of Eilat as a seaside health resort, the airport began to accept international flights.  So, from Russia you can get here from a number of large cities: Voronezh, Kazan, Irkutsk, Yekaterinburg, etc. on charter flights.  Ten flights from Aeroflot airlines ($ 1,400 round-trip is the most expensive option), El Al ($ 400 round-trip), LOT (the price is constantly changing depending on the time of the year) are daily made from Moscow to the resort every day. )  It is not as easy to get from the Northern capital to Eilat as from Moscow: there are only a couple of flights of the Polish LOT airline per week.  You can also get here by bus, some tourists do so to save money.  The nearest international airport is in the city of Uvda, which is located 60 km north of Eilat, whose beaches attract crowds of tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eilat‚Äôs weather" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2157607.jpg"></div>

Along the beaches of Eilat, mountains rise.  Experts say that this is the reason for the high volatility, as a result of which the salt concentration in the bay reaches 4.1%, which is much higher than in the ocean.  Here, even in winter, it is warm enough to swim.  Many tourists share that they are going to Israel in the cold season because of the wonderful weather in Eilat.  The lowest water temperature in the bay is at around +22 degrees.  All of these factors lead to coral formation.  They make up a fairly wide band here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eilat Hotels with Private Beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/2157606.jpg"></div>
