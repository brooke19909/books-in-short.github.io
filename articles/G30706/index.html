    <p>  To date, this payment system is in a leading position among all other similar systems.  You can pay for products with a Visa credit card number.  Russia, the CIS, Europe, etc. - this number can come in handy almost anywhere in the world.  A similar card, except for ATMs, is also used when performing trading operations even in the online sphere.  Both plastic card types and virtual ones are popular. </p><h2></h2><h2>  What types of cards exist today? </h2><p>  What can be done today with a <span>Visa card</span> number <span>?</span>  <span>Sberbank</span> and other financial and credit institutions offer a large number of services.  But a lot will depend on what type of card is available.

This type of card is by far one of the simplest.  In most cases, the VisaElectron card number is unembossed.  In other words, it simply is not squeezed out on that part of the card, which is the front.  It should also be noted that the card has restrictions on the provision of a possible amount of cash.  In addition, it does not have the necessary level of security. </li><li>  VisaClassic.  It has a wider range of functions.  It is standard for most payment cards.  With it, it will not be difficult to pay for a variety of purchases and services.  In this case, the Visa card number is embossed. </li><li>  VisaGold is able to provide a higher cash limit.  In addition, it is able to provide its owner with a wide range of diverse features.  In case of loss of a card, the holder can count on its emergency reissue by banking institutions. </li></ol><h2></h2><h2>  The set of cards is quite wide and varied. </h2>

    <p>  Why do I need a Visa card number?  What information does he store?  These questions are often asked, especially by inquisitive people.  But this issue should be addressed in more detail.  The data stored in the card number is of a technical nature.  In addition, we can say that most of this information is not a secret for anyone. </p><p>  The digital code of the Visa card allows you to read certain information.  Its need arises from the use of numerical codes that are currently used by banking institutions to obtain certain data.  It should be understood that when this payment system was created, the machines basically read the digital codes.  Words began to be read by them later. </p><p>  But do not take this reading method as outdated.  Many professionals recognize that it is the most convenient method by which you can specify the customer number.  The thing is that there can be much more digital codes than people.  For example, there may be a large number of Ivanov Ivanovs with a Visa card.  But Ivanov Ivan with a card with a number 1232 5577 9999 0000, - only one.  Another card created for a person with the same name and surname will carry completely different information.  This feature plays an important role when shopping online. </p><h2></h2><h2>  What could be the numbers? </h2>

    <p>  It is worth considering in more detail the issue of what is hidden under the number.  Let's say that in front of you lies a certain card that belongs to a certain person.  <span>Where is the</span> Visa <span>card number located</span> ?  It is knocked out on the part that is front, namely - next to the name and surname of the owner.  The number can be not only embossed, but also written by coloring means. </p><p>  It is believed that the extruded number is the safest and most universal.  Using a card with this number, you can get money at old ATMs.  They simply do not have the ability to connect to the network and analyze non-magnetic or electronic code.  But they read information from cards with extruded signs quite easily. </p><h2></h2><h2>  What do the first six numbers hide under themselves? </h2><p>  Visa card number usually has 16 digits.  They are grouped in four.  Grouping is needed more for aesthetics than for performing any kind of functionality.  In addition, it should be noted that a separate meaning is hidden only in the first six digits. </p>

This is such a designation, the number of a particular bank that issued the card.  This group also includes numbers that indicate the number of a specific system.  Due to these numbers, the card may not pay for certain purchases at certain stores and may not work in countries where the Visa credit card number is not registered.  An example is the following: a problem can occur when performing operations in foreign online stores or when linking a card to a PayPlay account.

    <h2></h2><h2>  Information encoded in the next eight digits </h2><p>  The next eight numbers hide the <span>account number</span> to which the link is made.  With it there is a withdrawal of funds for making purchases and it is on it that money is accrued.  In this group of digits, the type of currency, place of issue and type of card can be encrypted.  After these numbers are verification numbers.  With their help, the card is checked for compliance, after which operations are permitted or prohibited. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Additional code required to pay for virtual services </h2><p>  But these are not all the numbers by which information is read.  There are three more numbers that can be seen on the back of the card.  The need for these figures arises only when it is required to perform payment transactions via the Internet.  These numbers are called CVV (CV2). </p>

Knowing their meaning, you can understand that they have a sufficiently high value for scammers.  Therefore, you should not make payments on systems that are unknown so that attackers do not answer the question about how to find out the Visa card number.  In addition, you should check the certificate of the site on which the payment for services or products.  In some browsers, you can find out about the certification of a resource using the icon that appears in the address bar, namely in the left part of it.
