  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The horn coffee maker will make espresso and cappuccino</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Strong and aromatic coffee in the morning or during the day is already something akin to habits for many of us.  But making truly delicious coffee is not easy.  A drink made in a mug is completely wrong.  This requires a special device called a coffee maker.  There are several varieties of it, each of which has both its advantages and disadvantages.  If you love espresso, then a carob coffee maker will become an indispensable assistant, which we will talk about today. </p><p>  <strong>Principle of operation</strong> </p><table align="left" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  DeLonghi EC152 <br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="carob coffee maker" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/28772.jpg" width="500"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  Water is poured into the boiler, and <span>ground coffee</span> is placed in the horn (it is advisable to prepare the grains before each preparation of the drink).  The rest of the work will be done by the horn machine itself.  The water heats up, steam forms, which passes through the coffee and enters the cup.  It is advisable to warm the last one before, so that the walls are not cold.  In order to understand whether you should buy such a model, let's understand the principle of its operation.  Such a coffee maker got its name due to the shape of the coffee compartment, made in the form of a horn.  For comparison: in other models they can use nets or bags.  Coffee is prepared under high steam pressure, which is why it turns out to be especially tasty and strong.  Moreover, thanks to steam, the maximum amount of nutrients gets into the cup. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><table align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Philips HD 8325 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Horn coffee makers" class="if" height="279" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/28799.jpg" width="270"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  As you can see, using such a coffee maker is very simple.  Depending on the power realized in the model, coffee can be prepared in 0.5-2 minutes.  Many carob coffee makers are equipped with additional features such as an anti-drip system and overheat protection.  The latter function is especially useful as it protects the device from excessive loads. </p><p>  And one more pleasant moment.  With the help of such a coffee maker, you can prepare not only espresso, but also cappuccino <span>(coffee with foam).</span>  But here a lot will depend on the capabilities of the models: some will cope better with this task, others worse. </p><p>  <strong>Carob coffee maker: how to choose</strong> </p><table align="left" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td>  Krups XP4020 <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Horn coffee maker" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/48/28801.jpg" width="200"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to the power of the device.  The larger it is, the more powerful the steam pressure will be, which means coffee will be more saturated.  The preparation time of the drink also depends on this.  So, a horn coffee maker with a power of 1000 W, generating a steam pressure of up to 4 bar, makes coffee in two minutes, and a model with 1000-1700 W and a steam pressure of up to 15 pairs can cope with the task in just 30 seconds. </p><p>  At the time of purchase, you should determine the material of the horn.  It is best if it is metal, because, thanks to this material, the coffee will warm up better.  A plastic horn can give watery coffee with a sour taste. </p><p>  These are the main points that you should pay attention to when buying a device.  It remains only to determine the price, because the <span>carob coffee maker</span> fits in a wide range at a cost.  Experience shows that for one person it‚Äôs quite enough and cheaper device that can prepare 1-2 cups of aromatic drink.  In principle, all models of coffee makers are capable of making a small amount of coffee at a time.  In any case, the choice is yours. </p>
