This problem has several solutions.  Next, we will consider in detail only the most convenient and popular options for the development of events.  Step-by-step instructions will help you easily transfer funds to a Sberbank bank card.  And each person after that will be able to choose a suitable method of replenishment of his account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kreditorpro.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Account replenishment operations" class="if uuid-2412959" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412959.jpg"></div><h2>  Possible methods </h2><p>  A modern client of a financial company is able to transfer money to a Sberbank card in different ways.  The main thing is to understand the course of action under certain circumstances. </p><p>  Replenishment of bank plastic accounts from Sberbank can be carried out: </p><ul><li>  through an ATM; </li><li>  using the bank cash desk; </li><li>  through mobile banking; </li><li>  from a mobile phone (funds are debited from SIM); </li><li>  through online banking; </li><li>  through electronic wallets; </li><li>  through transfer services from different banks; </li><li>  through Sberbank payment terminals. </li></ul><p>  Next, we will study all of the listed approaches.  In reality, everything is much simpler than it seems.  The main thing is to follow a certain procedure. </p><h2>  Ticket offices to help </h2><p>  Let's start with the least popular trick.  We are talking about contacting the bank with a corresponding request.  This scenario is not used by advanced customers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="onlinevbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank Online and card transfers" class="if uuid-2412961" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412961.jpg"></div><p>  To transfer money to a Sberbank card, you need: </p><ol><li>  Take documents with you.  A person will need a bank card number, money and ID. </li><li>  Contact the cashier of any bank.  It is advisable to go to Sberbank.  Then, no commission will be charged for the operation. </li><li>  Tell the cashier about your intentions.  Call the card number, pass the passport and money. </li><li>  Get a receipt for the transaction and an identity card. </li></ol><p>  It is done.  Now it remains only to wait for the money to be credited to the specified account.  This usually happens within a few hours.  Sometimes the waiting period is up to 5 business days. </p><h2>  ATM </h2><p>  You can transfer money to a Sberbank card using ATMs.  For example, by replenishing the account in cash.  Consider this scenario. </p><p>  When working with Sberbank ATMs, you will have to act like this: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into the ATM and indicate the PIN code from it. </li><li>  Select the option "Operations with the card." </li><li>  Click on the "Replenish Account" button. </li><li>  Place the bills in the bill acceptor. </li><li>  Check the data is correct. </li><li>  Confirm transaction. </li></ol><p>  The operation does not cause any particular difficulties.  You can act differently.  How exactly? </p><div class="photo" data-original="epayinfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sberbank account replenishment with Qiwi" class="if uuid-2412960" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412960.jpg"></div><h2>  Transfer from ATM between cards </h2><p>  Say, using a money transfer between two plastics.  The following algorithm of actions is suitable for both ATMs and Sberbank terminals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The implementation of the task is reduced to the following steps: </p><ol><li>  Insert the card into an ATM or terminal. </li><li>  Get started with the machine. </li><li>  Select "Card Transactions" - "Transfer".  The corresponding menu item can be in the "Payments" block. </li><li>  Indicate the details of the receiver's plastic. </li><li>  Enter the amount you want to transfer. </li><li>  Check the entered data and then confirm the procedure. </li></ol><p>  No other action is required.  Money will be debited from the active card to the account of the specified details.  If you work with machines from <span>Sberbank, no</span> transaction fee will be charged. </p><h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  <span>How to transfer money to another Sberbank card?</span>  The next trick is the behavior of the operation through Sberbank Online.  First, the user will have to register on the portal.  Only after this step will he be able to activate Internet banking services. </p><p>  The following is suggested to follow this type of manual: </p><ol><li>  Log in to your profile on the Sberbank Online website. </li><li>  Go to the "Payments and Transfers" block. </li><li>  Select the "Translation" function. </li><li>  Refine the type of transaction.  In our case, the option ‚ÄúTo another client of Sberbank‚Äù is suitable. </li><li>  Fill out the form that appears on the screen.  Usually you need to choose the plastic from which funds are debited, to register the details of the recipient of funds and the amount of the transaction. </li><li>  Make sure the printed information is correct. </li><li>  Click on the "Translate" button. </li></ol><p>  The actions taken will allow you to print or save the receipt of the transaction.  Money will be transferred to the indicated card.  It is necessary to wait for funds up to 3-5 days. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tele2wiki.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Tele2&quot; and transfer money to the card" class="if uuid-2412974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412974.jpg"></div><h2>  Mobile banking to help </h2><p>  You can transfer money to a Sberbank card through 900. This is the number responsible for the operation of the Mobile Bank service.  By connecting it, a citizen will be able to manage the plastic account without much hassle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After successful activation of mobile banking, you will need: </p><ol><li>  Open New Message on your mobile phone. </li><li>  Type in the text "Transfer mobile recipient_number_transaction_total". </li><li>  Send the generated letter to the number 900. </li></ol><p>  Quick, easy, convenient.  This technique is in great demand among the population.  Transferring money from your phone to a Sberbank card is easier than it sounds.  Especially if you follow the detailed instructions. </p><p>  Important: in order for the recipient to "pick up" the funds put to him, it is necessary that he also has mobile banking connected.  Otherwise, the operation will not go through the processing stage. </p><h2>  Bank transfer services </h2><p>  Transfer money to a Sberbank card?  The next scenario is working with third-party bank transfer services.  Typically, these services are free, but they include a commission. </p><p>  You can find the appropriate sites from almost every bank.  Often customers use the service from Alfa Bank. </p><p>  In general, the algorithm of actions under such circumstances will look like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the card transactions page between banks. </li><li>  Indicate the details of the plastic from which to write off money. </li><li>  Prescribe data from the Sberbank card. </li><li>  Enter the amount of payment. </li><li>  Click on the "Translate" button. </li></ol><p>  As soon as these actions are behind, the person will replenish the account of the selected Sberbank card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sendsmart.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS and money transfer" class="if uuid-2412955" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412955.jpg"></div><h2>  From SIM card </h2><p>  How can I transfer money from a phone to a Sberbank card?  Consider a situation in which funds will be debited directly from the SIM card of the mobile device.  Similar payments are found more and more. </p><p>  The algorithm of actions directly depends on the mobile operator.  You can replenish the bank plastic "Sberra" as follows: </p><ol><li>  On the MTS website, select the "Easy payment" - "Money transfer" - "To the card" function.  Prescribe account details and payment amount. </li><li>  Write a message with the text "Card plastic_number month_and_year_expiration_action_cards_total".  Send a request to number 3116. This technique is relevant for Megafon. </li><li>  Generate an SMS of the type "Payment_system_cards_card_number_payment_size".  Send a message to 7878. After the actions taken, the person will transfer part of the money from the Beeline SIM card to the specified plastic. </li></ol><p>  These are the most common layouts.  Transactions can also be carried out on the official pages of mobile operators on the Internet, but these are not the most common tricks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sberbank-gid.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ATM and money transfers" class="if uuid-2412957" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412957.jpg"></div><h2>  Tele2 and transactions </h2><p>  You can <span>transfer money from "Tele2" to the card of Sberbank.</span>  We study this case separately.  What needs to be done to a person to achieve the goal? </p><p>  At the moment, there are several tricks.  For example: </p><ol><li>  Go to market.tele2.ru. </li><li>  Select the option "To the card."  It is located in the upper right corner of the page. </li><li>  Indicate the data of the phone from which you will have to charge money. </li><li>  Enter the details of the recipient of funds. </li><li>  Specify the transaction amount. </li><li>  Check the box "I agree ...". </li><li>  Click on the "Translate" button. </li></ol><p>  This method allows you to transfer money from Tele2 to a Sberbank card via the Internet.  But there is another rather interesting approach to solving the problem. </p><p>  The thing is that mobile operators allow you to replenish bank cards via SMS.  In the case of "Tele2" the message will look like - "card number amount".  The generated SMS is sent to number 159. </p><p>  USSD-requests also help to cope with the task.  To transfer money to a Sberbank card, a person will have to dial * 159 * 1 * plastic_number * payment_size # on the phone. </p><h2>  E-wallets </h2><p>  Modern customers of Sberbank can replenish plastic accounts using electronic wallets.  This technique allows you not to work with cash.  It takes a minimum of time and effort. </p><p>  We will study the transfer of money from Qiwi to a Sberbank card.  The user will: </p><ol><li>  Log in to the mentioned electronic wallet. </li><li>  In the top menu, click on the "Withdraw" button. </li><li>  Print transaction data and plastic details. </li><li>  Mark the item "Wallet account". </li><li>  Confirm the request. </li></ol><p>  Similarly, there is a replenishment of bank plastic using other electronic payment systems. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onlinevbank.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to transfer money through online banking" class="if uuid-2412956" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2412956.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  We found out how to transfer money to another Sberbank card.  In addition, all the popular methods of replenishing a bank plastic account were presented to our attention. </p><p>  Now everyone can choose how to act.  All learned techniques work equally well.  The difference is that in some cases a fee is charged for transactions.  Transferring money to a Sberbank card via SMS is easy. </p>
