So, a classic example of such a labor lesson is working with kids in the older group based on the tale "Three Bears".  The main theme in this case is the application "Our favorite Bear."  The process is a joint work with children to create a picture of a teddy bear from color cardboard and paper. </p><h2>  Application "Our beloved Bear": the oldest group of kindergarten </h2><p>  The lesson simultaneously pursues several goals from the field of creativity, communication, cognition and development of fine motor skills.  The pedagogical tasks implemented on it are teaching the kids to build the image of the toy using separate parts, reinforcing skills in cutting round and oval details, placing them on paper, and carefully sticking them. </p><p>  Thanks to such activities, children develop a sense of composition, they learn to spend improvised material in the most rational way.  Along the way, telling yourself the story of a fairy tale, the kids again come in contact with the characters, learn to empathize with fairy-tale characters, and develop communication skills. </p>

    <p>  Along with obtaining the Bear‚Äôs image, children are offered gymnastics techniques for the eyes (to relieve eyestrain) and exercises for the fingers.  The action is accompanied by a slide show with an appropriate plot and a tutor demonstrating techniques for working with paper, glue and scissors.  In addition, during work, children can listen to music, talk and answer questions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To create an application, each participant will need an A4 sheet of cardboard, brown colored paper, from which the figure of a teddy bear will be cut, as well as a small amount of corrugated and plain paper of other colors, glue, scissors, a napkin for hands. </p><h2>  Who doesn't like bears? </h2><p>  As you know, cubs are very popular among children.  There are tons of cartoons and books with bears as the main characters, from Winnie the Pooh to Gummy Bears.  So the theme, voiced as an application "Bear", in the senior or middle group of kindergarten is likely to find a lively response in the kids. </p><p>  The teacher can tell a little about this animal - lives in the forest, loves to climb trees and enjoy honey.  At the request of the educator, the kids list tales and poems whose characters are bears.  Of course, ‚ÄúTeremka‚Äù, ‚ÄúKolobok‚Äù, ‚ÄúMasha and the Bears‚Äù, ‚ÄúTops and Roots‚Äù will be mentioned.  Without a doubt, children will not forget about the super popular and beloved by modern kids cartoon "Masha and the Bear." </p>

    <h2>  <span>Application "Bear"</span> in the senior group - where to start work? </h2><p>  The tale "Three Bears", on the plot of which the work will be built, should first be read and discussed with the children.  At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher asks the children to recall the plot of the tale and list the main characters.  Then invites you to mentally go to the house to the bears.  The application "Bear" can be made in the form of a teddy bear sitting at the window with beautiful shutters and curtains of corrugated paper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  You can choose an option and simpler - Mishutka on the background of the log wall of the house or just in an open clearing with grass and flowers. </p><p>  The teacher offers the children to consider the figure of Mishutka and list its components - paws, trunk, head, and then compare them with familiar geometric shapes, for example, an oval, a circle.  What does bear‚Äôs head resemble?  That's right, circle!  How to get it?  It is necessary to carefully cut with scissors from the square.  The same applies to the oval, which is ‚Äúmined‚Äù from the rectangle.  The circle and oval in the future application will depict, respectively, the head and torso of a teddy bear. </p>

    <h2>  Getting to work </h2><p>  Before starting work, the teacher once again reminds the children of the basic rules for handling scissors and invites them to stretch their fingers by doing special exercises.  All this is accompanied by the reading of suitable poems or tongue twisters, you can do it to the music. </p><p>  This lesson is suitable for children aged 5-7 years, that is, pupils of the older group.  It will be difficult for younger children to independently master the cutting of geometric shapes, and stick them carefully until it works. </p><p>  The applied skill that the Bear application trains is the ability to work with scissors.  In addition, tasks for kids - to choose the right color of paper, to learn accuracy and perseverance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can cut the torso, head, and legs of the teddy bear with the help of pre-prepared templates that the teacher distributes to each child.  To set up children in the right way, puzzles or tongue twisters about bears should be heard before the start of the lesson.  It is worthwhile to demonstrate to the pupils illustrations of fairy tales whose characters these animals are. </p>

    <h2>  Safety comes first </h2><p>  Safety precautions, which must be listed at the beginning of the lesson, consist in the requirements to store the scissors in a place specially designed for this purpose, to lay them on the table with sharp ends away from themselves (at the same time closed), to pass the rings forward, in no case to cut on the go , and do not hold the scissors up with the blades.  Also, do not work if the tool is dull or the hinge is loose. </p><p>  After making sure that the children know and understand the essence of these important requirements, the educator can offer to go directly to work.  If it is decided to cut out according to patterns, children are invited to pick up colored paper.  As a basis, take a cardboard sheet of a certain color (depending on the color of the selected background).  For example, you can take blue and decorate with grass - a strip of green paper. </p><p>  If the background will be a wall of a bear house with a cut-through window, its color may be different.  To simplify the work, on such a sheet you can pre-stick a window cut out of paper - a frame with elegant curtains, which are suitable as small pieces of corrugated paper.  If it is assumed that the entire application "Bear" will be done with the child‚Äôs own hands, it is better to refuse a complex background. </p>

    <h2>  Execution technique </h2><p>  To learn how to cut Mishkino's torso, children must fold a sheet of brown paper in half, attach a template to the fold, circle around the outline and cut along the line.  Expanding the resulting parts, glue them on cardboard.  Immediately you can dress our Bear.  According to another pre-prepared template, we cut out bright pants with straps in the same way and stick them over the body. </p><p>  Then proceed to the head.  You can, as already mentioned, cut it out of a paper square, you can - by tracing a round pattern.  Attach it to the base sheet above the torso and glue it gently, following the alignment of the details. </p><p>  A carved muzzle of beige or light brown color is pasted on top of a brown head circle, a small black nose and eyes made of white and very tiny black circles are attached to it.  Panties can be decorated with buttons and pockets.  If there is no desire or opportunity to tinker with such small details, to create such an application, you can take ready-made templates downloaded from the Internet, on which there are already all the details, down to the smallest. </p>

    <h2>  Piggy bank of ideas </h2><p>  The background can be thought up in the form of a clearing with flowers or a log wall of a forest house.  You can depict not Mishutka, but the Little Bear girl in an elegant sundress instead of panties.  The sundress cuts out according to the same pattern, but without cutting the corner in the middle under the trouser legs. </p><p>  The eyes of the little bear can be taken ready-made from plastic for crafts.  If the paws and ears are cut in the form of small circles or ovals of the same size, then you can prepare them all at once, folding brown paper with an accordion.  If one of the children still does not have good scissors, an adult can help him by issuing pre-prepared parts. </p><h2>  Interesting "chips" </h2><p>  To avoid mistakes in sticking small paper circles, it is better to take colored double-sided paper.  Flowers for a glade background can be cut into a figured hole punch.  And in the paws of a teddy bear, you can put a heart obtained in the same way.  If the application "Bear" turned out to be beautiful and neat, it is suitable as a postcard (for example, as a holiday gift to parents). </p>

    <p>  You can also complicate the task by placing next to the main character and other animals.  In this case, the application will be called "Bear and his friends."  All figures are drawn in exactly the same way and glued next to the main character on a cardboard sheet. </p><p>  The technique by which the applications are performed, there are a great many, and they can be not only paper.  The picture can be made of fabric - there is even an applique "Bear" crocheted.  The most difficult thing here is to master the scheme by which loops for such a product are dialed.  This task can be done by experienced enough small artists.  In addition to the threads and the hook, they will need a lot of patience and craving for creativity, so the teacher should evaluate the scope of work and think about whether all the children in the group are able to cope with the task. </p>
