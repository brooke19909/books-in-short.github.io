  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make polymer clay do-it-yourself earrings</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It seems that there are a lot of various jewelry on the shelves, but more and more people are interested in how to make earrings with their own hands.  An excellent material for their manufacture is plastic - polymer clay.  It has a different color, is easily modeled, and after a certain heat treatment it becomes very hard. </p><p>  The most commonly found on sale are domestic plastic ‚ÄúTsvetik‚Äù, which is sold in sets of colors and packaging resembles plasticine, and imported polymer clay ‚ÄúFimo‚Äù, each shade is individually packed.  The advantages of Russian products at an affordable price, but its color is not very stable: if you boil, such plastic becomes paler. </p><p>  I offer two options for how to make earrings made of <span>polymer clay</span> with your own hands <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Sunflowers </h2><p>  For work, you need plastic in black and <span>yellow,</span> 2 earrings for earrings (sold in fabric and accessories stores), 2 pins and 2-8 rings (in the same place), varnish with a glossy effect (it can also be colorless for nails). </p><p>  From the tools we use glass or 1 tile with a smooth surface, a sheet of paper and a stack.  You need an oven. To understand <span>how to make earrings</span> with your own hands, imagine what they consist of.  Firstly, it is a decorative element, in this case a flower-sunflower, secondly, a shvenza, with the help of which the earring is attached to the ear, and thirdly, the elements connecting one to the other. </p><p>  The flower is made of black tortillas and yellow petals.  All work takes place on a smooth surface of glass or tile.  In the core, with the sharp end of the stacks, make dots, seeds, and on the petals draw shallow longitudinal strips from the center to the edges, imitating the natural relief of the petals.  To get rid of fingerprints, rub them with a small piece of paper.  When the flowers are ready, insert a pin into each of them (in the black part, it is thicker and stronger), and then pull it out.  There should be a hole in which the mount will subsequently be glued. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Directly on the glass, place the work in a preheated oven for 15-20 minutes.  Look through the glass - the figure should not change colors and float away!  Before making earrings, read at what temperature you should bake purchased plastic, because different manufacturers have this parameter different: from 110 to 130 degrees. </p><p>  Remove the finished flowers from the oven and cool at room temperature.  Cool down?  Begin the assembly.  Glue the pins into the prepared hole using instant glue, attach 1 to 4 rings to them, depending on the length of the petals, and fix the fastener in the last ring.  Varnish and let dry.  So sunny flowers are ready, which cannot leave indifferent any passerby. </p><h2>  Chocolates </h2><p>  How to make <span>earrings with your own hands</span> so that everyone wants to bite off a piece of them?  Decorate them with chocolates!  Yes, not simple, but those that cannot be distinguished from the real ones.  We will make these delicacies from <span>chocolate-colored</span> polymer clay, using the same tools as the previous model, as well as blades and matches.  From a flat cake according to the pattern (rectangle 2 by 2.5 cm), cut 2 blanks.  Keep the blade straight upright.  Divide the ‚Äútile‚Äù into 4 segments by placing a match in the middle and slightly pushing it into the clay.  First, make a groove along, and then across. </p><p>  If you want more realism, you can make a bite imitation on the corners of chocolates.  To do this, using the cap from the felt-tip pen, cut off first 1, and then 2 half circle.  It will look like someone else has already enjoyed your decoration.  Scratch the fingerprints with paper, make a hole for the pin, and send the job to the oven.  All further steps are similar to the manufacture of sunflower earrings. </p><p>  Knowing how to make <span>earrings with your own hands,</span> you will not only always look bright and unusual, but you can also prepare an extraordinary gift for a friend or relative. </p>
