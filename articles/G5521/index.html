  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top-loading washing machines</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is already very difficult for modern housewives to imagine how their mothers and grandmothers lived relatively recently without automatic washing machines.  The laundry had to be soaked, then thoroughly washed, rinsed and wrung out - and this was all done manually.  And today, the washing process boils down to loading things into the machine, choosing the right program, and then hanging the items that have already been washed.  This means that women (who are most often engaged in washing) freed up a lot of time for other important things, for communicating with their spouse, playing with children and just minutes for themselves. </p><p>  Manufacturers of washing machines are constantly improving designs, introducing new technologies, striving to produce multifunctional units that have a low noise level and compact size.  If we talk about the type of loading, today there are washing machines with horizontal (laundry is laid in the drum through the door on the front panel) and vertical (laundry is laid on top) loading.  Which is better: horizontal (frontal) loading or vertical?  The answer to this question depends on many components. </p><p>  Vertical loading washing machines have a number of pluses and minuses compared to their horizontal tribesmen.  Their undoubted advantages are: </p><p>  - the ability to add and remove laundry directly during washing (which is very important); </p><p>  - ease of use - in such machines it is much more convenient to load (and then get out) laundry, for this you do not have to squat and bend; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - compactness - if we compare washing machines of the same volume with different types of loading, then the vertical size will be much smaller.  Therefore, top-loading washing machines are ideal for small spaces; </p><p>  - ease of installation - the vertical loading of the washing machine makes it possible not to think about how to put the unit so that there is enough space not only for him, but also for the opening door, so even a small corner is suitable for such a machine; </p><p>  - a shorter wash cycle; </p><p>  - high stability, which is achieved due to the presence of two shock absorbers. </p><p>  If we talk about the minuses, then we can not fail to mention the following factors: </p><p>  - washing machines with a vertical load consume more water than units with a horizontal load (therefore, those who have a water meter should definitely consider this aspect); </p><p>  - washing machines with vertical loading are often distinguished by a higher <span>noise level</span> and can bounce when spinning laundry (though not all models have a similar drawback); </p><p>  - it is impossible to put anything on top of such machines, and they cannot be used as built-in household appliances. </p><p>  When <span>choosing a washing machine</span> with a vertical load, you need to pay attention to many different factors.  The most important thing is to decide on the set of necessary functions.  Most modern washing machines are highly versatile and ‚Äúknow how‚Äù to wash a wide variety of materials: cotton, synthetics, wool, silk and other delicate fabrics (each has a separate washing mode).  In many washing machines, it is possible to additionally select the spin and rinse mode, as well as the temperature level.  Thanks to this set of functions, any user can easily cope with the launch of the washing machine.  In addition, for a top-loading washing machine, the function of removing excess foam is important. </p><p>  When choosing a washing machine, you should not forget about the manufacturer.  Preference should be given to products of those companies that have long established themselves in the market of household appliances.  If we talk about specific brands, the washing machines MIELE, AEG, Bosch, Electrolux, Candy, Zanussi, Indesit, LG, Beko, Ardo, are of high quality, versatility and a long service life. </p>
