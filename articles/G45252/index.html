According to this criterion, one-, three- and two-way speakers are distinguished.  How they differ from each other and which system is better, we will try to answer in this article.

Equipment in such systems is understaffed with a mid-range speaker that carries so-called ‚Äúspatial‚Äù information and creates surround sound.  In addition, due to the separation of duties, the equipment has become more compact. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is the difference between two-way acoustics and three-way" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1666531.jpg" width="355"></div>  The negative quality of three-way systems is the high price.  It is two to three times higher than that of two-way speakers.  Moreover, three-way acoustics involves the installation of crossovers - complex frequency filters.  To set up such equipment, you must have excellent hearing, otherwise it will not work to achieve consistency from the speakers.

    <h2>  Differences between speakers </h2><p>  Any speaker system consists of speakers (midrange, bass and treble), filtering equipment, signal amplifiers, audio cables and input terminals.  Filtering devices are responsible for dividing the audio signal into several ranges.  The two-way acoustics filter divides the frequencies into two ‚Äúsections‚Äù - up to 5-6 thousand Hz, and above 6 kHz.  Three-way devices, as a rule, are equipped with crossovers - adjustable frequency filters that divide the sound range into three sections. </p><p>  All acoustic equipment can be active or passive.  In the first case, each speaker is equipped with a separate signal amplifier.  This solution facilitates the matching of emitters, reduces the overall cost of the system.  However, at the same time, the complexity of maintenance, installation and initial configuration increases.  Separate amplifiers most often complement a set of three-way devices. </p><h2>  Coaxial and component speakers </h2><p>  How a three- or two-way <span>acoustics</span> will sound <span>in a car,</span> largely depends on the type of speakers, which are coaxial and component.  The first are a single monolithic design, which combines emitters of high, medium and low frequencies.  This solution makes the sound narrowly focused.  Therefore, such devices are used as a supplement and mainly in small cars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="two-way speakers in a car" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39348/1666534.jpg" width="600"></div>  Component speakers are emitters that can be located in different places.  Thanks to this, it is possible to achieve surround sound, but the installation process is complicated.  In addition, if installed incorrectly, the soundstage will be very heterogeneous.  <span>Component systems</span> are installed in cars with a spacious interior.

    <h2>  Price issue </h2><p>  As noted earlier, two-way speakers will be much cheaper than installing three-way equipment.  There are two reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  less equipment ‚Äî only two speakers, a maximum of two amplifiers and one filter are required; </li><li>  simple installation - you can assemble such a system yourself, having basic knowledge in the field of electricity. </li></ul><p>  Three-way systems include more sophisticated equipment, the cost of which is significantly higher than the price of conventional devices.  In addition, if you decide to install such acoustics, you will have to seek the help of professionals - without special measuring devices and fine hearing, the mounted system will sound just like two-way acoustics.  This is the main answer to the question of how the two-way acoustics differs from the three-way ones. </p>
