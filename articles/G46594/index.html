On average, it takes two hours to complete one game.  Participants are offered a variety of stories.  The program in the spirit of the communist past of the country is in great demand. </p><p>  The military museum exhibited samples of modern and Soviet technology.  Separate expositions are dedicated to weapons and uniforms.  Admission is free.  In the near future it will be closed for large-scale reconstruction, which will last until 2020. </p><p>  Cimrman English Theater puts on comic and satirical performances.  Its uniqueness lies in the fact that the artists of the theater took the traditional Czech humor, which was translated into English, as the basis of their work.  Tourists really like the surroundings.  They are delighted with the performances and recommend the theater to their friends.  This is a great place to relax in the company of loved ones. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Considering room types in Ostas 3 *, many visitors make a mistake.  Traveling alone with a child, choose a double suite.  But in vain!  Much more comfortable in apartments for three adults.  It should be borne in mind that the audibility in the hotel is excellent.  The rooms overlooking the carriageway are bright and comfortable, but in the morning it can be noisy. </p><p>  Those rooms, from the windows of which you can see the courtyard, are damp and dark.  This is the best option for those who value peace and quiet.  In winter, these rooms are cold.  Since the smoking area is located on the open terrace between the second and third levels, it is better to settle in far away from this part of the building.  The hotel has five floors.  Otherwise, all rooms are almost the same. </p><p>  Russians do not recommend suites 21 and 31. But 27 are praised.  If you need an iron, hairdryer or electric kettle, you need to contact the reception desk.  Reception staff never fail.  Some tourists were unsatisfied with the quality of cosmetic supplies.  According to them, soap and shampoo very dry the skin and can cause allergic reactions. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The hotel does not organize sightseeing trips, but they can recommend a trusted travel agency.  The most popular program is “Prague in 7 hours”.  Also in demand are the routes "Karlstejn Fortress", "New Place", "Telc", "Porcelain Town Meissen".  The average cost of excursions is 15,000 rubles for a group of three people. </p><p>  Participation in the team event will cost much less.  Only 1 000 rub.  For the program "Legends of Mystical Prague" will have to pay 6,000 rubles.  Not far from the hotel building, a walking tour through the historical places of the Czech capital “Prague - a revived fairy tale” starts.  An experienced guide will show and tell the myths that envelop ancient bridges and palaces, embankments and gardens, architectural complexes and monuments.  Price - 10 000 rubles for two adults.  The maximum number of participants is 5. Duration - 7 hours. </p>
