Its atmosphere, saturated with bohemian charm, mystical legends about Czech alchemists, leaves no one indifferent.  Prague is a very non-trivial and multifaceted city.  Even among other European capitals, many of which are very magnificent, Prague has a very competitive position.  According to many ratings, publications and surveys, it ranks first among cities where tourists want to return again and again. </p>

    <h2>  What visa is issued for a trip to the Czech Republic? </h2><p>  Immersion in the Prague fairy tale, however, can be overshadowed by some formalities.  Given that you need a standard Schengen visa to the Czech Republic, it is impossible to plan a spontaneous weekend trip.  You should take care of collecting documents and applying for a visa in advance.  In all other respects, the Czech Republic is open and accessible to almost all categories of tourists, its airports accept low-cost low-cost flights, the city is connected to Europe with a dense network of railways. </p>

The consulate of this country is on the list of "loyal" to Russian citizens.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Where to stay in Prague? </h2><p>  Among other European <span>capitals, Prague</span> compares favorably with its compactness - most interesting tourist sites are concentrated in the city center.  So you should choose a place for an overnight stay near the center.  Although from distant, cheaper areas you can get to the center by metro in 20 minutes. </p><p>  Accreditation of hotels in Prague according to the "star" principle complies with international standards.  You could even say that their rating system is above these same standards.  Even hotels of the 1 * or 2 * category are inferior to their more "stellar" competitors except in the range of services, but not in their quality.  There are plenty of five-star, royal hotels in the center, they are so good that guests get used to luxury with lightning speed.  You can stay for a day or two in a pathos expensive hotel with impeccable service, rooms with high ceilings and carved beds.  But if it‚Äôs not your plan to get used to luxurious social life, then feel free to leave the five-star oasis and relocate to some worthy ‚Äútroika‚Äù, such as City Center Hotel 3. It is not so inferior to eminent ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù.  And it‚Äôs not that city, to look at it from the hotel window, you need to plunge into Prague, take a personal walk along each of its central streets. </p><h2>  City Center 3 Prague.  Czech </h2><p>  A worthy example of European "triples" is this hotel.  It is located in the heart of Prague, on the Namesti Street of the Republic (exact address: Revoluƒçn√≠ 4,110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic).  A very convenient place for tourists who come to see the city, or for travelers who visited the capital for business and corporate purposes.  To the Powder Gate on foot 2 minutes, to the Charles Bridge - 3 minutes leisurely walking tourist step.  It is also very convenient when you live so close to the center, because many attractions can be visited several times at different times of the day.  This is best done in the early morning or late evening when there are no crowds of tourists.  This is the biggest advantage of the City Center 3 * hotel.  Prague, Czech Republic is a very popular tourist city among travelers, at any time of the year it receives tens of thousands of visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  And the hotel has an excellent location not only in terms of proximity to the main attractions, but also in terms of proximity to the main transport interchanges: <span>Prague</span> Ruzyne International <span>Airport</span> is 14 kilometers from the hotel, it is only 600 meters to Prague Central Station. And to the Prague metro station walk can be reached in 2 minutes (100 meters). </p><h2>  City Center 3 *.  Description </h2><p>  Besides the fact that the hotel is centrally located nowhere else, it is still notable for decent quality and a range of services.  The official category 3 * in the Czech Republic is not a sentence, this is decent housing for a reasonable price.  The hotel is small, with 87 rooms.  The hotel is located in a six-story building, built in a classic style.  Living on the upper floors carries an elevator. </p>

    <p>  The official check-in time is 14:00.  However, it follows from the reviews of hotel guests that if there are free prepared rooms, tourists are not forced to wait for official time, but are lodged upon arrival.  But this is only if there are free rooms.  Demanding immediate check-in at the reception, if it has not yet arrived at 14:00, there is no sense.  This is an international norm in the hotel business. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Dining at the hotel </h2><p>  The cafe serves breakfast, but there you can eat a la carte at any time of the day.  Continental breakfasts are usual: eggs, toasts, salads, coffee, pastries, fruits, granola, yoghurts.  This is very convenient for those who feel hunger immediately after waking up and do not want to wander in search of a restaurant, and then wait for an order.  For those who want to discover all the wisdom of the Czech gastronomic culture, it is better to book only a room in the City Center 3 hotel. Catering services are not included in the price, but are eaten in numerous restaurants and taverns in the center.  The food in the Czech Republic is very tasty, but high-calorie.  All kinds of treats that are suitable for delicious Czech beer are very popular: sausages, shank (as it is called, the boar‚Äôs knee), duck, ribs, etc. In side dishes, potatoes are leaders in all respects.  They are generously treated in the Czech Republic, portions in restaurants are large.  And the pastries are simply divine: zahers, strudel, gingerbread cookies, rolls. </p>

    <p>  Lunches or dinners can also be ordered at the hotel if desired.  In this case, book HB. </p><h2>  Rooms at City-Center 3 * </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the hotel is located in the very center of the capital.  Consequently, noise unchanged for large cities will still be present.  In the Hotel City Center 3 * Standard (Prague), standard rooms can overlook the main street.  This is an option for those who love beautiful views and do not mind the noise.  Those who like to sleep at night from busy walks and vivid impressions should book rooms with windows facing the back yard of the hotel.  For romantic natures there are mansander rooms, they are cute and unusual, but they are slightly smaller. </p><p>  The rooms have satellite security system, shower, toilet, TV, telephone.  Wi-Fi in the room is paid (3 euros / day, 7 euros / 3 days).  Wi-Fi at the reception is free.  The safe is also located at the reception.  The hotel also has parking, a shop, car rental and a casino. </p>

    <p>  Please note that pets are allowed in the rooms of the City Center 3 * hotel (Prague, Czech Republic), but 10 EUR / day is required for their accommodation.  Children under six years old can stay in the room for free.  Children over six years old must pay extra 50% of the room rate.  The hotel has a lot of students, German and Austrian youths, so it‚Äôs worthwhile to think a few times before checking into a hotel with children.  Everyone knows that students are sometimes noisy. </p><h2>  Hotel Service </h2><p>  Most of the tourists who have visited the City Center 3 * hotel praise the service the most.  Here it is necessary to raise for a moment the philosophical theme of "expectations and realities."  Naturally, one should not expect royal service and courtesy from a hotel of the 3 * category.  But if we take as an example the service familiar to many in Turkish and Egyptian 3 * hotels, then in Prague it's just a reference service.  The hotel is clean, cleaned in rooms every day, towels are changed every day, bed linen twice a week.  The staff at the reception of the City Center <span>3 *</span> hotel <span>(Prague, Czech Republic) are</span> certainly polite.  The hotel provides round-the-clock rental car rental services, booking tickets and excursions, currency exchange, room service, and many others. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  Reviews are a very subjective category.  But nevertheless they help tourists a lot with choosing a hotel. </p><p>  Before deciding on the choice of the City Center 3 * hotel, reviews should be collected not only on the profile sites, but also among friends who visited this hotel, consider all the recommendations in order to plan your vacation.  In their reviews, tourists praise the rooms for cleanliness, service, a good range of services.  The negative aspects in the reviews of hotel guests relate mainly to the fact that the rooms there are small, the bathrooms are tiny, and the food is varied.  Yes, and many say that repairing the rooms would be out of place. </p><h2>  Russian speaking staff </h2><p>  Some compatriots traveling to the Czech Republic complain that the hotel does not speak Russian.  It is difficult to call this claim sober.  Prague is a European city, the service in its hotels is very little focused on Russian tourists.  Therefore, the lack of Russian-speaking staff in economy hotels is not something to complain about.  It is better to take and learn a basic English course, then you can feel comfortable in any European city. </p><p>  In the City Center 3 * staff speaks English and German. </p>

In addition to world-famous architectural attractions, you can visit one of the best places for shopping among tourists - the Palladium shopping center, as well as the Kotva Mall. </p><p>  But for those who are so tired that they do not even want to leave the City Center 3 *, entertainment can be found in the hotel itself.  Downstairs there is a cafe and a casino.  You can try your luck in gambling or just sit down for a spicy drink.  And it‚Äôs better to go to the land of fairy dreams in ‚Äúchildhood‚Äù, sleep off in full, and enjoy the beautiful city with wide open eyes the next morning.  The hotel does not provide entertainment for children.  But adults after exhausting walks around the city in the hotel can go through several sessions of Thai massage for an additional fee. </p><h2>  Prague Attractions </h2><p>  Residents of the hotel can visit the sights of the city, because they are quite close to the hotel.  Prague Castle, Mala Strona, <span>Old Town Square</span> Charles Bridge, city hall and <span>astronomical clock,</span> Dancing House and Golden Street - all these are very attractive places for tourists.  But there are so many interesting things in this city: hospitable taverns and taverns with spicy meat dishes, tens of thousands of varieties of the best beer in the world, beer museums, smartly decorated shopping centers, the city promenade, and cobblestone streets with many interesting angles.  Prague is the birthplace of the alchemists, Franz Kafka, Beethoven, the Swarovski brand.  Of course, in the Czech capital there are a lot of good democratic places where you can stop and eat. </p>
