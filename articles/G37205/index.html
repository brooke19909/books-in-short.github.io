If relatively recently this issue was decided in favor of foreign resorts - Turkey, Egypt, Thailand, today today more and more tourists decide to stay at home.  Indeed, in June in Sochi, vouchers are much more affordable, and in addition, you get rid of the need to issue foreign passports and visas.  And the road is much shorter and more profitable.  Today we will talk about holidays on the Black Sea coast in early summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in sochi in June" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1854046.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Why Sochi </h2><p>  It is not for nothing that this city is called the summer or resort capital of Russia.  Throughout the Soviet period, this particular city was a favorite for all residents.  Due to its favorable location between the Caucasus Mountains and the Black Sea, in the zone of humid subtropics, Sochi is not only a place amazingly suitable for a beach holiday, but also an excellent balneological resort.  That is why, in addition to hotels, there are a huge number of resorts.  Thousands of Russians and guests from neighboring countries are treated here annually.  Unique natural conditions make it possible not only to have a good rest, but also to restore the resources of your body. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vacation in sochi june" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1853153.jpg" width="600"></div>

Basically, the coating is pebble, but areas with golden sand are also found.  At the same time, in June you can still relax in the mountain resort - Krasnaya Polyana.  One of the most popular sites is the Olympic Park.  A colorful show of singing fountains will impress any tourist, even having visited the best European resorts.  Sochi has preserved a huge number of archaeological sites, among which mysterious dolmens can be found.  It is worth taking an excursion to Mount Akhun, where from the observation deck you can admire the panorama of the city, the emerald sea and mountains covered with forests. </p><h2>  Season opening </h2><p>  Everyone wants to relax in the midst of the summer heat, so vacation applications in July begin to be prepared in the winter.  But not everyone is so lucky.  But what if he goes to Sochi in June?  At this time, real summer is already coming here, the days are getting hotter, and the water in the sea is warmer.  So, the average daytime temperature is +23 ¬∞ C, and the nighttime temperature is about 15 degrees Celsius.  Wonderful conditions for walking and exploring the sights of the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="in sochi in June" class="if" height="411" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1854031.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  If you are going on vacation with children, then in Sochi in June it is better not to get ready.  Pretty easy to see why.  Swimming does not work - it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the sea is much warmer than in May, its temperature is about 20 degrees, but it‚Äôs not very comfortable for a long time in the water.  And if you consider that the kids are ready not to leave the beach all day, it is better to wait a bit with the trip.  In Sochi in June it‚Äôs good to go on a sanatorium voucher to undergo a course of treatment and enjoy the mild weather. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, most often, by the end of the month, the temperature of air and water reaches summer levels, so if you plan a trip to the end of June, then you can not worry.  Any kind of rest will be available to you.  But if you do not tolerate the heat, then it is better to choose a different time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in sochi june" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1854036.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Daily temperature differences </h2><p>  Holidays in Sochi in June can be different, but in any case very interesting.  Yes, it‚Äôs pretty cool here at night, so don‚Äôt forget to bring a light sweater or a warm shirt with long sleeves.  But in the afternoon, the sun bakes already very noticeable, so a cap, sunscreen and light clothing will come in handy.  And if the temperature is still uncomfortable for a long bath, the weather in June even contributes to the appearance of a good tan. </p><h2>  Precipitation </h2><p>  But about cold rains you can not worry.  Due to the special microclimate there are no frosts and strong winds.  Although about the stability of the weather you can argue.  It can change several times a day.  If in the morning you looked out the window and saw heavy clouds, do not rush to be upset.  By the time you have breakfast and exercise, the sun will already shine with might and main.  The weather in Sochi is unique, there are 300 sunny days a year.  So there‚Äôs practically no chance that you will get caught in the rain. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sea in Sochi June" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1854044.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The cost of trips </h2><p>  The optimal ratio of price and fullness of rest is precisely the first month of summer.  Vouchers in May are a little cheaper, but the air temperature at night does not exceed 12 degrees, and the humidity is very high, this month has a lot of cloudy days.  In terms of quality of rest, June is comparable with the velvet season, that is, with September, but at prices it is much more profitable.  Moreover, the only difference is that at the beginning of autumn the sea is warmer.  The opening of the season is characterized by a small number of vacationers, so if you like peace and solitude, then the ideal option is a tour in Sochi.  June, by the way, is also very hot, so do not worry too much that you will not have time to sunbathe. </p><h2>  Reviews of experienced tourists </h2><p>  It turns out that among those who regularly visit the Black Sea coast, there are not so few lovers of opening the season.  These are most often people over forty years old, lovers of measured relaxation.  Most of them recommend visiting Sochi in June.  Reviews, all as one, note that at this time you can soak under the gentle sunshine, instead of languishing from the heat. </p><p>  Mild weather is ideal for exploring the surroundings.  It was at this time that the climatic conditions were ideal in order to make excursions to local attractions.  The sea in Sochi in June, as they say, is an amateur.  But the closer to the end of the month, the more water warms up.  The second half of June is already a full summer, so the resort during this period is perfect for families with small children. </p>

    <h2>  Price for holidays in June 2017 </h2><p>  Starting in January, early summer booking is already available.  And it is not surprising that quite a lot of tourists choose Sochi in June.  Photos of half-empty beaches attract a lot of people, because you don‚Äôt feel like pushing over a piece of sandy surface.  At the beginning of summer, the cost of living in mini-hotels or a guest house will fluctuate between 1500-3000 rubles. </p><p>  If we consider the rooms in the central hotel complexes of Sochi, then here the prices will be even higher.  Roughly from 2000 to 5000 rubles.  The cost of food also varies depending on the season.  At the beginning of summer, breakfast, lunch and dinner in an ordinary dining room costs from 300 to 500 rubles.  In an expensive restaurant you can give from 1000 to 3000 for one meal. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sochi june reviews" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1854038.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Entertaining events are another component of a good holiday.  Prices in June for them are also very reasonable.  A visit to the water park costs from 700 to 800 rubles per adult, and children will cost in the amount of 350 to 500 rubles.  Riding on bananas and buns costs about 200 rubles, and diving with a professional instructor costs about 2000 rubles.  They will ask for 800 rubles for a cruise on a boat. </p><h2>  Extra bonuses </h2><p>  Another reason to gather in June in Sochi is the Kinotavr festival.  It traditionally takes place at the very beginning of summer.  At the opening of the season, domestic and western movie stars come.  If you are a fan of a particular genre of cinema or have always dreamed of meeting an idol, then the beginning of summer is the perfect time to travel to Sochi. </p><p>  It was at this time that sweet berries ripened - cherries, cherries, strawberries.  They are sold in stores and markets, and prices are very low.  Enjoy fresh fruits while you can.  Instead of swimming on the beaches of Sochi, you can entertain yourself by parachuting, diving or yachting.  In the July heat you will not want to bother yourself with such feats at all. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi in June photo" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1854041.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  We discussed the features of rest in Sochi at the beginning of the beach season.  As you can see, it has several advantages.  If you decide to spend June on the Black Sea coast, you will not only get amazing impressions, but you can also save a little.  I would like to note that today we considered only one resort - Sochi.  The weather in June in Adler or Gelendzhik differs due to the climatic features of the latter, although these cities are nearby.  It may be cooler there in June or, conversely, hotter.  If you are looking for an alternative to a vacation in Sochi, you must first collect more detailed information so that the vacation does not become a disappointment. </p>
