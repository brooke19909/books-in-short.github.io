Reviews provide much more objective information.  Here are some negative comments travelers leave about this resort: </p><ul><li>  Disposable slippers are not provided in the rooms; </li><li>  on the balcony there is neither a dryer, nor a rope for towels and bathing suits (you have to hang wet things on chairs); </li><li>  the furniture on the balcony is dusty enough (you have to wipe it with wet wipes before using it); </li><li>  the beach is small (in the season there will be quite crowded); </li><li>  Compared to the main territory of the hotel, the beach is not very well maintained; </li><li>  unpleasant boring music constantly plays by the pool; </li><li>  there is no beer in the beach bar; </li><li>  inflated prices for the organization of transfers and taxi calls; </li><li>  except for the central part, the hotel territory is nowhere to be highlighted at night; </li><li>  in addition to the reception and the hookah, nowhere else is it possible to use wireless Internet; </li><li>  during the season it feels like the hotel is not coping with a large flow of guests; </li><li>  smoking is allowed on the beach, and therefore you have to sunbathe and swim, breathing in puffs of tobacco smoke; </li><li>  uncomfortable hard pillows; </li><li>  I would like to see more flowers in the area; </li><li>  strong audibility between numbers; </li><li>  many standard rooms are adjoining (separated by a door); </li><li>  despite the fact that the repair was made relatively recently (in 2011), the hotel has many scuffs and breakdowns, restoration work is again required; </li><li>  cheap plastic furniture on the balconies does not fit into the overall concept; </li><li>  on the beach there are old wooden plank beds with mattresses; </li><li>  inflated prices for excursions at the hotel (you can order similar tours from local agents half the price); </li><li>  taking into account the fact that the hotel is aimed at European holidaymakers, the prices here are overpriced (unless you have got a share or a favorable offer from a tour operator); </li><li>  after ten in the morning on the beach it is quite problematic to find a free sunbed; </li><li>  to eat well in the dining room, you need to come to the very beginning of a meal (later there is practically no choice); </li><li>  cramped bathroom in the room; </li><li>  the furniture is old and needs to be restored or completely replaced; </li><li>  there are no rugs near the beds, and the floors in the rooms are pretty cold. </li></ul>
