How to make a pillow in the shape of a man?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It would seem that you can come up with a new pillow?  Make it round, elongated, with a roller or bagel, stuff it with fluff or air, put on different covers.  But in originality, a pillow in the shape of a man certainly surpasses all these banal decisions.  What is it - stupidity, a toy or just a convenient thing?  Let's figure it out. </p><h2>  Origin of goods </h2><p>  A pillow in the shape of a man owes his appearance to resourceful Japanese.  She began to sell in 2004, and she immediately gained popularity among single women.  A male version soon followed.  It gradually developed to a pillow in the form of a woman with silicone implants in the chest and buttocks, which, according to the manufacturers, are very realistic to the touch.  In Japan, this product is still very popular. </p><h2>  Printed boyfriend </h2><p>  On the sites of foreign online stores, the pillow-man has been selling for quite some time.  The cost ranges from 12 to 50 dollars.  One of its most popular varieties is a boyfriend pillow.  It is a torso of an adult man with one arm.  The shirt is a pillowcase: it can be changed to suit your mood, with changes in the interior or removed and washed if necessary.  As a rule, the pillow is filled with silicone balls.  Sometimes granules of expanded polystyrene are used as packing - the same material as in <span>anti-stress toys.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pillow man" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687813.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interest in this pillow has greatly increased after she appeared in the TV series "Chorus". </p><p>  According to sellers, this is an ideal way to feel in the arms of a strong loving man, without snoring, unnecessary words, tossing and turning in a dream or <span>halitosis</span> in the morning. </p><p>  The human pillow is designed for: </p><ul><li>  Single women who want to fall asleep in the arms of a partner. </li><li>  For ladies whose husband or boyfriend is away from home for a long time due to work or service. </li><li>  For tired wives of gamers who want to feel warmth and affection, while the spouse plays at the computer. </li><li>  As a gift for people with a good sense of humor. </li><li>  Also, the pillow-man will be an interesting props for a girl's party in pajamas. </li></ul><h2>  What do consumers think? </h2><p>  You may have already decided to yourself that it is difficult to come up with a more strange and unnecessary product than a pillow man.  Reviews of real customers refute this opinion.  Many ladies really feel calmer when in the absence of a partner (temporary or long-term) a stuffed boyfriend hugs them. </p><p>  One American customer claims to have bought such a pillow as a playful gift for her friend, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality and convenience of the product and decided to buy it for herself.  After all, the unusual shape provides, above all, good support for the neck and back. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="man pillow reviews" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687814.jpg" width="461"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But perhaps the most unusual use of this product was found by a customer who bought it for her nine-year-old son.  He could not sleep at night alone and came to his parents' bedroom.  To make him feel better, mom bought this pillow.  To his surprise, she liked him, and with her the child began to fall asleep on his own. </p><p>  These are the positive reviews that a pillow man collects.  Textile is sometimes the object of criticism from buyers, its quality is not always consistent with the price.  In addition, you need to pay attention to the sizes indicated in the description so that the purchase does not turn out to be very small. </p><p>  The question of whether the pillow is better than a real person is also debatable, and whether such a passion for inanimate objects is dangerous to the detriment of communicating with real people.  But this is everyone‚Äôs personal opinion, someone is wary of this idea, and someone simply perceives it as a comfortable pillow of an unusual shape.  And girls are happy to take funny photos with their ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù and share them on social networks. </p><h2>  Varieties of goods </h2><p>  There is also a pillow man for single men.  Customer reviews note its creativity and convenience, but often question the design: unlike the female version, there is no removable pillowcase, and a huge yellow hand evokes associations with the characters of the animated series "The Simpsons". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="human shaped pillow" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687815.jpg" width="496"></div>

    <p>  The husband pillow does not resemble human shape, and got its name only from the association with the sensations of comfort and security that it gives.  Due to the high dense back and armrests, it is very convenient to read or watch TV while lying on it. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="man pillow textile" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687816.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Female knees are another version for men.  The invention also came from the East, and is a foam pillow depicting the hips and knees of a slender lady.  Since it‚Äôs unlikely that you can persuade a woman to sit on her lap for several hours while you sleep, this is a pretty interesting idea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself pillow" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687817.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The U-shaped pillow is another variation of the ‚Äúpillow-man‚Äù type, although, like the pillow-husband, it has little resemblance to the human body.  But she will hug and warm you from all sides.  This type of pillow was especially fond of future mothers, because it provides support to the neck, back and allows you to conveniently place a growing tummy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pillow man" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687830.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to make a pillow-person yourself? </h2><p>  It will cost much cheaper than the purchased one, it won‚Äôt take a lot of time to manufacture, and it won‚Äôt require cutting and sewing skills. </p><p>  You will need: </p><ul><li>  Men's shirt or <span>long-sleeved T-shirt.</span>  If you want the printed cavalier to be larger, then do not forget to take the size XL or even XXL. </li><li>  Glue <span>gun</span> or fabric glue, <span>double-sided tape.</span> </li><li>  A few clothespins. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  Chalk or marker on the fabric. </li><li>  Material for stuffing: synthetic winterizer, silicone balls or granules of foamed polystyrene (be careful with them, if there is a small hole in the product, then you will remove the granules throughout the house). </li></ul><h2>  How to make a pillow in the shape of a man with his own hands? </h2><ol><li>  Fold the shirt on a flat surface, draw a line at a distance of 4-5 cm from the buttons, cut. </li><li>  Cut sections: bend and secure with glue from a gun, <span>glue for cloth</span> or tape. </li><li>  Take a few clothespins and align the edges.  Using glue, connect them, and also seal the collar and the holes between the buttons.  Keep the bottom of the shirt and sleeve open. </li><li>  Stuff the pillow. </li><li>  Cover the bottom and the edge of the sleeve. </li></ol><p>  You can make a pillowcase for a pillow on the same principle.  If you are going to wash your craft, then you need to use waterproof glue or give preference to a thread with a needle. </p><h2>  Pygmalion and Galatea </h2><p>  Remember the Greek story where the sculptor made himself a woman of dreams?  Danish designer Noortje de Keijzer tied and stuffed her perfect man.  She uses it not only to sleep and watch movies together, but she even shot a video where they brush their teeth together, have breakfast and dance.  And as necessary, the girl erases her boyfriend. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pillow man" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/27663/687820.jpg" width="468"></div>

    <p>  The <span>designer</span> named Arthur the first version of the <span>pillow-guy</span> , and soon he had a black brother - Steve. </p><p>  She created this project when she herself was lonely, and according to her, she felt much better.  And not even because a ‚Äúman‚Äù appeared in her life, who ‚Äúis perfect, fits perfectly into my interior, is always there to hug, will never change and will wear a mustache if I want‚Äù (from a book dedicated to a knitted boyfriend) .  But more because she realized that in a joking manner attracted people's attention to such a serious problem as loneliness.  In addition, the designer claims that a knitted man is only the first step.  If you learn to live in peace with yourself and enjoy life, albeit with the help of such an unusual props, then soon you will have not a full, but a real friend. </p>
