    <h2>  The surroundings of the resort </h2><p>  Believe me, they are worth it to start looking for a ticket today and get ready for the journey.  The severe, but infinitely beautiful Siberian nature will win your heart at first sight.  Where is the park hotel "Aya" located?  Altai is still not completely exhausted by tourists, but these places are familiar to most backpackers who like traveling.  Translated, "Aya" means "moon."  A beautiful legend is associated with the name of the lake, that a long time ago the moon descended into the valley to save the human race from adversity (a monster or cannibal in various sources).  Going down, she formed a dent, where the lake arose. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In fact, scientists say that the lake appeared as a result of drilling rocks at vibrant waterfalls.  In this way dozens, if not hundreds, of lakes formed in these mountains.  Why is this so popular?  It is here that the water is warm enough, about 20 degrees.  That is, this is one of the few places in Altai where you can swim without experiencing discomfort.  The lake is relatively small, but deep, with a maximum depth of 21 meters.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lake is 9 hectares, the diameter is approximately 300-400 meters.  The reservoir is fed by underground springs.  Aya Nature Park has become a wonderful example of relaxation in Siberia.  Hundreds of tourists come here to have a good time, relax and improve their health. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Park Hotel Altai Mountain Altai" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/1266505.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Winter Mountain Altai </h2><p>  Of course, during the hot summer, the influx of tourists is somewhat larger, but even with the onset of cold weather the Aya Park Hotel does not empty.  Photos in winter show us fabulous landscapes of Siberian nature, chained by cold.  It is difficult to even say when it is more beautiful here - in winter or summer.  With the onset of cold weather it becomes especially quiet.  Crystal, frosty air, snow-white trees - all this creates excellent conditions for walking.  Every year, skating rinks and slides are poured here, as well as rental points for sports equipment.  Skating and skiing, snowboarding - all in order to spend time with health benefits.  And if you are tired and cold, then welcome to a restaurant or bar for a cup of hot tea.  In winter, a bathhouse with birch brooms is extremely popular here. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, rest here allows you to restore strength and health and just relax much better than in foreign resorts.  This is facilitated by clean air and magnificent nature, as well as developed infrastructure.  Therefore, if you are nearing vacation, then get ready for Altai. </p>
