For some, this task is quite simple, but for most of us, as a rule, it turns out to be overwhelming.  Creating savings requires discipline, often cost savings. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="piggy bank from sberbank reviews" class="if" height="361" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1838318.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  About service </h2><p>  In order to accumulate the required amount, it is necessary to allocate part of your monthly budget every month and put it aside.  And then store it under a mattress, in a sugar bowl on a shelf or, more modernly, in a separate bank account.  And very often it turns out that circumstances prevent us from achieving our goals.  Either there was no extra money last month, then there was no time to get to the bank, then unplanned expenses appeared that were closed by reducing the already accumulated amount.  The Piggy Bank from Sberbank can help here.  We will consider reviews of this service in the article. </p><p>  More recently, Sberbank launched a new convenient service for savings called "Piggy Bank".  This is a great way to move towards your goal with small but sure steps.  Namely, to fulfill your little dreams, having accumulated the necessary amount to buy a new gadget or plane tickets to the islands of paradise. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is a piggy bank? </h2><p>  "Piggy bank", in fact, is an electronic account of the client, on which accumulations will be stored.  Such a system is primarily not only convenient, but also safe.  Now your savings will be protected from the waste that they might be exposed to when stored under the mattress.  But besides this, the service has a number of other various advantages.  No need to go to the bank in order to deposit the accumulated amount into a savings account.  You do not need to stand in lines and do not even have to worry about the fact that you can forget to make a transfer to a separate savings account, because the service provides for automatic transfer of money according to the specified rules. </p><p>  This is noteworthy "piggy bank" from Sberbank.  Reviews about her are only positive. </p><p>  The purpose of the service is to help bank customers accumulate a certain amount of money to buy any thing or service.  It is savings, and not obtaining additional funds by adding interest.  A huge range of various contributions is available for this. </p><p>  So, let's take a closer look at all the features and benefits of the new service, as well as how to connect it, usage rules and nuances. </p><h2>  The principle of the service "piggy bank" </h2><p>  From Sberbank "Piggy" (reviews confirm this) works as follows. <strong></strong></p><p>  Let‚Äôs say, on a monthly basis on the 10th of a day, payments in the amount of 20 thousand rubles occur on the card.  And on the 11th the amount will be automatically transferred in the amount of 10%, that is, 2,000 rubles.  And such a transfer will be made every month on a certain date.  By simple calculations, we see that for the year in your ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù there will already be 24 thousand rubles.  Agree, a very good amount!  Absolutely all service parameters are easily configured according to the client‚Äôs wishes, taking into account his capabilities, needs and goals. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sberbank piggy bank reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1838312.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Connection types </h2><p>  Sberbank provides several types of ‚ÄúPiggy Banks‚Äù, you can choose the most convenient option: </p><ol><li>  With a fixed amount of transfers.  When choosing this service, a fixed amount will be transferred from the client's debit card every month. </li><li>  With the transfer of a percentage of the amount of proceeds.  It means that the <span>savings account</span> will automatically transfer a percentage of each receipt to a debit card.  For example, on March 5, you received a salary of 30 thousand rubles, and on March 6, 20% of this amount will be transferred from the card.  That is 6,000 rubles.  Or, let's say, on April 18, you replenished your card with 2 thousand rubles, then on April 29 a transfer of 20% - 200 rubles will occur. </li><li>  With the transfer of interest from the amount of expenses.  In this case, you set the percentage of daily expenses.  For example, 5%.  Today you spend 500 rubles in a cafe with friends, and tomorrow the piggy bank will be replenished by 25 rubles.  Or new sneakers for 1,500 rubles will replenish your piggy bank by 75 rubles. </li></ol><p>  So it‚Äôs very convenient "piggy bank" from Sberbank.  Reviews confirm the convenience of savings with this service. </p><p>  For the convenience of the client, when using the service and <span>operational control of</span> finances, the bank provides a free SMS notification of all operations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, the user can set the maximum transfer amount, after which the operation will need to be confirmed. </p><p>  Among other things, all operations in the Piggy bank for crediting and debiting, as well as the total amount of savings are reflected in the personal account of Sberbank Online. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a piggy bank in sberbank online reviews" class="if" height="313" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1838313.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Connection Methods </h2><p>  Reviews about the Piggy Bank claim that this is a simple service, so connecting it is quite easy.  No need to go to the bank and write a statement. <strong></strong></p><p>  Today there is only one way to connect the service - this is Sberbank Online.  It turns out that only the person with a personal account can already connect to the Piggy Bank to their debit card.  And if you do not use it yet, then we will tell you how to register in it. </p><h2>  Set up Sberbank Online </h2><p>  So, first we connect the Sberbank Online service.  The registration process boils down to obtaining a permanent login (identifier) ‚Äã‚Äãand password that will allow you to authenticate.  But how does the Piggy bank connect from Sberbank?  User reviews describe conditions as very simple. </p><p>  It is also worth knowing that you can connect Sberbank Online only if you have at least one bank card. </p><h2>  Obtaining an identifier in a bank branch </h2><p>  For the identifier and password for connecting the service, you must go to the bank with a passport and a card issued in the same region.  Any free operator in a bank branch will help you complete the execution of a universal service contract and after that will issue a login and password. </p><h2>  Obtaining an identifier at an ATM </h2><p>  Probably the easiest and fastest way to get an identifier.  To do this, you just need to insert the card into any ATM or terminal, enter the PIN code.  After completing registration and the operation of connecting the service, the ATM will print a confirmation on the check, where it will contain the necessary identifier and password for access. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="piggy bank from sberbank terms reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1838314.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Obtaining an identifier through customer support </h2><p>  An ambiguous way to get the identifier.  On the one hand, you don‚Äôt have to go anywhere, stand in lines.  You just need to call the hotline number.  But, on the other hand, you will have to tell the operator all the registration information, and there is a lot of it: owner information, card number, secret word, as well as the place of registration of the card and, possibly, information about the last transaction.  Only after that the support service operator will inform you of the identifier that needs to be written down or remembered.  Then you need to get a permanent password.  To do this, just send a message with the text parol to 900. </p><p>  After you have received a login and permanent password, you just need to go to the service website or install the mobile application on your phone, enter your data and start using the service. </p><p>  What is Piggy Bank at Sberbank Online?  Reviews confirm that this is a very popular service. </p><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><p>  Now that you have access, let's move on to the step-by-step instructions for connecting the Piggy bank service that interests us.  So, for this it is necessary: </p><ol><li>  Connect to your Sberbank Online account by specifying your personal identifier and password. </li><li>  Select the card to which you want to connect the "Piggy Bank", and go to the operations on this card by clicking the corresponding button opposite it.  In the drop-down menu, select the "Connect Piggy Bank" item. </li><li>  It is necessary to configure the parameters of the created "Money Box".  For starters, you can give it a name, for example, "for flights" or "for summer tires." </li></ol><p>  Now you need to select the type of service.  What is ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù in ‚ÄúSberbank Online‚Äù (user reviews we will present below) and how to connect it, is understandable. </p><p>  If the ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù will be with a fixed amount of crediting, then it is worth indicating the size of the amount, the frequency of crediting and the nearest date of the first deposit. </p><p>  If you decide that your "Piggy Bank" will be of the type "percentage of crediting" or "percentage of debiting", then you need to specify the percentage itself, which will be replenished "Piggy".  It is also necessary to indicate the amount of maximum replenishment.  If the calculated amount exceeds the maximum, then you will receive a request for confirmation of replenishment in the form of an SMS message.  If you agree with the amount of replenishment, you will need to send a response message.  Otherwise, the "piggy bank" will be replenished by the maximum amount. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to use a savings bank piggy bank reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/42515/1838315.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Thus, we see that through the provision of the service, the bank allows its customers to accumulate the required amount unnoticed for themselves by automatically transferring funds to an accumulative electronic account. </p><h2>  Piggy Bank from Sberbank: reviews </h2><p>  Basically, customers are very satisfied with the service.  After all, it is very convenient that when a salary is credited to the card, part of the funds automatically goes into accumulation.  A person may not even think about it.  Money deposited on a separate account can be spent at your discretion.  It is absolutely safe.  The disadvantage is that if circumstances arise, the accumulated funds can be immediately withdrawn.  And this is a temptation that is hard to resist.  As a result, undisciplined people and ‚ÄúPiggy Bank‚Äù will not help to raise money for any purpose. </p>
