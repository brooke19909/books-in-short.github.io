So there was a resort place Sharm el-Sheikh, today popular in the whole tourist world. </p><p>  Not only local attractions, but also hotels located in the most picturesque areas are fighting for the championship of the best <span>resort in Egypt</span> .  One of them, Otium Amphora Hotel 5 (Sharm El Sheikh), is located on the very shore of the Red Sea. </p><h2>  Resort </h2><p>  In fact, Sharm El Sheikh is a huge tourist area, divided into several resort areas, each of which has its own ‚Äúset‚Äù of attractions to attract customers. </p><ul><li>  The Bay of Elders has not only hotels located in 3 rows along the sea, but also numerous restaurants, fitness clubs, shopping malls and diving centers.  <span>Naama Bay</span> (as the local population calls it) is the oldest district in this area.  It is here that Otium is located (Amphora Hotel, Sharm El Sheikh).  Reviews about this place are the most enthusiastic, as the hotel is in close proximity to the conservation area.  It is forbidden to moor ships and fish, which makes this place the most environmentally friendly on the coast. </li><li>  Sharm El Maya is proud of its sandy beach, the only one in the area.  Tourists are waiting in the area for an oriental bazaar, small cafes and pleasure yachts at the pier. </li><li>  Ras Umm al-Cid is popular with divers, as there are real coral gardens in the bay of the same name. </li></ul>

In summer, the air warms up to + 40 degrees, and water - up to + 30. At the same time, the heat is transferred quite easily, due to the lack of humidity.  Rains in these parts are extremely rare.  Everything is done here for the well-being of holidaymakers, equipping the entire Sharm el-Sheikh with the best household appliances.  The Otium Amphora Hotel, for example, has air conditioning in every room. </p><p>  In winter, there is no such heat, and the sea also favors swimming at + 20 degrees (water temperature).  The only inconvenience to those who usually feel cold can be delivered in winter nights when the air temperature drops to + 15 degrees.  Nevertheless, during the New Year tours, the hotels here are as crowded as in the summer. </p>

    <p>  The warm Red Sea delights lovers of the underwater world with its clear water and beautiful coral reefs.  The Egyptian government strictly monitors its natural heritage, therefore, in some places it is forbidden not only to fish, but also to feed fish, and protected areas are strictly protected, which does not scare tourists away, but, on the contrary, attracts them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location of the Otium Amphora Hotel </h2><p>  Where is Otium located (Amphora Hotel, Sharm El Sheikh)?

    <p>  At the request of customers, the tour can be ordered on its own route, but the service will cost more.  One of the favorite places for tourists to get acquainted with the natural resources of Egypt is the Ras Mohammed Nature Reserve. </p><h2>  Excursions to the reserve from the hotel </h2><p>  Only 25 km away are the Ras Muhammad National Park and Sharm El Sheikh.  The Otium Amphora Hotel organizes excursions for its guests to this ‚Äúpearl" of the Red Sea. </p><p>  On an area of ‚Äã‚Äã260,000 ha, 5 ecosystems are located - lagoon, coastal, marine, desert and coral.  Each of them is amazing in its own way.  All reefs are protected by the state, and the fact that the Red Sea does not cloud any river makes its waters the most suitable for scuba diving. </p>
