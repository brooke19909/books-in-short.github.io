Advantages and disadvantages of using</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Light is the main criterion that affects the quality of a photograph.  It is he who can correctly convey the mood and atmosphere of photography.  It is very important to feel and understand it.  But what if you are the owner of a SLR camera and you are not always able to put the right light in the photo?  What is a live view?  You will find the answer in the article. </p><h2>  The device is a mirror and mirrorless camera </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but first of all we start with the structure of the camera - how is it arranged and why does the frame that we see through the viewfinder or screen do not coincide with the finished picture?  Only in this way we can find out what it is - live view. </p><p>  Let's start with the DSLR device.  The camera consists of a lens and the camera itself.  The lens has a diaphragm ring and lenses.  But inside the camera itself, the fun begins.  Why is the camera called SLR?  Everything is simple: because in its body there is a system of mirrors that refracts light from the lens into the viewfinder, as in a periscope, but the whole point is that we see the real image in the viewfinder, and not the one that the "matrix" sees. </p><p>  What happens during the picture?  The mirror rises, passing a beam of light to the matrix, the shutter opens, and the beam enters the matrix, after which the shutter closes.  But there are more modern mirrorless cameras that do not have a system of mirrors, since a screen broadcasting the image from the main screen of the camera is inserted in the viewfinder.  What is their advantage?  In this case, through the viewfinder we can already see what actually turns out, which can not be said about SLR cameras.  For this, the live view mode was invented. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Camera Mirror Device" class="if uuid-3175777" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3175777.jpg"></div><h2>  Definition </h2><p>  Live view - what is it?  This is a feature that can turn your SLR camera into a mirrorless one for a while.  During the operation of this mode, the camera raises the mirror and allows the light to directly hit the matrix so that you see the result on the screen of your camera that you get in the picture.  Live view allows you to correctly evaluate the exposure of the frame. </p><h2>  Bit of history </h2><p>  Previously, there was no such thing as a camera screen.  Only later, in the 2000s, began to install screens.  But even then it was not possible to see the image that will result from the shutter.  In those days, the screen showed only the settings of the camera and various parameters, for example, a light meter.  At that time, only ‚Äúsoap dishes‚Äù had a live view mode, and even that wasn‚Äôt all.  But now we can use this function on almost any camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dpreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The survived era of &quot;soap dishes&quot;" class="if uuid-3174962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3174962.jpg"></div><h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  What are the advantages of live view over normal view through the viewfinder?  Firstly, as already mentioned, this mode allows you to correctly assess the situation by exposing the frame.  On the screen, you immediately see the result that you get at the end.  Secondly, in this mode, you can zoom in on the frame and check the accuracy of the focus, that is, in live view, you can focus as accurately as possible.  This criterion is highly appreciated when shooting macro or when recording a static video.  Thirdly, only on the screen you can see the whole frame at 100% of its size.  Only 98% of the whole frame is displayed in the viewfinder, that is, some nuances may be missed.  Fourth, this function is incredibly convenient in difficult shooting conditions due to the fact that you see what will turn out on the screen, so even in complete darkness at high ISOs you will see something, while the viewfinder will be pitch-black dark.  In addition, if the camera is equipped with a rotary display, then when shooting a concert or something from a lower angle, it will be inconvenient for you to bend down and look into the visor, so when you rotate the screen and turn on live view, it will be very easy for you to shoot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  disadvantages </h2><p>  Now let's talk a little about the disadvantages of this feature.  What is the catch, why manufacturers simply could not refuse the mirror?  Firstly, the batteries run out insanely quickly.  Secondly, during operation, the shutter opens, respectively, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsaturated with light, and as you probably know, the matrix has a certain resource.  It has the property of oversaturation, because, like any photosensitive element, it can exhaust its resource.  You can draw an analogy with the film.  Why can‚Äôt you allow it to be exposed to sunlight?  Just because it can just light up and you can‚Äôt take a frame anymore, it will exhaust its resource. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gossen-photo.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Analog photography film" class="if uuid-3174969" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3174969.jpg"></div><p>  On all cameras, this function will work approximately the same.  What is the live view on Canon, what on Sony, what on Nikon - everything is identical.  How to turn it on?  Consider the example of a Canon 6d camera.  To enable live view, you must translate the video selection joystick.  Or live view mode on it.  And then click on its middle.  Everything, you have enabled this feature.  On other cameras, it turns on by the same analogy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imaging-resource.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Live view enable button" class="if uuid-3174942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/98486/3174942.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So this article has come to an end.  I hope you find out the answer to the question of what it is - live view.  They noted for themselves some advantages and disadvantages of using this function. </p>
