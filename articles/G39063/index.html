The staff is friendly and completely devoid of arrogance.  As for food, it's hard to stay hungry here.  Breakfast consists of fruits, vegetables, cold cuts, toast, eggs, coffee and tea.  The main thing is to arrive at the meal on time (for those for whom it is included in the room price).  People on vacation have a good appetite.  And if you don‚Äôt have time, you will have to wait until these or those dishes are prepared. </p><p>  A lot of positive emotions were delivered to vacationers by The Three by Apk 3 hotel in <span>Phuket (Thailand).</span>  Reviews about beach vacations are also positive.  To the sea at hand, the beach area is large and clean.  It is better to swim in the morning, at this time the water just sparkles.  Almost all rooms have a beautiful view.  Sometimes it is noisy, but the panorama is worth these inconveniences.  There are rooms in which balconies are adjacent to the wall of the neighboring building.  These rooms are quiet, but the view is poor.  All apartments are equipped with new furniture and appliances.  Every day, two bottles of drinking water, packaged coffee, tea and sugar are brought to the room for free.  Towels are changed daily. </p><p>  A completely worthy option of relaxation is The Three by Apk 3 hotel. Reviews confirm this.  Especially flattering guests talk about the staff.  People are very welcoming and friendly, always smiling and ready to help at any moment.  But it is worth considering that none of them speaks Russian.  Also, guests note the fairly developed infrastructure of The Three by Apk 3. Hotel reviews indicate that all the main attractions can be reached on foot.  On the street where the hotel is located, there are also a lot of interesting places. </p>

    <h2>  What you should pay attention to? </h2><p>  When checking into the room, a deposit of $ 100 is required, which is then returned.  It is recommended to immediately rent a motorbike for the entire period of rest.  So it turns out much cheaper (about 200 baht per day).  Scooter is best taken in specialized stores.  Street vendors are best avoided.  Almost all of them are scammers.  You can do this at the bike rental service, which is located near The Three by Apk 3 (Thailand, Phuket).  There are many positive reviews about this rental.  Its owner is a decent honest man.  The passport is left as a deposit.  Upon delivery of the vehicle, the document is returned.  For rented bikes, parking is provided on site.  At night, they are under the reliable guard of staff. </p><p>  It is necessary to refuel a scooter at a gas station.  It can be safely left on the street or beach.  There are parking spaces for this vehicle everywhere.  The main thing is that the steering wheel is closed.  People who visited Thailand claim that without an iron horse, rest would be boring.  On the bike you can go around almost all the beaches of the island.  And without it, you will have to be content with visiting only the swimming area located near the hotel.  Phuket is a huge island and difficult to get around on foot.  On the beach, you also need to discuss in advance the cost of certain services.  Thais are cunning people who cheat at every step.  But all this is leveled by their genuine good nature.  For example, it is necessary to determine in advance the time of parachute flying or <span>jet</span> skiing <span>.</span>  Otherwise, the locals can take the initiative and will carry you around only to bring down more money. </p>
