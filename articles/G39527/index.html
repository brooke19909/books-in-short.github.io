    <p>  Firmware lasts an average of about twenty minutes.  However, this process can be significantly delayed.  In order to start updating the device, you will need to run the program and select the hardware search tab.  If everything goes well, then your smartphone will be displayed in the "Rum Manager" window.  After this, this equipment must be selected and click on the check button.  All this is necessary in order to test the device.  After that, all data for the firmware will be known.  Before you begin, you should remember that the initial settings can no longer be returned.  If the update fails, then the Galaxy S6 Edge phone will have to be taken to a service center.  In this case, the re-launch of "Rum Manager" will not lead to success. </p><p>  When the decision about the firmware is final, you will need to select the start button in the program window.  After that installation of system files will begin.  At this stage, it is very important to monitor the smartphone and not remove the USB cable from the connector.  After completing the firmware, you only need to turn off and then turn on your phone.  In order to check the operability of <span>the Samsung Galaxy</span> S6 Edge, you must first try to set the time with the date.  You will also have to run the video files and test the video accelerator. </p>
