  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Metro station "Sennaya Ploshchad": from construction to the present day</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The metro station "Sennaya Ploshchad" during its more than half a century history has experienced many exciting and scary moments.  And this is not surprising, because the construction of the deepest metro line in Russia was preceded by events that, as many believe, formed a negative energy footprint in this place. </p><h2>  The history of the construction of the "Hay" metro station in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Planning for the construction of the subway began back in 1935, when the city was still called Leningrad and the Communists stood at the helm of the country.  To implement their offspring, the designers sought to make room for the station in the densely populated city center - for this, leading people, led by A.A. Zhdanov, set about resettling residents who settled here due to the close proximity of shopping malls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.sennaya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sennaya square before the subway was built in 1960" class="if uuid-2423023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2423023.jpg"></div><p>  But all plans were disrupted by World War II.  As a result, construction was postponed for almost a quarter century.  The discovery took place in the middle of the summer of 1963 on the site of a religious building demolished in 1961 - the huge Church of the Savior on Sennaya, the explosion of which many residents left a deep mark in the heart.  At that time, the Sennaya Ploshchad metro station had a different name - Peace Square.  And only after three decades, the station received its current name - Sennaya. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Station accidents </h2><p>  The terrible echo of the past was first echoed in 1999 when a five-meter concrete structure collapsed, which served as a visor at the entrance to the Sennaya Ploshchad metro station.  At that moment 7 people died.  This incident triggered the reconstruction and repair of all metro stations in the city. </p><p>  The tragedy that happened eight years after that claimed many more lives.  The Sennaya Ploshchad metro station is the interchange station of the three <span>metro</span> lines <span>of St. Petersburg</span> : </p><ul><li>  Moscow-Petrograd. </li><li>  Right-bank (with access to the Spasskaya station). </li><li>  Frunzensko-Primorskaya (exit to Sadovaya). <div class="photo" data-original="www.sennaya.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Map of Haymarket" class="if uuid-2423016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/85425/2423016.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  In view of this, the station is of great strategic importance, which the terrorists took advantage of.  At a time when there was a large passenger flow, an explosion thundered on the train between the Sennaya and Technological Institute stations, which caused the death of 16 people. </p><h2>  <span>Sennaya Ploshchad</span> station </h2><p>  Now the station is one of the most crowded in the city, as it serves up to 190 thousand passengers daily.  The exception was the period of the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, when the operating mode of the Sennaya Ploshchad metro was violated by the overhaul of the station's escalators. </p>
