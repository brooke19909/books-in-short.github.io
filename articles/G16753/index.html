    <h2>  Plunge into history </h2><p>  Nikolaevsk <span>(Volgograd region)</span> has an extensive history.  Once upon a time, a poor village of fishermen was located on the site of a modern city.  The first mention of this settlement dates back to the 18th century.  The then Astrakhan governor ordered the construction of dwellings for fishing people.  The development of Nikolaevsk begins at the beginning of the twentieth century, when the number of merchants is growing rapidly in the city, and industry turnover is significantly increasing.  The level of agriculture also increased, mainly due to peasants.  The development of this city is stopped by the February Revolution, and then by the Civil War. </p><p>  Stormy activity in these years continued Nikolaevsk.  <span>The Volgograd region,</span> like this point, is actively developing during the formation of Soviet power.  Several factories begin their work, new schools are being built, residential buildings appear.  The Second World War had a great influence on the life of the city.  About 10 thousand local residents voluntarily went to the front: mainly young Komsomol members and the able-bodied male population.  A large hospital was located in the city.  During the war years, Nikolaevsk was attacked several times by enemy aircraft.  Many residents became holders of various orders, and several were awarded the honorary title of Heroes of the Soviet Union.  After the war, Nikolaevsk (Volgograd region) began another construction.  City status was assigned to this settlement in 1967, after the population increased to 11 thousand people. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nikolayevsk Volgograd region" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1191971.jpg" width="374"></div>
