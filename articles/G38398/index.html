The population of the city has been growing steadily for over 11 years, which cannot but have an impact on the need to increase the pace of construction of residential buildings and complexes.  After all, both residents of the city and newcomers need to have a roof over their heads.  Many people prefer to live in the usual urban environment, choosing apartments in multi-storey buildings under construction.  But there are also many who are happy to change the urban environment for the peace and quiet of rural life, while also preferring to live in comfortable low-rise residential buildings.  One of these residential complexes offering life in the lap of nature is Baltym Park, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dom-obmen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltim Park Residential Complex Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2231928" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2231928.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer project </h2><p>  The YIT Uralstroy company, the developer in Yekaterinburg, was able to offer the city residents not a trivial project for the construction of a multi-storey residential complex among a densely populated metropolis, but a whole microdistrict, which allows to obtain a high standard of living close to unique nature.  At the same time, he placed his project on a land plot located a few minutes drive from the city itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is planned to erect not just residential buildings, but a whole micro-town with all the necessary infrastructure, proximity to the federal highway, metropolis and modern amenities for living.  This is how the ‚ÄúBaltym Park‚Äù, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg, will appear to its residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pr-flat.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltim park residential complex yekaterinburg reviews" class="if uuid-2231932" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2231932.jpg"></div><h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  Where is this attractive residential complex located?  It is worth driving just 18 kilometers north of the city and you can find yourself in the Balti Park, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg.  It is located in the village of Baltym, not far from the lake of the same name - a popular vacation spot among the townspeople and residents of surrounding villages and cities.  Only about 5 kilometers separate the residential complex from the ring road, and just over 15 - from the center of Yekaterinburg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dom-obmen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltim Park Residential Complex Yekaterinburg Address" class="if uuid-2231935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2231935.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Baltiam Park, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg, has an address outside the city itself, it is not difficult for its residents to get to work or on personal matters in the metropolis.  Near the complex there is a public transport stop, on which buses stop connecting to Verkhnyaya Pyshma and the Ordzhonikidzevsky <span>district of Yekaterinburg.</span>  Owners of personal vehicles, having left on the federal highway, in a few minutes will be on the ring road and in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the future, it is planned to launch additional public transport routes and reorganize the road.  All this is done to create the most comfortable living conditions not only for residents of Baltym Park, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg, but also for the population of nearby villages and cities. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realty.pride-ural.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltim Park Residential Complex Yekaterinburg" class="if uuid-2231936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2231936.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of the residential complex </h2><p>  What is a residential complex?  This is a whole residential neighborhood, spread over 76 hectares of land.  The project provides for the construction of not only residential 3-5-storey buildings using monolithic-brick technology, but also all the necessary socially important infrastructure objects.  In total, the complex will offer more than 5,000 apartments: from one-room to four-room.  Thus, everyone who wants to move here will find a home that matches their taste and budget size. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vysota66.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Baltim Park Residential Complex Yekaterinburg photo" class="if uuid-2231942" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39099/2231942.jpg"></div><p>  For the convenience of residents, each apartment building will have its own landscaped area, where you can relax after a working day or on a weekend.  Also, so that residents who have children in the future do not experience inconvenience, it is planned to build a school and kindergarten.  And, of course, many areas will be given for other infrastructure necessary for life. </p><h2>  Apartments in the complex </h2><p>  Apartments in Balti Park, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg, residents' reviews have already earned only positive.  All of them are very spacious.  And their cost attracts even the most budget buyers.  The developer in his project adhered to European plans.  This means combining the kitchen and dining area into one space to create much-needed space.  Bathrooms are also being built combined, their area reaching 6 square meters.  This allows you to place everything you need in them. </p><p>  All apartments have balconies.  But these are not ordinary balconies of high-rise buildings, but Finnish ones, turning into excellent verandas for a pleasant pastime in the afternoon and evening.  The height of the ceilings is at least 2.7 meters, which makes the space visually even larger and brighter.  Also in the apartments of Balti Park, the residential complex of Yekaterinburg, the photo only confirms this, dressing rooms are provided.  Thus, everyone who moved here for permanent residence will be able to find the apartment of their dreams. </p><h2>  Residents reviews </h2><p>  Many of the project‚Äôs houses have already been commissioned, and therefore Baltimy Park, a residential complex in Yekaterinburg, has real reviews.  Among them there are no dissatisfied with apartments or their layouts.  But many express their concern about the transport connection, which has not yet been fully adjusted, and the future reorganization of the road.  Such measures will help get rid of the inevitable traffic jams during rush hours and add comfort to those living in the residential complex. </p><p>  But, in spite of some still existing shortcomings, Baltim Park is the most unique project not only in Yekaterinburg, but throughout the Urals.  This is the most attractive project in which the developer managed to realize almost all the wishes of the residents. </p>
