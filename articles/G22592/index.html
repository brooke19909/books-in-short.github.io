  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knitting footprints</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When winter comes, I want to dress warmer and should especially keep my feet warm.  In the house you can walk in the tracks.  They gently grab the foot, allowing the foot to feel warmth and freedom, because they do not tighten and do not constrain the foot.  Knitting tracks is not at all difficult.  And if you learn this, your loved ones will always be warm and will not catch a cold.  Footprints are a wonderful gift for relatives and loved ones.  Everything that is done with love warms not only the body, but also the heart.  In order to make such a cute gift, you do not need to spend a lot of money, but such a gift will be much more personal and memorable. </p><p>  In addition, for this you do not need to be a very large specialist, you just need to want and try.  <span>Crocheting footprints with</span> crochets is much easier than knitting, especially if these are the first steps on your, I hope, a long passion for needlework.  To master good skills and hardness of the hand, it is better to start with small things.  They can be completed as soon as possible and rejoice at their achievements.  And for such small things you can use threads from old knitwear that you need to dissolve.  If you start knitting traces from old threads, then I advise you to dissolve the thing first, and wash and dry the threads, and only then start knitting, if the thread is not washed, the knitted fabric will not lie beautifully and evenly. </p><p>  So, get ready for knitting.  First of all, you need to choose what thickness the hook to choose.  Its diameter should be three times larger than that of the thread.  This is the usual rule.  But if you want the knitting to be denser, then my advice is to take the hook thickness more than twice as much. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Crochet, the tracks begin with the fingers.  We knit according to the description below. </p><p>  We wind several circles of thread on the hook and knit eight single crochet into the resulting ring, complete the circle, securing the last and first columns. </p><p>  We turn the work, we knit three loops of the chain to raise the row and now we knit <span>with double crochets.</span>  In the first loop of the chain of the lower row we knit a crochet column, and in the second <span>two crochet columns.</span>  Next, repeat to the end of the row.  We re-fasten the first and last columns. </p><p>  Turn, dial three chain stitches for lifting.  We have in the second row there are twelve columns.  We continue the expansion.  In the first loop of the chain - one double crochet, in the second - two columns and continue.  A total of eighteen double crochets.  At the end of the row is pinning. </p><p>  We turn again, knit three loops of the chain.  In this row, we make increments in the first loop of the chain, we knit two columns, the next two loops in each one column, the fourth loop - we knit two columns, the fifth loop - one column, and then to the end.  In this row, seven columns should be added. It turns out twenty-five columns. </p><p>  Next, we continue knitting the tracks, adding six columns in each next row, distributing these increases evenly in a circle.  The number of rows in which expansion should be done depends on the size of the leg.  The larger the size, the more rows should be knitted, with the addition.  In addition, it depends on the thickness of the thread, the thicker the thread, the higher the knitted stitches and the longer the knitting lengthens. </p><p>  The width of the circle should correspond to the width of the leg.  In the process of knitting we get a "bucket".  When we have expanded to the required girth of the leg, we knit two or three rows without expansion.  Count the number of columns.  Divide into three parts.  We continue to knit only two-thirds of the columns.  Knit up to the heel.  Fold the canvas in half and carefully knit with double crochet, connecting the halves.  This completes the knitting of the tracks.  Now you need to do everything again, and you will get a couple of warm and cozy little wands. </p>
