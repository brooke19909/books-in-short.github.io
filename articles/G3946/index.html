Many people like pools, a water park and a spa center, unobtrusive animation, a nightclub, and a pleasant and well-educated audience throughout the day.  Warm memories remain. </p><p>  <span>Antalya Airport</span> is 15 km from Baia Lara Hotel 5 *.  Reviews suggest that this is the best place to stay in Antalya.  The presence of bars and restaurants is impressive.  An abundance of delicious drinks and a variety of dishes will satisfy the hunger of even the most fastidious gourmet. </p><p>  Special attention, according to the guests, is worth the swimming pools.  Some hotel guests do not even go to the beach, as local water areas fully replace them with beach vacations.  Nevertheless, the coastal zone of the hotel is considered one of the most comfortable.  A clean warm sea and a lot of entertainment on the beach are waiting for everyone who chooses Baia Lara Hotel 5 *. </p>
