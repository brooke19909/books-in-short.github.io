    <h2>  It was a long time ago </h2><p>  We must start with history, because Nevyansk is an ancient city.  It was founded in 1701.  This happened under Peter the Great, who ordered the construction of a metal factory.  The city, as was previously accepted, belonged to a certain family, the famous Demidov dynasty.  In Nevyansk, the sights of which we will introduce you to, many historical sites have been preserved.  And this despite the fact that at the end of the XIX century there was a fire and most of the buildings burned down.  The city authorities take care of preserving its historical appearance. </p>

    <h2>  Start from here </h2><p>  Some attractions of the city of Nevyansk require reconstruction, but on all historically significant architectural buildings there are signs with information about who owned this house before and what its owner did. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To get more information, it is worth visiting the Historical and Architectural Museum.  It was founded in 1947 and currently has about 60,000 exhibits.  By visiting it, you will find out what are the sights of Nevyansk and the surrounding area and you can choose where to go first.

    <h2>  Terribly interesting </h2><p>  This building was built in the first half of the XVIII century.  As the name implies, it has a slope.  It was built on the orders of <span>Akinfiy Demidov.</span>  At the base of the Inclined tower is a square with a side of 9.5 meters.  It deviates from the vertical by 1.85 meters.  The height of the tower is 57.5 meters. </p><p>  The tower is a hollow quadrangle with massive walls.  On top of it are three octagonal tiers.  There are several floors in the Inclined Tower, each of which had its own purpose.  Unfortunately, these days you can only guess about them, only based on historical documents that have been preserved from past times.  And they say that the second floor served as the office of Demidov, on the third there was a laboratory for the smelting of silver and gold.  The fourth floor has unique acoustics.  Its domed flattened ceiling contributes to excellent sound propagation.  Thus, standing in one corner, the rooms can clearly hear what is being said in another. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Visitors to the tower talk about the fact that they do not leave the feeling of some kind of extraneous presence.  Perhaps a ghost lives in the old tower, or maybe it’s a game of imagination of those who know how much mysterious happened in its walls. </p><h2>  Holy places </h2><p>  The beautiful city of Nevyansk.  Sights described in this article include the Transfiguration Cathedral.  In the city lived the Yakovlev family, who owned several factories.  At their expense, this stone five-altar temple was built.  In Soviet times, somewhere in the 30s, the cathedral was closed.  As was customary at the time, the building was used as a production building.  Of course, the domes and the bell tower were removed from it.  With the revival of spirituality, temples began to be restored in our country.  Transfiguration Cathedral was restored and reopened in a festive atmosphere in 2003.  Parishioners were very happy about this event. </p><p>  There is a sobriety society and the “Mercy” society at the temple, which helps sick and needy people.  According to reviews coming to this city, the cathedral is quiet, calm.  The soul asks to stay in it longer, then to feel lightness and purification. </p>

    <h2>  Founding Fathers </h2><p>  Nevyansk sights are not only buildings, but also monuments.  One of them perpetuated the memory of Peter I and Nikita Antyufeev.  Those who are familiar with history understand why there is a monument to these people in this city.  Nikita Antyufeev is a former craftsman who managed to please the tsar with his skill and business qualities so much that he made him his right hand in the development of the Urals.  The tsar gave Nikita the name Demidov, under which he became famous as the owner of metallurgical plants, whose fame boomed even outside of Russia.  If you are interested in the history of our country, be sure to visit Nevyansk.  Sights, photos of which you will find in this article, will tell a lot about it. </p><h2>  It’s good in nature </h2><p>  This city has an artificial pond.  It was created over five years.  The completion of the work dates back to 1701.  This pond is protected as a natural monument and is the oldest body of water in the Urals.  The pond was created at the moment when Akinfiy Demidov was building a dam for the iron factory.  This pond is polluted due to the fact that a plant is operating nearby.  But the city authorities are trying to ennoble the appearance of the territory around it and purify the water.  The grass around the pond is regularly mowed.  Interestingly, although the water of the pond is polluted and you can’t swim in it, there are lovers of fishing in these muddy waters. </p>

    <h2>  A little further </h2><p>  In the vicinity of Nevyansk there are also many attractions.  For example, near the village of Verkh-Neyvinsky there are rocks that have an original appearance.  This is a mountain range that stretches 100 meters in length and 32 meters in height.  In total, she has seven separate teeth.  This is the work of the wind.  Interestingly, the teeth themselves are made up of granite slabs stacked on top of each other.  The foot of the rocks is bombarded with numerous stone fragments.  If you use special equipment, you can climb to the top of the main tooth.  Then you will see a stunning panorama of the Ural mountains and forests.  But there are mountains in the city itself.  They are called Small Swan and Big Swan.  These, of course, are not mountains in their essence, but hills.  But if you go up, the view of the city and its surroundings will be wonderful. </p><h2>  Almost a fairy tale </h2><p>  Another amazing nevyansk attraction is the carved tower, located near the city, in Kunar.  Everyone who saw him speak only enthusiastically.  The smith Kirill built this tower.  Currently, he is no longer alive, but his husband, Lidia Kharitonovna, who still lives in this house, is enjoying the work of her husband. </p><p>  At first glance, the house is fabulous.  But it turns out that the master devoted his work to the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution.  He worked on it alone, starting his work 13 years before the anniversary.  The house is decorated with figures of pioneers, on the walls you can read lines from popular Soviet songs of those times.  Sergey Ivanovich - self-taught.  He independently mastered the <span>profession of a blacksmith,</span> woodcarver, playing harmonies and painting.  One cannot but admire this house, which was recognized as the best in Russia in 1999. </p>

    <h2>  No one is forgotten </h2><p>  As in many cities of our country, in Nevyansk there is a memorial dedicated to the heroes who fell during the Patriotic War.  It is located on Revolution Square.  It was discovered relatively recently, in 1985.  It is a granite pedestal on which the names of the dead are embossed.  In the center, the Eternal Flame burns and a golden star is set. </p><p>  Nevyansk does not forget about the <span>home front workers,</span> who also brought closer victory and helped the front.  In their honor, a memorial was erected in the square on Revolution Square.  This is a white column that stands on white square plates.  There is also a plate on which the words of gratitude are written.  They also remember the exploits of individual residents of the city.  Here in the central square is a bust of Victor Gomzin.  He received his awards, including the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, posthumously.  Gomzin died in March 1945.  Fellow countrymen have not forgotten him and come to honor their memory annually. </p>
