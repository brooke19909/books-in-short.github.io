Contour embroidery is used for decoration and is often combined with other needlework techniques.  The classic version includes the use of a minimum number of colors.  Often <span>these are monochrome</span> works. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gutenberg.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monochrome embroidery" class="if uuid-2707766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2707766.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of contour embroidery </h2><p>  This type of needlework differs from standard embroidery in that it does not embroider a whole motif with a cross, but creates its outline.  This gives the finished work lightness and makes it watercolor.  Here you can highlight the originality of the implementation, the possibility of application in different areas of life, universality in terms of combination and originality of the plot. </p><p>  After all, if there is nothing interesting in the needlework magazine, then you can independently draw the contours and embroider the future masterpiece on them.  It takes a minimum of time to make an embroidered motif, because the main thing is to convey contour and shape. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vyshivka.mirtesen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple motive" class="if uuid-2707775" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2707775.jpg"></div><p>  In addition to the classic contour embroidery, there is also monochrome.  The basis of the execution is the back needle stitch.  If at the same time you take the thread in only one addition, then the result will be very gentle and pleasant to look at.  Sew a stitch of black thread on white fabric with even elements.  Monochrome is intended for tailoring: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Floral motifs. </li><li>  Plant elements. </li><li>  Lace on the fabric. </li></ul><p>  Contour embroidery can look very attractive and interesting, but the choice of materials plays a big role here.  The final result depends on the basis of the work. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery pattern" class="if uuid-2707769" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2707769.jpg"></div><h2>  Work items </h2><p>  By the beginning of the process of contour cross-stitch, you need to prepare so that the result is of high quality.  For work, in addition to basic materials, you can use a number of devices that will facilitate embroidery: </p><ul><li>  The cloth.  For a small motive, uniform material is selected, it looks more neat and gentle compared to a standard canvas.  Even crosses here are less.  For large scenes, it is better to use the canvas, this will facilitate the process. </li><li>  Threads.  Mouline thread is selected cotton or silk.  You can also embroider with wool, but this will add bulk to the work. </li><li>  Hoops and scissors.  The former are used to create an even and tight stretch, so the sewn crosses will be neat and beautiful. </li><li>  Water soluble marker.  The gadget is used to create squares on the fabric on which the plot will be embroidered.  This helps embroiderers to orient themselves in the process of tailoring and not to lose the necessary part of the pattern. </li></ul><p>  Although you can find many different products in needlework stores, it is better not to save on contour embroidery, since the better the elements of work, the more beautiful the result will be.  The main thing is that the purchased materials fit the embroidery plot. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scheme selection </h2><p>  Depending on where the finished work will be applied, a scheme for the process is selected.  Contour embroidery has different variants of embodiment, ranging from primitive ornaments and simple patterns, which are used as an element of decoration in other needlework techniques and ending with complex plots and portrait works. </p><p>  The choice of the scheme should depend on the skill level of the needlewoman, her skills and speed of completion.  To decorate textiles, a floral theme is used, you can embroider small flowers or combine them with abstraction, the same ornaments or interesting patterns.  Contour embroidery suggests combining only a few colors in order to convey the essence of the work using simplicity and conciseness, without overloading it with visual moments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Couple of lovers" class="if uuid-2705965" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2705965.jpg"></div><p>  Small paintings or plots that will be framed, often consist of different elements and additional needlework techniques.  It can be a counting cross or a smooth surface.  Patterns for contour cross stitch can decorate any thing, complement it with simplicity and at the same time sophistication. </p><h2>  Type of execution </h2><p>  In addition to the standard <span>counting cross with</span> which the contours are embroidered, other <span>types of stitches</span> can be used in the work <span>,</span> which will add originality.  The surface has recently become popular.  Simple motifs and elements are easily made with <span>silk threads</span> and look very delicate on the canvas. </p><p>  Contour stitch embroidery in time is faster than the standard cross-stitch and does not require special skills.  The only difference from the classical technique is the transfer of motifs to the fabric using a water-soluble marker.  On these contours, the work is sewn off. </p><p>  The tenderness and lightness of the motive can be conveyed with the help of a ‚Äúback to needle‚Äù seam.  It is performed quite simply, and its essence is only in drawing a contour on the canvas. </p><p>  The result and effect depend on the choice of the type of execution.  Experienced needlewomen advise combining several techniques to obtain the desired result. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Simple patterns" class="if uuid-2705967" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2705967.jpg"></div><h2>  Signs in embroidery </h2><p>  If you embroider a particular plot, then you can affect your real life.  There is a whole list of signs in embroidery, which can help in the implementation of desires.  Unmarried girls need to embroider pair stories, this will help in the future to find their soul mate and arrange a family life.  Patterns of a pair of contour cross-stitch can be combined with other motifs, creating whole pictures. </p><p>  To fulfill your desires, you need to embroider a pendulum or a horse, this promises increase and career growth.  You can embroider a horseshoe or a full basket of fruits.  It also contributes to material well-being. </p><p>  To develop creativity, you need to embroider flowers and still lifes.  Of course, there are few such plots in monochrome embroidery, but their implementation definitely promises a change for the better. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The scheme of seals" class="if uuid-2705973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2705973.jpg"></div><h2>  Achieving Desire </h2><p>  Before embroidering, you need to focus on your desire, visualize it and tune in for a positive outcome.  Many girls also pay attention to the lunar day, as this enhances the magical effect and effectiveness. </p><p>  You can‚Äôt embroider in a bad mood, you need to clearly understand what should happen in the end, and think only about that.  Of course, if, apart from embroidery, there is no way to try to bring closer your material well-being, then nothing will come of it, since the embroidered picture can serve only as a motivator. </p><h2>  Embroidery Tips </h2><p>  Monochrome contour embroidery is best done with silk threads, then the pattern will turn out delicate and refined.  You can also use cotton floss, but it will not give the desired effect. </p><p>  Before embroidering on a uniform weave fabric, you need to wash it so that the base sits a little.  If you do this after embroidery, the pattern may look jagged or skewed. </p><p>  Experienced embroiderers are advised to work gradually, embroidering square by square.  If you leave complex sections of the circuit for later, then as a result you can miss a lot of details and make mistakes. </p><h2>  Mouline Secrets </h2><p>  Often on small motifs, some elements are located far from each other.  In this case, you do not need to make broaches from the threads, since this is noticeable, and even a sheet of paper under the base will not be able to remove the strips.  It is better to fasten the thread with a microstitch, it will be imperceptible, and the embroidery will not deteriorate. </p><p>  Before starting work, it is necessary to check the threads for molting, if after lowering the water in the room temperature, the threads let out color, it is better not to embroider them.  Quality floss will cost more, but the effect of embroidery will continue for more than one year. </p><p>  Each girl can decorate her life and home with interesting motifs and embroidered paintings, the main thing is to find time and energy for the hobby and find the right story. </p>
