Many rent outfits for a lot of money, but there is no certainty that the costume was given to you clean and processed after the last time you put on another baby.  On <span>New Year's Eve,</span> parents often have their queues behind the costumes, so one child does not have time to take off his outfit, as he is being handed over to others.  Nobody worries about cleanliness and processing, they do not even have time to iron out suits, not to mention washing or sanitation.  It is not uncommon for parents to find pediculosis in a child after a holiday.  And this is a rather unpleasant New Year's surprise, you see, isn‚Äôt it? </p>

These are lightly armed warriors who rode horses.  The word "hussar" is Hungarian, since the first such riders appeared in this European country.

The child can wear simple trousers in black, white or blue (depending on what color of uniform you have in mind), and flashing stripes on the sides with gold or gray satin ribbons. </li><li>  Boots.  This costume item can be skipped.  It will be enough to wear black shoes or Czech shoes. </li><li>  Mentic.  It is like a broken cloak, but warm and trimmed with fur. </li><li>  And, of course, the brightest and most colorful attribute is the hussar hat.  Its correct name is a shako.  This is a tall, cylindrical-shaped headpiece with a visor and beautiful jewelry.  A fluffy feather or pompom was often worn on top.  Each army had its own special decorations on the shako, so making a hussar hat is a matter of fantasy for the master. </li></ul><h2>  Necessary for sewing measurements </h2><p>  To sew a jacket or doloman, you will need to measure the length of the sleeve, shoulder, arm circumference, neck circumference, chest and thigh circumference, and the height of the stand-up collar.  To sew a hussar hat, you need to measure the circumference of the head and approximately calculate the height of the shako.  This is done at the request of the cutter. </p><p>  If you yourself will be sewing trousers for the hussar outfit, then you will also need such measurements: hip circumference, trouser length, lower leg width, waist circumference. </p><h2>  What will you need to buy? </h2><p>  To sew a costume and a hussar hat with your own hands, you will need to purchase materials that will be needed in the work, so that later there will be no problems along the way and you do not have to re-run to the market or go to the nearest store. </p><ul><li>  Material for sewing pants.  It should be dark and dense fabric.  Although you can sew and white leggings. </li><li>  Material for sewing doloman and mentics.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  Accessories: ‚Äúlightning‚Äù for trousers and a vest or jacket, gold buttons for a jacket and uniform, for a hussar hat, accelerating ribbons (you can buy a gold rope or silver, pick up tassels), threads, needles, you can pick up yarn to suit the color of the suit to make a pompom of the same color on a shako, a fringed ribbon for an epaulet. </li><li>  Cardboard for a pattern of headgear. </li><li>  Scissors. </li><li>  PVA glue. </li><li>  Badge or sticker on the central part of the shako. </li></ul><h2>  Variety of shakos </h2><p>  Hussar caps vary in color and height.  They can be white, black or in harmony with the color of the uniform.  If red is broken, then the shak can also be made red. </p><p>  In height, they may not be too high - up to 20 cm. </p><p>  But the decoration differs dramatically.  Axelbants can be located along the visor from one edge to the other, from one upper corner of the cap to the opposite middle or to the opposite upper corner.  An icon or emblem is attached in the center.  You can search the volumetric sticker in gold or silver in the sewing accessories store to resemble the metal emblem of a hussar regiment.  To design a hussar hat for the New Year, you can attach a pompom to the center of the child on top of the bottom or attach a fluffy feather. </p><p>  It is also possible to sew a gold strip on the upper and lower parts of the tulle, on a black background of a shako - a strip in the color of a camisole. </p><h2>  Work order </h2><ol><li>  Make the necessary measurements of the child. </li><li>  Draw patterns on costume paper and make patterns on the cardboard carnival hats of the hussar. </li><li>  Transfer patterns to material. </li><li>  Sew all the seams on a typewriter and attach "zippers" to the pants and jacket. </li><li>  To do decoration: sew metal gold buttons and accelerating bands, embroider and sew epaulettes on the shoulders. </li><li>  Before you make a hussar hat, you need to transfer the template to the material and then design a headpiece from cardboard, putting all the pieces together. </li><li>  Sheathe a cardboard cap with cloth and decorate the headpiece.  We will discuss this in more detail later in the article. </li></ol><h2>  The easiest hussar costume </h2><p>  For a boy, you can make a rider outfit with your own hands, without putting much effort.  This option is suitable for those mothers who rarely encounter sewing, do not have a sewing machine, special skills and abilities.  Such a simple suit consists of black trousers.  You can decorate them on the sides with stripes for beauty.  To do this, you need to buy a golden ribbon 2 cm wide (the length corresponds to the double length of the trousers plus a couple of sentiments for bending from the bottom and top) and choose the same thread color. </p><p>  First, the bottom of the pants is hemmed along the seam, so that the tape starts from the inside inside the leg.  Then the seam goes to the front side.  To avoid wrinkles, it is better to place the workpiece on a flat surface, for example, on a table.  Finishing sewing is also necessary on the wrong side, but already on the belt.  After completing this procedure, the bottom of the suit will be ready on both sides. </p><h2>  Vest </h2><p>  The role of a doloman can be performed by a vest of red or blue color (the costumes of these riders were of different colors, so that the uniform can be sewn by anyone, even green or burgundy).  A white or color turtleneck can be worn underneath.  It is advisable to wear the same color under a red vest. </p><p>  Let's consider in more detail what a vest is.  It is sewn from two halves - the front and back, like an ordinary vest, only the neckline needs to be made semicircular and small, like for a sweater.  You can sew the front part whole, and make two halves on the back and sew the ‚Äúzipper‚Äù. </p><p>  The main work will be to decorate the vest.  First you need to mark the middle and on both sides symmetrically sew eight beautiful round buttons.  They are sewn in pairs at an equal distance from the center line of the front.  Next, you need to have a braided rope, twine, a beautiful gold edging that plays the role of accelerants, and sheathed figured around buttons.  It can be three loops located down, up and away from the center.  Shamrocks look beautiful.  Then you will need to connect the buttons together in pairs with a rope.  It remains to make epaulettes on the shoulders. </p><h2>  Epaulettes </h2><p>  On the doloman on the shoulders there are epaulettes.  These are rounded shoulder straps with fringe.  Consider how you can do them yourself.  If you have a hussar costume has gold axelbands, then you need to buy a gold edging with a fringe. </p>

    <p>  The epaulette itself can be made of cardboard, lined with red or gold material.  The same beautiful button is sewn on the thin side of the shoulder strap as on the doloman.  A fringed hem is sewn along the rounded edge so that the threads hang on the shoulders.  You can create some kind of drawing from the edging, as in the photo above. </p><h2>  Costume </h2><p>  If you have the skills of a seamstress and a sewing machine, then you can sew the entire costume of the brave hussar of two elements: doloman and mentica.  Usually a suit is worn as follows.  Doloman is put on his chest and all buttons are completely fastened, and the mentic is hung on one shoulder, and it hangs on the back of the axel. </p><p>  When sewing, you just need to make two identical doloman, in the form of a jacket with a collar in the form of a rack.  A mentic differs from doloman only in that its edges are sheathed in fur (bottom, neck and sleeves). </p>

    <p>  The mentic is attached with a rope from the neck under the arm of the opposite hand.  Then he will not fall off his shoulder and disturb the child at the holiday. </p><p>  We start sewing with a pattern.  If you do not have the skills to draw such patterns by the standards, you can use the boy‚Äôs shirt, having outlined the necessary cut elements on paper: backs, front (2 parts), two identical parts of a one-piece sleeve, stand-up collar.  Do not forget to leave 1.0-1.5 cm on each side on the hem of the fabric and seams.  After all details are marked with simple stitches, they make the first fitting of the costume for the child.  If you decide to sew a lined suit, then you need to transfer the same patterns and measurements to the lining fabric.  The whole process is repeated similarly to the first. </p><p>  Then, the doloman and the lining jacket are sewn separately.  Both parts are well ironed through a damp cotton cloth.  The tunic is stitched with a lining on the wrong side along the collar and the lines of the shelves, and then everything is turned on the front.  After that, iron the product again, iron the seams.  Then re-try on a suit for the boy to adjust the length of the product.  You can sew a gold piping on the bottom seam or sew a satin ribbon along the bottom.  We do the same on the collar. </p><p>  It remains only to sew the "lightning" and decorate the doloman. </p><h2>  Quiver hussar </h2><p>  You already know how it looks and what shape the cap of such a warrior has.  First you need to consider different images of such a hat and choose a color and jewelry for it.  Often, in the center of the cap of the hussar, you can see a metal coat of arms or ‚Äúcrab‚Äù, as our military says.  You can search for a similar picture <span>sewn with gold</span> threads in the hardware store.  There are even such fabric stickers.  If you don‚Äôt find it, then don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.  You can do well with the accelerant. </p><p>  How to make a hussar hat with your own hands?  Consider the pattern first.  You also need to think in advance what material for such work needs to be used, than to attach such a hat to the child‚Äôs head so that it does not fall, and what you will decorate with. </p><h2>  Pattern </h2><p>  <span>The pattern of the cap of the</span> hussar consists of three separate elements: tulle, bottom and visor.  To draw such a pattern, you need to measure the circumference of the head.  This will be the length of the body.  Having determined by eye what height will be enough for your child to shake, draw a rectangle.  Do not forget to leave a couple of centimeters on the hem so that the cardboard shaver can be glued or fastened with a stapler. </p>

    <p>  Having curled up a tulle around, we outline the circumference of the bottom.  Around it you need to draw a lot of triangles to firmly adhere the bottom to the top.  A visor is also drawn along the same circle, and triangles are also drawn on its upper part, on which thick PVA glue is subsequently applied.  However, before fastening the parts together, according to these templates, you need to transfer the pattern to the fabric from which the shako will be sewn for a brave hussar costume. </p><p>  The material is connected first by the height of the rectangle, then sewn on the bottom.  The visor pattern is transferred to a fabric bent in half.  Further, the material is sheathed around it from two sides.  Only then the sheathed visor is sewn to the shako. </p><h2>  Decoration of a shako </h2><p>  If for a boy the hussar hat is made black and monophonic with his own hands, then you can decorate it with a bright yellow rope woven into a pigtail.  And at one end attach one or two brushes.  You can replace them with pompons.  It will also look beautiful. </p>

    <p>  Since the central part of the shako is occupied by an accelerant, the emblem can be attached from one side of the cap, as in the photo above. </p><p>  Consider another version of a shako for a boy who has a broken or blue mentic.  As you can see in the next photo, this shako is of small height.  This "flaw" compensates for the long feather in the center of the cap.  Such an accessory is attached to something solid, for example, on a stick or a cardboard base.  It is better to take a double layer of paper so that the product is stronger. </p>

    <p>  The rest of the decoration consists of a central emblem and a chain attached to two gold-colored buttons symmetrically sewn. </p><p>  A shako with a white high feather will also look beautiful.  Look carefully at the bottom photo of the cap of the hussar.  This option will suit absolutely any costume, both with white leggings and black ones.  Such a shako will also look beautiful with a white doloman. </p>

    <p>  The axelbant is a double woven lace located on the lower side of the shako and stretched to the upper opposite side.  Since the feather and the rope are white, then the emblem should not be gold, but silver, with a metallic sheen. </p><p>  The hussar caps in white look spectacular.  Then the gold axelbants will look even brighter.  Often you can see pompons on children's shakos instead of feathers and brushes. </p><p>  The article describes in detail how the different versions of the costume of the hussar as a whole look, and the rider separately.  A pattern of a headdress from cardboard is given, it is described in detail how to sew a hat for a hussar, to decorate products with decor items.  Try and your child will have something to brag about before friends. </p>
