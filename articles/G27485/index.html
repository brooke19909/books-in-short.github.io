The functionality of the device allows you to call it a small tablet with limited capabilities.  The book received a media player, a color screen that can work with video.  Unfortunately, the device copes with the direct task (reading books) the worst. </p><p>  The device, which will be discussed later in the article, is one of the simplest devices among all available in this sector.  It costs a little - about 4 thousand rubles.  It does not support work with wireless networks and networks of the third generation.  If one could play games on a reader (this function is available only in new firmware versions), then it would turn out to be called a substitute for any tablet.  Often this device is purchased by children.  It allows you to read books, watch cartoons and so on.  Of course, there is not enough opportunity to work with entertainment, but this model is a worthy option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ritmix rbk 450" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1760084.jpg" width="328"></div>

    <h2>  Brief characteristics </h2><p>  The Ritmix RBK 450 reader is a device created using special technology.  It got a seven-inch screen.  Due to the devices used, the manufacturer was able to achieve a clear picture and good contrast.  On the other hand, such a solution reduces eye strain.  That is why the manufacturer chose to use a TFT display.  Consumers consider this choice rash, but it is tested by experience and time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Play video </h2><p>  The Ritmix RBK 450 e-book is created on a special processor, which is most often used in various players.  The device is able to work with 10 video formats and 7 - audio.  The speaker is quite tolerable in order to listen to music without headphones.  The device works adequately, stably, without any glitches. </p><p>  You can even play Full HD.  An e-book will show that it is able to open not only well-known formats, but also those that are not heard.  If several audio tracks or subtitles are found when working with a file with a standard player, problems may arise.  If desired, you can edit the image viewing format.  It is set to position 4.3. </p><p>  Brightness is a great feature.  If you use the maximum mark, the picture becomes clear and contrast.  It is possible to work with color reproduction in some shades.  Such functions are often inherent only in media players, and not in electronic books. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e-book ritmix rbk 450" class="if" height="499" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1760088.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Playing music </h2><p>  You can play any <span>audio format</span> on the Ritmix RBK 450 <span>:</span> both the most famous and not.  Some of them are recognized as standard.  The sound is powerful and works best with headphones.  There are pros and cons.  For example, if you work with rock, bass and pop, the device will show its best side.  Available customizable options, as well as an equalizer.  In order to sort the media library, a special technology has been created.  It allows you to compose audio files by genre, album and artist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Digital formats </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the manufacturer used a TFT screen, he preferred to create not an e-book Ritmix RBK 450 (reviews about it are almost always positive), but an unfinished tablet.  Although the comparison is unsuccessful, it still has a place to be.  The reader can freely work with those files and formats with which tablets and netbooks are in poor contact.  Unfortunately, the more advanced the video playback function, the worse the functionality of the book reader application. </p><p>  The device is able to interact with well-known digital formats: fb2 and epub.  But the standard application does not work with footnotes and table of contents.  The same problems arise when viewing HTML files. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ritmix rbk 450 reviews" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1760089.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Standard formats </h2><p>  The Ritmix RBK 450 (specifications are described below) sometimes has problems reading rtf.  Formatting may ‚Äúfly off‚Äù, pictures may not be displayed.  Footnotes in this format are inserted into the text, so they are read normally.  With standard TXT files, the application works hard.  The reader is not able to automatically break text into paragraphs. </p><p>  If the PDF file weighs no more than 10 MB, then the device is able to open it.  The application interface resembles the standard "Adobe".  When the book exceeds the permissible size, the reader freezes and you can reload it only through a special button.  An additional advantage is the fact that when viewing a book, pictures of various types are downloaded. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the device does not work with archives and formats doc and djvu.  The manufacturer guaranteed that the problem will be solved in the near future.  It will be enough only to reflash the reader. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ritmix rbk 450 firmware" class="if" height="392" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1760092.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  General characteristics </h2><p>  The design is nice and cute.  Weight was 310 g. Dimensions are small: 19 x 12 x 1.1 cm. The screen is specially coated with a film so as not to spoil the display.  Due to the fact that the back is made of matte material, the device practically does not slip in the hands.  The manufacturer decided to abandon the cover of a leather substitute with a magnet lock. </p><p>  The determining factor in the purchase for many will be the price.  The reader, when compared with other similar devices, was distinguished by good functionality at a low cost. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ritmix rbk 450 battery" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1760093.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features </h2><p>  The Ritmix RBK 450 e-book, reviews of which below, runs on a good processor, and its cores operate at a frequency of 400 MHz.  This is enough to ensure that the 7-inch screen interacts with a person as comfortably as possible.  There is a backlight, it is colored and works both when touched with a finger or with a stylus.  The latter is located in a special nest in the lower part on the right side.  The sensor may not work if you touch it lightly.  For some consumers, a button for turning pages will be useful.  On the device, in general, there are only three keys: on / off, volume control.  The most noticeable is the third button, as it is responsible for accessing the menu. </p><p>  RAM is 256 MB.  The embedded manufacturer provided 4 GB.  If desired, you can use a 16 GB memory card (maximum size).  This will allow you to download to the device most of the necessary applications, games and other files.  The reader can be used for background music playback.  Using the device is allowed to show cartoons to children or use it as a voice recorder.  As additional bonuses, it is necessary to note the presence of a calendar and gallery.  After the release of several modifications of the firmware, its latest versions have several games.  Therefore, the Ritmix RBK 450 gained great popularity. </p><p>  The battery can last no more than 4 hours after a long video, you can listen to music a little longer.  To increase the period of use in the last action, it is allowed to turn off the screen.  Then the battery will drain much more slowly.  With active reading, you can wait until the battery is turned off only after 7 hours of use.  At the end of the device there is a USB port, the device is charged best from the network adapter.  In this case, you can turn on only the screen, and not the reader itself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="e-book ritmix rbk 450 reviews [" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1760094.jpg" width="500"></div>

For some owners, the device runs slowly and ‚Äúthinks‚Äù for a long time, which causes a negative.  Often there may be problems with downloading applications and other software.  A large proportion of consumers complain that the device must be turned on almost every day, because if you leave it for a week and not use it, the reader stops working.
