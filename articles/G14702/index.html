It is drawn to us in pink, purple and yellow colors.  It is so pleasant in the middle of gray everyday life to plunge into another, bright world for at least a couple of hours!  It employs people with amazing capabilities, able to soar under the dome, feel like water in the water, curl up into real knots, do magic and wonders, talk to animals and cheer even the most gloomy person.  And after the performance, we all leave the building with a dome with the feeling that good can and must be done.  And which of us in childhood was not attracted by the profession of a circus performer?  And all the fault is films in which the lives of these people are cloudless, and under the mask there are no tears.  Just think: to travel around the world, get into road stories, communicate with a variety of interesting people and give everyone around you joy - is it really not great?  And therefore, in the circus, everyone at least for a little bit becomes children and perceives this world brighter and more beautiful, washed, as after rain.  Today we‚Äôll talk about the Ivanovo Circus. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo circus" class="if" height="446" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/464007.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Highlights of the city </h2><p>  We often associate Ivanovo with the most provincial town, since we represent it in an abstract way.  But in fact, the locality (by the way, which gave the Disco Crash group to the whole country) exists on the map.  This is the regional center of the Ivanovo region.  The city has a population of almost half a million people.  Well, who did not hear about the city of brides!  Such a nickname was received by Ivanovo in the middle of the last century: the female population prevailed here.  By the way, that is why the city was destined to become the textile capital of Russia.  And in Ivanovo, by the way, there really is something to see.  To begin with, there is a triad of theaters - for any, even the most fastidious, spectator.  The same number of cinemas.  But there are many museums.  Their theme is the city itself and its history, local history, art, the ‚Äúvisiting card‚Äù of the city is chintz.  And public life is in full swing in Ivanovo: in addition to the famous Zerkalo film festival, there are many music festivals here, special attention is paid to rock, namely, to instilling young people with a good musical taste.  But children especially like the zoo, in which one and a half hundred animals live.  The highlight of the city is the Ivanovo State Circus named after  V.A. Volzhansky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo circus performance schedule" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/465390.jpg" width="600"></div>

The project was published: a dome with a diameter of fifty meters and a height of twenty-five meters, designed for three thousand people.  It was to be built from semi-arches.  This project was original and unique at that time.  Moreover, the building was a transformer.  It survived during the war years without a single repair, but ... Seventy-seventh year.  Despite numerous protests, the circus was blown up.  Ivanovo lost a wonderful monument.  Instead, a dome with a capacity of one thousand seven hundred places, typical of sixteen cities, was erected.  And now we see him as we did almost fifty years ago. </p>

    <h2>  Circus programs </h2><p>  This dome sheltered many troupes: even the circus of the Zapashny brothers.  In winter, the Iceberg team arrives.  The highlight of the circus itself is the selection of animals to participate in the rooms.  Many circus art stars from Europe and America come here - so there is something to see! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to get to Ivanovo </h2><p>  So, perhaps, you already have a great desire to go to this wonderful city ... This desire is quite feasible: take everything into your own hands!  Well, if you come to visit the Ivanovo State Circus.  How to get to the place?

If you take Moscow as a reference point, then on the plane you will spend no more than an hour;  if you choose land transportation methods, the trip will take a maximum of half a day.  But it‚Äôs easy to get to the circus: it is located at 42 Lenin Ave. It is located between Baturin Street and the banks of the Uvod River. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ivanovo Circus" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/464009.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  We hurry to the circus </h2><p>  Our people like to relax - and we can do it right!  And some would not have crawled out of the circus day and night.  If not for a strict schedule.  And here is the useful information that everyone who needs to visit the Ivanovo Circus will need: a schedule of performances.  Typically, programs last for 2 hours, performances begin at noon, the busiest time is four in the afternoon.  It should be noted that in 2014 the Ivanovo Circus was closed from July to December 25 for repairs. </p><h2>  Circus in numbers: how much do you give fun? </h2><p>  Depending on the place, the price can vary from four to nine hundred rubles.  Children under three years old can attend the Ivanovo Circus for free.  As already mentioned, its capacity is one thousand seven hundred places, so there are almost always free places at an affordable price.  And here is one minus that you can find: in the circus it is not allowed to take pictures of performances, you have to pay for the shooting. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ivanovo circus reviews" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/464008.jpg" width="236"></div>

    <h2>  What about the people? </h2><p>  What do people who visited the Ivanovo circus say?  Reviews are very different.  There are no comments on the cultural program.  But the situation is worse, for example, with the condition of the premises, which requires urgent repair.  The condition of the buffet and the restrooms is not pleasing to the eye.  But why end the story on a sad note?  The circus is a place where we are charged with energy, but also give our energy to a brilliant dome.  So do not grumble about the imperfect state of the building or the cold in the hall, you just need to let go of all the problems and headfold into the haze of a new miracle. </p>
