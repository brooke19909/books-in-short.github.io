However, someone remains with dreams of heaven, and someone gets a prestigious position.  This work requires serious knowledge, as well as certain personal characteristics.  To become <span>a civil aviation pilot,</span> you need long-term training.  That is why this vacancy is attractive in terms of salaries.  Usually it exceeds the average figures established in the labor market. </p><h2>  Features of work </h2><p>  As in any profession, you can find the pros and cons.  Among the advantages are high salaries in the field of aviation, the ability to retire earlier than the established age in Russia. </p><p>  In addition, flying on international flights, you can visit many different countries.  For pilots set a special mode of work.  You can not work more than 12 hours and relax for less than half a day.  That is why upon arrival in another city you can find time for a walk and get acquainted with the sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pilotpatrick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does the pilot earn" class="if uuid-2663931" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2663931.jpg"></div><p>  Given all the advantages and how much the pilot earns, this profession can be called very attractive for young people. </p><p>  However, not without pitfalls.  Due to the nature of the schedule, pilots are rarely at home.  For some, the number of days off does not exceed 5-7 days per month.  You also need to be prepared to undergo serious training and take responsibility during flights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What does income depend on? </h2><p>  The pilot's salary is affected by: </p><ul><li>  airline generosity; </li><li>  work experience; </li><li>  qualification; </li><li>  number of flight hours; </li><li>  type of aircraft; </li><li>  position held; </li><li>  region. </li></ul><p>  There are some more indirect factors.  They also affect how much a passenger airplane pilot earns in Russia.  For example, the prestige of the diploma received, as well as knowledge of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand some additional skills.  It is also known that international flights are paid more generously than domestic flights. </p><h2>  How much does an airplane pilot earn in Russia? </h2><p>  Income in the field of aviation is of interest to many.  Usually they are above average, which is especially attractive for those who are only determined by the profession. </p><p>  If we consider the average data, the highest salaries are paid to Tyumen pilots - about 215 thousand rubles.  The next place in the unofficial rating is Primorsky Krai with an average income of 150 thousand rubles.  Completes the top three Magadan region.  Here, pilots are paid an average of 130 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.starcostumes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a passenger plane pilot earn" class="if uuid-2663935" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2663935.jpg"></div><p>  Now we find out where aviators receive the lowest income.  Oddly enough, the Moscow and Leningrad Regions, which are usually famous for their high salaries, got into anti-rating.  Pilots here are paid an average of 54 and 39 thousand rubles, respectively.  Also in the top three outsiders - Khabarovsk Territory.  The average salary for pilots is 51 thousand rubles.  Many will be surprised that the capital is too low income.  Perhaps only the region participated in the statistics.  The average salary for pilots in Moscow can be 127 thousand rubles.  This is significantly more than the income of ordinary Russian citizens. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How are things at Aeroflot? </h2><p>  Usually, salaries of employees are not disclosed, as they constitute a trade secret.  However, in 2013, a strike took place at the largest Russian airline.  Pilots demanded better working conditions, as well as higher salaries.  For the pilots, it all ended to no avail, and in the meantime, the media leaked information about how much the pilot earned.  They said that Aeroflot employees have better conditions and more benefits than their foreign colleagues. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.howtobecome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does an airplane pilot earn in Russia" class="if uuid-2663933" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2663933.jpg"></div><p>  It became known that even the second pilot is paid from 400 thousand rubles.  The captain‚Äôs salary is even more - from 440 thousand rubles.  In addition, in cities of arrival, pilots are paid for accommodation in four- and five-star hotels.  That is why the demands of the dissatisfied were not satisfied. </p><p>  For a long time on the market, Aeroflot has become an international brand.  Remaining a leader in the Russian air transportation market, you have to keep the brand.  That is why recruiters find the best pilots, offering decent conditions and payment. </p><p>  The aircraft commander can earn up to 650 thousand rubles per month.  The co-pilot will earn less - within 350 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Other airlines </h2><p>  As mentioned above, <span>how much the pilot earns</span> depends heavily on which carrier he works for.  The largest payouts can boast of Russian Aeroflot - about 400 thousand rubles.  per month. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pilotcareernews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much do pilots earn per month" class="if uuid-2663936" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2663936.jpg"></div><p>  In other airlines, income is more modest. </p><ul><li>  S7 Airlines - approximately 350 thousand rubles. </li><li>  UTair - 100-150 thousand rubles. </li><li>  "Russia" - an average of 120 thousand rubles.  In this airline, until 2015, pilots were paid about 300 thousand rubles.  However, in 2015, their income was noticeably reduced. </li></ul><h2>  Will salaries change? </h2><p>  Some airlines have fairly tight financial policies.  This affects the salaries of pilots of a passenger plane and leads to a "staff turnover".  However, they do not plan to increase payments. </p><p>  According to recruiting specialists, the Russian market is in dire need of qualified pilots.  That is why some employers, on the contrary, try to create the best conditions for their pilots. </p><p>  Being interested in retaining qualified pilots, they do not save on payroll.  As a result, they offer their employees more competitive income. </p><h2>  How much do co-pilots pay? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="aiomag.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="passenger salary" class="if uuid-2663939" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2663939.jpg"></div><p>  As mentioned above, the position affects the level of income.  In addition to the crew captain, there is a second pilot on board in case there is a need to replace the main pilot.  A backup aviator has similar skills, but his income is still lower.  For example, if the captain is paid 500 thousand rubles, then the second pilot - 390 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Benefits for pilots </h2><p>  Not always airlines pay with their employees only money.  Many carriers provide a whole package of benefits. </p><p>  For example, Aeroflot provides a social package equivalent to an amount of up to 300 thousand rubles.  Agree, this is a good increase in the basic salary.  In addition, the air carrier is ready to provide employees with housing, medical insurance for the pilot and members of his family, as well as to compensate for the costs of pre-school education and visits to health facilities.  This list of benefits is relevant for the crew commander. </p><p>  For the second pilot, the conditions are somewhat more modest.  Aeroflot is ready to offer him medical insurance, corporate airline tickets, tuition fees, etc. </p><h2>  Pension for pilots </h2><p>  It is important not only how much the pilot of a passenger plane earns.  Agree, the issue of going on a well-deserved vacation is no less relevant. </p><p>  To become pensioners, men need to have 20 years of experience and fly 6 thousand hours.  For women, the indicators are slightly different.  Fifteen years of experience and 4,800 hours.  Having fulfilled these two conditions, the pilot can go on a well-deserved rest and begin to receive pension payments, which are formed of two parts - insurance and additional. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.focus.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how much does a passenger plane pilot earn in Russia" class="if uuid-2663938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96428/2663938.jpg"></div><p>  The first is affected by the amount of pension accruals.  It depends on how much the pilot earns.  The higher his income, the more deductions can be made during the period of employment. </p><p>  With the second part, everything is somewhat more complicated.  The additional payment is affected by several factors: </p><ul><li>  insurance pension; </li><li>  size of social security; </li><li>  the number of full years in excess of the minimum length of service. </li></ul><p>  On average, retired pilots are paid 40,000 rubles per month.  Of course, this is less than a salary.  But significantly higher than average Russian pensions. </p><p>  Now you know how much airplane pilots earn per month.  For those who have not decided on a profession, this information can be especially useful. </p>
