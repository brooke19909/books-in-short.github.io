It is surrounded by coniferous forest, consisting of pines, spruces and cedars.  The hulls, like mushrooms in the forest, were lined up on the ennobled territory of the health resort, interconnected by paved walking malls.  There are also equipped playgrounds for games, sports and for parking. </p><p>  He came for recovery - live and rejoice that there is no industry around, the air is clean, smelling of pine needles, the Tom River is 500 meters from the sanatorium.  Nearby is the village of Podyakovo, and the city of Kemerovo from the "Cedar Forest" is 32 kilometers away. </p><h2>  How to come to the sanatorium? </h2><p>  The easiest way is if it is a check-in trip, which indicates the route.  On the day of arrival, a bus from the sanatorium is waiting for tourists at the railway station.  Departure time to Kedrovy Bor is 11:00.  If something did not work out and it was not possible to get on this bus, you can take a taxi, and in half an hour it will rush to the destination. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cedar forest kemerovo" class="if" height="356" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1841325.jpg" width="502"></div>  Public transport runs from Kemerovo.  You can get to Kedrovy Bor by taking a bus from the bus station to Taiga, Pacha, Khmelevka villages.  They all go through the village of Podyakovo with a stop near the sanatorium.

There are luxury rooms, they are designed for home bedroom apartments.  The cost of trips to the sanatorium depends on the room in which the vacationer will live, and on the treatment program.  On average, this is 2400 rubles per person per day. </p><p>  The resort provides four meals a day.  It consists of a menu of 3 types: custom, diet and vitamin.

    <h2>  Diagnostics and recovery </h2><p>  People come to the Kedrovy Bor sanatorium (Kemerovo) who have health problems associated with the digestive tract, breathing, heart, bones and joints, nervous and genitourinary systems.  If a person who has arrived on a ticket to the sanatorium-resort card does not clearly reflect the problem of the disease, here you can be examined, take the necessary tests and tests for hormonal levels, do an ultrasound and ECG.  During treatment or rehabilitation, vacationers can consult a doctor on the desired profile. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  As prescribed by the medical staff, guests arriving for treatment take therapeutic <span>baths (coniferous,</span> turpentine, with bischofite), mud applications, inhalations, showers, massages, UHF and ultraviolet and many other procedures, including alternative medicine.  It is a treatment with color, music and aromas.  The resort uses silt mud. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cedar forest kemerovo reviews" class="if" height="381" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/1841321.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  People who come to improve their health have the opportunity not only to take procedures prescribed by doctors, but also to actively relax.  To do this, there is an equipped beach, where there is a place for swimming and fishing.  The resort has a gym with exercise equipment, an indoor pool, spa and billiard room.  Their visit is paid according to the price list additionally.  There is a large library for those who love chatting with a live book, rather than an electronic one, dumped onto a gadget brought with them.  By the way, the Internet "Cedar Forest" is provided. </p><p>  Almost all year round races of employees of enterprises <strong> </strong>  Kemerovo in the "Cedar Forest".  Reviews and impressions are varied.  But mostly people say thanks to the doctors and all the attendants.  The positive aspects of being in a sanatorium include everything being remoteness from enterprises, the ability to breathe forest air.  I like the approach to nutrition.  Negative moments cannot be called such as some rooms requiring repair.  Everything is done on schedule.  Not everyone with cars likes paying entry to the resort.  But in general, Cedar Forest leaves a very good impression on itself. </p>
