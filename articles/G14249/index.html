    <h2>  Briefly about the hotel </h2><p>  Bauman Residence Hotel is a 10-minute walk from the famous Patong Beach.  And Phuket International Airport is only 45 minutes away.  This location is considered quite convenient and advantageous.  And not close, and not far - it is just possible to get to the airport quickly, but landing and taking off planes will not interfere with vacationers with their noise. </p><p>  And a five-minute drive from the hotel is the large Jungceylon Shopping Center.  It is interesting that the part of the city in which this hotel complex is located is the most beloved among the guests - they themselves assure so.  And the beach in the immediate vicinity, and all other interesting places that I would like to visit, being here on vacation. </p><h2>  Offered rooms </h2><p>  So, guests are offered a choice of six types of rooms.  The most popular is considered a double - with one bed and with access to the pool (3-4 guests are possible).  The second most frequent reservation is a penthouse suite for five.  Next comes the superior triple room.  There are two options - with 1 wide bed or with two separate.  Double deluxe rooms are also available.  Also to choose from - with one wide bed or 2 twin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  More guests can stay in a family apartment for four.  And finally, the last option is a two-bedroom suite (designed for five guests). </p>

    <h2>  Important booking information </h2><p>  Before you begin to pay or choose your own room, you should familiarize yourself with the information regarding the reservation.  So, check-in at the Bauman Residence Hotel is registered at the same time as in the rest of the hotel complexes.  From 14:00 until late in the evening.  And departure - before noon.  But, as mentioned above, if you previously tell the administration that the guests will have to leave later or check in earlier, there will be no problems, the request will be fulfilled. </p><p>  The hotel can be accommodated with children of any age.  Interestingly, if the child is not four years old, then he is allowed to stay in the reserved apartments for free.  And if the baby is not even two years old, then they can provide him with a separate crib.  If the child is older than the specified age, you will need to pay an additional 50% of the cost of the reservation.  An extra bed is also available upon request, so you should be puzzled by this issue as soon as possible. </p>

    <h2>  Budget Class Rooms </h2><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with a discussion of the cheapest apartments.  These are superior double rooms (either with 1 wide or with 2 separate standard beds).  In Bauman Residence Hotel 4, such apartments will cost 75,000 rubles for two for 2 weeks.  If you want breakfast to be included, you will have to pay about 2-8 thousand rubles (depending on the presence or absence of a promotional booking offer).  For three such a room with breakfast included will cost one hundred thousand rubles. </p><p>  What is included in the conditions?  Balcony with a picturesque view of the mountains, telephone, satellite TV, a wide-screen TV, air conditioning, wardrobe, shower.  And, of course, such pleasant and necessary little things as a bathrobe, towels, linen, free toiletries and a hairdryer.  In addition to the above, there is an electric kettle and a wake-up service. </p><p>  Double rooms with access to the pool cost about 112 thousand rubles for 2-3 people and 135 thousand for 3-4 tourists (price without discounts).  The conditions are almost the same, only the apartments are more spacious. </p><p>  There are also "deluxe" - 117 000 rubles for two weeks for three people with breakfast included in the price.  For two - 94,000 (the same conditions).  The apartments have a balcony, air conditioning, bath with shower, minibar and everything else listed above. </p>

    <h2>  Expensive apartments </h2><p>  Speaking about Bauman Residence Hotel 4 (Thailand, Phuket), I would like to pay special attention to expensive rooms.  For example, family.  48 square meters, special conditions.  For four guests with breakfast included in the price, these apartments will cost 775 thousand rubles (this is a discount).  The standard price is approaching the mark of 880,000 p.  What is offered for this price? </p><p>  Private balcony with city views, spacious beds, telephone, satellite TV, a hotel with a seating area, a bathroom (with bathtub and shower), a minibar, free toiletries with bathrobes and other little things.  But this is not all that can please the Bauman Residence Hotel. </p><p>  Reviews of luxury rooms are striking in those emotions that were put into them by guests who returned from vacation.  But it is worth recognizing - apartments of this class are really chic.  70 square meters, flat-screen TV with wide screen, bathroom with large bathtub, air conditioning, free W-Fi and much more.  How much will a deluxe room cost for two weeks?  About 1,170,000 rubles for four people with breakfast included in the price.  The amount, of course, is impressive when compared with the price of the remaining apartments for the same 14 nights. </p><p>  But the rooms are luxurious, richly decorated.  The windows and the balcony overlook the city (or pool), the apartments themselves have everything - a telephone, a seating area, comfortable furniture, a minibar, a refrigerator, a kettle, linen, bathrobes and much more. </p>

    <h2>  Bauman Residence Hotel 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  And finally, how people who managed to visit there comment on their holidays in this place.  Guests assure that this elegant, stylish and, importantly, the new hotel will be a great place to stay.  The guests claim that the rooms are cleaned daily and of high quality, the restaurants are served honestly and deliciously varied dishes, and entertainment is really something special.  A gym, a tennis court, a bar and a restaurant by the pool, a jacuzzi, waterfalls, animation - as they say, taste and color! </p><p>  In general, the service is good, the staff is polite, the conditions correspond to the description - everything you need for a comfortable stay.  Prices, however, are not available to everyone, but if such an amount is available, then you do not need to regret spending it on this hotel complex.  Thousands of tourists have already seen this. </p>
