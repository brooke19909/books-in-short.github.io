The impetus for the development of the settlement was given by the appearance of railway communication.  Currently, the city of Lyubertsy is a large industrial center with a large number of people.  On its streets you can meet not only local residents, but also guests.  People come here to see the sights of Lyubertsy related to its life and history.  This article will talk about some of them. </p><h2>  Monument to the heroes of helicopter pilots </h2><p>  To win the wars use different fighting vehicles.  One of them is a helicopter.  Mi-24, which participated with its counterparts in the Afghan, Chechen and other wars, found its rest on a high stele in the city of Lyubertsy.  A monument was erected on the street of Warriors-Internationalists. </p><p>  It is not without reason that this city was chosen for the installation of a monument so rare for our country.  After all, military helicopters are assembled and tested here.  But this monument, in addition to paying tribute to the combat vehicle, also recalls the helicopter pilots who died during the war. </p>

Not all sights of Lyubertsy were honored to be reconstructed.  And on the house of Crumming they changed the roof, restored the spiers, carried out restoration work, as a result of which he began to fully correspond to his historical era. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This was necessary to do, because after the owner left his home, it was converted into a manger, and then several times changed its purpose.  Currently, the house of N. A. Cruming has been transferred to the city museum, which periodically arranges exhibitions of things from the home of a well-known manufacturer, including a buffet, piano, gramophone, writing instruments and much more. </p><p>  Crumming began its activities in 1911.  Initially, he was a representative of The International Harvester Company-Chicago, but in 1914 he became the manager of a factory producing agricultural machinery.  In Soviet times, N. A. Crumming closely communicated with V. I. Lenin, who even stayed at his house when he came to hunt.  The address of the building is st.  Red, d. 1. </p>
