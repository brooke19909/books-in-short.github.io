    <p>  The construction of the cathedral was started in 1908 according to the project of the famous architect from Greece Anastasios Metaksas.  He also supervised the progress of construction work.  After his death in 1937, the architect Nomikos led the work.  In total, construction lasted 66 years, and only in 1974 did the discovery take place that they had been waiting for so long. </p><p>  A magnificent building built in the <span>Byzantine style.</span>  The main dome of the temple is crowned with a five-meter gilded cross.

The ancient city fortress is one of the most popular and visited attractions, which attracts thousands of history buffs every year. </p><p>  The construction of this large defensive facility, located on a low hill, began at the end of the VI century a few hundred meters from the sea.  Before this place was located the ancient acropolis destroyed by a powerful earthquake. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patras greece sights" class="if" height="441" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1321529.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Initially, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fortress was more than 20,000 square meters.  m. She was surrounded by a moat filled with water.  The fortress consisted of two rows of thick walls.  The outer row was supplemented by sentinel towers.  During the years of Byzantine rule, the fortress of Patras was several times attacked by the Slavs and Saracens, Normans, but always withstood the siege. </p><p>  At the beginning of the XIII century, the fortress was captured by the Franks, who did a lot of work to strengthen it.  By its intended purpose, the fortress was used until the Second World War. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ancient Roman Odeon </h2><p>  For many of our compatriots, Greece has become a favorite vacation spot.  Patras are especially attractive for tourists because they can combine beach and sightseeing holidays.  In this city there are many very interesting places that you should visit in between relaxing on the beach. </p><p>  The odeon was built in the city in 160 AD.  e.  It was the heyday of the Roman Empire.  Over time, wars and earthquakes buried the once magnificent majestic structure, forming a hill in its place.  At the end of the XIX century during the construction of the dam there was an acute shortage of land for the embankment.  In this regard, it was decided to take the land from the hill.  What was the surprise of the Greeks when, under a layer of earth, they discovered the ruins of an ancient Roman odeon, moreover, well-preserved. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patras greece reviews" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1321523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Restoration work was begun, and the entire territory of the odeon, together with the lands adjacent to it, was declared the most important archaeological site.  As a result, unique <span>Roman mosaics</span> and other priceless artifacts were discovered.  The work was completed in 1956.  Greek specialists managed to recreate a unique structure almost in its original form. </p><p>  Today in the summer, odeon is used as an open-air theater.  Concerts are held here, theatrical productions are staged.  The odeon is famous for its amazing acoustics.  Its capacity is more than 2000 people. </p><h2>  Rion Andirion Bridge </h2><p>  I would not want our readers to have the impression that Greece is rich in ancient monuments only.  Patras are known far beyond the borders of the country thanks to the cable-stayed bridge.  It connects the Peloponnese and mainland Greece.  This is, without exaggeration, an impressive and grandiose masterpiece of modern engineering. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a bridge arose in the 19th century.  In those days, such a large-scale project was too expensive for <span>the Greek economy,</span> so it was not implemented.  The design consists of five spans, which are held by four pylons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="g patras greece" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/1321524.jpg" width="600"></div>
