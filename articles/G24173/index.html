    <p>  The story of Simeiz as a resort town began with the construction of his estate in this place by the industrialist Ivan Maltsov.  Part of the land was sold to them for the construction of cottages and villas, which led to the emergence of the resort of New Simeiz in the early 20th century.  The resort quickly became fashionable and frequently visited by the Russian elite.  Simeiz even honored the visit of Emperor Nicholas II with his family. </p><p>  With the advent of Soviet power, the development of the resort as an all-Union health resort continued.  Sanatoriums specializing in the treatment of respiratory organs were actively opened.  During the fascist occupation of Crimea during the Great Patriotic War, many residents of Simeiz heroically died participating in the liberation partisan movement.  After the war, the resort received a new impetus for development.  Old health resorts were restored, new sanatoriums and boarding houses were built.  In the context of perestroika, in the early 90s, the village experienced a period of decline and neglect.  Currently, Simeiz returns to its former glory. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What is Simeiz famous for now </h2><p>  An interesting fact in the history of the village is its scientific significance.
