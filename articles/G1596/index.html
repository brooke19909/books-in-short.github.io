How to fund Yandex.Money via phone</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More and more people are appreciating the advantage of settlements directly via the Internet.  One of the most popular e-wallet systems in Russia, along with Webmoney, is Yandex.Money.  Using this service, you can pay for services, pay for goods purchased via the Internet, and make various payments online.  However, for starters, it’s worth learning how to fund Yandex.Money account. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to fund Yandex money account" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/339718.jpg" width="519"></div></h2><h2>  Methods for crediting funds to a wallet </h2><p>  The electronic money system offers several ways to fund your account.  Previously, prepaid cards were on sale, but at the moment they have already been canceled.  Currently, you can receive funds from other users of the system, deposit cash, <span>transfer money</span> from a bank card or other payment service.  Each of the methods offers several options, you just have to choose the most convenient. </p><p>  To begin, let's figure out how to replenish Yandex.Money through the phone.  Users claim that it is very convenient.  Judge for yourself: you can replenish an account in the system without leaving your home.  Moreover, you do not even need any payment cards, online banking or other <span>electronic wallets.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Telephone operators are meeting users of the Yandex.Money system </h2><p>  In order for funds from your mobile account to be transferred to an electronic wallet, you must be a Beeline, MTS or Megafon subscriber.  Naturally, it is necessary that your balance should contain the required amount, taking into account the commission that will be debited for the service.  So, how to replenish Yandex.Money via phone?  All that is required of you is to remember the short number and know your electronic wallet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to replenish Yandex money via phone" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/339714.jpg?1392880937244" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Each operator has its own numbers.  So, for MTS subscribers the short number is 112, for MegaFon - 133, and for Beeline - 145. Dial the following combination on your phone: * short number * Yandex-wallet number * necessary amount #.  Please note that this recruitment procedure is suitable for MTS and Beeline.  MegaFon subscribers must dial: * short <span>number * amount * account number</span> in the Yandex.Money system #.  After just a few minutes, the amount entered will be in an electronic wallet. </p><p>  But this is not the only way to replenish Yandex.Money through the phone.  Operators offer another option.  To do this, you need to poison the SMS with the account number in this electronic payment system and the transfer amount.  True, it is advisable to check the number with the operator - it has the usual federal format.  Please note that with any method of replenishment via phone, it is advisable to save all messages.  If the amount you specified does not reach, you can make a claim to the operator.  This will be the only proof that the attempt to replenish Yandex.Money via the phone was unsuccessful. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="replenish Yandex money via phone" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/339719.jpg?1392880967987" width="537"></div>

In this case, you will need to enter your phone number and amount.  After that, it will remain to confirm the payment by entering the code, which will come in the form of sms to the specified mobile number. </p><h2>  Fast and free payment methods at partner salons </h2><p>  If you don’t have enough money on your phone or don’t trust such payments, you can contact one of the nearest partner salons of this system.  Those are Euroset, Svyaznoy, Banzai, Alt Telecom.  In any of them, payments are instantaneous, and no commission is charged.  But the most popular are Euroset and Svyaznoy (due to the large number of stores in many cities of the country).  At the checkout you will be given a check, which will be a confirmation of payment.  True, here one should be vigilant and always check the electronic account number.  In the event of an error and crediting money to someone else's account, no one will return cash to you. </p><h2>  Bank Payments </h2><p>  Another place where you can replenish Yandex.Money is instantly and without any fees or interest, is the bank.  Rather, banks, because there are many of them in Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to replenish Yandex money" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/339715.jpg?1392881050247" width="435"></div>  The required amount can be paid in any of the departments of financial institutions connected to the "City" system.  Payments are instantaneous, banks do not charge commissions or interest from customers.  Also, without additional expenses and delays, you can replenish the account in such banks as “Acceptance”, “Levoberezhny”, “Sovkombank”, “Bank of Moscow” and a number of others, the full list of which is available to all Yandex.Money users.  On the official website you will find information about the location of all branches.  This will allow you to choose the place closest to your home or work where you can top up your account.  Just note that not all banks listed on the website instantly transfer funds, moreover, some charge a fee for their services.

Do not forget to pick up the receipt confirming payment.  If, after the set time has passed, the funds will not be credited to the account, you will have the opportunity to file a claim with the bank. </p><h2>  Self-service terminals: fast, cheap, convenient </h2><p>  Currently, an increasing number of active Internet users prefer to replenish their account without the participation of unauthorized persons.  So, the exchange functionality allows </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Replenish Yandex money through the terminal" class="if" height="287" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/339720.jpg?1392881106726" width="204"></div>  transfer money through the terminal.  It’s even easier to replenish Yandex.Money with this method: select the icon of this system on the screen, enter the account, enter the required amount and pick up the check.  The amount is transferred in most cases almost instantly, and for users this service is absolutely free.  Currently, there are several dozen names of terminal networks, a complete list of which can be found in the public domain on the Yandex.Money website.

      <p></p>
    <p>  Note!  The maximum one-time amount to replenish an account through a terminal cannot exceed 15,000 rubles.  Nevertheless, taking into account the number of such self-service systems, the popularity of the considered method is quite high. </p><h2>  Internet banking </h2><p>  If you don’t have a desire to figure out how to top up Yandex.Money via phone, or simply don’t have such an opportunity, and the prospect of finding the nearest bank branch or terminal does not appeal to you at all, do not despair.  There would be access to the Network!  If you have Internet banking connected to Sberbank, Alfa-Bank, VTB or any other financial institution that cooperates with the electronic money system in question, you can transfer money to your account without any difficulty.  In many of them, the default template is installed by default, choosing which you only need to enter your account and amount. </p><h2>  Bank cards </h2><p>  Even if you do not have an account in the Yandex.Money system, but you need to transfer funds to an electronic wallet, you can do this directly from the official website.  To do this, it is enough to have a Visa or MasterCard, the protection of which is provided by 3-D Secure technology.  If this condition is fulfilled, you can simply click on the "Replenish Account" button on the Yandex.Money website, and then enter the recipient and the amount.  At the same time, keep your credit card at hand - you will need its details.  It’s very easy to replenish Yandex.Money with a card, but this method has one small drawback.  Regardless of the amount of the transfer, a commission of 49 rubles will be deducted from you. </p><h2>  Replenishment from bank accounts </h2><p>  Currently, users of many countries can transfer currency to their own wallet in the Yandex.Money system.  Naturally, for this, they must have an account opened in one of the banks that conduct payments via the Internet.  On the official website of the said electronic system, select your country and the desired currency.  After clicking the button at the bottom of the form, you will be provided with the relevant details.  They will need to be indicated when making a payment in the Internet banking system. </p>

    <p>  The commission for making these payments can be found directly at the bank.  In some countries, payment is considered internal, so the overpayment is small, in others it goes as international.  In this case, the commission will be appropriate. </p><h2>  Financial constraints </h2><p>  Regardless of the way in which you decide to replenish your or someone else's account in the Yandex.Money system, be prepared for the fact that you can deposit only a certain amount at a time. </p><p>  When replenishing from a bank account, anonyms can deposit no more than 15,000 Russian rubles at a time, and up to 40,000 rubles - within a month.  The amount of a one-time payment for identified users is 100,000 rubles, monthly - 6,000,000 rubles. </p><p>  Using cards to transfer money allows you to withdraw no more than 15,000 per payment, up to 100,000 rubles per day and up to 200,000 rubles per month.  At the same time, you can write off currency no more than 15 times a day from Russian cards and up to 40 times a month.  For foreigners, a more stringent restriction is established: within one day - no more than 8 payments, during the month - up to 16. </p><p>  The use of Internet banking, payment terminals, transfer systems, cash desks of banks and partner salons allows you to deposit no more than 15,000 rubles at a time. </p><p>  An operation such as replenishing Yandex.Money via phone has more stringent limits on the amount.  Putting more than 5,000 rubles in this way is impossible.  Moreover, the commission, depending on the operator, will be from 8 to 12.5%. </p>

    <h2>  Service Features </h2><p>  Having dealt with numerous payment methods, many ask questions regarding the functional of the system.  From an electronic wallet you can withdraw cash, pay for various purchases on the Internet, transfer currency to other users, or make all kinds of city payments (the same utilities).  For example, you can pay by phone through Yandex.Money.  To do this, you only need to have the necessary amount in the account and know your mobile number, which must be entered when filling out a special form. </p><p>  Using the mentioned service is possible both in Russia and abroad.  Moreover, Yandex.Money offers its users a free plastic card that can be settled in ordinary offline stores.  By ordering it, you will only pay for shipping. </p>
