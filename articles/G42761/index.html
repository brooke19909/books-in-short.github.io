But there is a way out, because for this all kinds of parks and squares are broken.  But rare plants need to live somewhere.  And the Botanical Garden in Kemerovo is one of the best "houses" for them </p><h2>  History of occurrence </h2><div class="photo" data-original="ako.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemerovo Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2966510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/2966510.jpg"></div><p>  The Kuzbass Botanical Garden in Kemerovo began its existence on the New Year of 1992.  Its doors opened on December 28, 1991 and at first it belonged to the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences.  The floodplain soils of the Tom River were the best suited for the first ecological experiments, because there meadows rich in grasses spread on the swampy areas, overgrown bushes perfectly "got along" with small-leaved forests.  It was an ideal place to establish an environmental laboratory.  Under the strict guidance of the permanent leader of the professor, doctor of biological sciences Andrei Nikolaevich Kupriyanov, the 186-hectare botanical garden in Kemerovo lives and thrives. </p><h2>  "Residents" of the botanical garden </h2><p>  Since the foundation of the garden, residents and guests of Kemerovo have acquired and planted several hundred species of plants.  Only Siberian tree varieties grow here about two thousand.  Plants from milestones of continents are presented.  There are two greenhouses with representatives of tropical and subtropical flora.  Thus, entire collections of perennial herbaceous plants began to form. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For each group of flora in the Kemerovo Botanical Garden, individual conditions are created.  The climate is maintained thanks to modern technological advances and caring hands of people who go around the whole territory every day, trim, trim and treat plants, preserving the old generations of herbs. </p><div class="photo" data-original="novokuzneck.bezformata.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="green plants" class="if uuid-2966517" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/2966517.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, it is in the Kemerovo Botanical Garden that annually grow flowers and green plantings to decorate the city, which delight residents and its guests with bright colors and magnificent compositions from May to October. </p><h2>  Botanical Garden Relocation </h2><p>  A big event happened a few years ago - the botanical garden moved to Lesnaya Polyana from Kemerovo.  This is a satellite city a few tens of kilometers from the city.  Flora moved to better conditions for existence. </p><p>  It took builders almost a year to prepare the land for construction, to start and complete the project.  Now, outside the city, the Kemerovo Botanical Garden in Lesnaya Polyana has convenient parking.  Inside the garden is divided into zones for photographing, emphasis is placed on attracting the attention of both children and adults.  Children and adolescents, for example, have built an excellent selfie area.  Adults are attracted by the noise of the waterfall and the amazing atmosphere of pacification of the unique structure of local architects. </p><h2>  The future of the botanical garden </h2><p>  The founders, authorities and employees of the updated Kemerovo Botanical Garden have ambitious plans.  One of the most ambitious ideas is the construction of a magnificent greenhouse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Botanical Garden" class="if uuid-2966537" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/2966537.jpg"></div><p>  The Government of the Russian Federation has identified 40 hectares of Kuzbass lands for the construction of the Russian Disneyland, and the move of the botanical garden from Kemerovo is only the first step towards this goal.  In a year, it is planned to organize and open for visitors an artificial lake in the territory.  The paths to it will be connected with the main entertainment area. </p><p>  In the master plan for the arrangement of the ecological zone, there are other options for spending time and leisure for residents and guests of the city.  There will be a zone of various attractions, sports grounds for children and adults, and, of course, a contact zoo where you can not only take pictures with your pets, but also hold them in your hands or treat them to something tasty. </p>
