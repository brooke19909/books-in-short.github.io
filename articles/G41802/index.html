He wrote music for the cinema, which later became popularly loved and popular.  The name of Isaac Dunaevsky is heard by the older generation, since young people who are not related to music are rarely interested in the most talented composers of the past.  This man deserves to be remembered.  He lived an interesting and complex life, during which he created many amazing melodies. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Dunaevsky Isaac, whose biography begins on January 18, 1900, was born in Lokhvits (Poltava province).  The boy was born into the family of a Jew, Tsale-Yosef, who worked in a bank.  The baby's mother was called Rosalia.  Adults were fond of music.  Grandfather Isaac was a cantor, and his mother sang and played the piano in her youth.  In addition, the family had five more children who also became musicians.  Not all of them have achieved outstanding success, but I would like to single out Boris Osipovich, a talented choirmaster. </p>

    <h2>  Study </h2><p>  Little Isaac from an early age showed a craving for music.  When he was 8 years old, his parents paid him violin lessons with Grigory Polyansky.  Isaac Dunaevsky (a brief biography is set out in the article) in 1910 became a student at the Kharkov Music College.  There he learns to play the violin by K. Gorsky and composition.  Already in 1918, the young man graduated from high school and received a gold medal.  A year later, he became a graduate of the Kharkov Conservatory (studied under I. Akhron and S. Bogatyrev). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work </h2><p>  What is arranged to work Dunaevsky Isaac Osipovich?  His biography began with music, but can he in his adult life find application for his talents?  It takes about a year to find a job.  In 1919, he became accompanist and violinist at the Kharkov Russian Drama Theater.  Isaac quickly ascends the career ladder and a year later already works as a conductor and composer.  He combined this work with lecturing.  In addition, in his spare time, he led the amateur initiative.  Dunaevsky‚Äôs debut as a theater composer took place in 1920, when he wrote music for the sensational performance ‚ÄúThe Marriage of Figaro‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  In 1924, Isaac Osipovich moved to Moscow, where he worked first at the Hermitage, and then at the Satire Theater.  From 1929 to 1934 he lives and works in St. Petersburg.  The talented Dunaevsky becomes the main conductor and composer in the Leningrad Music Hall.  Together with G. Alexandrov, a famous Soviet film director, Dunaevsky creates the genre of musical comedy.  The first common work of the two masters was the movie "Jolly Fellows".  It was released only in the winter of 1934, but this did not prevent Dunaevsky from gaining wide popularity in certain circles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After that, they created three more films that had the same success: ‚ÄúThe Bright Way‚Äù, ‚ÄúCircus‚Äù, ‚ÄúVolga, Volga‚Äù.  Incredibly, during the period from 1934 to 1940, Isaac Osipovich wrote music for 16 (!) Films.  The most amazing thing is that they all became popular and received the love of the audience.  In addition to his main work, Dunaevsky also took a personal part in the dubbing. </p><p>  D. Shostakovich praised the talent of I. Dunaevsky, especially praising his overture to the film "Children of Captain Grant."  From 1937 to 1941, Isaac Osipovich was the head of the Leningrad Union of Composers.  At this time, he met in Mikhail Bulgakov.  They become friends, often talk and spend time together.  During the war, Isaac Osipovich traveled a lot throughout the country and spoke to raise the morale and morale of the population.

    <h2>  Family support </h2><p>  Isaac Dunaevsky, whose biography is filled with vivid events, quickly went to success not only thanks to his innate talent, but also due to the huge support from the family.  Throughout his life, he actively communicated with his brothers.  They were a support for each other and helped even when all the friends turned away.  Do not underestimate the role of the family in the formation and self-realization of man.  Dunaevsky Isaac, whose biography represents a rapid ascent to the heights of glory, is a vivid example of this.  The support and confidence of the brothers was complemented by the tender care of Sister Sarah. </p>

    <h2>  Isaac Dunaevsky: biography, personal life </h2><p>  We already know that our hero was successful and talented, but how were things going on the personal front?  In 1925, a young man marries the beautiful Zinaida Sudeikina.  In the marriage, the couple has a son, Eugene, who in the future becomes the capital's ‚Äúeasel painter‚Äù artist. </p><p>  Soon, a man falls in love with the ballerina of the Bolshoi Theater Zoya Pashkov and they have an uproar.  The boy Maxim is born.  He grows up as a very gifted child.  Over the years, Maxim Dunaevsky became a famous pop composer. </p><h2>  Creation </h2><p>  Dunaevsky Isaac, whose biography is the main topic of the article, made a huge contribution to the development of Soviet music.  He achieved his greatest creative success by composing light music for films.  Some fragments of the operettas of Dunaevsky can rightfully be considered full-fledged individual works.  A distinctive feature of his music was a well-developed melodic move. </p>
