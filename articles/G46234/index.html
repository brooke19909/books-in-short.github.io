It is also quite often used when knitting various decorative products and details. </p><h2>  Crochet Shoelaces </h2><p>  As a rule, tying the lace is easy.  But even with all the ease of the process, there are several options for crocheting lace. </p><h2>  The easiest way </h2><p>  This option is considered the simplest, as a regular chain of air loops fits here.  The ideal option is to use thick yarn or you can fold the thread in several layers.  So you can easily knit several plain or multi-colored shoelaces, and then connect them together, that is, weave them into a neat pigtail, twist together or tie a knot. </p><h2>  With connecting posts </h2><p>  This method will be a little more interesting.  The basis is the same ordinary chain of air loops, which is very easy to knit.  On this chain, you need to knit a series of connecting posts. </p><h2>  Double crochet </h2><p>  On a chain connected from air loops, you need to knit a series of columns with or without a crochet.  The end result is not even a crocheted lace, but a whole ribbon.  This will be ideal for a belt, for example, or the same straps. </p><h2>  Like a shoe cord </h2><p>  How to crochet a lace?  It is necessary to take the threads, namely several balls of yarn, and knit all the ends together.  An air loop is knitted from the first thread and then a second thread, a third and so on, are pulled through it.  We can say that the entire cord is knitted with air loops, but its appearance is significantly different from the identical cord, knitted with knitting needles.  Crocheted lace resembles a shoe cord.  And if you take several different colors of yarn, you get a real work of art. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Another way to knit lace </h2><p>  First of all, you need to dial three air loops.  Then knit a single crochet into the second loop.  The knitting fabric itself does not turn over.  A thread is stretched through the left loop and two loops on the hook are knitted together.  Next, the hook is inserted into the just knitted left loop, a thread is pulled through it and 2 loops on the hook are knitted together.  And so on until the desired length of the lace crocheted.  Everything is simple! </p><h2>  Master class: how to crochet a lace </h2><p>  To work in advance, you need to prepare: </p><ul><li>  thread for knitting; </li><li>  hook; </li><li>  scissors; </li><li>  great mood and, of course, inspiration. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="morezadumok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crocheted lace" class="if uuid-2306962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2306962.jpg"></div><p>  Crochet lace instructions are pretty simple.  The first thing to do is dial two air loops. </p><div class="photo" data-original="morezadumok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself crocheted lace" class="if uuid-2308098" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2308098.jpg"></div><p>  In the first of two air loops, a connecting loop is knitted.  So it turns out the first "link" of a knitted chain-cord. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="morezadumok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet lace master class" class="if uuid-2308101" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2308101.jpg"></div><p>  Again, you need to knit two air loops.  As in the previous step, the connecting loop is knitted in the first.  So the second link turns out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="morezadumok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet lace" class="if uuid-2308113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2308113.jpg"></div><p>  We continue to do such simple actions until the desired length is obtained.  Look how beautiful the lace is. </p><div class="photo" data-original="morezadumok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself crochet lace" class="if uuid-2308115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2308115.jpg"></div><p>  Once the desired length of the lace is crocheted, you need to turn around and knit three connecting air loops into a column.  How to do it?  The master class is accompanied by a photo that you can rely on when knitting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="morezadumok.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet lace" class="if uuid-2308119" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2308119.jpg"></div><p>  The next step will be knitting on the second side of the chain.  You need to knit a connecting column and two air loops.  Repeat until the very beginning of the chain. </p><h2>  Caterpillar lace </h2><p>  A detailed description of the work for those who are interested in the question of how to crochet the lace.  You can independently tie a caterpillar lace from absolutely any thread: silk, wool, cotton, blended.  The choice of yarn depends on the destination of the finished product. </p><p>  To work in advance, you need to prepare the hook and thread.  When choosing a hook, you need to understand that its number indicates the thickness - the higher the number, the thicker the hook.  From this it follows that the thicker the thread itself, the thicker the tool itself should be. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kolobok.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="selection of crochet hook" class="if uuid-2308335" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64787/2308335.jpg"></div><p>  As a rule, the recommended hook number is usually written on the threads to help the needlewoman.  The thickness of the finished lace directly depends on the thickness of the thread.  The finer the thread, the finer the lace. </p><p>  Below we will look at how to crochet the lace.  The master class will reflect all the subtleties of this simple matter. </p><p>  We collect two air loops - a working thread is thrown onto the hook.  It turns out something like a loop.  Then, in front of the loop, a yarn is made with a working thread.  A draped thread stretches on a hook through a loop - this is an air loop.  These actions are performed twice - so it turns out two air loops. </p><p>  Next, from the first air loop, you should knit a crochet.  A hook is inserted into the first air loop, a working thread is thrown on it.  From left to right, the threaded thread extends through the first loop.  Again, a yarn is made, which extends through both loops on the hook.  This results in a single crochet. </p><p>  So, the whole process is as follows.  Through the first loop on the hook, a thread is thrown by a movement from left to right.  Two loops remain on the hook, and the working thread is located on the left.  Once again, the yarn is made.  The draped thread stretches already in the usual movement from left to right through two loops on the hook. </p><p>  A threaded thread is drawn through the first loop on the hook.  Two loops remain on the hook, the working thread on the left.  Once again, the yarn is made.  The draped thread is stretched by the movement we are familiar with from left to right through two loops on the hook. </p><p>  Knitting rotates through the very 180 degrees, while the hook is motionless and remains in the right hand, while the working thread is also on the right.  A hook is introduced under the loop consisting of paired threads, and the working thread is carried out for knitting and throws on the hook.  On it, the result is a yarn, a loop of 2 threads and a loop of 1 thread.  The yarn is then stretched through a loop of two threads.  Again, a crochet that stretches from left to right through both loops on the hook.  Knitting rotates clockwise 180 degrees, the hook does not move, the working thread is still on the right.  We find a pair of loops, consisting of threads parallel to each other.  And we carry out all the steps listed above.  So we pick the desired length of the lace chain. </p><p>  After the crochet lace is ready, the working thread is cut and pulled together by a bundle.  With the help of a hook, the end of the thread can be hidden on a cord so that it cannot be seen.  You can hide the end of the thread in the seams if the cord will be sewn onto the product. </p><h2>  Advice </h2><p>  Knitting must be held with your fingers.  At first it may not be too convenient, but with practice your fingers will do it on the machine.  When knitting, the threads cannot be tightened too much. </p><p>  Started knitting clockwise rotates 180 degrees.  It should be borne in mind that it is knitting that rotates, and not the hook itself.  So, if the working thread was from knitting on the left, then after turning it should be on the right side.  On the turned knitting, you need to find a loop of two parallel threads and under it you need to squeeze the hook.  Next, you need to make a yarn - the working thread is held for knitting and throws on the hook.  This action will position the working thread on the left side of the knitting. </p><p>  A caterpillar lace will be an ideal option for finishing various products, as ribbons, strapless, ties, pens, and so on - which is enough for imagination. </p>
