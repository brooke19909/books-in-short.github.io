    <h2>  Cathedral of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul </h2><p>  The architectural ensemble has great historical and cultural significance.  Peter and Paul Cathedral was originally built of wood in 1375.  Bishop Yakov Buchatsky erected it from stone at the beginning of the 16th century.  In the second half of the 17th century, the cathedral passed to the Turks, who made it the main city mosque, adding a 36-meter minaret with 145 stone steps.  In 1756, when the church was again returned to the Poles, they installed a 3.5-meter statue of the Virgin Mary with a halo of 12 stars, she is the intercessor and protector of the whole region. </p><h2>  History of the Turkish Castle Bridge </h2><p>  None of the historians can name the exact age of this magnificent structure.  Castle Turkish bridge was designed by an unknown architect in ancient times.  It stretches across the Smotrych river, connecting the Kamyanets-Podilsky fortress with the Old Town.  The bridge was named Turkish because it was reconstructed in the 17th century, when the city belonged to the Ottoman Empire.  It leads to the Old and New Fortress - unique defensive structures of the era of feudalism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kamyanets Podilsky sightseeing tours" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/471570.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Stephen Bathory Tower </h2><p>  The seven-story large <span>defensive structure</span> is part of the Polish Gate complex.  The tower was built at its own expense by the Polish king <span>Stefan Batory</span> in 1564-1585, so it bears his name.  The construction is located on the gentle bank of the Smotrych River.  Since this is the most vulnerable place for citizens, the tower was a very significant part of the fortification system that protected the city from enemy raids.  In the XVII century, the construction of the furrier craft workshop repaired the building at its own expense.  In 1711, the Russian Tsar Peter I visited the tower, and in the 1780s commandant Jan de Witte renovated the structure, building it to seven tiers and attaching a rectangular-shaped building. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Peter and Paul Cathedral" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/471568.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The splendor of the Vrublevsky forest </h2><p>  At the confluence of the Dniester and Tarnava, a forest spreads in the hills, striking the guests of Kamenetz-Podolsky with its beauty and majesty.  This is a unique botanical monument created by nature itself, it occupies an impressive territory of 89 hectares.  The forest consists mainly of hornbeams and oaks, but there are also very interesting, rare specimens.  In the reserve you can see white sedge, on steep hills called tottra, orchids grow - ordinary nests. </p><p>  Not far from the forest is the village of Vrublevtsi, it is also of interest to curious tourists.  The fact is that in its place archaeologists discovered sites related to the Early Paleolithic period, that is, about 300 thousand years ago.  Thanks to the excavations, it was possible to find out that the settlements of the Early Tripoli, the sites of the Early Scythian period, the early Slavs, the inhabitants of Ancient Russia lived in the territory that Kamenetz-Podolsky occupies today.  The sights of these places amaze not only with their beauty, but also with antiquity.  It seems that here every tree, every pebble has its own story, full of mysteries and secrets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stefan bathory tower" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10530/471567.jpg" width="349"></div>

    <h2>  Bishop's castle </h2><p>  The ruins of the Chernokozinetsk castle are located near the river canyon.  The building was erected in the XIV century, and from the XV to the XVIII century in the warm season, local bishops lived here.  <span>Catholic priests</span> fortified and completed the castle.  Previously, Polish garrisons often stayed here, protecting the city from the attack of the Tatars.  Unfortunately, the wealth of the bishops constantly attracted attention to the castle of both Tatars and Cossacks, so the building constantly had to be protected from raids.  Catherine II also contributed to the history of the Chernokozintsevs. In 1795, the tsarina gave the bishopric possessions to Countess Litte, <span>Grigory Potemkin‚Äôs</span> niece <span>.</span>  The castle has a difficult fate, it constantly changed its owners, and world wars completely knocked it out.  From the once magnificent building, only ruins remained. </p><h2>  The most popular sights of the city </h2><p>  Kamenetz-Podolsky boasts many interesting places.  Sights, photos of which cause an unbearable desire to be in this picturesque region, amaze the imagination of adults and children.  The city has a lot of worthy architectural masterpieces.
