Last but not least, an increase in their number was ensured by new Chinese brands entering foreign markets.  The quality of their products can be different - everyone is united by a powerful hardware component and a low price.  The reliability of devices, however, often fails (judging by the reviews). </p><p>  However, the smartphone, which we will characterize as part of today's article, is a somewhat unusual market representative in this regard.  The thing is that this is a product of a Russian manufacturer.  And we are talking about Highscreen.  Read more about her, as well as about her phones, read on. </p><h2>  Brand Information </h2><p>  Most likely, you have not heard about such a company before because of its not so high popularity.  True, it has been on the market for a long time - since 2003.  Then, under the specified brand, laptops and accessories for them were produced.  Later, tablets began to be released under the name Highscreen.  According to the manufacturer, on the official website, their offspring - WebPad - was one of the first mobile devices released in the Russian Federation. </p><p>  The company introduced its smartphone only in 2009.  Then it was, of course, a device released by other developers, commissioned by a Russian company.  Seeing the success of such devices, Highscreen thought about their own production. </p><p>  As a result of such a decision, we can observe the Highscreen Power Five smartphone (reviews, specifications and other information about which will be presented in the framework of this article). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About phone </h2><p>  At first glance, the device does not differ from similar Chinese smartphones that operate on the basis of the Android operating system, which have sufficiently powerful characteristics.  Everything here is too ‚Äútypical‚Äù - a MediaTek quad-core processor, 1.5 GB of RAM, a display based on AMOLED technology, with the exception of one parameter - battery capacity.  This is surprising, but the developers managed to integrate a 5000 mAh battery into this device.  Accordingly, the smartphone is positioned not only as powerful, functional, productive or reliable, but as one that is able to maintain its performance over a long period of time.  In addition, the cost of the device is pleasing - about 16-18 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  Is this information about Highscreen Power Five true?  The reviews that we will provide below will show this.  In the meantime, we offer you a more detailed look at the characteristics of the main points regarding the smartphone. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The first thing, of course, I would like to describe the kit in which a mobile phone is offered to customers.  After all, if well-known manufacturers are more stingy, and new Chinese brands, on the contrary, are more generous in equipping their devices, then what will be our domestic developer?  Let's find out! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, first of all, let's examine the box in which the device is delivered.  There is nothing like that in it - ordinary hard cardboard made in a corporate style.  It shows the phone with design touches, and also has a manufacturer‚Äôs logo and the characteristics of the device are traditionally applied.  Opening the package, we find the complete set - the device itself and the accessories offered to it.  The latter include a headset, a cord for charging the device (consisting of two parts - an adapter and a microUSB cable), another shorter cord, as well as a cover-book with a transparent screen for viewing information on the device‚Äôs display.  As testimonials about <span>Highscreen Power Five reviews</span> indicate <span>, the</span> colors of the case, like the smartphone itself, are different.  For example, we came across a white modification. </p>

    <p>  A quick inspection gives the impression that the accessories are made at a high level.  At least, it can be said firmly about the case - working with it is quite convenient.  And in general, I would like to note that this is a pleasant feeling when the developer took care of the buyer, providing him with a basic set of add-ons for comfortable work. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Of course, in the direct work with the Highscreen Power Five Black Gray phone (reviews confirm this), the appearance of the model and its ergonomics are important.  Therefore, we will dwell on the design of the device in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As noted above, several color solutions are on sale - which pleases you with the choice of a phone that suits your style.  We managed to see the gray, black and white versions. </p><p>  In general, the appearance of Highscreen Power Five Black, the reviews of which we are interested, is of a classic ‚Äúsmartphone-brick‚Äù character.  The developer will not surprise us with anything new in the form of a device - except that the side frames are beveled to the rear, as well as the reduced space between the glass of the screen and the plastic of the model's case.  Due to the latter, the effect of an enlarged display of the model is created (when the latter does not light). </p><p>  The phone case is made of plastic, the texture of which is not so easy to determine: it is something between a gloss and a matte surface.  Along the perimeter of the device is a metal frame, also serving as an antenna.  It has the effect of grinding, which is why it is pleasant to hold the device in hands.  Even after prolonged use of the phone, there were no traces left on it, which is already pleasing. </p><p>  The back cover of the smartphone is removable, while made of polycarbonate.  After long use, handprints are invisible on it, just like fingerprints do not remain.  On it (in the center) there is a peephole of the main camera with a flash, immediately below which there is a company logo in a vertical orientation. </p><h2>  Placement of phone items </h2><p>  In general, the arrangement of keys and connectors is not much different from how it is implemented on many other devices.  Under the screen, on the front panel of the device, the hardware keys ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù are noticeable.  They are indicated by the applied icons, the highlight under them is not observed.  Highscreen Power Five Black Gray reviews suggest that this is a negative point, especially in the dark.  However, we are talking about three keys, the finding of which is already remembered on an intuitive level. </p>

    <p>  In addition to them, the device has a traditional ‚Äúrocker‚Äù for changing sound.  It is located in the upper part of the lateral face.  Directly beneath it was the power key and unlock the screen.  On the other side there is a gap for more convenient opening the back cover. </p><p>  Functional openings - a headphone jack and a port for charging the device - are located, respectively, on the upper and lower faces. </p><p>  As a small result, I would like to say that the appearance of Highscreen Power Five LTE Black (reviews confirm this) is quite attractive.  Despite the budget of the smartphone, in the process of working with it there is no suspicion of ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù of the manufacturer.  Everything is done at a fairly high level, which cannot but cause a pleasant experience for the user. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  According to the reviews available about the Highscreen Power Five LTE model, the device has a 5-inch screen with a special protective glass made in Japan.  The latter is covered, firstly, with an oleophobic layer, due to which finger sliding is facilitated when working with a smartphone;  secondly, there is an anti-reflective coating that eliminates the discomfort of interacting with the phone in sunny weather. </p><p>  The display resolution is 1280 by 720 pixels, which makes the picture quite clear.  Pixels on the screen, in particular, you will not notice. </p><p>  The display of the device supports up to five simultaneous touches - this is a good result for a mobile phone.  At least more is not required in practice.  As a result, it could be noted that the Highscreen Power Five Silver reviews have called the smartphone screen quite colorful and bright, despite the not very realistic tonality caused by AMOLED technology. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2>

    <p>  A clear pride of the developers of the smartphone is an indicator of the duration of its work.  This is not surprising, given such a capacious battery!  If the ‚Äúdry numbers‚Äù mean nothing to someone, here are some more vivid examples from life about how the Highscreen Power Five Silver White smartphone behaves.  Reviews indicate that the latter is able to hold out in active use for about 4 days!  For an Android device, this is, of course, a fantastic indicator.  It also means that in a simple, more moderate mode of operation, the device is able to work up to a week without recharging.  And now for comparison, remember how often you had to charge your previous device on this OS.  Most likely, the difference is obvious. </p><p>  Since we're talking about autonomy, I would like to mention one more feature that a 16 GB Highscreen Power Five smartphone has.  Reviews call it ‚Äúextreme mode‚Äù, and the essence of its action is to translate energy consumption to a minimum level.  In practice, it is represented by black filling all the icons and displaying the least amount of information.  In this mode, the phone can last up to 20 days without charging. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  The phone is universal, it has the ability to support the robot of two SIM cards.  You yourself know how much this is a profitable option that allows you to reduce mobile costs by several times.  In addition, it is also convenient with him, because the phone allows you to stay in access mode on two of your numbers at once. </p><p>  In addition to the GSM module, there is also Wi-Fi with Bluetooth.  The user will definitely not have problems with these data transfer formats.  In addition, as the reviews on Highscreen Power Five LTE Black show, the phone also supports fourth-generation mobile networks, providing the ability to surf the Internet at ultra-high speeds.  There is a special item in the settings that allows you to select the network in which the user would like to work. </p>

    <p>  And, of course, there is a GPS sensor for receiving information about the user's location. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It is not surprising that such a functional smartphone that supports many data formats requires a significant amount of internal memory to accommodate them.  And if we take a look at the technical characteristics of the gadget, it will become obvious that the manufacturers were striving for this. </p><p>  In particular, of the total volume of 16 GB free (immediately after the purchase of the device) were 12 GB.  This is enough for some minimal tasks and needs before the owner of the smartphone buys a card to expand the memory.  In turn, with its help, the capacity of the gadget can be increased by another 64 GB.  Thus, the Highscreen Power Five LTE Black smartphone (reviews confirm this) can be turned into a real portable entertainment center.  Add autonomy to this - and get a device you can only dream about! </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  As you might guess, the phone operates on the basis of the Android operating system common in the environment of such devices.  At the time of release, its current version was modification 5.0;  now, apparently, version 6.0 is available.  It is good that the Russian manufacturer keeps its products in step with the times, keeping up with all the updates released by Google. </p><p>  Although the OS is built on a bare Android system, you can see the additions made by Highscreen in it.  For example, this is the ‚ÄúChameleon‚Äù program, which allows you to determine the colors of the design after a picture is taken of the environment of the smartphone through the camera;  or you can call modified animations switching between applications in the background that cannot be seen on a ‚Äúclean‚Äù system.  But all this is present on Highscreen Power Five 16 GB (Gray).  The reviews indicate that users like the original approach of the manufacturer, and the design of the model interface really looks pretty. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with two cameras - the front one (which serves as an additional one, the main function of which is to create ‚Äúselfie‚Äù images and transfer pictures during video communication, as well as via Skype) and the rear (or main) one for taking any objects around.  Their technical characteristics are different, as well as the quality of the resulting images. </p><p>  So, the main camera has a matrix resolution of 8 megapixels.  According to the reviews related to Highscreen Power Five 16 GB, the quality of the images obtained as a result corresponds to the declared characteristic.  According to detail, the balance of colors and the saturation of the photo, you might think that they were made using ‚Äúapple‚Äù devices - the same iPhone 5 or 5S.  This is surprising, since most Chinese developers from the same price range indicate a resolution of 13 megapixels in the descriptions of their models, while in practice the photos were taken terribly even for 5 megapixels.  In the case of the domestic manufacturer of smartphones, things are different, which cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  The front camera makes photos a little worse, and also does not have a flash (unlike the main one).  But the picture conveys with a bang, despite the fact that it serves only for communication. </p><p>  The main camera is capable of creating HD video in high quality.  True, the reviews describing the Highscreen Power Five smartphone indicate an imperfect sound in such videos.  We also managed to find customer complaints about the insufficiently fast autofocus operation in this shooting mode. </p><p>  Our preliminary conclusion: for a model with such a price, the operation of the camera looks simply gorgeous. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The topic of what characteristics the Power Five processor has, we already slightly touched at the very beginning of our review.  Now back to her, to consider the main nuances in more detail. </p>

    <p>  So, you probably already know that MediaTek MT6735 is installed here - the quad-core ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the smartphone with a clock frequency of each at 1.5 GHz.  We know that other budget solutions launched in the Chinese market have the same equipment - for example, this is Meizu M2 mini.  With such characteristics, it is not surprising that the phone calmly reproduces any, even the most bulky (in terms of physics and graphics) game without any problems.  At least the most popular - Asphalt Urban and Real Racing - will go at the highest settings as smoothly as possible.  The same applies to a number of other applications in the first positions in the ranking of Google Play.  Such abilities allow you to turn Power Five into a gaming smartphone. </p><p>  Also, as the average review on the Highscreen Power Five phone suggests (in fact, we managed to identify this information in many recommendations), the model does not heat up at all, even when working with hard-to-load items.  Here, credit should be given to engineers who have taken care of this issue. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  It has already been noted that the gadget can play anything - any of the most popular file formats can easily open on the device. </p><p>  The developers initially took care not to give the user unnecessary trouble, and installed a player of their own design.  It is executed, it can be said, is quite convenient for working with musical compositions and videos.  There is a clear structuring of content, a quick search for files on the device, an equalizer, nice visualization of the application.  In addition, of course, you can install a powerful ‚Äúthird-party‚Äù solution, for example - the same VLC or MX.  With any of them, the set of supported files becomes even wider. </p><p>  A typical problem for budget devices - the low volume of the speaker - was not mentioned in the reviews.  Therefore, we conclude that the phone has good sound, which suits everyone. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  About the model, despite the very recent start of sales (and it was released in mid-2015), a lot of conclusions and conclusions have already been left.  The Highscreen Power Five Black Gray smartphone, the reviews of which we are most interested in the framework of this article, showed itself on the good side - all the advantages that we deduced from the analysis of technical characteristics, according to people's estimates, coincide with what the model is on practice.  From this it becomes clear why the phone is very popular among buyers. </p><p>  On the other hand, about the Highscreen Power Five Black smartphone the reviews are not only positive.  There are also negative characteristics that we should give within the framework of this article, since they describe the ‚Äúweaknesses‚Äù of the model.  And you need to know about them if you would like to purchase it.  In some ways they are petty, but even in such a situation they can create problems. </p><p> For example, this is not a reliable mounting of the sound adjustment button.  Buyers say that it should be placed on some more reliable mechanism, since for many it falls off.  Another drawback is the slippery back cover.  Still, on the go, immediately after purchasing the gadget, it‚Äôs not easy to notice;  but in the process of long work it is determined very easily.  Many complain that they can drop the device during a conversation precisely because of such a cover.  To avoid this, it must be replaced.  Another important problem is the location of the speaker at the rear of the device.  Due to this, the phone lies on it and loses stability, for example, when typing. </p><p>  There are many similar flaws - and all of them can not be physically eliminated, since users themselves could not determine which implementation format would suit them better. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  From the article, you found out information about the Highscreen Power Five LTE Black smartphone, including reviews.  This is a Russian product, which in its parameters and capabilities is very similar to Chinese smartphones from little-known brands.  At least, the filling of the phone, its low cost and positioning indicate the existence of such a similarity. </p><p>  There are also differences between Power Five and the Chinese.  For example, the domestic version has a high build quality, during which, again, good materials are used.  In addition, the hardware component of the model is optimized at a high level, which also allows us to talk about the reason to praise the developers of the device.  Given these factors, we can say that the phone really deserves attention from the buyer. </p><p>  On the other hand, of course, and he is not perfect.  The manufacturer‚Äôs strategy in some issues is controversial for the reason that the decisions by which it is determined are somewhat different from generally accepted practice.  For example, if a company excluded the backlighting of system keys under the screen, it violated the ‚Äúcanon‚Äù, according to which such a hint should be there.  And the people who bought the phone consider this another drawback, despite the fact that in everyday life they press these buttons intuitively, without thinking about their purpose.  And in fact there are many such moments. </p><p>  And the smartphone that has become the object of our review is a really high-quality device.  We wish the company continued prosperity and expansion of its production to global markets!  Moreover, the market potential is only increasing prospects. </p>
