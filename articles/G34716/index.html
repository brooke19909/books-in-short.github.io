    <p>  One of the main principles of knitting is the right choice of the required size of knitting needles.  Their diameter should be either the same as the diameter of the selected yarn, or one and a half times larger.  In this combination, the product will look neat. </p><p>  How to knit french <span>elastic with knitting needles?</span>  Will it be difficult to perform for those who are just starting to get acquainted with the art of knitting?  The knitting pattern is completely no difficulty.  You just need to be able to knit the front and wrong loops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Simple features </h2><p>  French gum has always been considered quite openwork, because both knit and purl loops are used to knit it.  Outwardly, it is immediately noticeable that it is very different from the gums familiar to everyone.  It is also called a "snake" or "corrugation" - because of the features of its application.  A distinctive feature are the purl loops, which are knitted in the reverse order. </p><p>  Another feature of such an elastic band includes the entire number of loops necessary for work.  As a rule, it should be a multiple of four.  This means that the total number of initial loops should be divisible by 4. The two edge loops must be remembered. </p><p>  Understanding how to knit a French gum with knitting needles is completely straightforward.  All the work is that you just need to alternate two rows. </p><h2>  Method number 1 </h2><p>  So, the French gum.  Its outline is very simple, perhaps even a little primitive.  It is performed by alternating a combination of front and back loops. </p><p>  In the first row you should knit like this: two wrong, two front loops.  Moreover, the front must be tied, capturing the back wall of the loops. </p>

    <p>  In the second row, the sequence will be as follows: one wrong side, two front ones (they also need to be tied to the back wall), one wrong side. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Continue work the same way, taking turns knitting the first and second rows. </p><h2>  Method number 2 </h2><p>  French gum in this way may be quite a bit more complicated than the previous one.  On the prepared knitting needles, you should dial as many loops as you could divide into three.  And one more thing: for symmetry, it will be necessary to add three more loops.  Thanks to this addition, the canvas will be more even.  It is necessary to knit and edge loops. </p><p>  If you knit in this way, then knitting even and odd rows will be slightly different. </p>

    <p>  The knitting of the odd row will be as follows: 1 wrong loop, the next loop is removed not knitted, the next loop knit, capturing the rear walls.  The odd row closes the wrong loop. </p><p>  Knitting an even row is as follows: 1 front, the next loop is removed without knitting, 1 wrong side, the removed loop is put on the knitting needle and sewn on the wrong side.  An even row is closed by the front loop. </p><h2>  What you need to know when choosing a French gum for knitting? </h2><p>  Before you decide on a pattern called "French gum", you need to understand a few features of the future product. </p><p>  Firstly, the density and directly the pattern of the elastic should be in accordance with the main pattern and type of fabric. </p><p>  Secondly, if the craftswoman decided to knit the fabric with circular knitting, then not all types of elastic bands are suitable.  Because some people have a picture, while others do not.  If we turn to the French gum, then it does not have a double pattern, which is why with circular knitting, he will not be able to convey his volume and beautiful pattern. </p><p>  Thirdly, the future thing should not be too stretched, because the whole picture will be lost.  French gum is primarily valued for its embossed structure, so if the threads are stretched, it will not be able to stand out. </p>

    <p>  So, we have mastered a new knitting.  Gum french <strong> </strong>  - what else can you say about her?  Yes, many knitters can say that she is not for them.  The pattern seems too complicated and confusing.  But, as practice shows, everything is not as scary as it seems at first.  The main thing is to alternate the loops correctly and not skip them.  This is especially true for loops that must be connected in the reverse order.  Such an elastic band can also be used when knitting voluminous sweaters and sweaters - their bottom and sleeves.  It turns out pretty interesting. </p><p>  Yes, the elastic is easy to use, but knitting it can take quite a lot of time - more than working on ordinary loops.  And all because the main knitting consists of two loops, which must not be done in turn, they change places, creating crossed buttonholes. </p><p>  Therefore, one should not refuse such a pattern, even if at first it seems too complicated.  With a certain patience, even a beginner in knitting can master it. </p>
