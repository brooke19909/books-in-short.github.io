Tilda dolls, bears, bunnies and seals became especially popular.  These toys were invented by a needlewoman named Tony Finger from Norway.  For a short time, they gained such worldwide popularity that on sale you can find not only finished handicrafts, but also materials, sets and patterns for such creativity.  In addition, the author of these dolls has written many books on their manufacture, which provide step-by-step instructions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilde bears" class="if" height="391" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/367005.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features and Features </h2><p>  To understand how Tilda bears are sewn, just look at their photo.  You can immediately consider such features: </p><ul><li>  slim figure; </li><li>  long legs with large feet; </li><li>  neat face. </li></ul><p>  These features are inherent in toys if Tilda bears are sewn from parts, but there is another option for their manufacture: when the body, legs and head are solid-cut, and only ears are sewn. </p><h2>  Material selection </h2><p>  In order for the toy to be designed in the right style, special attention must be paid to the choice of fabric.  Usually, for a Tilda bear sewn from details, they take a plain fabric of a light pastel shade, and for a whole-cut toy, material with different patterns is suitable.  Both clothes are sewn separately for both toys, which gives them a special charm and charm.  However, if instead of it, only a beautiful bow is planned on the neck from a satin ribbon, then for a fragmentary product you can take a patterned fabric. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="teddy bear pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/367037.jpg?1396636104305" width="386"></div>

It is this material that makes it possible to evenly fill even the most complex parts of the toy. </p><h2>  How to build a one-piece pattern </h2><p>  Tilda's bears are sewn according to special patterns that can be bought directly from their creator, but a huge number of craftswomen make them on their own, which does not spoil these lovely creations.  As already mentioned, you can consider the details either at the finished work or in a photograph and, observing the proportions set by the author, draw all the details.  The easiest way to build a pattern for an integral toy.  First you need to determine the growth of the future product, draw a midline, draw a slightly elongated head with a wide neck, immediately passing into the shoulders and paws.  The upper legs should not be too long, the stomach and the lower part of the armpits should go straight down, not tapering and not expanding.  Then the legs of a bear loom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a tilda bear" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/367035.jpg?1396636202853" width="375"></div>

The seam should pass along the line of symmetry of the muzzle through the crown and middle of the nape. </li><li>  The body is also an oval with a small neck and tucks from the front and back for a larger volume.  As a rule, this part is slightly narrower than the head and almost twice as long as it. </li><li>  Ears.  Each consists of two semicircles. </li><li>  Upper paws.

    <p>  As you can see, a ready-made ready-made pattern of a Tilda bear is not necessary for work, because if you experiment a little, you can create it yourself. </p><h2>  Assembly parts </h2><p>  How to sew a Tilda bear after all the patterns are ready?  To begin with, the resulting patterns are transferred to the fabric, give a small allowance for the seam, approximately 0.5-0.7 mm and cut out all the details.  Then proceed to processing all the workpieces.  The one-piece version can be sewn much faster than a bear from parts.  To do this, cut out the details by cutting with tailor pins and laying a seam at the same distance from the sections.  In places of rounding, cuts are made from the edge to the seam so that the product does not puff.  In the place of sewing on the ears, the seam is not laid, through this hole the product is turned out, filled with padding polyester, put in sections of the ears and finish the work with neat stitches. </p><p>  In the same way, all the details of the second version of the bear are sewn.  After all, they are assembled into a toy, turning the slices inside the parts.  Stitch the parts carefully so that coarse stitches and knots are not visible anywhere.  An opening is left on the head from the side of the neck, respectively, and from the side of the body, these two pieces are combined.  The paws also do not flash in the joints, the same applies to the ears of the toy.  All these seams are neatly closed at the time of manual assembly.  And for a wonderful toy to come out, all you need is accuracy and a well-built Tilda pattern. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda pattern master class bear" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13645/367060.jpg?1396636297011" width="419"></div>

    <p>  The master class ‚ÄúTilda Bear‚Äù of other craftswomen may be very helpful, but you can easily do without additional information and lessons.  It should be noted that after creating at least once such a toy, a lot of ideas will burst into your everyday life and will not allow you to live in peace.  You will want to create and create! </p><h2>  Textile toys in the interior </h2><p>  Any Tilda toy will easily fit not only into the interior of the children's room, but will also bring some romanticism and lightness to the decor of the living room or bedroom.  The main thing is that its color fits harmoniously into the interior, emphasizing the overall picture or standing out as a bright spot against the general background.  In addition, <span>coffee beans</span> or odorous herbs are often added to the filler of such toys, which makes them even more attractive. </p>
