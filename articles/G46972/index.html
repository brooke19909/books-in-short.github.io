Among them is the recreation center "Sperm Whale" (Rostov), ‚Äã‚Äãlocated in the city, on a picturesque corner of nature - Green Island.  The small remoteness from the center of the metropolis and the proximity of the Don River, and most importantly the few people, made this place very attractive for a weekend break.

    <p>  Judging by the reviews, guests really like the restaurant, built in the style of "bungalow".  Here you can taste European cuisine.  Many Rostovites come to Sperm Whale for business lunches and private meetings. </p><p>  On the territory of the recreation center there is a large swimming pool for adults and a separate one for children, around which there are comfortable sunbeds and sun umbrellas. </p><h2>  Rostov - the left bank of the Don </h2><p>  Zadonye, ‚Äã‚Äãas this site is called by local historians and historians, is the southernmost region, separated from the city by a river.  Unlike the right - the European part of Rostov - the left bank of the Don or Levberdon is already Asian.  It is considered the ecological "lungs" of the city.  And so there are a lot of recreation centers.  A series of former departmental pioneer camps, most of which have been reconstructed and turned into tourist complexes, are interrupted by modern recreation areas where you can sit in the gazebo and fry the barbecue. </p><h2>  Base "Blue Wave": reviews </h2><p>  Many of those who stayed at this place note primarily a large pool with sunbeds and sun awnings located around.  It is great to spend a sunny day off.  In addition, vacationers are invited to take a stroll along the Don River.  Educational routes and lunch on a boat cost around two and a half thousand rubles per hour.  Moreover, judging by the reviews, tourists themselves can determine the route, for example, staying in the Starocherkasskaya village.  For less active relaxation, the SPA area with a Finnish sauna and a bathhouse is excellent. </p><h2>  "Dream" </h2>

    <p>  Many positive reviews were left about the Dream complex, located in the village of Olginskaya, on the left bank, ten kilometers from the metropolis.  A small distance from the city allows tourists in just a quarter of an hour to be in the recreation center.  The number of exciting activities offered here is amazing.  This is an exciting paragliding, and quad biking, and exotic flying in a wind tunnel, and skiing or snowboarding with an air bag.  The most sophisticated athletes and extremals will love the variety of services offered here.  Children also find something to do, riding children's models of ATVs.  Vacationers are accommodated in a floating hotel.  There is also a cafe and restaurant.  After active entertainment, many people prefer to bathe and relax in the Russian bathhouse, available on the territory of the recreation center. </p>

    <h2>  "Chill" </h2><p>  Rostov, not far from which this entertainment complex is located, has always been considered a place where you can fully relax at any time.  On the vast territory of the base vacationers, judging by the reviews, feel free from the bustle of the city.  Cozy cottages with all necessary amenities, including air conditioning or heating (depending on the season), made this place quite popular. </p><p>  Especially a lot of positive reviews were said about the signature cuisine of the Kholodok base, combining several areas at once.  Especially the chefs manage the Caucasian food.  Here is a great place not only for relaxation, but also for wedding or corporate events.  Children are invited to a playground where they will not be bored. </p><h2>  "Aquarius" - recreation center </h2><p>  Rostov-on-Don has a very <span>large number of</span> places where you can have a great time.  There are so many of them that even the townspeople themselves do not know about the existence of some.  However, the recreation center "Aquarius" is not among the latter.  Judging by the reviews, many Rostovites have often spent time here.  The base is located between the Don and Koysug rivers, a kilometer from the highway to Bataysk. </p><p>  Here, on the shore of a stocked reservoir with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãseventeen hectares, there are gazebos for relaxing on a sandy beach.  There are also houses for rest, there is a sauna, a disco, a <span>summer cafe.</span>  Access to the recreation center must be made from the traffic police post. </p>
