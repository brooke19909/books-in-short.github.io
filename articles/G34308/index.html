  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D origami: create a gift yourself!</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  If you think that volumetric origami is just modules, then you do not know the whole truth about origami!  We will not talk for a long time about what a miracle this is, created by oneself and how pleasant it is to receive gifts from loving and caring people!  Although not: still a little about that too.  Why is there a flourishing of needlework right now?  After all, the gift industry is stronger than ever and offers a ton of any product for all occasions?  Here!  The answer is in the question itself!  It is the industry: the faceless mass of all "masipuseks" who live on the strength of a month.  You can buy them everywhere, the benefits of them are zero, and the donee knows the price of such gifts very well.  Now on.  In times of not very successful social.  the experiment was in short supply - and gifts such as tights, sets, etc. were very much appreciated.  Now everyone has this good in bulk, but no one has canceled the holidays, and I really want to understand on your favorite holiday that you really love ... So the well-forgotten old has returned - gifts with their own hands.  Hurrah! </p><p>  This is as an introduction.  And now - volumetric origami.  It can be represented by copyright models of snowflakes, balls and colors of different volumes and configurations.  Such crafts were made from ordinary sheets of paper, specially cut and bonded to each other.  Particularly beautiful balls presented on the forums are signed by the author and creator and are truly designer work.  If you have several of them, then you can create a unique interior in any room - and the room will immediately acquire individuality and comfort.  Folk craftsmen also learned to fold sheets of paper in such a way that volumetric inscriptions were obtained.  There are no size limits for origami art - therefore, theoretically, you can create an inscription on the entire wall.  Agree, your beloved (or beloved) will be pleasantly shocked to see your name, laid out in voluminous letters on the wall in the living room!  You can arrange individual cards in the same way.  There are no big secrets on how to make voluminous origami: you need to fold a paper sheet so that you get the volume (we learned this in kindergarten) and fasten the elements together.  Classical volumetric origami involves the creation of small masterpieces only from paper;  however, if you intend to use the product in the future as a toy, it is better to glue the elements together. </p><p>  Traditional volumetric origami involves the creation of figures from modules.  What is a module?  This is a square piece of paper folded in a special way.  It turns out a triangle, which can be connected to other same triangles using the grooves available in the module itself.  The manufacturing scheme of the module is simple, the problem is that you need hundreds to create a figure.  So, a volumetric origami swan requires from 500 to 1500 modules of different colors (or white - depending on which figure you are going to create).  Do not be alarmed!  Even a child can learn how to quickly fold a module.  And let the thought that such an activity is extremely useful for putting your thoughts and feelings in order be warmed up - it‚Äôs not in vain that in the East, voluminous origami is included in the rehabilitation program for heart attack patients.  Folding chains of modules and fixing them in a finished figure is already a pleasure!  Chains of modules hold perfectly - you can create bends of the desired configuration.  Before our eyes, the figure of a bunny, a dragon, a cow is created.  There are schemes of magnificent cakes made in the style of origami.  Nevertheless, it is the swan who remains the favorite, probably because the paper itself, so tender and fragile, meets our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthese magnificent and beautiful birds.  <span>A symbol of love,</span> tranquility, happiness - let the figure of a swan decorate your home as well, becoming a guard of harmony and prosperity for all who live in it! </p>
