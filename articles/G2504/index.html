    <h2>  early years </h2><p>  George Maximilianovich Malenkov was born in 1902.  His father was a small employee on the railway.  A rather interesting origin was Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov.  He was Russian by nationality, but his paternal ancestors once arrived in Russia from Macedonia.  The mother of the hero of today's story (shemekin‚Äôs girlhood) came from the middle class. </p><p>  In 1919, George Malenkov graduated from the classical gymnasium.  Although a relatively early period in the biography of this historical figure is not accurate.  Boris Bazhanov, who served as Stalin's personal secretary from 1923 to 1927, claimed that Malenkov had no secondary education.  The son of George Maximilianovich assured that his father successfully graduated from high school, then MVTU, and then was invited to graduate school, but refused, giving preference to party activities.  The second point of view is more believable.  After all, Stalin appreciated Malenkov primarily for his deep knowledge in the energy sector. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Work in the political department </h2><p>  In 1919, the hero of today's article joined the ranks of the Red Army.  What position did he hold?  In his autobiography, Georgy Malenkov wrote that he worked as a political instructor.  According to modern historians, he served as a regular clerk.  Georgy Malenkov never led fighters on the attack.  Moreover, he did not shoot well and kept his horse even worse.  His element was paperwork.  Thus, the revolutionary activity of Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov during the heroic years of the Civil War was reduced to writing and rewriting various papers. </p>

    <h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  During his studies, Georgy Malenkov met his future wife.  Valeria Golubtsova in the twenties held an insignificant position in the Central Committee of the RCP.  Marriage had a beneficial effect on the career of George Malenkov.  Golubtsova entered the graduate school of MPEI in 1936.  Subsequently, she took the post of rector of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Career </h2><p>  In the times during the first years of the political activity of Malenkov, Trotsky was very popular among young people.  First of all, the opposition platform was formed in the party cells of universities.  When she collapsed, Georgy Malenkov showed activity, which played a significant role in his future career.  He became one of the members of the student trust commission.  And soon he took the post of secretary of the party organization of the MVTU.  In this post, he gained the first experience of fighting the so-called enemies of the people. </p><p>  The zeal and activity of Georgy Malenkov did not go unnoticed.  On the advice of his wife, in 1925 he joined the Organizing Bureau of the Central Committee of the RCP.  And two years later he took the post of technical secretary of the Politburo.  According to historians, then George Malenkov was already a typical apparatchik.  He quickly turned into an unprincipled official, ready for anything for his career.  With enviable readiness, he complied with the instructions of the leadership and, above all, of course, the Secretary General.  And like every classic official, Malenkov did not have his own opinion.  And if it did occur at times, he did not express it. </p>

    <h2>  Fighting Dissent </h2><p>  In the early thirties, Georgy Malenkov strengthened his reputation as a statesman loyal to the ideas of communism.  This was expressed in a zealous struggle with dissidents.  In 1930, Kaganovich was elected "leader" of the Moscow Bolsheviks.  And he, in turn, instructed Malenkov to head the organizational department of the MK VKP.  In this position, the hero of our story achieved high results in the fight against "enemies of the people."  First of all, he conducted a thorough verification of the Moscow Party organization for the presence of oppositionists.  He revealed a lot of them, which earned the trust not only of his protege Kaganovich, but also of Stalin himself. </p><p>  The leader, meanwhile, was preparing the apparatus for more stringent cleanings.  Consequently, he needed new personnel.  When the question arose of who to appoint as head of the department of the leading party organs of the Central Committee, Stalin remembered Malenkov specifically.  At the new post, George Maximilianovich did not take independent actions, in all fulfilling the will of the Secretary General.  This not only positively influenced his further career growth, but, of course, saved his life. </p><p>  Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov, a Soviet historian and public figure, once called Stalin and Malenkov the creators of the CPSU.  In this case, the first - a designer, the second - an architect.  Autkhanov, according to later researchers, overestimated the role of Georgy Malenkov.  Although it is impossible to deny the influence of this politician on the day-to-day leadership of the party, and, therefore, the entire state. </p><p>  In the early thirties, Malenkov became close to Yezhov.  Under his leadership, he conducted another check of the Communists, which became a kind of rehearsal of the "great terror."  In 1937, most of the leaders of the Soviet apparatus were arrested.  Georgy Malenkov took a very active part in the fight against "enemies of the people."  He often attended interrogations of those arrested.  And in the silence of his office, he also led the repressions quite well.  Yezhov wanted to appoint him to the post of his deputy, but Stalin did not allow it: it was difficult to replace such a personnel specialist in the Central Committee. </p>

    <h2>  Member of the Supreme Council of the USSR </h2><p>  Only at the end of the thirties did Malenkov begin to leave secret offices in the open political arena.  He has been a deputy of the Supreme Council since 1938.  Gradually expanding the range of issues that Georgy Malenkov solved.  So, at the All-Union Conference, he made a report on the tasks of transport and industry.  At this time, he managed to take a strong position among Stalin.  Moreover, in this environment, if you do not take into account the opinion of Boris Bazhanov, he was the only person with a higher education.  In addition, he had an amazing memory and huge capacity for work. </p>

    <h2>  War years </h2><p>  During the Second World War, Georgy Malenkov often traveled to sections of the front.  In 1941 - to Leningrad and Moscow region.  In August 1942, Malenkov left for Stalingrad.  During this period, the aviation industry was under his control, he was responsible for the production of combat aircraft.  And in the fall of 1944 Malenkov plunged into the solution of the "Jewish question".  He devoted more than one report to the Kremlin on this topic.  In the last years of the war, Malenkov was most concerned about the issue of job restrictions for members of Jewish nationality. </p><p>  Malenkov first held the post of Secretary of the Central Committee for seven years.  In 1946, he was suspended for errors that were discovered in the production of aircraft.  Stalin sent the former secretary for two months to Central Asia.  This was a very soft punishment; Malenkov did not lose confidence in the leader after the exile.  In 1948, he again took the post of Secretary of the Central Committee. </p><h2>  Leningrad affair </h2><p>  Stalin personally entrusted Malenkov to identify the members of the anti-party group.  He tried his best to justify the confidence of the leader.  Malenkov accused the leadership of the Leningrad regional committee in undermining the foundations of the Soviet state.  He supervised the investigation of the ‚ÄúLeningrad affair,‚Äù and, out of old habit, was present at interrogations. </p><p>  In January 1949, the All-Russian Wholesale Fair was held.  Through the efforts of Malenkov, her leader - A. Kuznetsov - was accused of data fraud.  Crime, as it later turned out, was not.  But it was already impossible to establish the course of events precisely, because Malenkov destroyed almost everything that was relevant in the Leningrad affair. </p>

    <h2>  At the head of state </h2><p>  In the biography of George Malenkov there are many white spots.  Why did this politician, having worked in the state apparatus for many years, not be able to stay afloat?  In 1953, he actually led the country and became the first to criticize Stalin‚Äôs personality cult.  However, in 1957, Malenkov was removed from the Central Committee and appointed director of a thermal power plant in Ekibastuz.  Four years later, they were completely expelled from the party.  According to one version, the "comrades" did not forgive Malenkov's desire to solve important issues without their knowledge, the independence that he showed in the first years after Stalin's death. </p>
