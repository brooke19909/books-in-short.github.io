  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Soviet batteries. Description and features of use</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  I remember many times of the <span>Soviet Union</span> with a note of sadness.  Not only endless queues in stores, a shortage of goods, but also a free education, the opportunity to get housing by enrolling in the ‚Äúqueue‚Äù for it, today are surprising the modern generation.  If you ask what associations evoke memories of life in the USSR, many will name soda machines, ice cream for 1 kopeck, high-quality doctor's sausage, necessarily Elektronika cassette recorders and Soviet batteries. </p><p>  Today, the development of science and technology has gone by leaps and bounds, leaving behind the "modern technology" of the times of the Union.  But do not forget that it was these ‚Äúnew products‚Äù that served as the starting point for multifunctional and energy-intensive products, with which the market is now in abundance. </p><h2>  Gadgets from the USSR </h2><p>  A very important point in the image of adolescents and youth of the Soviet Union was the presence of portable devices.  Tape recorders were considered the main accessory in the company.  Arranging improvised auto-parties or just listening to popular music in the courtyard of multi-storey buildings was possible only with a power source. </p><p>  There were several <span>types of batteries.</span>  They differed among themselves by the manufacturer and appearance.  The principle of operation of the receivers and the set of functions were identical. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Square batteries" class="if uuid-3131471" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107427/3131471.jpg"></div><p>  The main ones were such radios: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  "Spring"; </li><li>  "Electronics". </li></ul><p>  Later, enterprising businessmen began to import tape recorders from Japan.  This equipment was much more in demand. </p><p>  Tourism was very common in the USSR, so Soviet-era batteries were actively purchased for flashlights.  Children‚Äôs toys, as well as measuring instruments, could not do without them. </p><h2>  What are they, batteries of the times of the USSR </h2><p>  There were several basic types of batteries: </p><ul><li>  316 elements; </li><li>  finger; </li><li>  element 343; </li><li>  373; </li><li>  Soviet square batteries 3336; </li><li>  "Crown". </li></ul><p>  Each species is distinguished by its size and application.  For example, small round batteries were used in flashlights.  They were called pocket dry battery and KBS. </p><p>  Soviet batteries, the photo of which is below, were the most popular. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Assortment of batteries" class="if uuid-3131472" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107427/3131472.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of batteries manufactured in the USSR </h2><p>  Medium-sized round batteries had a standard 1.5 V. Used for different devices.  Depending on the size, the batteries had different energy resources.  These were mainly flashlights and tape recorders. </p><p>  In the USSR there was not a large selection of goods, and on the shelves you could find only 3 main types: round, square and Kron batteries. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The round ones, in turn, were divided into small, medium and large batteries.  They are also divided into alkaline and saline, the first of which became the next generation and were in great demand. </p><p>  Varieties of batteries are associated with the release of lamps and tape recorders of a certain type.  The thing is that productive capacities were not flexible, and often had to be limited to what the giant plants produced. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Round batteries" class="if uuid-3131473" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107427/3131473.jpg"></div><p>  Batteries 6F22 or "Krona" and "Corundum" were produced with salt or alkaline.  The first type included: 6F22, 1604, 6R61, and the second 1604A, MN1604, MX1604, 6LF22, 6LR61. </p><p>  The name firmly stuck to such batteries, although the factory for their production was originally called that.  Coal-manganese batteries were the first to be produced in this size.  The main characteristics of the Krona (PP3): </p><ul><li>  9 volt voltage; </li><li>  dimensions 17.5 * 26.5 * 48.5 height / width / length, respectively; </li><li>  0.5 Ah; </li></ul><p>  A 3336 square square battery replaced three ordinary round batteries - 4.5 V, plus its use was that it had very convenient contacts.  It was only necessary to fasten the wire to the corresponding fields.  Thus, it was possible to provide illumination or lighting on the street, set in motion a baby car with a motor, or connect any device that meets the parameters.  Square or flat DC sources were used in various types of flashlights. </p><p>  On the shelves of radio electronics stores, customers were offered special cases in which three batteries had to be put in; they replaced the standard Krona. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Battery of the times of the USSR" class="if uuid-3131474" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/107427/3131474.jpg"></div><h2>  Use today </h2><p>  Krona batteries are still used today.  They are used in measurement technology, as a rule.  The advantage of this type of battery is its versatility and high power. </p><p>  In the world a huge number of analogues of Soviet batteries "Krona".  They are produced by: Duracell, Varta, Panassonic, GP and others. </p>
