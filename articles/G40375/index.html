These places of worship are considered one of the 7 wonders of the world.  The necropolis in Giza is very popular among tourists.  Near the pyramids of Chephren, Cheops, Mykerin is a giant statue of the sphinx.  This is a figure of a lion with a human face 20 meters high and 57 meters long.  It may seem strange, but in fact, a giant sculpture was reopened not so long ago.  For centuries, the great sphinx was heavily covered with sand and from a distance it looked like just another hill.

    <p>  Modern tourists can appreciate the grandeur and beauty of the statue in full, as today the contours of the sculpture are cleaned and restored.  A huge number of legends go about the purpose and riddles of this statue.  According to one version, incredible treasures and lost sacred relics are hidden inside the sphinx.  There are disputes about whose face has a half-animal, half-man.  A popular version, according to which the great sphinx has the face of Pharaoh Chefren, however, today it is not the only one.  Be that as it may, this gigantic figure is one of the country's signature attractions, and you should definitely see for yourself this wonder of the world with your own eyes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Giza pyramids.

    <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Great Sphinx" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1071570.jpg"></div>  The Giza Necropolis is considered one of the most famous in all of Egypt.  It is here that there is a large sphinx and three huge pyramids included in the list of ‚Äú7 wonders of the world‚Äù.  The tomb of Cheops is considered the highest, and the tomb of Chefren is the only one of all that boasts a fragment of the original lining.  The third tomb in the ensemble of the necropolis, in which Pharaoh Mikerin (Menkaur), who is the grandson of the legendary Cheops, found a place for his last rest, is relatively small in size, but at the same time boasts rich decor.  The height of the tomb is 62 meters, and the length of one side of the base is about 109 meters.  The pyramid was built in a big hurry, the pharaoh himself ordered to speed up the construction period, to use large blocks.  However, once it was an incredibly beautiful building.  According to some sources, <span>the Mykerin pyramid</span> description had the following: from the bottom and about 1/3 of the tomb was covered with red granite, above was a strip of white limestone lining, and the top was also red.  It is believed that the two-color pyramid remained until the Mamelukes were ruined in the 16th century.  The memorial temple housed a huge statue of the pharaoh and a whole collection of sculptures, many of which can be seen today in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.

Initially, it was a whole complex consisting of a pyramid, a temple, a false tomb, a corridor with a colonnade and some other buildings.  The dead city was surrounded by a high stone wall and a moat.  It is believed that it was incredibly beautiful here, in the courtyards there were growth statues and altars for worship.  Two burial chambers have survived to our days (completely identical, in one of them the pharaoh was really once buried).  Interestingly, both funeral rooms are located at a depth of 28 meters and are lined with pink granite.  Joser's <span>step pyramid</span> has six tiers, and below it is a network of tunnels connecting about 400 separate rooms.

It's hard to believe, but this locality exists today, however, its modern name is Luxor.  Like millennia ago, the city is divided into two parts by the great Nile: the kingdom of the living and the valley of the dead.  In both its parts, an incredible number of ancient buildings and religious buildings have been preserved.  Luxor and its environs have unique and simply very beautiful temples, huge statues, rich tombs.  It is in the local valley of the dead that the Tutankhamun pyramid is located, which has survived to modern times in preserved form.

However, the largest of them was the Karnak temple complex.  This is a whole city, divided into three parts, each of which "belongs" to a separate deity.  Today this attraction is considered the second most popular after the pyramids among tourists vacationing in Egypt.  Experts say that the construction of the complex began 20 centuries BC, and over the course of 13 centuries, each pharaoh completed something, the result was only 33 churches and halls.  There really is something to see: an alley of sphinxes, giant obelisks and statues, columns of the <span>Karnak temple.</span> </p><h2>  Edfu Temple </h2>

Initially, this religious building was dedicated to Horus, the son of the goddess Isis and Osiris.  This building was not found at its best, but thanks to the efforts of archaeologists and restorers, the structure was neatly cleared and restored.  The Arab Republic of Egypt has sights that are more famous and interesting than the Edfu Temple, but it is considered to be one of the best preserved to date.  At the entrance to the halls there is a huge statue of the Choir with a falconry head made of black granite.  Halls and a sanctuary are open for tourists - a room in which only priests and pharaohs could enter.

Abu Simbel is a provincial city in which it is difficult to find a decent hotel.  It is notable for its unique temples, preserved to this day in decent condition.  The city and the nearest religious buildings were erected at the very end of the era of the New Kingdom.  Temples in the rocks ordered the creation of Pharaoh Ramses II, and he dedicated the largest to himself.  On the facade of the shrine you can see giant statues of the gods: Amon, Ra, Ptah and Pharaoh himself.  The same figures were installed inside the church in the farthest hall, only Ramses II himself had the right to enter.  Nearby, also in the rock, the Hathor Temple is cut down.  These buildings are no less valuable than the pyramids or the Great Sphinx, today these ancient shrines are also protected by UNESCO as world heritage sites.  Abu Simbel is located in Nubia, 285 km south of Aswan.

    <h2>  Isis Temple on Filet Island </h2><p>  On the largest land area, washed by the waters of the Nile on the first threshold, a temple complex was built in honor of the goddess Isis - the wife of Osiris.  Once the island was called "Pilak" (literally translated - "extreme").  He is notable for the fact that the priests went on his trip to the Bige island, where, according to beliefs, Osiris found peace forever.  There they held various ceremonies and left gifts.  Today, the temple complex of Isis has been qualitatively restored and transferred to the island of Ajilkia. </p><h2>  Pharaoh's Village </h2>

    <p>  Pharaoh Village is a cultural and historical park located near Cairo - the modern capital of the state.  Here you can see the homes of rich and poor residents of Ancient Egypt and even visit the current temple.  Among all the buildings, representatives of different classes are engaged in their household chores: the actors are dressed ‚Äúin fashion‚Äù from the time of the pharaohs.  Of course, most of the buildings in the village of Pharaohs are only reconstruction, and not genuine monuments of architecture, but at the same time visiting the open-air park gives the greatest feeling of immersion in the ancient world. </p><p>  Every year, the Arab Republic of Egypt becomes an increasingly popular holiday destination.  Attractions can be found for every taste.  If time and opportunity allow, you can try to travel to several cities in one vacation. </p>
