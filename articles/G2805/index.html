  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Functions of commercial banks and their significance. The main activities of commercial banks.</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Bank is a structural unit of monetary circulation.  From a financial point of view, this organization acts as an intermediary in the flow of financial resources from lenders to borrowers and from distributors to consumers.  Banks are characterized by a double exchange and assumption of obligations of an unconditional type with a debt loan, which is fixed.  A commercial bank is part of the <span>credit system of</span> our country, which includes the Central Bank, <span>credit organizations,</span> as well as branches of foreign banks. </p><p>  Banks have an exceptional value, in particular, they can form means of payment and put them into circulation.  In addition, it is banks that carry out the withdrawal of funds from circulation.  Based on this, it should be noted that it is banks that lend to the economic sphere of the Russian Federation, improving its development.  The principles <span>of commercial</span> banks are that this organization operates within the limits of the resources encountered and in the circumstances of market relations with its clientele.  Thus, commercial banks realize their operations within the limits of the balance of money on <span>accounts of the correspondent</span> type of their own purpose.  The possibility of performing such a <span>type of activity</span> as the most important operations of commercial banks, of course, is present. </p><p>  Another thing is operations of a specific order, which recognize investment and mortgage.  The chances of such operations are strictly predetermined by the structure of liabilities.  This circumstance requires the organization of painstaking work on the choice of sources for creating their own resources.  Only a few banks can afford to operate within their own resources of attracted type.  These few credit organizations should have a high level of independence in the economic turnover of the Russian Federation, while ensuring their liquidity. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The functions of commercial banks are mediation.  These <span>functions of commercial banks are</span> defined in credit relations, stimulation of savings in economic activity, in payments between legal entities and in operations with securities.  In addition, there is no doubt that the functions of commercial banks are determined by the fact that these organizations, having a high demand for loans from the company, must mobilize savings in the economy and create high-order incentives for the accumulation of funds based on the restrictive policy of their current consumption.  Banks must maintain a deposit policy that adapts to today's realities.  Carrying out their activities in the form of a financial broker, banks carry out intermediary operations under agreements for the sale of securities at the expense and on the instructions of their principal.  The functions of commercial banks are also expressed in the directions of its activities. </p><p>  Thus, the bank conducts operations that are divided into two large groups - active and passive.  Passive operations determine the sources of funds and the nature of the bank's relations of a financial nature, operations to attract financial resources to banks, create their resources. </p><p>  Active operations are the activities of a bank aimed at making a profit and maintaining liquidity.  These types of <span>banking operations</span> include: deposits, loan operations, loan accounting operations.  Deposits are the money that was made to the bank.  They are stored in bank accounts and are applied in strict accordance with the banking laws of the country.  Together with deposits, you can see the growth of other bank liabilities - this is also borrowed money, but of non-deposit quality.  Their bank accepts in the form of loans or from the sale of individual debt obligations in the financial market.  These are, in general terms, the main operations of commercial banks. </p>
