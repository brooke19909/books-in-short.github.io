The Bashkirs were able to save their 12,000 rivers and more than 2,500 lakes from pollution, and the forests, which occupy 40% of the territory, from deforestation. </p><p>  Aushkul Lake is a source of mineralized water, and a place where thousands of pilgrims gather annually, as it is conveniently located at the foot of the sacred mountain Aushtau. </p><h2>  Lake location </h2><p>  A crack formed in the earth‚Äôs crust a long time ago became Lake Aushkul on the territory of modern Bashkiria (Uchalinsky District).  It lies in the middle of a rocky steppe two hundred kilometers from Chelyabinsk, 300 km from Yekaterinburg and 350 km from Ufa. </p>

    <p>  Places around it are sparsely populated.  Only one village of Starobayramgulovo is located nearby, and the nearest town of Miass is 40 km away.  Fishermen and pilgrims are well aware of Aushkul (lake).  How to get to this sacred place for the Sunnis by road, tell the signs and a map: along the Chelyabinsk highway to turn to Miass or Kasli, and then in the Uchalinsky direction to the city of Komsomolsky.  From it, turn right to the village of Starobayramgulovo, which is located on its shore. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Translated from the Turkic name of the reservoir means ‚Äútransshipment lake‚Äù, and it is associated with a pilgrimage to the sacred mountain Aushtau, located on its northwestern coast.  Before going up to the sacred relics, travelers made a halt on its shore, from where this toponym came from the lake, spread out on the plain, and not on the highlands. </p><h2>  Description of Aushkul Lake </h2><p>  A bowl of clear bluish-green water lies at the foot of Mount Aushtau.  This is Aushkul Lake.  Small in size, only 2 km long and 1.5 km wide, it is surrounded by a coast covered with small colorful pebbles.  If you do not spare the time to search, then among them you can find the famous Aushkul fawn jasper.  In the distant 18th century, vases were made from it for the nobility and the Imperial Palace. </p><p>  The infinity of Lake Aushkul does not shine, because the deepest places in it do not exceed 3 meters.  But this does not stop fishing lovers from leaving here with a good catch. </p><p>  Entering the basin of the Uy River, this lake was able to preserve a unique set of minerals in its composition, which puts it on a par with the healing hydrocarbonate-calcium-magnesium sources.  Its water is soft, and the river Chartadm and rains fill the lake. </p><p>  The only island of the lake has a mysterious feature: it constantly migrates over short distances, and the outlines in the shape of a heart give it romantic charm.  Scientists, deprived of sentimentality, give a prosaic explanation for this phenomenon, associating it with the fact that the island lies on a peatland, which is loosely fixed to the bottom, and it is carried by the winds in one direction or the other along the coast. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Aushkul Lake has become home to gray cranes and mallards, and in the small birch line near the shore, black grouse nest. </p><h2>  Rest on Aushkul </h2><p>  This lake has preserved its pristine appearance, purity and beauty due to the lack of nearby industrial enterprises and tourist centers.  Those who go to the Uchalinsky district to enjoy nature should be prepared that they will have to live among it in the literal sense of the word. </p><p>  The shores of Lake Aushkul are gentle, so finding a place for a tent is not difficult. </p>

    <p>  Those who can not do without the benefits of civilization can stop either 40 km from the reservoir in a hotel in the city of Miass, or ask for a wait at the locals.  The second option is very attractive, since the Bashkirs are incredibly friendly and hospitable people. </p><p>  Especially crowded in these places in the spring.  This is due to the fact that believers come to the <span>holy spring,</span> which beats only a month in a year on the top of Mount Aushtau.  According to legend, the decapitated saint Aulius himself climbed to the top of the mountain, where the Bashkirs buried him, and next to his grave he scored a spring with healing water.  By summer, it dries up and completely disappears until next spring. </p><p>  Knowing its healing properties, pilgrims climb to the top of the mountain (645 m) to get water, and to bow to the grave of St. Aulius. </p><p>  Also regulars of the lake are fishermen, knowing about its rich in fish waters. </p><h2>  Fishing on the lake </h2><p>  Those who fished in these places are familiar with the spectacular sight, when in the first rays of the sun in the expanse of water the reflection of Mount Aushtau becomes visible.  This is what Lake Aushkul looks like at dawn.  Fishing in it is especially good from the east coast. </p><p>  Numerous bonfires are equipped here, and mushrooms are found in a nearby forest.  The slope of a small hill that looks down to the eastern shore of the lake looks no less attractive.  Fans of berry picking will enjoy the slope overgrown with strawberries. </p>

    <p>  The lake waters abound with bream, roach, perches, pikes, rips, carps, gold and <span>silver crucians.</span>  You can fish both from the shore and by boat.  Spinning will require depth for fishing, so you need to either carry a boat or rent it from local fishermen. </p><p>  Unfortunately, poaching is frequent on Lake Aushkul, which leads to the shredding of fish and a decrease in its number.  Therefore, even with a large catch, the weight of the fish is rarely impressive. </p><h2>  Attractions near the lake Aushkul </h2><p>  No matter how clean and attractive Lake Aushkul is, there are more equipped recreation places in Bashkiria for this, therefore, the local population is associated with this region, first of all, with the shrines located on Mount Aushtau. </p><p>  At the top of it are burials, revered not only by the Bashkirs, but also by all Sunnis.  In one grave lies the remains of an Arab sheikh, as evidenced by an ancient inscription on a memorial plate.  Nearby are buried saints Aulius and Divan. </p>

    <p>  The energy of the mountain peak has been recharged for many centuries by the pilgrims' belief that the desires made near these graves will certainly come true, to which there are numerous confirmations.  Despite the fact that the path upstairs is quite steep, and it is difficult for elderly or unprepared people to pass it without rests, the path to the shrines does not overgrow with grass.  A tree growing near the graves stores thousands of ribbons on itself - these are the desires of the pilgrims. </p><h2>  Tours to Aushkul </h2><p>  When the weather on Lake Aushkul favors, which is especially often in the summer, paragliders and lovers of jeep tours come here. </p><p>  The former are attracted by the beautiful view of the lake from a bird's eye view, while the latter awaits an 80 km path from Miass with relaxation near the lake and climbing the holy mountain. </p>

    <p>  Travel agencies also offer relaxation to those who are used to acting on the road: day trips around the lake on ATVs and bicycles, with the conquest of the hillsides, will be a great opportunity to actively relax and test yourself for endurance. </p><h2>  Aushkul Lake today </h2><p>  Something must remain unchanged in this world, such as sunrises and sunsets.  So the lake Aushkul should be untouched by civilization.  The silence, beauty and holy energy inherent in this place should continue to give rest to the human soul. </p>
