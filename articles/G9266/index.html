Rest in Beregovo, Transcarpathia: reviews and photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The city of Beregovo (Transcarpathia) is located in the lowlands of the most mountainous region of Ukraine.  This is a small town.  Its ancient history goes back to the time of Roman settlements.  And unique mineral springs attract visitors from all over the country. </p><h2>  Colorful historical background </h2><p>  To make local features a little clearer, you should at least superficially familiarize yourself with the history of the city.  About the settlement of the Romans, located on the site of modern Beregovo (Transcarpathia), is known from the works of Papaya Paris Ferenc, who lived at the end of the XVII century.  This statement did not find unequivocal support among scientists, but it has been documented that after the death of the Hungarian king Beilo I, this part of the land passed to his youngest son, the Duke of Lampert.  And in 1063 he founded a settlement here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coastal Transcarpathia" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469659.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As usual, along with the official version, there is also a beautiful legend about the foundation of the city.  According to ancient legends, a shepherd named Sas watched his flock in that area.  At some point, two huge strong bulls did not share something and began to fight with each other.  Unable to calm the animals, the shepherd only watched them from afar. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fight was fierce.  Opponents dug the ground with blows of powerful hooves.  In the end, whirling in one place, they dug a whole hole, at the bottom of which was a treasure.  The story is silent about what happened to the bulls themselves.  But the shepherd, in the joys of the wealth that had fallen on him, built a temple on the river bank with this money.  And already around the temple the city gradually grew.  Thus, the pious foundation of the city is glorified in legends. </p><p>  The border town was constantly raided by the Polovtsians, who slowly exterminated the indigenous population.  To strengthen this defensive point, in 1141 the Hungarian king invited the Saxons to the city, giving them trade privileges. </p><p>  But already in 1241 the Tatars practically razed Beregovo to the ground.  However, the city still revived and even received royal status.  Soon after, German and Italian masters were invited here to develop winemaking. </p><p>  For a short time Beregovo was under the rule of the Transylvanian prince, and in 1687 it became part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. </p><p>  In 1919, the Romanians began to rule here, but soon the city was given to Czechoslovakia.  With the outbreak of World War II, Beregovo was again ruled by Hungary.  However, due to the defeat, this territory was given to the USSR.  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Beregovo (Transcarpathia) ended up in Ukraine. </p><h2>  Modern culture </h2><p>  It is easy to guess that such a historical ‚Äúcocktail‚Äù left its mark on the culture, traditions and cuisine of this region.  But, to the credit of the locals, the impression is that they absorbed only the very best. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Residents of Transcarpathia are famous for their hospitality.  If you make friends with a local resident, and he invites you to look at his tea, this tea will be accompanied by an laid table, akin to a small wedding. </p><p>  You will notice that in Beregovo (Transcarpathia) they are very tolerant of representatives of a different nationality, religion and race.  For centuries, people have become accustomed to living side by side with each other, not trying to cut everyone under one comb.  They honor their traditions, but respect strangers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in coastal Transcarpathia" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469674.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Local dialect </h2><p>  Most of the local residents from childhood speak fluently in three languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Ukrainian, Russian and Hungarian.  Moreover, when talking in the family circle in one sentence words from all three can coexist comfortably.  But, in addition, Transcarpathia has its own special language, which is not even understood by residents of neighboring regions. </p><h2>  Hungarian cuisine </h2><p>  The motives of local dishes are more reminiscent of traditional <span>Hungarian cuisine.</span>  If you are going on vacation in Beregovo (Transcarpathia), be sure to try them.  In the usual menu there are many delicious meat dishes, generously seasoned with spices, paprika and onions. </p><p>  And to drink a hearty lunch or dinner is an upscale local wine.  You can buy wine from the local Chizay brand wine company or try real home-made wine, which in Transcarpathia is made by the residents themselves in almost every yard of a private house.  After all, the grape harvest is excellent here from year to year.  And winemaking traditions have been passed down in families from father to son for centuries. </p><h2>  Unique thermal springs </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="coastal Transcarpathia thermal springs" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18960/469675.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><p>  No matter how bright the local flavor and no matter how exquisite taste the traditional dishes and wine differ, this is far from the main reason why you should visit Berehove (Transcarpathia).  <span>Thermal springs</span> with unique healing properties are what attract tourists here. </p><p>  There are only four such sources on our planet in only four places: in Iceland, on the Kuril Islands, in New Zealand and, in fact, in Transcarpathia. </p><p>  The word ‚Äúunique‚Äù does not at all imply any miracles or panacea for all diseases.  But the mineral composition of water really has pronounced healing properties.  Naturally, to feel the healing effect, it is not enough to plunge into the water once.  It is necessary to undergo a whole course of treatment, preferably not less than ten days.  By the way, it is not recommended to be in water for more than two hours a day. </p><h2>  Rest in the sanatorium </h2><p>  Those who plan to heal in comfort should take a ticket to the sanatorium.  Berehove (Transcarpathia) has a health complex "Lark" with several pools.  A full-fledged sanatorium is located nearby in the village of Kosino. </p><p>  The baths in Kosino in terms of mineralization are the same as in Beregovo, and even larger in size.  Water is supplied from wells that are located at a depth of more than a kilometer.  Before serving in the pools it is cooled, since the temperature of the source itself is 55 degrees Celsius. </p>

    <p>  In each pool, the temperature is different - 24, 32, 36 and 38 degrees, so you can choose the most comfortable water for yourself.  The water mineralization rate is around 24 percent.  This is a very high content of minerals.  Among them, hydrogen sulfide, sodium, iodine, potassium, iron and fluorine predominate. </p><p>  This combination has a beneficial effect on the nervous system, activates the processes of the immune system and perfectly affects the joints.  Also, taking mineral baths will help reduce pain in arthritis, make you forget about radiculitis for a while, and even help restore kidneys. </p><p>  And although a course of treatment is required to obtain long-term results, all visitors are unanimous that the effect is felt even after a single procedure. </p><h2>  Rest "savage" </h2><p>  Even without a ticket to the sanatorium, you can safely go for health in Beregovo (Transcarpathia).  The private sector here will provide services no worse than any official complex. </p><p>  Local residents have long been accustomed to provide services at the level of modern guesthouses.  Moreover, the payment here is surprisingly gentle, especially compared to the promoted resorts. </p>

    <p>  Arriving at the sources, you can easily find housing for yourself.  Most often it will be a separate annex in a private house.  But you can rent a full-fledged guest house, built specifically for tourists. </p><p>  You can come to the sources at any time of the year.  Although the pools are located in the open air, the heat of the water is enough to feel comfortable in it. </p><p>  So if you have the opportunity to come to Transcarpathia, be sure to use it and get to know this amazing land personally. </p>
