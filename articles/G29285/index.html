    <p>  The accession of Siberia is still in the center of attention of historians and causes a lot of controversy, including among members of the public. </p><h2>  The Conquest of Siberia by Ermak </h2><p>  The history of the conquest of Siberia begins with the famous <span>campaign of Yermak.</span>  This is one of the atamans of the Cossacks.  Accurate data on his birth and ancestors does not exist.  However, the memory of his exploits has reached us through the centuries.  In 1580, the wealthy merchants of the Stroganovs invited the Cossacks to help them protect the property from constant raids by the Ugrians.  Cossacks settled in a small town and lived relatively peacefully.  The bulk were <span>Volga Cossacks.</span>  In total there were a little more than eight hundred.  In 1581, a campaign was organized with the money of the merchants.  Despite its historical significance (in fact, the campaign marked the beginning of the era of the conquest of Siberia), this campaign did not attract the attention of Moscow.  In the Kremlin, the squad was called simple "bandits." </p><p>  In the fall of 1581, a group of Ermak plunged into small ships and began to sail up <span>the Chusovaya River,</span> up to the very mountains.  Upon landing, the Cossacks had to clear their way by chopping trees.  The coast turned out to be completely uninhabited.  The constant ascent and mountainous terrain created extremely difficult conditions for the transition.  Ships (planes) were literally carried on hands, because of the continuous vegetation it was not possible to install skating rinks.  With the approach of cold weather, the Cossacks set up camp on the pass, where they spent the whole winter.  After that, rafting on <span>the Tagil River</span> began <span>.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Siberian Khanate </h2><p>  The conquest of Siberia by Yermak met the first resistance from the local Tatars.  There, practically beyond the Ob River, the Siberian Khanate began.  This small state was formed in the 15th century, after the defeat of the Golden Horde.  It had no significant power and consisted of several possessions of small princes. </p>

    <p>  Tatars, accustomed to a nomadic way of life, could not well equip cities or even villages.  The main occupations were still hunting and raids.  Warriors were mostly equestrian.  As weapons used scimitars or sabers.  Most often they were locally made and quickly broke.  There were also captured Russian swords and other high-quality equipment.  The tactics of rapid horse raids were used, during which the riders literally trampled the enemy, and then retreated.  The foot soldiers were mostly archers. </p><h2>  Cossack equipment </h2><p>  Cossacks Yermak received modern weapons at that time.  These were gun powder and guns.  Most Tatars had not even seen this before, and this was the main advantage of the Russians. </p><p>  Near modern Turinsk, the first battle took place.  Then the Tatars from the ambush began to shower the Cossacks with arrows.  Then the local prince Yepanchi sent his cavalry to Yermak.  Cossacks opened fire on them from long guns and cannons, after which the Tatars fled.  This local victory made it possible to take Chingi tour without a fight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The first victory brought the Cossacks many different benefits.  In addition to gold and silver, these lands were very rich in Siberian fur, which was highly valued in Russia.  After other service people learned about the prey, the conquest of Siberia by the Cossacks attracted many new people. </p><h2>  Conquest of Western Siberia </h2><p>  After a series of quick and successful victories, Yermak began to move further east.  In the spring, several Tatar princes united to repel the Cossacks, but were quickly defeated and recognized the Russian government.  In mid-summer in the modern Yarkovsky district, the first major battle took place.  Cavalry Mametkula launched an attack on the position of the Cossacks.  They sought to quickly draw close and crush the enemy, taking advantage of the rider in close combat.  Yermak personally stood in the trench, where the guns were located, and began to fire on the Tatars.  After several volleys, Mametkul fled with the whole army, which opened the passage to Karachi for the Cossacks. </p><h2>  Arrangement of occupied lands </h2><p>  The conquest of Siberia was characterized by significant non-combat losses.  Difficult weather conditions and a difficult climate caused many diseases in the camp of forwarders.  In addition to the Russians, there were also Germans and Lithuania in the Ermak detachment (the so-called immigrants from the Baltic). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  They were most susceptible to diseases and most difficult to tolerate acclimatization.  However, in the hot Siberian summer these difficulties were not, therefore, the Cossacks advanced without problems, occupying more and more territories.  The captured settlements were not plundered or burned.  Jewels were usually taken from the local prince if he dared to set up an army.  Otherwise, he simply presented gifts.  In addition to the Cossacks, settlers participated in the campaign.  They walked behind the warriors along with the clergy and representatives of the future administration.  In the conquered cities, fortresses were built right there - wooden fortified forts.  They were both a civil administration and a stronghold in the event of a siege. </p>

    <p>  Conquered tribes were taxed with tribute.  Its payment was supposed to be followed by Russian governors in prison.  If someone refused to pay tribute, he was visited by a local squad.  In times of great uprisings, the Cossacks came to the rescue. </p><h2>  The final defeat of the Siberian Khanate </h2><p>  The conquest of Siberia was facilitated by the fact that the local Tatars practically did not interact with each other.  Different tribes fought among themselves.  Even within the Siberian Khanate, not all princes were in a hurry to help others.  The greatest resistance was the Tatar <span>Khan Kuchum.</span>  To stop the Cossacks, he began to assemble an army in advance.  In addition to his squad, he invited mercenaries.  These were Ostyaks and Voguls.  Among them met and know.  In early November, the khan led the Tatars to the mouth of Tobol, intending to stop the Russians here.  It is noteworthy that the majority of locals did not render any significant assistance to Kuchum. </p><h2>  Decisive battle </h2><p>  When the battle began, almost all the mercenaries fled the battlefield.  Poorly organized and trained Tatars could not resist the battle-hardened Cossacks for a long time and also retreated. </p>

    <p>  After this devastating and decisive victory, the road to Kishlyk opened before Yermak.  After capturing the capital, the detachment stopped in the city.  A few days later, representatives of the Khanty with gifts began to arrive there.  Ataman received them cordially and talked kindly.  After that, the Tatars began to voluntarily offer gifts in exchange for protection.  Also, everyone who knelt down was obligated to pay tribute. </p><h2>  Death at the peak of fame </h2><p>  The conquest of Siberia was not initially supported from Moscow.  However, rumors about the success of the Cossacks quickly spread throughout the country.  In 1582, Yermak sent a delegation to the king.  At the head of the embassy was the ataman‚Äôs companion, Ivan Ring.  Tsar Ivan the fourth gave a reception to the Cossacks.  They were presented with expensive gifts, among which were equipment from the royal forge.  Ivan also ordered to assemble a squad of 500 people and send to Siberia.  The very next year, Yermak subdued almost all the lands on the Irtysh coast. </p><p>  The famous chieftain continued to conquer uncharted territories and subjugate more and more nationalities.  There were rebellions that were able to quickly crush.  But near the Vagay River, Yermak‚Äôs squad was attacked.  Having caught the Cossacks by surprise at night, the Tatars managed to kill almost everyone.  The great leader and Cossack chieftain Ermak died. </p>

    <h2>  Further conquest of Siberia: briefly </h2><p>  The exact burial place of the chieftain is unknown.  After the death of Ermak, the conquest of Siberia continued with renewed vigor.  Year after year, new territories subordinated.  If the initial campaign was not coordinated with the Kremlin and was chaotic, then subsequent actions became more centralized.  The king personally took control of this issue.  Well-equipped expeditions were sent regularly.  The city of Tyumen was built, which became the first Russian settlement in these parts.  Since then, the systematic conquest continued with the use of the Cossacks.  Year after year they conquered ever new territories.  In the cities taken, the Russian administration was placed.  Educated people were sent from the capital to do business. </p><p>  In the middle of the 17th century, a wave of active colonization took place.  Many cities and settlements are founded.  Peasants from other parts of Russia arrive.  The population is gaining momentum.  In 1733, the famous Northern Expedition was organized.  In addition to conquering, the task was also to explore and discover new lands.  The data obtained were later used by geographers from around the world.  The end of the annexation of Siberia can be considered the entry of the Uryakhan Territory into the Russian Empire. </p>
