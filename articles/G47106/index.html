Here every street and every house breathes history, and many tourists rush here to look at the beautifully preserved antiquities, surprising with their perfection. </p><p>  Tancici dum, not related to ancient architectural masterpieces, still impresses with its unconventional style.  An unusual house, located right in the heart of Prague, appeared in 1996 on the ruins of a building destroyed during the war.  The president himself closely monitored the project, which was approved by him.  Creative-minded architects created an amazing design reminiscent of the famous dance duo of D. Rogers and F. Aster.  That part of the unique structure, which expands upward, symbolizes the male figure, and the second curving tower visually looks like a woman with a thin waist. </p>
