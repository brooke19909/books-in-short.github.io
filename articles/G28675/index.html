  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to skate properly so that progress is tangible</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before talking about how to skate properly, you need to stop at choosing the skates themselves.  This is important, because in any sport a lot depends on the inventory.  Skates should be comfortable, fit and fit the leg tightly.  And you need to pay attention not only to the size, but also to the completeness of the boot.  If it is too narrow or wide, it is fraught with injury and rapid wear of the skates.  During the fitting you need to wear those socks that are designed for riding.  Only if the skates sit well on the leg and fit the ankle tightly will it be easier to control and steady progress in skating will be outlined. </p><p>  The next important point is how to properly tighten the skates.  They should not be laced too tight so as not to disturb the blood circulation.  It is necessary to tighten so that the leg does not turn inside the boot, and the toe and heel are not separated from the insole.  It is advisable to tighten the boot to the place of the bend of the foot, at the fold, securing this fragment with a simple knot.  The upper part of the lacing should not be too tight, so that if necessary, you can freely squat.  It is believed that if the skates are tightened correctly, it is impossible to stick a finger under the laces. </p><p>  Understanding how to skate properly will come directly on ice.  However, theoretical knowledge will give confidence when you first go to the rink.  Of course, at first the movements will be absurd and awkward, but gradually the information that has been deposited will come up in your head and the process will go faster. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first rule to remember is that your legs should be slightly bent.  As with skiing and snowboarding, straight legs will inevitably lead to falls.  In order to start moving on ice, you need to bend your knees slightly and bend forward.  This pose helps to balance on the ice and maintain balance.  Then the supporting leg should be turned sideways to the outside, and push off with it.  The second leg begins to move, and the entire weight of the person is transferred to it.  The movement is carried out by alternating pushing legs.  The scheme is quite simple: we start, pushing off with the left foot, drive on the right, then push off on the right, and drive on the left, and so on.  No need to start and try to ride in parallel set skates - this is very exhausting, but does not give any results. </p><p>  In addition, you must remember how to brake properly on skates.  There are several methods of braking, and it is better to choose the most suitable one directly at the rink.  You can push the free leg forward, turn it with an edge to the direction of movement and rest against the ice.  Or, conversely, put one foot back, perpendicular to the second.  The second method is easier for beginners, but provides slower braking.  The easiest way to slow down, bringing both skates together and sharply turning them perpendicular to the direction of movement.  In general, it is not as difficult as it seems at first glance, the main thing is not to accelerate much at first in order to avoid emergency situations.  After the fall, you first need to kneel, and not try to get up, pushing with your hands behind. </p><p>  Speaking of how to skate correctly, it is worth mentioning the most common mistakes made by beginners.  This is riding <span>on straight legs,</span> riding on parallel or, conversely, widely spaced legs, and trying to push off the front of the skate.  It is advisable to avoid these actions, which lead to a waste of energy and slow down progress. </p><p>  In general, the main thing is to train, since you can learn how to skate correctly only on ice.  As a rule, after the first falls and awkward movements, the first successes come, and after a few hours spent on the ice, self-confidence appears. </p>
