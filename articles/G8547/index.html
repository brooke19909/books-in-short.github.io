By the way, recently a very large-scale event was held here in honor of such an event as the birthday of the Victoria Hotel (Chelyabinsk), which is celebrated on September 19 every year.  A huge number of comments were left about this celebration in Runet, testifying to an unforgettable holiday. </p><p>  As for the reviews about the hotel itself, they are also quite positive.  The guests of the complex claim that Victoria is an excellent hotel with friendly staff, whose representatives always respond quickly to any customer requests.  The rooms here are large and clean, as well as comfortable, but sometimes there is a smell of dampness in the bathrooms. </p>

    <p>  Regular visitors of the hotel write that in different rooms of the same category there are slightly different conditions: somewhere there are excellent bathrobes and high-quality slippers, while somewhere the bathrobes resemble something disposable, but there are no slippers at all.  Other inconsistencies are also noted: sometimes there are 3 or 4 towels in the room for one person, and there are situations when there are only 2 of them. Of the advantages of the complex, people distinguish a pool, sauna and gym, as well as a high level of service. </p><p>  In conclusion, we note that often there are reviews indicating monotonous breakfasts and very high prices for drinks in the minibar, but this can also be attributed to the little things. </p>
