    <h2>  The most economical rooms </h2><p>  It should be noted that the Emotions By Hodelpa 4 * hotel (Dominican Republic) offers guests apartments at prices quite reasonable for this level of service.  The most economical option is the so-called superior rooms of 30 square meters.  m </p><p>  They are stylish soundproofed apartments with one huge king-size bed and floor-to-ceiling windows.  Inside, there is everything necessary for comfort: a widescreen TV, a safe, a climate system, ironing facilities, a trempel, a minibar, a coffee machine, a dressing room and even an alarm clock.  Naturally, there is a bathroom with a shower, hairdryer and other hygiene items. </p><p>  How much does it cost to stay in such a room?  In June, 7 days for two people will cost about 60-65 thousand rubles (including all inclusive).  But in addition you will have to pay a <span>tourist fee</span> (18% of the amount) and city tax (10%). </p>

    <h2>  Luxury apartments </h2><p>  Also in the fund of the Emotions By Hodelpa 4 * hotel (Dominican Republic) there are so-called club Essential rooms.  They are decorated in a more elegant style and have all the previously mentioned amenities.  But, in addition, these apartments have access to a private pool and a private entrance to the room.  Also, people who book them are guaranteed access to the executive lounge.  They are also provided with slippers and bathrobes.  And the beds, by the way, in such rooms are elongated (more than 2 meters). </p><p>  The cost of these apartments, of course, is higher than that mentioned above.  7 days will cost two guests about 100-115 thousand rubles. </p><p>  By the way, all issues related to the view from the window must be decided in advance, even when booking.  Not all windows offer sea views.  There are rooms with garden and pool views.  Therefore, if this aspect is fundamentally important, it is necessary to indicate the wishes in the reservation specially reserved for this when booking.  But you need to consider that apartments with sea views are usually more expensive than others. </p>

Not only those travelers who were counting on a peaceful stay in a quiet and secluded place are not very satisfied.  This is not here.

Everything is incredibly tasty, so the all-inclusive service is fully justified. </p><p>  Naturally, no one leaves without attention the amazing view from the windows of the apartments.
