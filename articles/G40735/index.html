    <p>  A prerequisite for the full use of this advantage is regular (within the billing period) depositing the principal amount of the debt on the card (which, as a rule, is indicated in the monthly bank statement).  As a rule, the typical settlement period at VTB 24 is from the 1st to the 20th day of the month.  The minimum amount in question is usually 10% of the principal.  By the way, the same figure is used in calculating the so-called minimum payment - the total amount of money that the client must deposit on the card monthly on account of the principal debt, and interest that accrues after the grace period. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  What can the bank offer? </h2><p>  The "classic" VTB 24 credit card is the most common type of plastic from this financial institution.  It is quite simple in design, minimum requirements for the borrower.  The credit limit on this card is on average 300 thousand rubles, the interest rate is about 19% per year.

This product combines the functions typical of any credit card, and also provides many bonuses that you can use when buying airline tickets from Transaero.  In particular, these are points that an air passenger can spend on upgrading a seat class (from ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù to ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù).  The credit limit and rate are approximately the same as for the "classic" card.  The annual cost of servicing a credit card is 900 rubles, but in the first year the bank allows you to use it for free. </p><p>  There is a prestigious Golden Card in the VTB 24 line of credit cards.  It is intended to emphasize the fact that the client is a wealthy person.  This card provides certain bonuses when servicing in hotels and other service points in many countries of the world.  The credit limit of the "Golden Card" is higher than that of the "classic" and "Transaero" - 600 thousand rubles.  The interest rate is slightly lower - an average of 18% per year.  True, for such a pleasure the client will have to pay a substantial amount as part of the annual service - 3 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  A level above the Golden Card is a Premium card.

    <p>  The most solvent customers can get a VTB 24 credit card called Platinum.  The credit limit for it reaches 2 million rubles.  Annual servicing - 30 thousand. The bank promises to holders of such a card an individual approach to servicing and a quick solution to a number of possible problems.  For example, if the card is lost, the bank is ready to replace it as soon as possible or to issue funds at the expense of the credit limit. </p><p>  Among the additional loan products is the ‚ÄúMy Terms‚Äù card.  According to it, the client can get a number of useful services, take part in insurance programs.  True, the credit limit for such cards is modest - within 150 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The so-called grace-period when VTB 24 does not charge interest on all cards for using the credit limit - 50 days. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  VTB 24 credit card can be issued through a visit to any office of this financial institution.  Previously, with all the conditions, as well as information on the necessary documents, can be found on the official website of the bank.  A preliminary decision regarding an application for a card can be obtained by a customer by filling out an online form or by submitting their data to a call center specialist via a toll-free telephone. </p><p>  VTB 24 Bank may, once having made a preliminary decision on the basis of an online application or one made by telephone, no longer carry out any additional checks of the client‚Äôs solvency.  That is, if the borrower has received consent, then when he comes to the bank‚Äôs office, then all that needs to be done is to sign the necessary documents and get a card shortly afterwards. </p><h2>  What does the credit limit depend on? </h2><p>  The maximum credit limit indicated in the description of cards is not guaranteed by the bank.  But the more likely it is to get access to it, the more acceptable for the bank are such characteristics as the client's age, place of work, length of service, salary level, as well as information from his credit history. </p>

    <p>  The standard formula for calculating the maximum credit limit is its size should not exceed 300% of the monthly salary (or other confirmed income) of the client.  The validity period of credit cards is usually two years. </p><h2>  Checking balance </h2><p>  VTB 24 Bank has developed several convenient options for checking credit card balances.  Among them is the Teleinfo system (or Telebank).  As part of it, several channels are involved - the Internet, telephone, SMS messages.  Through one of them, the client can perform several useful operations, such as, for example, ordering a bank statement for a certain period, find out the loan debt.  Also, in some cases, it is possible to obtain a bank deposit through Teleinfo.  It‚Äôs easy to activate this service - just call the bank‚Äôs contact center and then give the card number, code word and answer a number of possible additional questions from a specialist. </p>

    <p>  For a small monthly fee (usually within 50 rubles), the client can activate the SMS-informing service.  Using your phone, you can manage your account and even pay for some types of services. </p><p>  There are also ‚Äúclassic‚Äù balance checking schemes - through an ATM or in a bank office.  An important point: VTB 24 does not charge a fee when checking the balance at an ATM, but other lending institutions can do this.  When you visit the office you will need an official client identification card. </p><h2>  Who can get a credit card? </h2><p>  If, say, some US banks are ready to provide banking services related to loans to non-residents of the country, then a VTB 24 credit card can only be issued to residents of the Russian Federation.  The minimum age of a client for processing bank products related to loans is 21 years.  Borrower solvency is the most important criterion for VTB 24.  A credit card, the terms of issuance of which are prescribed by the bank fairly transparently, is issued to those borrowers who have a regular income, preferably due to work executed according to the Labor Code. </p>

    <p>  Credit history is also an important criterion for making a positive decision on issuing cards.  If a client is too loaned or has systematic delays in repaying loans, including those issued by other banks, then the chances of getting a credit card can be significantly reduced.  Many borrowers leave, trying to get a product such as a VTB 24 credit card, reviews where they say that the bank refused because of a bad credit history. </p><h2>  Insurance </h2><p>  For the majority of loan products, VTB 24 offers insurance for the event of disability.  There is also an option in which a credit card is insured against illegal access (however, only a certain amount is subject to compensation, a typical interval is 20-150 thousand rubles).  The Bank regularly offers discounts on the execution of policies.  Their size, which can reach 10-15%, depends on what type of card, what are the conditions of the insurance program. </p><h2>  Promotions, special offers </h2><p>  The credit card of VTB 24 Bank is a product that may be of interest to customers by virtue of the ability to receive, on a fairly regular basis, various prizes and bonuses, as well as use interesting special offers.  All these privileges are granted to customers due to the cooperation of the bank with retail chains or service centers, quite often - online stores.  As a rule, the condition for receiving certain bonuses is that the customer makes purchases in partner organizations. </p><h2>  Partnership programs </h2><p>  Let's look at examples of how VTB 24 Bank cooperates with various companies to provide its customers with favorable bonuses and purchases.  Among the popular programs of such a partnership is interaction with the OZON online store.  Bank customers making purchases using VTB 24 credit cards in this online market can count on a 7% discount or accumulative points that can be used for subsequent purchases.  Within the framework of the Mobile Bonus program, VTB 24 customers who use Beeline communication services benefit.  They return part of the money spent from the subscriber balance back to the card.  Many Russians, of course, want to get a VTB 24 credit card and at the same time a number of useful privileges from popular suppliers of services and goods. </p>
