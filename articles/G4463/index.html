    <h2>  How the Plane Alley (Sochi) appeared </h2><p>  It is known that in the East this tree, which there is called a plane tree, plays a symbolic role.  It means longevity and success.  One of the Muslim legends tells that in one city there was a plane tree, which turned one thousand years old.  And once there was an earthquake.  A worried emir asked the local rulers if the plane tree was intact.  They answered yes, but the disaster destroyed the House of Allah (the mosque).  To which the emir said that the most important thing is a plane tree, because any building can be restored.  But such an ancient plane tree is not within the power to resurrect Allah himself.  Once, back in the nineteenth century, these places were occupied by a poplar alley.  But it was cut down under the pretext that trees interfere with the laying of telephone wires.  People began to resent.  And so the city headman of Sochi at the beginning of the twentieth century decided to plant the then Craft Lane with plane trees.  This was done by the gymnasium.  The plane-tree alley (Sochi) was opened in the spring of nineteen thirteen, and the event itself was dedicated to the centenary of the Romanov dynasty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Plane Alley Address" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572782.jpg" width="533"></div>

When the city was reconstructed under Joseph Stalin, the alley was preserved.  In the fifties of the last century, it was decided to renovate Kurortny Prospekt, turning it into a large highway.  The alley was not in the project at all.  But the architect Metelev managed to keep it as part of the street.  Interestingly, at times May Day demonstrations were held here and government stands were even established.  In the seventies, the large Kurortny Prospect was once again repaired, and the sidewalk was laid out with beautiful colored tiles, like boulevards in Rio de Janeiro.  The plane-tree alley (Sochi) received the official status of a monument of landscape gardening art.  It was then that it was decided to turn the alley into an entertainment recreation area.  Armenian engineers developed the project of the Singing Fountains, which then became fashionable.  They decided to create something similar to the complex built in Yerevan, which was implemented. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi Plane Alley Stop" class="if" height="368" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Black and white stripes of history </h2><p>  But the alley also had bad times.  So, in 1993, when a heating main was laid, the roots of some trees were destroyed, and new plants had to be planted.  Several times plane trees suffered from storms and hurricanes.  And ten years later they found that many trees are affected by a fungus and can even fall on people walking.  Therefore, many plane trees planted by the gymnasium students of Tsarist Russia are no longer there.  But be that as it may, the Plane Alley (Sochi), the photo of which you see as an illustration, remains a place where both locals and many vacationers who come here on vacation love to walk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi plane tree alley photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572775.jpg" width="600"></div>

Its official address is Kurortny Prospekt.  This is not surprising, because, again, this pedestrian street is part of a large highway.  You can come here either by bus or by minibus.  Public transport stops at numbers nineteen, seventeen and twenty five.  Minibuses such as 100, 104, 105 and 120 pass by the alley. By the way, it’s only in common parlance at the exit they say: “Plane Alley stop”.  Sochi in its transport registry does not have such a name.  In fact, the stop is called "Singing Fountains."  This attraction is visited during many sightseeing tours of the city.  And nearby are hostels and apartments of different price categories. </p><h2>  Description and feedback </h2><p>  Now the length of the alley is about two hundred and fifty meters.  There are currently planted sixty plane trees.  In addition to them, the avenue is also decorated with laurel cherry, boxwood, palm trees.  Platanians are often popularly called "shameless."  The fact is that they throw off the bark from themselves, as if exposed.  The oldest plane trees are more than a hundred years old, and the diameter of some of them exceeds one and a half meters.  Esplanade connects the park with the promenade.  The size and beauty of these trees with maple-like huge leaves and fruits resembling tennis balls impress tourists.  They write that a walk among the plane trees is very relaxing, leading to joyful and pleasant thoughts and dreams.  Nearby are many shops and cafes.  Vacationers like to walk here in the heat, but in the evenings the alley is very crowded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Singing fountains Sochi plane tree alley schedule" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1572740.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  Singing Fountains </h2><p>  This decorative structure is a peculiar monument of the era.  Simply put, they are a pool where water jets erupt under pressure.  There is a special lighting equipment.  Many watercourses and technical devices make it possible for jets to sing and dance.  In addition, the fountains are equipped with special lighting effects.  They were built during the arrangement of the Trade Gallery.  In two thousand and nine, the fountains were renovated and decorated with beautiful mosaics.  Now they are a single structure with the restaurant "Rice" closest to them.  Attraction address: Singing Fountains, Sochi, Platan Alley.  They have a summer schedule, they work not only in the season, but also in the evenings, when the light and music effect is best achieved. </p>
