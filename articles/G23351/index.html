After the official ban on smoking in public places, a wave of popularity of new devices came.  Electronic devices are less harmful to health and also easy to use.  The manufacturer offers reusable devices that can be filled with different liquids and create a unique taste. </p><h2>  What does it look like? </h2><p>  The device is made of leatherette, however, genuine leather and other materials can be used on an individual order.  At the top and bottom of the device are metal plates with the brand logo.  If it is connected to the network or the user inhales smoke, one can notice a beautiful illumination of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prom.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Harmless smoking" class="if uuid-3149675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3149675.jpg"></div><p>  A mouthpiece with a metal tube is screwed into the upper part of the plate.  The main feature of the hookah is the presence of two cartridges.  The manufacturer provided for the possibility of their joint use.  One cartridge is enough for one and a half thousand puffs (according to the users of this device).  Before using an electronic hookah, it is necessary to remove the protective cap and screw in the replaceable element. </p><h2>  Characteristics </h2><p>  The company managed to combine ergonomics, convenience and mobility in the electronic Starbaz hookah.  Devices have a modern design, and the taste - the special splendor of a true hookah.  Products are presented in different colors.  The brand produces an original device, the length of which is 38 centimeters and a mini analogue that fits easily in the palm of your hand.  It sounds very cool, but there are extremely negative reviews on the Internet.  Electronic hookah does not smoke, is bitter, sits quickly - this is a small part of what users tell about the device.  This is largely due to the falsification of products. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to distinguish a fake </h2><p>  In our country, fakes are quite common.  However, there are some secrets that allow you to determine the original device.  Many scammers assure customers that the goods arrived directly from the United States.  However, the original devices are manufactured in a closed factory in China.  You should pay attention to the cost, since the price of an electronic hookah is at least 4,500 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.worthpoint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Electronic hookah" class="if uuid-3149676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3149676.jpg"></div><p>  Each original device is accompanied by a warranty card.  On the device should be patent number 1014 and the inscription RoHS CE.  The next secret is that the light at the bottom should match the color of the hookah.  Original devices are qualitatively and beautifully packed, and cartridges are in polyethylene. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Starbaz electronic hookahs are manufactured by Square, an American company, and then sells products under its own brand.  In the market of the CIS countries, in Russia and the Baltic countries, the organization sells devices through the official distributor of Eskew Siegz LLC, which has the relevant certificates and documents for the products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ecvv.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Color options" class="if uuid-3149682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3149682.jpg"></div><p>  The production uses aviation aluminum, which is characterized by high strength and resistance to external damage.  Many users have appreciated the design of the device, as it differs from other mass products for smoking.  This is not surprising, since the company has thoroughly studied user preferences for many years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Public opinion </h2><p>  Many reviews report that cartridges are easily replaced in the device, and charging takes no more than 3 hours.  The device has the ability to combine several tastes, which is confirmed by positive reviews.  Electronic hookah makes users feel like they are smoking an expensive portable cigarette.  Many people say that Starbuzz has the widest range of flavors.  Users like the excellent smokiness of the device, which allows you to relax and distract from problems. </p><h2>  Significant flaws </h2><p>  Some reviews report poor cravings and chemical smack.  Others talk about the fact that the market can easily run into a fake.  Many argue that the electronic hookah E-hose Starbuzz is almost impossible to find in our country.  Some reviews report that Starbaz is very bitter if you do not change the cartridges for two days.  Given that their cost is at least 600 rubles, the use of the device is quite expensive for users.  The device has an original socket for recharging, so in case of breakage it is difficult to find a replacement. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dhgate.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Device complete set" class="if uuid-3149680" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3149680.jpg"></div><p>  Electronic hookah reviews get controversial.  The opinion of users agrees that with prolonged smoking, the taste of glycerol appears.  Judging objectively, the only reasonable observation is the high cost of Starbuzz electronic hookahs.  Judging by the feedback from users, it does not please everyone.  Some argue that the original Starbaz costs at least $ 200 (12‚Äì13 thousand rubles).  Many say that the price of electronic hookah is very high when compared with analogues of other manufacturers.  Therefore, even lovers of newfangled smoking appliances do not quite understand why to pay more.  Despite the fact that the electronic hookah E-hose Starbuzz appeared on the market as a revolution in the world of smoking, reviews report that this device is more like an ordinary portable cigarette. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Many note that Starbuzz electronic hookah compares favorably with similar devices.  Users like the good taste, mobility and ease of use.  The electronic hookah receives mostly positive reviews, since the device helped many to get rid of bad habits.  Smokers like the stylish design and high safety of the product.  Cartridges do not contain tar and tobacco, which is confirmed by numerous positive reviews.  Electronic hookah has an extremely simple design, which is understandable on an intuitive level. </p><div class="photo" data-original="eyeni.biz" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="High flavor" class="if uuid-3149673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/73127/3149673.jpg"></div><p>  Users appreciated the ability to make a mix of different cartridges, which allows you to create a unique taste.  Devices have excellent taste and excellent quality.  Many users liked the packaging of the device, since the product can be a welcome gift for any person.  Reviews note that the electronic hookah has excellent smoke output and flavor.  Therefore, users get real pleasure from using this device.  Everyone can find a device that is ideal for personal needs and desires. </p>
