    <p>  The ancient complex of buildings is the fortress of Veliky Novgorod.  A magnificent building is located on the left bank of the Volkhov River.  However, if you decide to visit the Novgorod Detinets, the official address is best known: Veliky Novgorod, ter.  The Kremlin, 11. The building is an important architectural monument and is protected by the state at the federal level, in addition, the museum-reserve is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as an integral part of the historical part of the city.  The first written records of the Kremlin date back to 1044.  Of course, he, like everything else, is subject to aging, time does not pass without a trace for him, and some parts are irretrievably lost. </p><h2>  Detinets, <span>Veliky Novgorod:</span> why is it called that? </h2><p>  Surely everyone who hears such a name for the first time is in some perplexity, because the word ‚ÄúKremlin‚Äù is more familiar, common among the people.  Meanwhile, the detinets in Russia were called nothing more than the inner part of the city‚Äôs fortress, which was a common phenomenon in the era of fragmentation.  In ancient annals, the word begins to appear for the first time in 1097, and only in the <span>14th century the</span> term ‚ÄúKremlin‚Äù replaced it.  Subsequently, it continues to exist only in written sources of Novgorod-Pskov origin, so it can be partially interpreted as dialectic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Versions of the origin of the word </h2><p>  Most linguistic scholars associate the origin of the word ‚Äúdetinets‚Äù (Veliky Novgorod, Kiev and other large cities with similar structures) with the cognate ‚Äúchildren‚Äù.  So, the bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Eugene in 1808, expressed the opinion that during the enemy raids all the children were sheltering in the fortress, which is why the name later went.  The Soviet historian and archaeologist, who conducted excavations in the Novgorod Kremlin, believed that he got his name because of the princely warriors who lived in it.  They were called children‚Äôs or youths.  However, in reality there were no princes in detinets - they settled nearby in the settlement. </p><p>  According to Academician Yanin V.L., the Novgorod Detinets, like everyone else, got their name due to the fact that, perhaps, the councils of elders passed in it. </p><p>  Another common version was voiced by a Russian military engineer.  It is quite simple and logical.  The word "child" comes from the verb "child."  This is explained by the fact that during danger in the fortress women and children were sheltered, church shrines, property.  This version to some extent echoes the first. </p><h2>  Novgorod detinets: a brief history </h2>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is known that the northern part of the territory where the Kremlin is now located used to be the Volkhov River Delta and was divided into two regions.  Presumably, the very first Detinets occupied a middle position and was located on the northern islet.  It was built of wood, and was laid by his son Yaroslav the Wise - Prince Vladimir Yaroslavovich.  He in 1045 initiated the construction of the main temple of the city - St. Sophia Cathedral, which lasted seven years.  Consecration took place in 1052, and a month later Vladimir died and was buried in a new church. </p><p>  The Novgorod Kremlin-Detinets (Veliky <span>Novgorod, Novgorod</span> region) burned repeatedly.  So, in 1097, little was left of it, and the new one was built only in 1116, and by that time it had reached modern sizes.  During this period, an impressive part of the territory was in the Vladychny Dvor - the residence of the bishop.  It was he who in 1333 began the construction of a stone fortress, fearing an attack not only by the Swedes and the Horde, but also by Prince Ivan Kalita.  The complete replacement of wood by stone occurred only in the 30s of the 15th century.  A more reliable construction, however, also gradually collapsed and rebuilt over time.  During World War II, when the Germans occupied Veliky Novgorod, the Detinets (Kremlin) were used as barracks for soldiers. </p><p>  The next large-scale destruction occurred in the 90s of the last century, when the wall near the Spasskaya Tower partially collapsed (20 meter gap).  A few years later, the fence was restored.  Now the Kremlin has the status of the Novgorod State United Museum-Reserve. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Key Architectural Features </h2><p>  From time immemorial, fortresses and defenses were built on a hill, mainly for better visibility and inaccessibility for the enemy, as well as near rivers.  Detinets (Veliky Novgorod) answers all these rules.  It rises on a small hill - 10 meters above the level of Volkhov.  On the perimeter of the outer walls, its length is 1487 m, and the internal area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory is 12.1 hectares. </p><p>  The impressive walls are made of brick made of mortar and stone (cobblestone and limestone).  The thickness and height of the walls of the fortress varies between 3.6-6.5 m and 8-15 m, respectively.  A distinctive feature of the fortress is the construction of gate churches, that is, churches located above the castle gates.  This is a characteristic feature of church and, in particular, monastic architecture in Russia.  The ideological significance was that with the help of such a building the heavenly protection of the city was carried out.  The fact that the Novgorod detinets has several of them is explained by the leading role of bishops in construction.  Almost all the walls were restored in the 50-60s of the last century and correspond to the appearance of the fortress from the 15th century. </p><h2>  Towers of the Novgorod Kremlin </h2>

    <p>  It is known that there are twelve towers on the territory of the detinets.  Only nine have survived to date: </p><ul><li>  Spasskaya (pictured above) - has the appearance of an elongated rectangle, divided into six tiers, the height and thickness of the walls - 19 and 2 m, respectively.  At the top, a 15-meter tent with a sentinel tower was built, which was restored according to the descriptions of the 17th century.  The arched passage is blocked by a lattice, from the north to the tower facade adjoins the destroyed Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior.  It was she who gave her the name.  The Novgorod detinets (Veliky Novgorod) are recognized precisely by the Spasskaya Tower, which, moreover, was once depicted on a banknote of 5 rubles. </li><li>  The Palace is a dead tower without a passage, of a quadrangular shape, which is essentially a square of 11.2 x 10.2 m, the height of the walls is 20 m, and the thickness to the level of the second tier is 2 m, at the top there is a tent.  It is distinguished from the rest of the towers by a slender silhouette. </li><li>  Princess - looks similar to the previous one, also a deaf tower 18.5 m high. </li><li>  Kokuy (Kalancha) - a blank quadrangular tower without a passage, the height of which together with the dome is 38.5 m, the wall thickness is similar to the previous ones.  Now it houses an observation deck with a panoramic view of a part of the Kremlin. </li><li>  Pokrovskaya is a massive structure 18 m high and 3 m thick in the southwestern part of the fortress.  She extends beyond her by 9 m, and the walls are penetrated by 55 loopholes. </li><li>  Zlatoust - a deaf quadrangular tower of four tiers, the name of which was given by a nearby temple of the 14th century. </li><li>  Vladimirskaya - through it fell into the Novgorod detinets (Veliky Novgorod), is a travel, quadrangular, height - 17.8 m. There is a ten-meter tent at the top.  A distinctive feature is the loopholes with an arched top resembling windows. </li><li>  Fedorovskaya - a tower of cylindrical shape with arched loopholes </li><li>  Metropolitan - is a monument of military-defensive architecture, like the two previous towers.  The structure is cylindrical, blind, the wall thickness is just over 3 m, height - 16.3 m. </li></ul><p>  It is known about the destruction and reconstruction of three towers: Borisoglebskaya, Voskresenskaya, Prechistenskaya. </p><h2>  Sophia Cathedral </h2>

    <p>  The white-stone temple is the oldest on the territory of modern Russia from those built by the Slavic people.  Built in the years 1045-1050, for several centuries it was the spiritual center of the whole Novgorod Republic. </p><p>  This is a cross-domed five-nave cathedral.  Such structures are characteristic of 11th century architecture.  However, not only Novgorod detinets (Veliky Novgorod) is famous for it - there are cathedrals with the same name in Polotsk and Kiev.  The building has three apses (rounded lateral and five-sided central), on all sides it is surrounded by a three-story gallery.  The cathedral has five chapters, and the sixth crowns the staircase in the western part.  They are characterized by a special form of makovits - in the form of helmets of <span>ancient Russian warriors.</span>  The maximum height of St. Sophia Cathedral is 38 m, the wall thickness is 1.2 m, limestone was used for their construction.  The temple is made in the traditional Byzantine style. </p><p>  Holy places are always covered in legends.  So, on the central dome, on the cross, there is a figure of a dove representing the Holy Spirit.  Ivan the Terrible in 1570 brutally cracked down on the Novgorodians.  According to legend, the dove, sitting down on the cross to rest, saw a bloody battle and was petrified by a tested sense of horror.  Subsequently, the Virgin Mary told one of the monks that the bird was sent to the city as a consolation and a talisman.  Novgorod will be kept until the dove flies off the cross. </p><h2>  Belfry of St. Sophia Cathedral </h2><p>  It should be considered separately from the main structure.  The belfry is an architectural monument of the 15-18th centuries, which is included in the Novgorod detinets.  Veliky Novgorod (see panoramic view above) is a beautiful ancient city with many cultural and historical sights.  There are many shrines among them.  These include, as is already clear, the St. Sophia Cathedral, and with it the belfry.  Written sources first mention it in 1437, when a flood is told.  In particular, it is said that it was collapsed along with the adjacent fortress wall.  At the moment, the belfry is located on the inner eastern wall of the Kremlin, its length is 22.5 m and its width is 3.4 m. </p><p>  During the Second World War, it was badly damaged.  After receiving information that the German troops were already approaching the city, it was decided to evacuate the bells.  However, during the bombing, there was a direct hit directly into the barge with the three largest specimens, and they drowned in the Volkhov River.  The structure itself was partially destroyed by artillery. </p><p>  The restored belfry of St. Sophia Cathedral was acquired by Novgorod Detinets (Veliky Novgorod) in 1948.  Now it is used for its intended purpose, in its upper part there is an observation deck and an exhibition dedicated to the ancient bells of the city is constantly operating. </p><h2>  Church of St. Sergius of Radonezh </h2><p>  The gate structure is perhaps the only one of its kind that has survived in the north-west of the country to this day.  It was built under the auspices of <span>Archbishop Ion</span> in the territory of the Bishop's Court in the Kremlin in 1463.  This time is characterized by a premonition of the fall of the Novgorod Republic under the pressure of Moscow and its accession.  However, passions gradually subsided, and the people put up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcentralizing the state.  The church is a sign of peace, spiritual rapprochement and unification with Moscow, since it was built in honor of the saint, then still almost unknown in Russia and revered mainly in Moscow - Sergius of Radonezh. </p><h2>  Church of Andrei Stratilat </h2>

    <p>  Novgorod detinets (diagram in the photo) in the southeastern part of the territory has a small but noteworthy church.  It was built in the 15-17th centuries.  It has a rectangular even shape in plan, a single-span belfry and a small head that crowns the temple.  Initially, Borisoglebsky Cathedral was located on this site, which collapsed in 1682 and was subsequently dismantled to the very base.  Only the chapel of the holy Russian martyr warrior Andrei Stratilat remained untouched.  It was expanded and turned into an independent small church. </p><h2>  Vladychny Yard </h2><p>  It was from him that it would be worth starting a story about the Novgorod detinets, since this is the oldest part of the Kremlin, with which, in the opinion of E. Gordienko and V. L. Yanin, it originates.  Vladychny Dvor is located in the northwestern part of the fortress.  If you believe history, then Bishop I. Korsunyanin, whose name is largely associated with the establishment of Christianity in Novgorod, occupied a small island under his court.  Its borders were determined by two arms of Volkhov.  Such a natural defense met all the requirements, in addition, the walls protected the population (not always positively).  After the death of the bishop, the old church of Joachim and Anna was dismantled and in the immediate vicinity began to build St. Sophia Cathedral. </p>

    <p>  For centuries, the Vladychny Dvor was a fortress in the fortress and with all its might opposed itself to princely power - secretly or directly.  Moreover, each new lord considered it his duty to build something of his own.  Thus, for many years, some buildings were demolished, while others were built, built on, restored, surrounded by additional structures. </p><p>  The largest changes were during the reign of Euthymius II (1429-1458).  An ardent opponent of the <span>accession of Novgorod to Moscow</span> created in Russia a unique structure, and now a monument of architecture, the only building in the Gothic style - the Faceted Chamber.  And if her appearance is rather modest (pictured above), then the internal architecture is simply magnificent and absolutely unique. </p><h2>  Visitor Information </h2><p>  It will be useful to find out to all those who plan a trip to one of the most beautiful and ancient cities of Russia and wish to visit the Novgorod Detinets (Veliky Novgorod), the opening hours of the cultural object and the cost of entrance tickets.

    <p>  Planning to visit the detinets (Veliky Novgorod)?  The opening hours of the complex should be clarified in advance.  Many expositions are seasonal or have a division into winter and summer time, restoration work can be carried out somewhere, and the entrance will be closed in connection with this.  For example, the Sofia belfry is available for visiting on weekdays from ten in the morning until six in the evening, and on Fridays and weekends the stay is extended until 20:00.  It is possible to book tickets in advance online.  All these organizational questions will be answered by the information service of the museum-reserve. </p>
