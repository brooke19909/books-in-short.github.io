Gone are the days when the mobile phones of this company were one of the most popular among users.  They were replaced by Android smartphones, which boast better performance and additional features.  However, Nokia cell phones have not yet completely lost fans.  There are still users who like the company's devices, despite the lack of modern functionality.  Most recently, Nokia 5500 was especially popular, made in the best traditions of a familiar mobile phone.  The model remains relevant today, so it deserves a review. </p>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The phone is sold in a box familiar to the company.  It depicts a recognizable logo and shows some information about the model.  The Nokia 5500 is pretty generous: </p><ul><li>  telephone; </li><li>  branded charger; </li><li>  stereo headset for sports; </li><li>  64 MB microSD card; </li><li>  Software CD; </li><li>  manual </li><li>  USB cable </li><li>  strap; </li><li>  clip; </li><li>  a small bag; </li></ul><p>  Agree that not every modern smartphone can boast of such a set. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The Nokia 5500, whose case is made in titanium or black, is more like a device for young people.  This is emphasized by many details, for example, the yellow border around the display, smoothly turning into the send and reset buttons.  Fringing not only plays the role of a beautiful design element, but also protects the screen from unwanted damage.  Thanks to her, you can safely put the phone screen down.  It immediately becomes clear that the developer tried to make every little thing perfect. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  As mentioned above, the Nokia 5500 Sport is sold in two color variations: black with white accents, titanium with yellow.  The first option is made in a restrained style, which is perfect for the adult generation and daily use.  The titanium color with a yellow edging is made more catchy and playful, young people and athletes will like it.  It is worth saying that this approach to color design has paid off.  The model was perfectly bought by users of different ages.  Surprisingly, the phone is interesting for the female gender, apparently, due to the presence of functions for active sports. </p><h2>  Housing </h2><p>  Nokia 5500 XpressMusic is positioned as a secure model and confirms this.  The phone is based on a metal chassis, metal is also used on the front side of the device.  Side faces are made of dense rubber.  The back cover is made of thick plastic, which is able to withstand falls from a serious height.  It is attached to the body using a rotary mechanism.  A rubber pad is attached to the cover, which protects the ports from the bottom of the phone from dust and moisture.  When using the interface part of the device, the plug bends to the side.  During operation, the rubber becomes softer, and the plug can open independently.  This moment Nokia 5500 can be attributed to the manufacturer‚Äôs shortcomings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The right end of the mobile phone received an infrared port, as well as keys for controlling the player and standby mode.  On the left side are two separate volume buttons and a Push To Talk button.  On the upper edge is the familiar on / off key of the device, which also provides quick access to profiles.  There is also a flashlight, you can activate it by pressing "*".  Below, under the plug, is the charging port and headphone input. </p>

    <p>  On the back side of the Nokia 5500 is the company logo and a 2-megapixel camera peephole.  It is habitually placed for such devices, there is no flash and autofocus. </p><h2>  Keyboard </h2><p>  It is made of rubber in the form of a monolithic block.  The keys are pressed nicely, have a distinctive sound.  There is a white backlight, quite bright.  You can parse characters in any conditions.  There is a four-way navigation key in the center of which is the OK button.  The block is not very large, which can cause inconvenience to users with thumbs.  However, most owners quickly get used to this arrangement.  Thanks to the structure, accidental clicks are excluded even in the pocket, so you can not use <span>the key lock.</span>  The call and end buttons are made tiny, but it's nice to work with them.  The editing key (pencil) has been moved to the side to save space on the main square. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The phone received a TFT-matrix with a resolution of 208 x 208 pixels, capable of displaying up to 262,000 colors.  The display is quite small, due to the small size of the case and security.  It is known that the screen is the most fragile part of the phone, so the developers decided not to make it big.  It is not very comfortable playing games for the Nokia 5500 on such a display.  Otherwise, he is not bad.  It perfectly conveys paints and is distinguished by a "live" picture.  In many ways, it even surpasses the screens that are installed in competitors' models. </p>

    <p>  Due to the low resolution on the screen, only 9 menu icons can fit, but they are drawn well.  It is comfortable to use, eyes do not get tired, has a good supply of brightness. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  Smartphone apps are known to quickly drain the battery.  However, the Nokia 5500 did not get a decent battery that could provide long-lasting battery life.  It has a removable 860 mAh battery.  This capacity is due to the small dimensions of the case.  In the talk mode, as the manufacturer assures, the phone is able to work up to 4 hours, in standby mode, more than 200 hours.  At medium loads, the model works for about 2 days.  I must say that all mobile phones of the 60th series are gluttonous, 5500 is no exception.  Smartphone apps run out of battery especially quickly.  Duration of work is perhaps the weakest point in this unit. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The model is executed on the usual platform for Nokia.  The processor is able to perform most tasks, operates at a clock frequency of 220 MHz.  32 MB of memory is declared for applications, but about 10 MB is available to the user.  The interface works smoothly, there are no crashes and hangs.  Most programs and games designed for this platform run without problems. </p>

    <p>  To increase the amount of memory you can use microSD memory cards.  The tray for them is located under the battery, which is logical for a protected device.  Of course, does not support hot swapping. </p><h2>  Sport mode </h2><p>  This is one of the key features of this model.  Work was made possible thanks to a 3D-sensor, which is built into the hardware.  It is pretty accurate in counting steps taken.  Minor errors happen, but you can close your eyes to them.  In general, the sensor will fit for a regular workout.  You can switch to sports mode by pressing a key on the side of the device.  At the same time, it will change the color of the backlight. </p>

In the first case, the user needs to overcome a certain distance in the allotted time, their results can be entered in the table.  The second test is useful to fans of simulators.  With it, the user can get information about the loads and track them. </p><p>  The Quick Start mode immediately starts normal measurements.  Here, the user becomes available data on his speed, spent calories and distance traveled.  The program can start working immediately, that is, the user is not required to make settings.  It can be rolled into the background.  The application can run for several days, recording owner‚Äôs indicators. </p>
