Denpasar is the capital of this province, although it can hardly be called a real paradise for tourists, but nevertheless many people like to spend their holidays there.  Despite the fact that it is a busy and noisy city, you can still find picturesque islets of peace surrounded by beautiful tropical greenery.  There is also something to see here, as many architectural and historical sights are concentrated in this place of the island. </p><h2>  Resort Description </h2><p>  The city of Denpasar is considered the largest settlement in Bali, as more than 700 thousand people live on its territory.  It is located in the south of the island and is its cultural, political and commercial center. </p>

    <p>  On the territory of this resort there are many ancient buildings and magnificent architectural structures built during the reign of kings in Indonesia, including Bali.  Denpasar also has many interesting centers and museums on its territory, where you can get acquainted with the ancient culture of the island and even see exhibits preserved from the second century BC.  Therefore, this Indonesian resort attracts art lovers and admirers of beautiful architecture. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, in the provincial capital there are several beautiful parks and fragrant gardens where you can enjoy the silence and retire from the commercial and business hustle and bustle of this city. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Tourists also love to come here, because it is always warm here.  If you look at the island of Bali on the map, you can see that it is located slightly south of the equator.  Therefore, in its territory, including in the capital, a tropical, or, as it is also called, subequatorial climate reigns. </p><p>  Here, the weather almost never changes.  Due to this, Denpasar can receive tourists all year round.  People can easily come here in any season, as the average annual air temperature varies from +27 to +31 degrees Celsius.  Water in the Indian Ocean is always like fresh milk and is never cooler than +24. </p><p>  Although there is no clear distinction between the wet and dry season on the territory of the island of Bali, Denpasar is still better to consider from March to October for relaxation.  In these months there is practically no rainfall on its territory, there is wonderful clear weather.  The rainy season in the city begins in November and lasts until the end of February.  Precipitation mainly falls at night or in the evening, so they also can not interfere with daytime rest and visiting interesting excursions. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Many tourists visiting other <span>Bali resorts</span> visit Denpasar at least once to see the rich cultural heritage located on its territory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For example, here is the anthropological museum, built by the Dutch back in 1910. Its exposition includes unique household items of the ancient aborigines of this Indonesian island, as well as their accessories for various rituals, various decorations, dolls and costumes. </p><p>  The building of this museum is located near Puputan Square, which is the historical heritage of this city.  In 1906, a mass suicide of Raja Badung and his household, servants and all people close to him was committed on it.  This cult ritual took place before the eyes of the Dutch invaders, who were greatly shocked by the sight seen.  Now there is a monument.  He is a group of people with Malaysian daggers in their hands. </p>

    <h2>  What else can I see? </h2><p>  The most striking and interesting structure in this resort, according to many tourists, is the temple of Pura Jagatnath, built in the middle of the last century.  This shrine is made of white coral and stands on a turtle, and dragons surround it. </p><p>  The resort is generally quite rich in various historical and religious monuments.  For example, in the city there is an old temple, erected in the fourteenth century.  Its architecture is simple, but unique in its own way.  The building is built of brick and has no decorations.  In the courtyard of the temple stands a statue of the god of the wind and the mythical eagle. </p><p>  The whole cultural life of the capital is located in its eastern part.  Here you can go on an excursion to an art gallery or enjoy the original performance - ‚ÄúKechak's ritual dance‚Äù.  Those who come on vacation to this resort in June can still get to the big carnival, which takes place in the city at this time of year. </p>

    <h2>  Local kitchen </h2><p>  Those who love nightlife should choose another Indonesian resort, not this one.  In Denpasar there are no luxury clubs, discos or restaurants.  But you can still taste the local cuisine.  There are many street cafes in the city, or, as the locals call them, varungs. </p><p>  These establishments offer visitors to try fried rice, popular in all Indonesia, with various additives, spicy chicken soup with vegetables and a large number of various noodle dishes.  Prices here are very affordable and will not hit the wallet.  But it is worth considering that at 22:00 all cafes and small restaurants in the city are closed. </p><p>  At the same time, a night bazaar opens for visitors, whose stalls are filled with trays of delicious and exotic food, so none of the tourists are guaranteed to remain hungry.  Also around the clock there are various shops and supermarkets. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  In addition to visiting wonderful sights and tasting exotic food, many tourists come here to enjoy swimming and sunbathing.  If you look at the island of Bali on the map, you can see that it is washed by the waters of the Indian Ocean.  But many are sure that in Denpasar there are absolutely no beaches, since it is located in the very middle of the province.  However, this is a misconception, since this resort has access to the coast, and its entire beach industry is focused on Legian, which is ideal for extreme water sports. </p><p>  You can also sunbathe in the vicinity of Denpasar, visiting Sanur, to which it takes no more than five minutes.  Here you can have a great time on the white sands of this beach, as well as diving or snorkeling. </p>

Travel time in total takes about thirteen hours. </p><p>  Some tourists still use Turkish airlines flying from Moscow to Denpasar via Istanbul and Singapore. </p>

    <h2>  Useful information for vacationers </h2><p>  Tourists going on vacation to the island of Bali should remember that there is a different time.  Denpasar is five hours ahead of Moscow in winter, and four in summer, respectively. </p><p>  The local currency is the <span>Indonesian rupee,</span> which is equal to ten US cents.  Thus, one dollar can be exchanged for ten rupees.  If the denomination of the bill is below $ 100, then the currency can be exchanged at a lower rate.  Also, the resort accepts credit cards with a dollar account. </p><p>  As for mobile communications, it is better to immediately get a local SIM card upon arrival, the cost of which will not exceed fifty rupees. </p><p>  If someone else is considering whether to spend their holidays in this Indonesian resort, it is better to cast aside their doubts and go on a journey.  There you can find everything your heart desires, from beautiful picturesque landscapes to interesting historical and architectural sights. </p>
