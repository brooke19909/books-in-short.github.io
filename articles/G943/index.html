    <h2>  Etiquette </h2><p>  Vacationers should know the rules for visiting nudist beaches.  There are places where only men or only women are allowed, and this should be taken into account.  It is necessary to first clarify where the nudist beaches on the Black Sea are: the exact location, which side is best to approach and the list of requirements for visitors.  Some beaches have official status, and their etiquette requires guests at the entrance to take off all their clothes. </p><p>  In European countries, a fine may even be levied for refusing to undress in such a place.  Do not forget that such places of rest are not intended for children.  It is forbidden to litter, make fires, annoy other vacationers.  Another strict rule: you should not use the camera on the nudist beaches of the Black Sea.  Even if it is used to take a selfie, other visitors may not like it.  Not everyone wants to be in such a picture or video, which then gets on the Internet. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is also undesirable on a nudist beach to show increased interest in people of the opposite sex.  In particular, stare at a person or release comments about his appearance. </p><h2>  What for?  The meaning of the visit </h2><p>  There are several reasons why people prefer nudist beaches on the Black Sea to the usual.  Firstly, it is an opportunity to be closer to nature.  Such places are usually far away, inaccessible.  There are no extraneous sounds: you can listen to the sound of waves all day and enjoy clean water and sunbathing.  The second reason is getting an even tan.  Elements of clothing usually leave marks on the body, stripes.  On a nudist beach, a woman is free to sunbathe topless or completely naked and get a terrific tan. </p><p>  Some visit naturist beaches just out of curiosity.  And there are those who set out to liberate themselves, to learn to trust people and to know themselves.  Taking off your clothes in the company of strangers is not an easy step, but it will help get rid of constraint and constraint.  Sometimes people come to nudist beaches and just then to make new acquaintances. </p><h2>  The best nudist beaches of the Black Sea </h2>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Black Sea coastal zone belongs to the territories of several countries.  Nudist beaches are found almost everywhere: in Russia, Bulgaria, Georgia and other countries.  Some of the best are located near Novorossiysk, on the island of Crimea or in the Krasnodar Territory.  Recently, by the decision of local authorities, an official nudist beach was opened in Batumi.  Near Tuapse, near the village of Dzhubga, there is a fairly popular nudist beach.  It is better to get there along the coastline, passing by a boarding house.  The beach area is located at the foot of the Hedgehog, if desired, travelers can climb up and enjoy the spectacular views and sea views.  The sea here is very clean, places are difficult to access, so ordinary lovers of sunbathing on the sand in a swimsuit are rare. </p><h2>  Rest for money </h2><p>  There are organized paid campsites in Russia.  For example, the beach for nudists "Clean Dunes", where you can rent a tent or a place for it, as well as rent the necessary equipment.  Camping sites are designed for long vacations, ideal for spending vacations in summer or autumn.  Location - Anapa district.  The organization has its own website where you can see photos of the nudist Black Sea beach and get acquainted with the price list for services. </p><h2>  The beaches of the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  One of the most popular is Abrau Durso, not far from Lake Limanchik and the Zvezdny boarding house.  The territory is wild, located in a mountainous area.  Nearby there are rocky ledges and large stones.  The place is not guarded, but suitable for lovers of solitude in nature.  A little further away, not far from <span>Maly Utrish,</span> there is another territory suitable for this type of recreation - these are very picturesque places with waterfalls and rocks, where pistachio trees are found.  But it is worth remembering that the beach is not officially nudist, tourists of various ages and customs relax here.  Most of the beaches that can be reached from Novorossiysk are spontaneously organized.  Nudists choose them because they are remote from the city and protected from prying eyes by cliffs or forests. </p><p>  Another nudist beach on the Black Sea is located near the village of Divnomorskoye, referred to on the maps as ‚ÄúBlue Bay‚Äù.  It is well known and has been used for several years.  The coastline is strewn with large pebbles.  There are many vacationers on the beach, but it is noted from the shortcomings that the territory is not cleaned. </p><h2>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSochi </h2>
