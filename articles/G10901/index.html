  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Big Krasnokholmsky bridge in Moscow: history, photo, description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  This bridge in Moscow was built at an angle of 55 degrees to the fairway, thereby mitigating the kink of the Garden Ring.  It was originally planned to throw a suspension structure, but the combination of such a scheme and a rather sharp angle between the river and the bridge routes seemed risky.  In this regard, it was built according to the arch scheme traditional for the capital.  The construction, thrown across the Moscow River, occupies one of the important and significant positions in the road system of the central part of the capital. </p><p>  Below is a brief history of the construction of the Big Krasnokholmsky bridge in Moscow, its description and features. </p><div class="photo" data-original="35photo.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge in the evening" class="if uuid-3095568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3095568.jpg"></div><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  There is this bridge from the 18th century.  At first it consisted of connected logs lying on the water.  Bridges of this design, like wooden piles, in those days quite often suffered from severe floods, and therefore they had to be constantly rebuilt.  For example, in 1823 the described Big Krasnokholmsky bridge was demolished by flooding.  Yes, so that there is nothing left. </p><p>  With the growth of Moscow, there was a need to build a permanent bridge in this place connecting Zamoskvorechye and Taganskaya Sloboda.  Therefore, the city council turned to Amanda Struve (bridge engineer) with a proposal to create a new bridge.  It was he who created such bridges as Liteiny in St. Petersburg, the railway across the Oka River, the bridge in the city of Kremenchug, as well as the bridge in Kiev across the Dnieper. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Construction "for centuries" </h2><p>  The opening of the two-span permanent Krasnokholmsky Bolshoi Bridge took place in early April 1872.  It consisted of two spans having load-bearing box trusses 65.6 meters long.  The old Borodinsky and Crimean bridges were built according to the same scheme.  The width of the carriageway was 15 meters plus the width of two pedestrian walkways.  In the 1900s, trams were laid here as well. </p><div class="photo" data-original="liveinmsk.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge construction" class="if uuid-3095556" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3095556.jpg"></div><p>  At that time, the building overlooked Narodnaya Street and was located almost at right angles to the fairway.  Such a flaw was corrected in the design of the modern arch bridge, which was built in 1928 (project of engineer Vakhurkin V.M. and architect Kokorin V. D).  Today, the construction is located in the direction of the Garden Ring highway. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This bridge is an arched single-span steel pontoon connecting 2 river banks and located along the line of the Garden Ring (the gap between Taganskaya Square and Lower Krasnokholmskaya Street).  The authors of the project are a group of engineers: Sobolev D.M., Vakhurkin V.M., Goltz G.P. Ponton, built in 1938, has a 168-meter-long arch, which is the largest in the center of Moscow. </p><p>  The main span of the Great Krasnokholmsky Bridge consists of seven crescent-shaped parallel steel arches, each of which has a length of 168 meters.  In total, steel consumption amounted to 6,000 tons (890 kilograms per square meter). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rutraveller.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pedestrian walkway" class="if uuid-3095557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3095557.jpg"></div><p>  Coastal pylons are supported by 4 caissons (concrete) measuring 35.6 x 15 meters each.  The latter are buried below the river level by about 13 meters.  The entire length of the bridge with approaches to it is 725 meters, width is 40. The movement of cars on the bridge takes place in eight lanes.  Reconstruction with the replacement of the entire canvas on the bridge was carried out in the period from 2005 to 2007.  He got his name from the terrain, which is hilly, on the left bank of the river. </p><h2>  Interesting fact </h2><p>  There were (and still are) rumors that during the construction of the Big Krasnokholmsky bridge it was discovered that part of one residential building, standing on the street.  Osipenko, was right at the exit from the bridge.  In this regard, it was moved to another place, deployed 19 degrees.  Moreover, in the process of construction work it was not even necessary to turn off communications, and the residents of the house practically did not feel any discomfort. </p>
