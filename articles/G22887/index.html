    <p>  The island of Phuket, being one of the most prestigious world resorts, has long become a favorite vacation spot among Russians.  There are beautiful beaches, there is the opportunity to go diving, horse riding, play golf.  A large number of cultural monuments give tourists the opportunity to get acquainted with the Buddhist religion and life principles in the kingdom. </p><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Choosing tours to Phuket, you need to get acquainted with the weather conditions of the island in advance.  The hot season here begins in March and lasts until the end of May.  At this time, the temperature ranges from 24-33 degrees.  Somewhere in mid-April, the first signs of the rainy season begin to appear.  The temperature drops, sometimes pouring short-term showers.  In the first days of summer, monsoons begin, which completely cover Phuket.  The sea this season is turbulent, red flags appear everywhere on the beaches, signifying the prohibition of swimming. <br>  Rain with tropical thunderstorms lasts until October, and stable dry weather sets in from November.  It was at this time that tours to Phuket are the most popular, since they fall at the peak of the tourist season, which ends only in February. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Prices </h2>

    <p>  In general, two periods are clearly distinguished on the island.  It is a dry season and rainy.  Therefore, the trip time in many respects needs to be selected based on what kind of vacation tourists prefer.  Cost depends on the season.  Phuket, whose air temperature does not fluctuate strongly during the year, can be called an all-weather resort.  However, tourists who prefer a beach holiday, it is better to choose the period from November-December to April.  This time is considered a high season here, and therefore hotels are crowded, and the cost of living rises somewhat. </p><p>  From April to October, surfers come to Phuket, as well as those who prefer an active form of recreation on the water.  At this time, hotels are not fully filled, and prices are somewhat reduced.  Therefore, coming to Thailand (Phuket) this season, hotels can be booked without difficulty. </p><p>  If we talk about the financial side of the trip, then, regardless of the month, prices here will seem to Russians lower than on the mainland, although, compared with Pattaya, they are slightly higher.  For example, lunch in a street cafe can cost about four hundred rubles per person, a tuk-tuk ride costs about fifteen rubles, and an air-conditioned taxi costs 250-350 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  In general, Phuket, where prices have risen substantially over the past ten years, is one of the most expensive cities in Thailand. </p><h2>  Cost of tours </h2><p>  This small island breaks records in demand among other Thai resorts.  Tours to Phuket are mainly chosen by those who want to plunge into the atmosphere of complete relaxation, unlike the bustling Bangkok or Pattaya itself, which is awash with travelers coming from all over the world. </p><p>  At the same time, no one is bored here: after time spent on the beach, you can go shopping to the resort‚Äôs shops and shopping centers, to the oceanarium.  In addition, it is most convenient to go from here to the deserted <span>islands of the Andaman</span> Sea. </p><p>  At the height of the season, tours to Phuket for residents of the capital of the Russian Federation will cost from sixty thousand rubles with accommodation in a three-star hotel for two.  Moreover, a trip from Moscow will be much cheaper than with a departure from the regions due to the large number of charter flights. </p><p>  The usual time to visit the resort is winter.  In January 2015, many Russians bought last-minute trips to Phuket, and special offers are available to absolutely everyone, since Thailand is a visa-free country for the residents of our country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

On your own, you can get to the island from Bangkok - the <span>capital of Thailand.</span>  Since today Phuket is the pearl of this region, there are a lot of opportunities to get to it at an affordable price and with comfort. </p><p>  The island is connected to the mainland by a bridge, in addition, it has its own international airport.

    <p>  Fans of noisy pastimes are recommended to visit the cabaret next door, as well as watch the fights of famous Thai boxers in the center, located within walking distance.  In addition, in the office near the hotel you can rent a vehicle and explore all the sights on your own on the island. </p><p>  At the registration desk, you can order sightseeing tours to nearby islands, go to Pattaya or to wild beaches where there is no one. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians express the opinion that for their three stars M-Narina Hotel 3 * is very good.  He does not claim to be a high category, but he is quite consistent with his own. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, check-in is carried out instantly: without waiting for the hour stated in the rules, they give keys to the registry and help bring things to the room.  The staff speaks English, so there are no special problems with communication among Russians. </p>

    <p>  There are many positive reviews about the hotel's location: not only shops and numerous small markets are available, there are many inexpensive cafes and restaurants nearby, a stone's throw from the exchanger with a very good course, and a seven-minute walk to the beach. </p><p>  The rooms are good, everything works, there is a TV with a USB input, a safe.  Maids carry out cleaning carefully, without waiting for a tip, they build different figures on the beds, mainly elephants. </p><p>  At the registration desk, the girls, constantly smiling, help with any problem.  Some did not like breakfast, or rather, their scarcity.  The Russians, who like to eat tasty and hearty even in the morning, lacked the variety of dishes offered.  But some liked freshly squeezed juices, especially from pineapple. </p><p>  Tourists were also somewhat annoyed by the lack of <span>entertainment for children,</span> although they found a way out: they went for a walk, trying to stay less on the territory of the hotel. </p>
