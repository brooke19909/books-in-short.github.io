    <h2>  Salted Dough: Recipe </h2><p>  How does flower modeling from salt dough begin?  Of course, from the preparation of the material itself for creativity.  The dough should be soft and elastic, and for this you need to be able to knead it correctly.  We study the recipe for cooking. </p><p>  In order to make salt dough, you will need: </p><ul><li>  wheat flour - 300 g; </li><li>  salt - 200 g; </li><li>  pharmaceutical glycerin - 4 large spoons; </li><li>  warm water - 125-150 g; </li><li>  PVA glue - 1 large spoon. </li></ul><p>  How to make the dough from these materials?  Pour 125 grams of water into a bowl, then dissolve the salt in it.  After that, leave the solution to cool completely.  Next, add glycerin and glue, mix the ingredients.  Pour the sifted flour in small portions and knead the dough.  We roll it out until it stops sticking to the table and hands.  We wrap the resulting material in cling film and leave to "lie down" for half an hour.  After this procedure, the dough becomes elastic and pliable in work.  Now it can be used for making crafts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is according to this recipe that experienced craftsmen prepare material for creating thin and small details, and this is exactly what is needed to make such products as flowers from salt dough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salt dough flowers master class" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/375558.jpg?1397598829428" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to make stucco material color? </h2><p>  Compositions, including flower pictures, from salt dough can be decorated after the work is done and completely dried.  But many masters prefer to initially paint the stucco material in the colors necessary to create the composition.  How it's done?  At the stage of kneading the dough, the most common food coloring is added to it.  But you can also dye it with natural products.  For example, cocoa or <span>instant coffee</span> will give the dough a brown tint, beet juice - pink, carrots - orange.  But when adding the latter, consider that it is a liquid, and therefore initially pour less water. </p><p>  Next, we study information on how to make products such as flowers from salt dough. </p><h2>  Daisies </h2><p>  We tear off a piece from a common piece of dough and roll out a ball from it.  On a plate flatten it into a cake.  With a sharp wand (stack, manicure scissors or a toothpick), divide the circle into thin petals.  We push the dough well, cutting it, while leaving the middle whole.  We flap the edges of each petal, forming a sharp tip.  On each ray with a fingernail or spatula from a manicure set, carefully push the notch from the middle to the edge.  With a toothpick, perform ‚Äúpunctures‚Äù on the central part of the flower.  Set aside the chamomile to dry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="modeling of flowers from salt dough" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/375559.jpg?1397598526249" width="513"></div>

To make these elements from a lump of stucco material, we form a sausage.  Flatten it into a cake.  Sprinkle the workpiece with flour and fold in half lengthwise.  Cut the teeth along the edge of the product with manicure scissors on both parts at once.  Expand the part.  Flatten incisions.  Stack we carry out veins in the middle of a figure.  Leave it to dry. </p><p>  Having made about a dozen such daisies, you can create a whole bunch of flowers from salt dough from them. </p><h2>  Roses </h2><p>  The plant element, created according to the following instructions, looks not only beautiful, but also believable.  And it runs very quickly.

    <p>  A piece of dough is rolled into a layer with a thickness of about 0.5 centimeters.  With a round object we squeeze out seven identical elements - petals.  We lay them out in a horizontal row, while the edge of one figure should be 1 cm on the other.  Original steps turn out.  Then, starting from the bottom part, we twist the entire structure into a roll.  Put the resulting workpiece with one end on the table.  Fingers spread the petals on top of the flower, bending them from the center to the sides.  Rose is ready.  Similar flowers from salt dough, the master class for the manufacture of which you studied, can be an excellent basis for hairpins, hoops, brooches, and an element of a <span>decorative panel.</span> </p><h2>  Calla lilies </h2><p>  Following the following description, you can easily create charming figures of this type of flower.  We study the manufacturing instructions. </p><p>  We tear off a lump from a piece of dough and form a ball with a diameter of about three centimeters from it.  Flatten it into a cake, forming one of its edges round, and the second we make it a little pointed.  We turn the workpiece "roll".  In this case, the lower edge (round) is wound more tightly than the pointed one.  The resulting petal is slightly turned away from the center to the sides.  Sculpt the middle of the flower.  From a small lump of dough, swing the sausage, leaving one of its edges thick.  We form a ball there.  It turns out a blank in the form of a stick with a lump at the top.  We insert this detail into the flower.  On paper, draw a sheet template.  Roll out the dough into a layer, put a pattern on it and cut it out.  Stack draw veins.  We carry out a stalk - "sausage" one cm thick. All elements are laid out to dry: flowers from salt dough, leaves and stems.  After that we fasten them together using hot melt adhesive.  From such products you can form whole bouquets. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="salt dough flower pictures" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/375555.jpg?1397598571250" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  How to dry products? </h2><p>  This can be done naturally at room temperature or on a warm battery.  You can speed up the drying process using an oven.  Drying time is calculated individually for each piece of work on the basis that every 0.5 cm of dough dries for one hour at a temperature of 75 degrees. </p><p>  From the information provided in the article, you learned how to make flowers from salt dough.  The master class, presented in three versions, will help you create unique and beautiful products with your own hands.  Creative mood and inspiration to you! </p>
