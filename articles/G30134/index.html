Most of them boast their attractions, rich history, beautiful nature, as well as various interesting facts.  Each city is distinguished by its special atmosphere and has characteristic features inherent only to it.  The wonderful city of Perm is no exception.  It really deserves special attention because it has a great historical and cultural heritage.  The article will discuss the city itself, how many years Perm is, its attractions and much more. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280185.jpg?1544274467"></div><h2>  Perm City: General Description </h2><p>  This wonderful village is located in the European part of our country.  The city is the administrative center of the <span>Perm Territory.</span>  There is also a port located on the Kama River.  Perm is a large city with a large number of inhabitants.  According to 2016 data, the local population was 1041,876 people, which is a fairly high indicator.  Perm received the status of a million-plus city in the late 70s of the 20th century.  Of course, many are interested in how old the city of Perm is.  The answer to this question will be considered a little later. </p><p>  It is also worth saying that the village has important transport significance.  In addition to the port, there is a large logistics center, since the city is located on the Trans-Siberian Railway.  Also, many industries are well developed here.  However, the city is not only a production center, but also a scientific, cultural center. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280188" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280188.jpg?1544274467"></div><h2>  How old is Perm: when was the city founded? </h2><p>  Thus, we got acquainted with general information about this village.  Indeed, Perm is a large city with a history spanning many years.  Many important events took place here.  Of course, it is worth talking about how many years Perm.  It was founded in the XVIII century by <span>Vasily Tatishchev.</span>  If we talk about a more accurate date, then this happened in 1723.  It turns out that the age of the city is 293 years.  In 2023, Perm will celebrate its 300th anniversary.  Of course, in comparison with other cities of Russia, Perm is not such an old city, but it has a rich history, which will be discussed later. </p><p>  It is interesting that for some period of time the settlement was called Molotov.  This happened in the 40s of the 20th century.  However, soon, in 1957, the city was renamed back. </p><p>  Probably, many will be interested in the question of when the day of the city of Perm.  This holiday is celebrated every year on a certain day - June 12. </p><p>  So, we got to know better this beautiful city, learned how many years Perm is, as well as the date of its foundation.  Of course, it is worth telling about the history of the city.  She has always been rich in various interesting events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280182.jpg?1544274467"></div><h2>  A little bit about the name of the city </h2><p>  The names of various settlements are always of particular interest.  From some of them it is easy to guess what word they came from.  However, this does not always happen, sometimes it is impossible to understand the meaning of the name without referring to additional sources.  Many people are so accustomed to the name "Perm" and do not think about what it means. </p><p>  The word itself appeared in ancient times.  It is believed that it came from the Veps language.  This is one of the branches of the Baltic-Finnish languages.  The word means "distant land."  Other versions of the origin of the word are also considered.  One of them says that it came from the Komi-Permyak words "pere", which means "far", or "parma" (translated as "forest").  Now it becomes clear where the name of the city of Perm came from. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280187" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280187.jpg?1544274467"></div><h2>  The history of the city of Perm: how did it appear? </h2><p>  This area was inhabited long before the first settlements appeared here.  In Perm, many archaeological excavations were carried out, as a result of which more than 100 different objects from different periods were found.  In the XVII century, the territory where the city is now located belonged to the Stroganov merchants.  There were several settlements, for example, the village of Zaostrovka and a village called Upper Mulla. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The foundation of Perm, as mentioned above, dates back to 1723.  It was then that the construction of a smelter began here.  I wonder what prerequisites existed here for the foundation of the city?  It is known that in 1720 V.N. went here  Tatishchev by order of Peter I. This was necessary in order to find a place for the future construction of various plants.  He chose a village called Egoshikha, because it was here that there were reserves of copper ore. </p><p>  Also, the village had a favorable transport location.  After a while, the project was approved, and the construction of the plant began here.  Thus, it becomes clear when the settlement was founded, and how many years the city of Perm will turn out to be.  We also learned what objects were in these places before the appearance of the city itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280186.jpg?1544274467"></div><h2>  Further history of Perm </h2><p>  Of course, it becomes interesting how the city developed further.  Gradually, the village developed.  In 1780, Catherine II decided to create a new city next to the existing plant - Perm.  After that, the city began to be actively built up, here were built the buildings of various official institutions, roads were laid and much more.  Already in 1796, the <span>Perm province</span> was formed <span>, the</span> center of which became Perm. </p><p>  Since then, the city began to develop even faster.  At the end of the 19th century, construction of railways in several directions began here.  Around the same time, various institutions related to art, culture and science began to open here.  An opera and ballet theater was built, as well as the first cinema. </p><p>  However, the revolution affected Perm, as well as other cities in Russia.  This will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Revolution and Soviet time </h2><p>  As you know, the history of the city of Perm has many events.  One of them is the revolution.  In 1917, it happened here.  On November 8, news came to the city that the October Revolution had begun.  Initially, almost all representatives of the City Duma condemned this step.  However, after some time, a congress was held at which the establishment of Soviet power was proclaimed. </p><p>  After this event, the population of the city increased significantly.  From 1926 to 1939, the number of inhabitants increased many times, from 84 thousand to 306 thousand people.  And by 1970, Perm had become a millionaire city. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the city actively participated in the fight against invaders.  Most of the city‚Äôs enterprises were used for military purposes.  Here was organized the production of various ammunition, weapons, chemicals. </p><h2>  The city's attractions </h2><p>  Earlier, we already figured out how old the city of Perm is, how this settlement is known, and also got acquainted with its history.  There are many attractions in the city that you definitely need to talk about.  Most often in Perm you can find various architectural monuments.  Of great interest is the Meshkov House.  This is a wonderful example of the style of Russian classicism.  It is impossible not to pay attention to another wonderful building - the House of Gribushin.  It was created a little later, the building is made in the Art Nouveau style. </p><p>  As in many other cities, in Perm there is a monument to V.I.  To Lenin.  It has a special status and is included in the list of objects of federal significance.  The monument was unveiled in 1955.  The city has relatively new monuments.  For example, in 2006 a stone monument ‚ÄúThe Legend of the Perm Bear‚Äù was inaugurated here.  The sculpture received great fame and publicity.  Subsequently, it was replaced by a bronze and moved to another place. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280184.jpg?1544274467"></div><p>  Once in Perm, you should definitely visit such wonderful places as the Bishop‚Äôs House, Transfiguration Cathedral and much more. </p><h2>  Interesting facts about the city </h2><p>  Of course, in connection with its rich history, Perm is surrounded by a mass of interesting facts.  General information about the village, attractions and much more has already been sorted.  We also learned about how many years the city of Perm already exists when the city day is celebrated.  Be sure to tell a few interesting facts about this city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img alt="" class="if uuid-1280189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41305/1280189.jpg?1544274467"></div><p>  In 1842, a big fire broke out in the city, as a result of which the entire central part of the city was destroyed.  It is also known that in 1914 there was a flood.  <span>The Kama River</span> spilled and flooded several settlements at once.  The water level in it increased by as much as 11 meters.  Of particular interest is the fact that the first Soviet stamps were issued in Perm. </p>
