Queen of hearts, people's princess ... As she was not called!  A year after a divorce from the Prince of Wales, Lady Dee tragically died in a terrible car accident in Paris, under Place Alma, in an underground tunnel.  Princess Diana's death date is August 31, 1997. She was 36 years old.  It was an accidental or planned accident, it still remains a mystery.  The question still excites the minds and hearts of hundreds of people. </p>

    <p>  On the evening of August 30, Lady Di, accompanied by a billionaire from Egypt, Dodi al-Fayed, arrived at the restaurant of the Ritz Hotel.  After dinner, around midnight, the couple left the hotel through the back door and got into a black car, in which a guard and a driver were waiting for them.  At 00:15, the Mercedes drove away from the front door, sharply moving in an attempt to hide from the annoying paparazzi.  But the photographers went in pursuit.  The trip was the last in the life of a national favorite.  Only a bodyguard survived the accident, but he cannot remember anything, as he suffers from amnesia. </p><p>  <strong>The mystery of the death of Princess Diana</strong> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The investigation initially blamed the tragedy of reporters chasing a black Mercedes on scooters.  A version was put forward that one of them allegedly interfered with the car, and the driver crashed into the bridge support in an attempt to avoid a collision.  However, eyewitnesses claimed that the paparazzi entered the tunnel later than the Mercedes, which means they could not provoke the accident. </p>

This was confirmed by the fragments found at the scene of the accident and the testimonies of some eyewitnesses who testified that they saw the car zigzagging out of the tunnel a couple of seconds after the accident.  The search police even determined the year of manufacture and the exact characteristics of the car, but it was not possible to find him or the driver.  And later it turned out that one of the most successful and famous Parisian paparazzi James Andanson rode a white Fiat.  They could not prove that the photographer was involved in the accident that caused the death of Princess Diana.  And after some time, Andanson's corpse was found in a burnt car in the French Alps.

It has been suggested that the death of Princess Diana is the work of the British intelligence services, which are armed with <span>laser weapons.</span>  The media wrote that perhaps a laser was used in the tunnel to blind the driver of the Mercedes. </p><p>  Two years after the tragedy, all world newspapers printed a new sensational statement made by the investigation.  According to the results of the checks, it was found that the blame for what happened lies with Henri Pole - a car driver who also died in this accident.  It turned out that he was very drunk at the time of the accident.  Until now, this version is considered the main one. </p>

    <p>  16 years passed, and in the summer of 2013, the world community again began to discuss the death of Princess Diana.  And the reason was new truly sensational evidence.  There was information that the death of Lady Dee was arranged by the British special services.  But has this already been discussed?  Yes, but concrete facts have now appeared.  During the trial of one British soldier, it was accidentally revealed that he had information that the death of Princess Diana was ordered by an elite unit of <span>British special forces.</span>  The information received raises many questions so far.  The London police began to carefully study the new information and promised to evaluate its reliability and adequacy. </p>
