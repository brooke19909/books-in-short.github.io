If not, then where was the series filmed?  And if so, what is the Eleon Hotel, where is <span>this</span> place in <span>Moscow</span> ?  In social networks, discussions about this do not cease. </p><h2>  General information about the series </h2><p>  "Hotel Eleon" is a story offshoot from the series "Comedy".  The television series was released in 2016.  In a short time he won many fans.  The first season was quickly shot, then the second and third appeared.  One episode lasts only 22 to 30 minutes.  Despite the fact that the spin-off of "Kitchen" could not surpass its predecessor in the number of fans, this is really a very interesting light series, which found its audience and won many fans. </p><h2>  Hotel Eleon: where is the filming location in Moscow </h2><p>  The success of the sitcom "Kitchen" on the STS channel pushed the creators to make a comedy similar to him, with old heroes, but in a different setting.  It can be said that the directors decided to give a second life to expensive sets.  Thus, the idea came up to create the series "Hotel Eleon".  We do not know where the address at which the famous "cuisine" of the country is located in Moscow is located, but there is no doubt that the pavilion for filming is the same.  The identical scenery and atmosphere of the hotel are recreated and the requisites are beautiful.  New premises were added, such as a SPA salon, a swimming pool, luxury rooms, a laundry room, where cleaners sit, and a technical room.  In the small restaurant of the hotel, the characters beloved by everyone in the "Kitchen" continue to work - Nastya and her husband, bartender Kostik, a wonderful cook Senya, and the manager, Mikhail Dzhekovich, wanders about the "Eleon" day and night.  Other familiar characters come back gradually.  Thus, the space of the "Kitchen" has expanded, and some pavilions have been redone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Is there a Hotel Eleon </h2><p>  The main question of the fans, of course, is the veracity of the existence of this hotel in the city of Moscow.  After all, I really want to go to the same places where they go, the main characters of the Eleon hotel work.  Where is in Moscow, how to get to the place of filming - all these questions are often asked by fans on social networks.  Is there any such hotel? </p><p>  There were speculations that the hotel with such an interior is located in Ukraine, because the company Yellow, Black &amp; White, which created the project, worked in conjunction with the Ukrainian film studio Sister's Production. </p><p>  The answer to the question whether there is a hotel with that name in our capital is one, and it is one hundred percent accurate.  Hotel "Eleon" in Moscow yet!  Different scenes were shot on different <span>film sets.</span>  And all this is the capital of our country. </p>

    <h2>  Where was the series created? </h2><p>  Since there is no real hotel "Eleon", where the location of the series is located in Moscow, everyone who is interested in this sitcom wants to know.  Filmed in several places, more precisely, in three. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The main place is the pavilion of the Russian company ‚ÄúYellow, Black and White‚Äù.  They shot "Kitchen" and continue to shoot "Hotel" Eleon ".  Where in Moscow there is a photo-splash screen of the entrance to the hotel, many fans of the series know.  This place is quite recognizable, it is the very center of the capital - Bolshaya Yakimanka Street.  There (in house 1) is the Alexander House business center.  It was there that they built the facade of the hotel with a large inscription "Eleon".  The road with cars going back and forth, scenes on the roof - all in the same place, on Yakimanka.  Fans of the series can take a walk here and seem to be in their favorite series. </p><p>  Street shooting, which shows the road, passing cars and neighboring buildings, was carried out in a large Moscow business center "Alexander House", located on Bolshaya Yakimanskaya.  The hotel‚Äôs facade with a huge inscription ‚ÄúEleon‚Äù was filmed here, as well as several scenes on the roof where you can easily recognize the surrounding buildings. </p>

    <p>  Luxury rooms were rented at a hotel near the Sheremetyevo Airport.  If fans recognized the street where the hotel‚Äôs facade is located, then they still cannot find out this place.  But the directors and creators of the series did not disclose the secret.  Perhaps they are afraid of the influx of those wishing to the hotel.  Although this is strange, in fact, on the contrary, in this way it would be possible to make excellent advertising for this hotel.  After all, who does not want to rent a suite from your favorite series? </p><h2>  Interesting facts from the shoot </h2><p>  Many of the rooms that were shown in the TV series "Kitchen" in "Eleon" have a different purpose.  So, for example, the technical refrigerator turned into a room of techie Boris in a spin-off. </p><p>  Paul‚Äôs Serbian accent is real (he is really a Serb). </p><p>  In order to fight well, Dasha took karate lessons. </p>

    <p>  When creating the series, some rules of etiquette of the hotel business were violated.  For example, maids are forbidden to appear in the lobby of the hotel when guests and even more so management.  In the series, they flicker there constantly. </p><p>  The elevator in the series sham.  It‚Äôs just a box with a folding door that opens and closes like a real one. </p><h2>  Greek hotel option </h2><p>  Despite the fact that "Eleona" in Moscow does not yet exist, there is a hotel with that name in Greece.  Translated, this word means "olive grove."  Greek "Eleon" is located in the town of Tragaki. </p>

    <p>  This is a modern five-star hotel surrounded by olive groves.  The attention of vacationers are presented luxury pools, spa springs, entertainment programs.  Therefore, there is no need to look for information about the Eleon Hotel (where it is located in Moscow).  Reviews of tourists about his Greek namesake are no worse.  If you wish, you can really relax in the Eleon Hotel, however, the scenery will not coincide with those that were shot in the famous Russian series. </p>
