    <h2>  general description </h2><p>  The camera itself is a classic SLR camera.  Despite the fact that the production of the case uses relatively light materials, its weight is 830 grams.  This allows you to balance a rather heavy lens, which is a very important nuance when shooting with the Nikon D810.  An overview of the latest devices from this manufacturer is a clear confirmation that the new product has an almost identical design with its predecessor, the D800.  The novelty is equipped with a 36.3-megapixel FX matrix without an optical filter for low frequencies.  According to the developers, all changes to the camera were made solely on the basis of feedback from the owners of the device.  There are no significant shortcomings in the new product.  The only thing that can be criticized by the modern user is the lack of such a high-end Wi-Fi module in the device. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Ergonomics and build quality </h2><p>  At a fantastic level is the build quality.  The <span>Nikon D810</span> case is made of magnesium alloy, which gives the impression of high strength.  It is completely airtight.  An interesting innovation compared to the previous modification was the use of individual rubber plugs (and not one common as before) for all connectors and slots to protect against moisture inside.  The layout of the main control keys has also changed slightly.  It‚Äôs hard to call these improvements significant and with a cursory review can even be unnoticed.  Be that as it may, all of them played a positive effect. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  A significant advantage of the camera is the <span>Nikon D810</span> display <span>.</span>  A review of the camera market shows that only a few of them boast similar parameters.  The size of its diagonal has remained the same - 3.2 inches, but the image quality has improved significantly.  Resolution is 1.23 million dpi.  Along with this, it should be noted that the changes were made to the structure of pixels.  In particular, instead of the usual RGB matrix, the model uses an RGBW screen.  The addition of a white subpixel allowed to increase the maximum brightness of the display and at the same time reduce the amount of energy consumption by it.  Among other things, its color rendering and contrast have significantly increased.  In order to prevent fogging due to a sharp temperature difference, the space between the matrix and the protective glass is filled with a special gel.  Brightness, color saturation and gamma are automatically adjusted by the <span>light sensor.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Basic controls </h2><p>  As noted above, the layout of the main controls is much like the previous version of the <span>Nikon D810.</span>  <span>Customer reviews of the</span> device and experts characterize it as very convenient.  There are two positions for the focus mode switch - AF and M. All current settings are displayed on the top screen and in the viewfinder.  The Fn and PV buttons located on the front panel have become smaller and round.  A bracketing key and an additional hole for connecting a microphone are installed nearby.  The buttons for changing the mode and metering are located at the back.  Here you can find a two-way mode selector. </p><h2>  Auto Focus and Shooting </h2><p>  The maximum shooting speed is 5 frames per second.  If you activate the framing mode, it will increase to 6 frames per second.  In its price segment in this indicator, it is Nikon D810 that is considered one of the leaders.  A review of competing cameras is further proof of this.  Auto focus speed can be called excellent.  This is especially true for Live View.  The developers managed to achieve this largely due to the use of a module in the camera, which is used in more expensive models.  At the same time, one cannot fail to note the 51-point focusing system, which boasts high speed even in poor lighting conditions.  Moreover, 15 cross-type points are involved in the device system.  This means that the difference in contrast is analyzed both vertically and horizontally. </p>

    <h2>  Image Quality </h2><p>  At the first glance at the pictures taken with this camera, their highest quality becomes obvious (an example of the Nikon D810 Sample is given below).  The developers managed to achieve such an impressive result, largely due to the increase in the hardware range of the iSO.  The size of the spectrum for new items is from 64 to 12 800 units.  Its maximum rate in comparison with its predecessor has doubled.  It should be noted and just an incredible resolution of images.  Details are superbly transmitted even at high iSOs.  As shown by numerous examples of photos taken using the Nikon D810 model, the color rendition on them is notable for a slight shift towards blue.  Be that as it may, even the bodily shades look quite natural.  The average size of a photograph taken in maximum quality is 25 megabytes, and its size is 7360 x 4912 pixels.  The main thing that you should not forget about is that to obtain high-quality images you need to use good lenses. </p>

    <h2>  Video recording </h2><p>  The device provides the possibility of filming in Full HD with five different levels of frame rate per second and two quality levels.  At the same time, the clips are accompanied by stereo sound.  The maximum recording time in normal quality is 30 minutes, and in high quality - 20 minutes.  These restrictions do not apply when shooting by connecting an external recorder using an HDMI cable.  An innovation in the Nikon D810 camera was the availability of an improved image control mode.  It is used to obtain maximum dynamic range.  As practice shows, the built-in microphone to create professional clips is not enough, so you need to use an auxiliary device.  In order to monitor sound quality during the creation of commercials, the manufacturing company provided the ability to connect headphones.  As with any other modern camera, a button is installed here for directly starting video recording.  It can be found right next to the shutter button. </p>

    <h2>  Flash </h2><p>  Unlike its main competitors, the camera is equipped with a built-in retractable flash.  The developers have provided for her a number of features.  In particular, it can be synchronized by the rear or front curtain, act as a leader, and also work with manual or automatic activation.  In addition, the flash is equipped with a red-eye reduction function. </p><h2>  Night shooting </h2><p>  At a fairly high level are in the new Nikon D810 camera characteristics of night shooting.  The device supports shutter speeds up to thirty seconds.  In addition, a mode is provided here, when activated, shooting can be carried out for the entire period of time while the shutter button is pressed.  This can be very useful when taking pictures in the dark.  In addition, the user can independently configure the noise reduction function, which allows to reduce to almost zero the likelihood of the appearance of so-called hot pixels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nikon d810 sample" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/680743.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The <span>Nikon</span> D810 uses the same battery pack as the D800E.  It is designed to create 1200 photos without additional recharging.  It should be noted that for such devices this can be called a decent indicator.  In addition, the battery pack is interchangeable with a similar device from the D4 model. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Without a doubt, the Nikon D810 camera can claim the title of dream of both a beginner and a professional photographer.  Regardless of the location of the shooting, whether it be nature or a studio, the user will receive high-quality photographs.  This can explain the fact that the cost of the device in the salons of domestic stores starts from a mark of 130 thousand rubles.  In this case, we are talking about the price of only one case, excluding investment in the lens.  However, as evidenced by numerous expert reviews, the camera is really worth the money.  And for a true professional, such an amount cannot be called very scary for such a serious device.  The camera surpasses its predecessor in many ways, and its acquisition, without a doubt, will be a significant step forward. </p>
