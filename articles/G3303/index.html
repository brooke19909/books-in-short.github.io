These cheap full-fledged apartments are considered an excellent option for a budget, inexpensive vacation. </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  Jolly 3 * can be found at: Jadranski put bb, Budva.  The main landmark is the location on the opposite side of the Slovenska Plaza hotel.  There are apartments in the city, so be prepared for the fact that cars will pass along the road, dogs will bark in the next house, and shops are located nearby.  But you must be mentally prepared for the fact that this is an ordinary city street.  But only 200 meters to the sea.  The beach is small-pebble, the Adriatic Sea is warm, and what else is needed for a great vacation? </p>

    <p>  If you got to Montenegro by plane, then know that the nearest airport to Budva is called Tivat.  The distance from it to the city center is only 19 km.  Since the hotel does not provide transfers, it is easy to cover such a distance by minibus or boo and take a taxi.  You can also land at another airport, but it is already further from Budva.  Golubovtsi Airport is 42 km from the central part of the city.  But since Budva is a very popular destination for tourists from Europe, getting to the center is not difficult. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Description of beautiful places nearby </h2><p>  Tourists who first come to this small town on the Adriatic coast, of course, immediately go to see the sights of the city.  Since Jolly 3 * apartments are located in close proximity to the central part of the city, on the first day of settlement you can go for a walk in the old district.  Wander through the narrow streets, climb the fortress walls of the citadel, view the city from the observation deck.  Believe me, the panorama of Budva is impressive the first time, so do not regret 180 rubles (about 2.5 euros) for such a pleasure. </p>

    <p>  On the way, you can buy food for dinner, because each apartment has a fully equipped kitchen where you can prepare your own meals, and spend the money saved on excursions, for example, to the waterfalls and <span>canyons of Montenegro.</span> </p><h2>  Types of apartments </h2><p>  In total, Jolly 3 * has 7 apartments.  They differ in the size of the studio rooms and the size of the terraces.  Three apartments have the smallest footage of 28 m <sup>2</sup> .  They are located in the house under the numbers 202, 204, 206. Consider them more closely.  Each apartment has a kitchen, a bathroom with a shower, two twin beds, a wardrobe, a TV, a fridge, a kettle, a hairdryer, and bedside tables.  There is enough furniture to conveniently place all things.  A nice bonus is the presence of an open terrace measuring 8 m <sup>2</sup> .  And in the room, in addition to the terrace, there is also a small balcony of 4 m2. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The next three rooms in Jolly 3 * apartments have a larger footage.  These are 35 m <sup>2</sup> studios.  The apartment consists of two separate areas: a bedroom with a large double French bed and a dining room combined with a kitchen.  There is a wardrobe, dining table with chairs, TV, fridge, kettle.  In the bathroom, in addition to the toilet, there is also a shower and a hairdryer.  But be prepared for the fact that in room 207 the terrace is only 5 m <sup>2</sup> , although in the rest like 10 meters.  This is apartment number 201 and number 203. </p><h2>  The largest apartments </h2><p>  If you are going on vacation to Budva with children, then the largest apartment is located in apartments in Jolly 3 * at number 205.  Its total area is 48 m <sup>2</sup> .  There is a small corridor.  There is a small partition between the bedroom and living room.  There are two balconies in the apartment: 9 and 4 m <sup>2</sup> .  The studio combines a living space with a folding sofa and a kitchen with a dining room where you can eat at the dining table on the chairs. </p><p>  There is a TV and fridge, kettle and hairdryer.  The bedroom has a large double French bed. </p><p>  All the terraces and balconies of the apartments open onto a boulevard with a park area.  On the balconies are a small plastic table and two comfortable chairs. </p><h2>  Other services </h2><p>  There is a reception on the ground floor of Jolly 3 * in Budva, but it only works until 22.00.  If you arrived late at night, then be prepared for the fact that you may simply not be waiting.  Have to call the owner yourself.  So before planning a trip, consider this unpleasant moment.  Wi-Fi catches only near the reception desk. </p><p>  Each room has satellite TV.  There is even a safe where you can hide the most valuable things.  The room is cleaned daily, and bed linen and towels are changed every three days. </p>

    <p>  All rooms are located on the second floor of the apartment building Jolly 3 *.  If you arrived in Budva by your car, then there is free parking near the house. </p><p>  The beach located near the apartments is municipal and free, but you will have to pay extra for sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  All tourists note the good location of the apartment.  The city center and the beach are in the immediate vicinity.  It is convenient that there is a kitchen and large balconies.  Perfectly suited for budget and undemanding tourists. </p><p>  Of the negative reviews, the following claims of some demanding residents can be noted.  The owner rarely appears, it is impossible to get through to him.  Outside the windows, a city line with all the corresponding noise. </p><p>  So make the choice yourself.  If you want to save on housing, then this placement is perfect. </p>
