Cozy rooms at low prices, high-quality service, great views, proximity to the sea - all this is a clear advantage of the guest house. </p><h2>  What is a guest house? </h2><p>  The phenomenon of the guest house has existed for a very long time.  It takes its roots from ancient times.  All guest houses in Adler - “Sofia”, “Lazur”, “By the Sea”, operate on the same principle - the building itself is a private property, the owner of which rents it in whole or separately by room.  Very often, the owners of such houses live there and are directly involved in servicing their guests. </p>

    <p>  About all services that are provided in the guest house, its owner must report to the relevant government agencies.  This for tourists has its positive aspects: if you provide low-quality services, you have every right to contact the regulatory authorities and demand that an inspection be carried out in this house. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Honey, 2 </h2><p>  The place where the Sofia guest house is located (Adler, Medova, 2) is very convenient for tourists, since the Black Sea coast is located 500 meters from it.  A four-story house is often called a hotel, although it is not.  Across the road is the Adlerkurort association, which includes an oceanarium, water park, night club, dolphinarium and other entertainment facilities. </p><p>  In total, 44 places are offered here, in each room there is a TV, air conditioning, refrigerator, dishes, as well as all the necessary furniture.  The guest house, unfortunately, does not accept visitors with animals, so if you are going to relax with your pets, it is best to look for another place for them.  The cost of daily living in such a guest house ranges from 800 to 1400 rubles, depending on the time of year in which you relax. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  If you intend to relax in the south, be sure to pay attention to the guest house "Sofia" (Adler).  Reviews about this place, located on Medova Street, are mostly positive.  Many in the house are attracted by its convenient location in relation to the sea and all the necessary infrastructure, low prices - another reason to relax here. </p>

    <p>  Among the negative aspects, vacationers note too few rooms, which is why rooms have to be booked almost a month in advance.  In addition, the guest house only accepts guests from May 1 to October 31, although many other similar establishments work year-round.  The management explains this by the small number of guests in the winter season, and so far does not plan to switch to a year-round mode of operation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Vegetarian, 13 </h2><p>  It just so happened that in the same city there are several guest houses with the same name.  If you are going to Adler, the guest house Sofia (13 Vegetarian) will be happy to welcome you as a guest.  From it to the sea coast you need to walk about ten minutes on foot, so it is in less demand compared to other tourist complexes. </p><p>  The management of the guest house offers a standard set of services, the rooms are equipped with TVs, refrigerators, air conditioning and satellite TV, some of them have their own kitchenettes, free parking here includes parking and Wi-Fi.  There is a railway station near the house, so it’s worth checking in there only if you are sure that you can withstand the constant noise of trains. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Guest house "Sofia" (Adler), located on the Vegetarian, to the liking of many vacationers arriving from far corners of Russia.  Tourists during the trip get used to traveling by train, and living in such a guest house reminds them of the trip.  In addition, the cost of renting a room in this institution is lower compared to others. </p>

    <p>  Among the negative aspects, vacationers note the distance from the sea - not everyone wants to go to the coast for about ten minutes.  The entire entertainment infrastructure is located away from Sofia, which also negatively affects the number of visitors.  As for the service, guests do not have to complain - the administration of the house is ready to answer any questions and provide any feasible help. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Sofia 2 </h2><p>  Sofia-2 Guest House (Adler), reviews of which have already been distributed throughout the south of Russia, is located at the following address: ul.  <span>Pavlik Morozov,</span> 64. It is located a five-minute walk from the Black Sea coast, which is very convenient for those who like hiking and sea air.  The house is located four kilometers from <span>Adler Train Station</span> and Sochi Airport. </p>

    <p>  One of the main disadvantages of this guest house, according to vacationers, is that not every room has a bathroom.  During the swimming season, you can close your eyes to this, but when it comes to an end, living in such an institution is quite difficult.  It offers guests escort of the guide, a playground for children, laundry, terrace, as well as all the necessary accessories for a barbecue. </p><h2>  Villa "Sofia" </h2><p>  There are institutions even more remote from the sea, for example, the guest house Villa Sofia.  Adler is generally very rich in places with similar names, tourists do not immediately get used to it.  This house is located at Democratic, 62a, and it takes about 15 minutes to get to the beach from it.  But there are pluses - next to the mini-hotel are the most important infrastructure facilities - the central market, shopping and entertainment complexes and a cinema. </p><p>  From the train station to the villa "Sofia" can be reached in 10 minutes by bus, which is very convenient.  Choose between double rooms with private balconies.  You can also stay in triple rooms.  The kitchen is offered shared, it is located on the second floor of the guest house.  The cost of living varies from 1200 to 1600 rubles per day, depending on the category of the selected room. </p>

    <p>  The guest house is located a 15-minute walk to the center of Adler, it is most often called a mini-hotel in order to at least somehow distinguish from a large number of institutions of the same name.  It is located next to the Znaniye boarding house, where the Uro-Pro Medical Clinic conducts its work. Those who plan to start treatment can stay here.  A ten-minute walk from Sofia, there is an oceanarium, and several retail outlets, a Magnit store and a Sberbank ATM are located next to the mini-hotel. </p><h2>  Why exactly here? </h2><p>  Every year, tourists from Russia and the former CIS countries travel south to improve their health, enjoy the warm sun and swim in the Black Sea.  Regardless of which guest house Sofia (Adler) you choose, you will have the opportunity to take full advantage of all the services offered.  The existing hotels, guest houses and hotels offer free Wi-Fi, so those vacationers who are important to always be in touch will be able to immediately share pictures and impressions about the rest with their friends. </p><p>  It is important that in the territory of Adler there are a large number of medical institutions that help all their patients get rid of existing diseases.  The key is the position of doctors - it is important for them not only to rid a person of all existing ailments, but also to help restore all the damaged functions of the suffering body.  This approach is an advantage of local health resorts, which are famous for their quality treatment.  When traveling for treatment, you must first select the most convenient institution and book a ward in it. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Those who have been vacationing in this resort city for more than one season recommend visiting the Sofia guest house (Adler), which is located on Medova Street.  The main reason is the high-quality service, which is now widely appreciated in the tourism industry.  Vacation prices here are average compared to other travel agencies, but vacationers prefer to pay a little more and live as close to the sea coast and the beach as possible.  Another plus of this particular guest house is the following: just cross the road and you will immediately find yourself in the center with a lot of entertainment facilities. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is recommended to clarify the cost of accommodation in the guest house, hotel or mini-hotel you are interested in, since prices may change periodically.  It is best to book rooms a month or two before the intended trip, as in the summer they sell out at record speeds.  The same applies to rail and air tickets, if you wish, you can book them 30-45 days before the departure date.  It should be remembered that, depending on the time of year, the fare can both increase and decrease.  Have a good rest! </p>
