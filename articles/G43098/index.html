This smartphone has recently become quite popular among its counterparts.  And for this reason, buyers are trying to leave more and more feedback about it.  True, sometimes it‚Äôs quite difficult to understand from them what this smartphone really is.  But we will try to understand this difficult issue.  Your attention will be presented to the characteristics of the phone, as well as customer reviews about it.  And only a thorough analysis will help to fully understand the situation. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  To begin with, our today's product is nothing more than a <span>large-screen smartphone.</span>  That is how its manufacturer is positioning.  That is, if you decide to buy yourself an inexpensive, but good smartphone with a large display, you can rely on Explay Blaze completely. </p>

    <p>  How many specific inches does this model have?  5.5 to be extremely precise.  It is somewhat reminiscent of a mini-tablet.  After all, such a technique displays from 6 inches.  In this smartphone, it will be possible to easily and simply realize many of the modern needs of customers: watching movies, reading books, surfing the Internet and so on.  In general, a pretty good option for any, even the most "moody" user.  The Explay Blaze display is the first thing consumers are paying attention to.  It is not only large, but also shows bright, saturated colors.  Those that many analogues are simply not capable of.  The resolution on this smartphone is also pretty good - 960 by 540 pixels.  You can be sure that even in the sunniest weather your phone will show you truly unforgettable and clear colors on the screen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It is also important to pay attention to the memory of a modern smartphone.  The thing is that every user now plays games.  And they need space.  Plus, there are so many different applications that interest consumers.  They are also "weighty." </p><p>  But the Explay Blaze features in all plans provide us with such that we can not worry.  There is 4 GB of ‚Äúown‚Äù memory in it.  Not very much, but, nevertheless, it is more than in many other analog models.  Plus, with the "Explay" you have the opportunity to put yourself a memory card up to 32 GB.  In truth, this is a small minus of this smartphone.  After all, some modern phones allow you to insert a memory card up to 64 GB.  However, most of this volume, as a rule, is clogged with "trash".  And 32 GB is enough.  And for games, and for business.  The memory card slot is also very convenient - Micro SD.  Such memory in modern stores is extremely common, and is also not very expensive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay blaze phone" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/949099.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There is also such a thing as RAM.  She also plays an important role in smartphones.  The Explay Blaze phone is equipped with as much as 1 GB of RAM.  To be honest, this is enough for any modern smartphone.  Do not look for more RAM - it will be easier and more reliable to buy the most ordinary tablet.  But if you need a phone, then you really should pay your attention to the "Express". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  SIM card </h2><p>  Another pretty important point for any modern user is the support of SIM-cards by a smartphone.  The thing is that many models have now switched to the "Nano Sim" or "Micro Sim" format.  This means that if you have an old number (quite old), then the phone will have a simple SIM card.  And you can‚Äôt put it into a new smartphone.  Only if you try to replace it completely or trim it carefully.  The second option is better not to use, at least independently. </p><p>  But Explay Blaze offers us pretty good conditions for use.  It supports 2 types of SIM cards.  One of them is "Micro SIM".  It is very comfortable.  So, for example, now you can use the work number and home at the same time.  And with all this, do not think about replacing any SIM cards. </p><p>  To be honest, many models do not work well with two numbers at the same time.  But not Explay Blaze.  This smartphone can really function normally without causing a malfunction on the line.  Even when you have different phone operators.  The quality of communication in this case cannot but rejoice. </p><h2>  CPU and system </h2><p>  It is also important to know the processor and operating system information of your smartphone.  Why?  Everything is exactly the same as on computers - depending on the system and power, you may (or may not) be able to use certain programs and applications.  In addition, the firmware also depends on this.  Explay Blaze, like many modern phones, offers us an Android base.  But, to be honest, a fairly new version is 4.2.2.  At the time of the creation of this model, it was the newest version of the system.  So, you can easily launch modern games, as well as programs for the phone.  Many buyers are chasing this opportunity.  And now you can have it without any problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="display explay blaze" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/949098.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  What about the processor?  It also plays an important role.  Explay Blaze is equipped with a 1.3 GHz quad-core processor.  In truth, this is quite good power for a modern smartphone.  Some tablets do not have these characteristics.  And in combination with "Android 4.2.2" you will have in your hands not just a phone, but a real "beast".  It is also worth considering that the assembly of the operating system on this smartphone is "Jolly Bean".  This is a pretty good system that has more than once established itself as a quality system. </p><h2>  Networks </h2><p>  Explay Blaze Black also receives reviews regarding supported networks.  Of course, it is communication that plays an important role on any phone.  And how are things going here? </p><p>  Actually, very good.  There is GPS, and Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.0.  Also, this model supports 3G and 4G communication.  Just what the modern buyer needs.  Especially when working with the Internet or some applications. </p><p>  In truth, now many phones do not support 4G.  And for this reason, consumers refuse them.  Indeed, now this new type of connection guarantees us not only quick processing of this, but also a high-quality connection.  What else does the telephone need to perform its standard functions?  Probably nothing.  After all, calls (more precisely, their quality) depend on the connection.  Fortunately, Explay Blaze is the best solution you can imagine. </p><h2>  Multimedia </h2><p>  For most modern users, it is important that their smartphone is not only a means of communication, but also a multifunctional machine that will shoot video, take photos, and also play music.  Roughly speaking - a universal small multimedia center with support for communications and the Internet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone explay blaze" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/949097.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Fortunately, Explay Blaze photos and videos create great quality.  This model is equipped with a 8 megapixel camera.  This quality is often not endowed with many cameras ("soap dishes" or "home" models).  Plus, the high resolution of the screen makes itself felt. </p><p>  There is also a so-called front camera in the "Play".  It is very convenient if you like to talk using the video on Skype.  Or if you like taking selfies.  The quality here is not very good - only 2 megapixels.  But for the front camera, this is enough.  Also, many buyers note that the videos are shot in Full-HD format.  Just what a modern client needs. </p><p>  What about music being played?  She is also happy.  The sound is quite even, loud and clear, without wheezing and other third-party violations.  For such a sound, music lovers chase for a very long time.  But with Explay Blaze, you no longer need to look for a smartphone that is more suitable for listening to music.  And if you consider that you can insert a memory card into the phone, then there are a lot of multimedia spaces in this model. </p><h2>  Phone operation </h2><p>  Many people think about how to delete contacts with Blaze Explay.  But this question will seem a mere trifle in comparison with the eternal telephone theme - how long will this or that model work without recharging.  Many pay close attention to this item. </p><p>  How are we doing with today's model?  To be honest, it‚Äôs also pretty good.  It is worth emphasizing immediately the fact that the operating time depends on the number of SIM cards used, as well as on the intensity of use daily.  In principle, as in any other phone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay blaze specifications" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/949096.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In general, the situation here is the following: in standby mode, the Explay Blaze smartphone works for a month.  When answering one call from one SIM card - 3 weeks, from two - 2.5 weeks.  Also, with normal average use, when 2 SIM cards are included, the operation of this model without recharging will last about a week.  It turns out that this is an excellent choice for those who plan to always stay in touch and at the same time actively use their smartphone.  To understand how well it works, you need to try it in action yourself. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  Well, the design of the phone is also important.  In general, this is not an indicator of quality.  But this criterion plays an extremely important role among buyers.  To be honest, it‚Äôs hard for a modern consumer to please. </p><p>  But Explay Blaze was able to do this.  The design of this model can be called minimalism.  Simple colors, ‚Äúsoft‚Äù corners at the edges - just what will be convenient to lie in your hand and look stylish.  In general, there are currently two options for selling a smartphone - black and white.  The darker ‚Äúcoloring‚Äù is especially popular.  She looks tasteful, casts a beautiful sheen.  But the white socket is not inferior.  Its appearance, like velvet, attracts the public.  It's just that they treat dark models, for some unknown reason, with great respect. </p>

    <p>  Since the design suits, then sometimes the colors are not quite right.  If you do not want to have a black or white smartphone, then you can always change the socket to the one you dream about.  In stores now it is very easy to find.  Different colors, with drawings and inscriptions - all that you can wish for. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  An important role in <span>choosing a phone,</span> especially a modern one, is played by its price.  Yes, indeed, you can choose a high-quality, ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù model with a bunch of functions that might not be useful to you at all, but give a lot of money for it.  Such smartphones, as a rule, do not "live" for long.  And you can just thoroughly search and find a practical, stylish and multi-functional model. </p><p>  This is exactly what Explay Blaze is all about.  The price tag on this product does not exceed 8,000 rubles.  In principle, given the capabilities of this phone, we can say that the price is quite low.  Now, such models cost about 8 to 15 thousand rubles.  So buyers are happy with this price.  Yes, some still say that it would be possible to make the model cheaper.  But there are such people everywhere.  They are "by default" unhappy with everything. </p><h2>  Survivability </h2><p>  The most important point that you can directly imagine when evaluating the phone is its durability.  Yes, specifications and price are important.  But even more important is the quality of the technology.  Therefore, many prefer to take a less powerful, but better and more tenacious phone. </p><p>  Unfortunately, Explay Blaze enjoys far from the best popularity in this regard.  If you handle it normally, then, indeed, your smartphone will "live" for a long time.  But in emergency situations (especially if they happen often) you can not count on longevity.  On average, this model works fine for about 3-4 years.  So the manufacturer promises.  And these promises can be readily believed.  Do not drop the phone from the 8th floor to the asphalt and lower it into the toilet - then your equipment will work well and for a long time. </p><h2>  Determined </h2><p>  So it's time to think about whether to buy this smartphone.  In fact, if you want to get a high-quality and inexpensive phone that will take good pictures and videos, as well as be useful for working with the Internet and games, then Explay Blaze is a great option.  The main thing is that it fits into your price limits for such a product. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="explay blaze black reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/949094.jpg" width="600"></div>

And when buying, try to follow the rules of operation.  This will extend the ‚Äúlife‚Äù of your technique. </p>
