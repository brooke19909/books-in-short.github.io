This is a city hotel, but a five-minute walk from it is one of the unique sandy beaches.  The hotel is perfect for both youth parties and family vacations (although many recommend that parents with children not to go here, however, there are good reviews from family vacationers).  There is also the opportunity to take sea baths, swimming pools and a SPA center for those who wish to relax and improve their health, discos with animation.  The hotel also offers all inclusive meals, so people accustomed to the Turkish or Egyptian leisure system will not have to strain.  And not all beach hotels of the Greek islands work this way.  For example, a hotel with a similar name - Majestic Hotel (Rhodes) - includes breakfast only.  So be careful when booking a hotel with tour operators.  But let's talk about everything in order, focusing on the characteristics of the reviews of travelers who rested here.  Indeed, in this way you can get an idea about this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic hotel and spa 4" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/516505.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  To get to the Majestic Hotel (Zakynthos), you can either take a ferry from the Peloponnese or fly directly to the island's airport.  If you fly to Athens, it‚Äôs the cheapest way to travel by bus or train to Kipini, where you need to catch a ferry.  They mostly go in the summer.  A scheduled plane also flies here from Athens - the travel time is less than an hour.  But directly from Russia only charters from Moscow or St. Petersburg run.  Fly from three and a half to four hours.  Charter flights themselves are only available during the season, that is, from mid-May to the first decade of October. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Zakynthos and Laganas </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the resort where the Majestic Hotel SPA is located.  Zakynthos is the third largest among the Ionian Islands.  It is very conveniently located - it is easy to get to mainland <span>Greece from here.</span>  <span>Zakynthos</span> is known for its amazing natural beauty, so the Venetians at one time called it the "flower of lavender."  And Laganas is without a doubt one of the largest resorts of the island, like a magnet that attracts young people and families with children, as well as those who want to improve their health and swim in the clear sea.  In July-August, unique <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãturtles</span> lay their eggs on the beach <span>,</span> so part of the coast is reserved for the reserve.  In season, the <span>most famous DJs</span> from all over the world come to this town, and almost every day you can get to some kind of festival, festival or party. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic hotel spa zakynthos" class="if" height="234" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/514556.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Majestic Hotel SPA (Zakynthos) is almost the only hotel on the whole island that offers an all inclusive food system.  Please note that the cuisine here is much tastier than in Egypt.  Buffett is served in the main restaurant, which serves not only Greek, but also local cuisine.  Dinner here ends quite early - at nine in the evening.  But snacks and drinks in the bar, including by the pool, you can enjoy up to eleven.  The restaurant has a very good pastry chef - delicious pastries.  Everything is tasty, fresh and varied - meat, poultry, fish, seafood.  The grill is beyond praise.  Good fruit - especially a lot of melons and watermelons, and twice a day.  Excellent alcohol - wine, beer, rum, vodka, whiskey, Metax brandy - all without restriction.  You can take ice cream all day.  Regarding the all-inclusive system, the opinions of tourists were divided.  Some are advised to take it, because it can save money (otherwise you will have to pay extra).  Others, although praising hotel food, offer lunch or dinner somewhere else while traveling in the vicinity - they say, it is more authentic. </p><h2>  Sea and beach </h2><p>  Only three hundred meters separate the Majestic Hotel and SPA 4 * hotel from the beach.  It is municipal, like the entire coast on Zakynthos.  Therefore, if you want to sunbathe on a sunbed or deck chair under an umbrella, you will have to rent them.  But on the territory of the hotel itself there is a huge outdoor pool for adults and a pond for children.  Sun beds near it are free, and there are enough of them for vacationers.  By the way, Laganas Bay, where the beach is located, is included in the national reserves - here you can see the unique ‚ÄúCaretta‚Äù turtle.  Therefore, it is not surprising that it is very clean.  Its beach stretches for nine kilometers and is the longest in all of Greece.  The water is very warm and the sunset is soft, so tourists with children are very happy.  The left lane of the beach is wider, there are a lot of cafes and taverns nearby.  The sand is small, pleasant, the bay is very good, there are practically no waves, and the water is simply unrealistic turquoise.  Turtles often swim in it, which kids love to watch.  The water is the warmest on the island, so you can come here at the beginning of the season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Majestic hotel zakynthos" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/516491.jpg" width="335"></div>

    <h2>  Trips around </h2><p>  Of course, the most popular excursion that is usually booked at the Majestic SPA Hotel 4 * (Zakynthos) is Turtle Islands (Marathonissi).  And here you can swim in the caves, watch sea animals on a glass-bottom boat, ride a canoe.  By renting a bicycle or car, you can explore the surroundings with its famous olive groves and vineyards.  In addition, tourists are strongly advised to visit various beaches and bays of Zakynthos, breathtaking in their beauty, especially Navagio, Gerkas, Banana, Daphnia ... This can be done by car, bicycle, scooter ... And any village where you just stop by will shock you with its hospitality, delicious wine and nice people.  And just taking a walk around Laganos or going to the island's capital of the same name is a pleasure.  A very popular boat trip around Zakynthos on a double-decker boat with a pool.  It is also advised to rent a quad bike - it is cheaper and safer. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Tours to this hotel in the low season start from fifty to sixty thousand rubles for two people per week.  In principle, this is the cheapest Quartet with all-inclusive.  As for the prices of various services that are not included in the payment for accommodation, the picture is approximately the following.  If you want to use towels by the pool, you will need to pay one euro for their rental.  Or buy for 5 –Ñ in any store.  ‚ÄúWi-Fi‚Äù - 3 –Ñ per hour, 30 - per week.  But near the hotel there is a McDonald's, and from there you can catch a net for free.  Air conditioning in the room is also for money - 3-5 –Ñ per day.  Sunbeds on the beach - five to six euros per day for two.  But if you buy something in a cafe, also equipped for relaxing on the beach, you can take them for free and sunbathe until the evening.  Tours are advised to buy from tour operators in Laganas - the prices there are half the price.  If you are planning to travel to Zakynthos yourself, the bus costs 1.3 euros one way.  ATV rental - 23 –Ñ per day, car - 55. A boat trip around the island on a luxury boat will cost twenty-three euros.  Entrance to night clubs is free, cocktails cost about 2-3 –Ñ. </p><h2>  What tourists mostly write about this hotel </h2><p>  Zakynthos Majestic Hotel and SPA is primarily good for partying, energetic and not very picky youth.  Here you need to relax people who want to plunge into the nightlife, not think about food and live in comfortable conditions.  After all, they often go to Zakynthos for this.  The location of the hotel almost on the main street, where the most popular night clubs are located, attracts lovers here to have fun and have a good time.  Some claim that it is much better here than in Ibiza.  But at the same time, no noise is heard from the street in the hotel‚Äôs inner courtyard, and it is forbidden to make noise in the hotel itself after eleven in the evening - this is actually being watched.  Rest here is also recommended to those who come with a good company of friends, and also loves to travel around the surroundings - they are so picturesque that they have enough impressions for a whole year.  In a word, this is a wonderful youth hotel on an insanely beautiful island.  Only now there is often not enough time to sleep.  Although for young people this is only a plus.  The main thing here is not boring.  But if you are traveling with family or children, it is better in May or September - it is not so hot, and the number of party people is sharply reduced.  Just do not confuse this hotel with the Majestic Hotel 2 *, which is located in Rhodes.  This is an ordinary city hotel, and you will not find a spa center, parties with nightlife, or a sandy beach nearby. </p>
