  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Femur: structure, function, damage</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The largest <span>tubular bone in the</span> human body is the femur.  The features of all tubular bones are the presence of a body and two ends. </p><p>  The location of the head of this bone is based on the end of the superior proximal, it serves to connect with the pelvic bone.  Direction medially and upward is characterized by the surface of the head, called articular.  In its middle is the fossa of the femoral head, which is the site of attachment of the ligament of the bone head.  The head and body are connected by the neck of the bone, forming an angle with it up to one hundred and thirty degrees. </p><p>  On the border of the neck and body are two bony large tubercles, which are called skewers.  The location of the greater trochanter has on its medial surface, which faces the neck, a trochanteric fossa.  It is located above and laterally.  The small trochanter is located medially and behind, near the lower edge of the neck.  These two trochanters have an intertrochanteric line connecting them at the back, called an intertrochanteric crest. </p><p>  The femur, or rather its body, is of a cylindrical shape, which is curved by the convex part anteriorly, and around the longitudinal axis it looks as if twisted.  The body of the bone has a smooth surface, the back has a line that is slightly rough, and it is divided into two lips - medial and lateral.  The middle of the femur connects these lips closely, and to the lower and upper direction they begin to diverge.  Both lips are directed to the trochanteric femoris - large and small.  The lateral lip enlarges and becomes much thicker, at the end turning into the gluteal tuberosity, which is the place where the <span>gluteus maximus muscle</span> attaches <span>.</span>  Sometimes this tuberosity has the appearance of a third trochanter.  The medial lip passes into a rough line.  Reaching the lower end of the femur, the two lips diverge from each other, forming a popliteal surface in the shape of a triangle. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The distal end of the bone is slightly widened, forming two condyles of a large rounded shape.  These condyles are distinguished by the magnitude and degree of curvature of the articular surface. </p><p>  The medial condyle is larger, the lateral one is smaller.  Both condyles are located at the same level, and behind them they are separated by a fossa called the intercondylar fossa.  On top of the articular surface of the medial condyle, there is a medial epicondyle, and also the lateral side of the condyle has a lateral epicondyle, which is much smaller than the medial one.  In front, both condyles with their articular surfaces pass into each other.  This forms a concave patellar surface, to which the posterior side of the patella is attached. </p><p>  Since the <span>human</span> femur is the largest bone, it is most susceptible to various deformations.  The most severe of these are fractures.  When the anatomical integrity of the bone is violated - this is a fracture.  The reasons for it can be different: a direct hit on the thigh, a fall on solid objects and much more.  If the femur is broken, then this injury is considered severe.  In this case, there may be significant loss of blood and <span>pain shock.</span>  Naturally, walking becomes impossible, and any load on the injured limb is also excluded.  The leg undergoing deformation is shortened.  Large vessels of this limb can be damaged as a result of displacement of fragments, especially in the lower third, when a backward displaced fragment damages the <span>popliteal artery,</span> causing profuse bleeding.  The thigh should be fixed immediately.  For this, a tire is applied, anesthesia is done, and then the victim is taken to the traumatology department. </p><p>  The structure of the femur is extremely simple, however, it performs the main function - it keeps the body load and the body itself in balance, participates in complex motor manipulations, and is the basis for articulating the lower extremities with the pelvis.  Such opportunities were presented to her by nature itself, therefore, it is necessary to treat your health with care. </p>
