There is an opportunity to make your child such a small but surprising gift - to be in the role of a brave sailor at least on New Year's holiday.

    <h2>  Measures for the manufacture of a visor </h2><p>  For the manufacture of a sailor's headdress, any thick paper is needed, a large sheet of whatman paper would be ideal.  First you need to measure the circumference of the child‚Äôs head.  In order for the sailor's visor made of paper to hold well on his head, you need to add another three centimeters to the resulting size.  This will be needed for bonding and free donning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="paper sailor cap" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/405385.jpg" width="300"></div>

The first part is the peakless side.  For its manufacture, you need to draw a strip with the appropriate dimensions.  The length should be equal to the circumference of the head and plus three centimeters.  The height of the strip is 5 centimeters.  Next, draw the top.  In order for the baby to fit the peak of paper, it is necessary to make the top voluminous.  To do this, we need to draw two circles.  Small circle radius (and this will be the inner one): head <span>circumference</span> divided by 0.6.  Having received the radius of the circle, we must draw the circle itself.  Then, to the obtained value, that is, to the radius of the small circle, you need to add 7 cm. This will be the radius of the large (outer circle).  By the obtained value we also draw the second circle.  When plotting, it must be borne in mind that the center of both circles must be single.  In the finished form, you should get a circle in the center of which is a round hole.  It then needs to be cut.  Next, you need to cut another circle, equal to a large one.  Now it‚Äôs already clear <span>how to make a cap</span> on the paper with your own hands. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a cap out of paper" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/405407.jpg" width="301"></div>

    <h2>  Assembly parts </h2><p>  When three paper parts are ready, you can start joining.  Initially, you need to glue two circles with PVA glue.  To do this, smear the circle around the edges of the circle without a hole with glue, put a circle with a hole on top.  The edges should be tightly connected, but you need to pay attention so that the glue does not get on the main part.  While the round parts are glued together, you can do the side.  There is nothing complicated in this case.  It‚Äôs already clear how to make a cap out of paper.  The ends of the strip must be glued.  When the side dries, you will need to attach the top to it.  To do this, make notches or incisions on the lower circle (which is with a hole).  Scissors over the entire radius need to cut pieces about 5 mm long after 3-4 cm. Then bend them and gently stick to the side.  Allow the workpiece to dry.  Now we know how to make a cap out of paper with your own hands.  It will take a little time for this. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="peakless paper" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14030/405416.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <h2>  Visor design </h2><p>  When the preparation of the seamen's headgear is ready, you can proceed to its design.  You can paint the side before gluing with blue paint.  It is certainly fast, but not very interesting.  It is better to use a blue satin ribbon for this.  It can be glued to <span>PVA glue,</span> or use a thread with a needle and gently fasten in several places.  Paper stitches need to be made small, and attention must be paid so that the needle is thin and sharp, otherwise you can break the rim.  It is also necessary to burn the ends of the ribbon with a match, so that then it does not open.  The satin ribbon should be twenty centimeters longer than the size of the head circumference.  After all, with a sailor, ribbons develop in the wind.  Therefore, attaching it to the side, you should not sew on the ends themselves, but at a distance of ten centimeters from the end.  Now it has become known how to make a peakless cap out of paper with your own hands.  Before you put on a baby <span>'s sailor suit,</span> you must not forget about the paraphernalia.  To do this, the front visor must be decorated with an anchor.  It can be cut out of velvet paper, or you can purchase a finished application.  With a velvet anchor, with a flying satin ribbon, the baby will feel like a real conqueror of the sea.  You can also make a real marine collar to a peak (you can also not sew from fabric, but <span>cut from paper).</span> </p>
