    <p>  Statistical indicators are a qualitative as well as a quantitative characteristic of any property of a certain population.  Both of these sides form the structure of this concept.  Quality is determined by the sign that is being studied, it can be judged by the name of the indicator.  And the quantitative side is displayed in its numerical value. </p><p>  The system of statistical indicators consists of a combination of several such characteristics.  It is used in order to study and display the qualitative and quantitative aspects of processes and phenomena occurring in the life of society.  In this case, the conditions of a particular place and time are always taken into account. </p><p>  The characteristic given by statistical indicators is always generalizing.  This is their main difference from the individual values ‚Äã‚Äãof a particular attribute.  For example, the private option is the salary of an individual employee of the company, and the average salary of all employees of the same company is already a statistical indicator.  You can get it, unlike the first, only by simple or complex calculations. </p><p>  Since statistical indicators reflect different sides of processes and phenomena occurring in the economy and in social life, there are several of them.  They can be classified according to several criteria: </p><p>  1. By units of aggregate, which may be the following: </p><p>  1) Summary.  These are generalized, abstract indicators.  They give a characteristic of the entire population as a whole and are divided in turn into: </p><p>  - Estimated.  They are obtained using special formulas.  They are needed to solve certain problems of statistical analysis. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - Volumetric.  They are obtained by summing several attribute values ‚Äã‚Äãof certain elements of the population. </p><p>  2) Customized.  They characterize only one unit of the aggregate or one object.  This may be, for example, the number of employees in the enterprise. </p><p>  2. Classification of statistical indicators by the functions that they perform: </p><p>  1) Predictive.  They show what the state of the phenomenon being studied can be in the future. </p><p>  2) Accounting.  They show the state in which the phenomena that are being investigated are present. </p><p>  3) Planned.  They are focused on ensuring that the tasks assigned are carried out. </p><p>  3. In the form of expression: </p><p>  1) Relative.  In relation to the absolute, these indicators are secondary, derivatives.  They express the correlation between the quantitative characteristics of <span>statistical aggregates.</span>  <span>Relative indicators are</span> calculated by dividing the absolute indicators.  They can be named, as well as expressed as percentages or ratios.  <span>Relative indicators</span> are divided into three subspecies: </p><p>  - structures; </p><p>  - plan; </p><p>  - speakers. </p><p>  2) Absolute.  This is the initial form by which statistical indicators are expressed.  These quantities characterize the absolute dimensions of those phenomena that are being studied.  These are always named numbers.  Absolute indicators are expressed in cost units of measure, labor and in-kind. </p><p>  3) Medium.  This form of indicators is the most common.  It characterizes the level typical of the phenomenon.  This indicator can be calculated either per unit of attribute, or per unit of the statistical population. </p><p>  4. According to the time factor: </p><p>  1) Instant.  They give a characterization of those processes and phenomena that occur in the economy and in society on a certain date. </p><p>  2) Interval.  They give a characterization of those processes and phenomena that occur in the economy and in society over a certain time period (year or month, quarter, etc.). </p><p>  To describe all indicators using conventional signs and images, it is customary to use special drawings - graphs in statistics. </p>
