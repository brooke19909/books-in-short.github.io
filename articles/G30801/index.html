How to entertain a child?  Or maybe you want to go to a good movie theater or tickle your nerves at the rides?  You are invited to the largest entertainment center - Gorky Park.  Kharkov is rightly called a green city, however, the Gorky complex is considered the largest corner of nature. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  This entertainment center begins its history back in 1893.  Then the first trees were planted, they became the foundation of the future park zone.  In the 19th century, the square was named Nikolaevsky; it did not enter the territory of the city.  The grand opening of the park was made in 1907, by which time the small trees turned into majestic plants, which formed this corner of wildlife. </p><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a green complex belonged to the townspeople - they wanted to equip a zone where they could have a comfortable rest.  By the joint efforts of the authorities and local residents, about 98 hectares of forest stands were planted.  Long alleys, separated by plants, converged in a single center, which looked like a circular platform at the very entrance to the park.  Subsequently, the complex was named in honor of the writer M. Gorky. </p>

    <h2>  The fate of the beloved park </h2><p>  Locals love their park very much and relate to its history with trepidation.  He became a real symbol of the people's victory over the troubles and tribulations of different times.  The complex survived the Great Patriotic War, although most of the buildings were destroyed.  But the townspeople did not abandon their favorite vacation spot: volunteers and local authorities jointly restored and restored Gorky Park.  Kharkov has always been famous for its dedicated people who created wonderful monuments of wildlife.  A colonnade was erected at the entrance, which was designed by E. Svyatchenko and A. Krynkina.  At the end of the central alley, a large beautiful fountain was built.  The construction gave cool to guests in the hot summer days.  Nowadays, the park is thriving and hosts thousands of tourists and locals every day.  The complex has completely changed its appearance: a modern entertainment center has turned into a real Disneyland in Kharkov! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New life of the modern complex </h2><p>  The wonderful metamorphoses that the green corner of nature has undergone have been brought to life by city mayor G. Kernes.  The modern metropolis of entertainment for adults and children - this was Gorky Park.  Kharkov is perceived as a center of concentration of the most ambitious entertainment: in 2012, an updated park was opened, which surprises with its scale.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe measure was to create a real family-type center where every visitor will find entertainment to their liking.  Now the park has more than 40 types of various attractions.  Absolutely new devices were added to the usual entertainments that excite the consciousness of young and adult visitors. </p><p>  The project of the renewed park was composed and developed by specialists from abroad, and all new attractions were made in Canada, Italy, France and Germany. </p>

    <h2>  House of Horror </h2><p>  The pride of the entertainment center is the modern room of fear.  This is one of the attractions that once enjoyed particular popularity.  In Soviet times there was also a kind of prototype - a room of laughter.  Unfortunately, today there are fewer and fewer such attractions.  The room of fear (Gorky Park) will help to recall past times. <strong></strong>  Kharkov has become one of the few cities in which a complex has appeared that is not inferior in equipment to the best European counterparts.  "House of Horrors" is an attraction that is made in the form of an old abandoned mansion where you can meet the most terrible monsters.  Legend has it: in the old days, this estate was owned by Professor A. Kozlov, who practiced black magic.  But during his experiments, the scientist made a mistake and ... disappeared without a trace.  And dark powers, ghosts and even zombies took possession of the mansion.  So if you are going to visit this room of fear, be prepared for scary adventures and chilling encounters with fairy-tale characters. </p>
