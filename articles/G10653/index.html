Recipes for the multicooker Redmond M90</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>The Redmond</span> M90 crock-pot is a true leader among similar devices presented today in the market of household appliances.  It is difficult to find another kitchen appliance that could compete with this model.  Thanks to a stylish futuristic design and a wide range of functionality, this multicooker can be considered the best invention among such devices for the kitchen. </p><h2>  Model description </h2><p>  One of the most interesting from the point of view of the functionality of the devices can be considered a multicooker Redmond M90, an overview of which is given in this article.  One of the main advantages of this device is its design.  Stylish black-metal case, streamlined shape, glossy surfaces and bright lighting make this multicooker look like a device from the future. </p><p>  The fact that developers have carefully approached the issue of multicooker functionality becomes clear even before you turn it on and start using it.  Special attention should be paid to the bowl of the device, which is made of aluminum alloy and equipped with fairly comfortable handles.  In addition, the manufacturer took care of the non-stick coating.  An excellent alternative to Teflon is a ceramic coating, which is much more resistant to mechanical damage and detergents. </p><p>  There are several more positive aspects that characterize the <span>Redmond M90 multicooker.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> especially note the removable inner part of the lid, which greatly simplifies the cleaning process of the device.  A special valve provided for releasing steam during cooking is also easily removed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Separately, I want to note some points that provide the most comfortable operation of the Redmond M90 multicooker.  We are talking about a convenient folding handle, thanks to which you can easily move the crock-pot from place to place.  Another pleasant surprise was the built-in stand for spoons, which allows you to keep at hand all the necessary devices in the process. </p>

    <h2>  Slow Cooker Recipes </h2><p>  Recipes for the Redmond M90 multicooker are contained in a special cookbook, which is included in the standard package.  One of the most interesting dishes that can be prepared using this device is homemade cheese.  Cooking involves several stages: </p><ul><li>  warm a liter of fat milk in the "Milk porridge" mode; </li><li>  add a kilogram of grated cottage cheese to the milk, let stand, drain the whey; </li><li>  add to the remaining mass half a pack of butter, two eggs, a teaspoon of salt and soda, as well as your favorite spices or any other toppings (such as nuts, ham or raisins); </li><li>  using the "Multipovar" mode, set the temperature to 80 degrees and the time is 1 hour so that the cheese melts and undergoes the necessary heat treatment; </li><li>  the last step in the preparation of this dish is solidification: for this, transfer the mass to a container lined with cling film and send to the refrigerator. </li></ul>

    <h2>  How to care for a slow cooker </h2><p>  Extremely simple maintenance requires a kitchen device such as a Redmond M90 multicooker.  Customer reviews indicate that cleaning the device and its individual parts does not take much time and effort.  A bowl and other removable parts, as well as spoons, are easy to wash in a dishwasher, but details such as a removable lid and a steam valve are best washed by hand under running water.  It is worth paying special attention to detergents that are used in the process of cleaning the multicooker.  They should not have abrasive particles or aggressive chemical components.  As for the device‚Äôs case itself, it must be wiped with warm water and a soft cloth. </p><p>  Before starting to use the device, you must carefully study such a document as an instruction.  The Redmond M90 crock-pot has a special compartment in which condensate accumulates.  It needs to be cleaned every day, and in the case of intensive operation of the device - after each cooking session.  To do this, you just need to remove the container from the back of the multicooker, drain the liquid from it, wash it and put it in place. </p>

    <h2>  Review Summary </h2><p>  Summing up, it is worth noting that the Redmond M90 multicooker is considered one of the best models to date.  Customer reviews indicate that they are quite satisfied with the equipment, a wide range of functions and the quality of the dishes prepared in this device.  We can say that this device is perfect for both beginners and experienced chefs.  So, children, students or just people who are not distinguished by culinary talents, can easily take advantage of a wide range of automatic programs.  If we talk about gourmets and experimenters, they will be able to "play" with the temperature regimes, as well as the cooking time. </p><p>  The crock-pot Redmond M90, as you can understand from the reviews, works quite efficiently and quickly.  She will perfectly cope with both preparing a hearty breakfast and delicious holiday dishes.  Thanks to the colorful recipe book designed specifically for this device, you can discover new piquant tastes.  Following the recommendations contained in it, you will not get confused in the proportions or modes. </p><p>  Perhaps, as evidenced by the reviews, we can single out only one drawback of this multicooker model, which, incidentally, cannot be called so significant.  It lies in the fact that when choosing one or another automatic cooking program, the temperature mode and some other parameters are not displayed on the display.  But in general, this does not cause any inconvenience, because the Redmond M90 multicooker has special settings that make the cooking process simple and enjoyable. </p>
