A man can cook with his own hands something that no one can ever buy anywhere.  And if it is decided to ‚Äúimmediately kill‚Äù the representative of the stronger sex, then you should do just that.  That is, to <span>give gifts to a man with his own hands</span> made from the heart. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY gifts for a man" class="if" height="363" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/280826.jpg" width="546"></div>

    <p>  <strong>We knit, weave, we sew, weave, we embroider</strong> </p><ol><li>  The first items on the list of ‚ÄúGifts to a man with his own hands‚Äù are things connected with his own hands: sweaters, pullovers, socks, shirts, t-shirts.  Of course, sweaters and pullovers are best knitted from warm yarn, and shirts and T-shirts from thin cotton thread. </li><li>  <span>You</span> can <span>blame dry felting</span> from a spun wool for a cute trinket: a souvenir toy that is nice to hang in the car as a pendant, or a <span>keychain.</span>  And you can make such gifts for a man with your own hands, which will be not only pleasant, but also useful.  For example, creative felted ankle boots, such super-fashionable soft colored felt boots with prints, fur trim and rubber sole will please the representative of a strong half of humanity. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="make a DIY gift to a man" class="if" height="284" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/2638/280827.jpg" width="357"></div></li><li>  Skillful needlewomen prefer to present their men with exclusive hand-sewn exclusive things: shirts and shorts, jackets and car seat covers, key cases and glasses. </li><li>  And you can even make a gift with your own hands to a man by weaving a carpet for him!  This only at first glance seems an impossible task.  But the weaving process is simple and exciting.  It is only necessary to make a special needle, apply a drawing to the fabric and carefully, painstakingly ‚Äúpoke‚Äù the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe carpet with loops formed on the back of the fabric. </li><li>  Every man is pleased to receive something super original as a gift.  But the donor does not always have any creative abilities.  Therefore, we can advise you to simply embellish some little thing with embroidery, and let it decide for yourself what to embroider. </li><li>  And if a man prepares a gift for a man?  Not every man is going to sit over the embroidery frame, needles, knitting needles and sewing machine!  However, there is a solution: you can even turn a plain plain t-shirt into an exclusive one.  You can simply apply a unique cool print to it with paints using a stencil.  Or make an order in a workshop that deals with printing pictures on fabric, attaching your own print version to it. </li></ol>

    <p>  <strong>Cake on the festive table - all over the head</strong> </p><p>  Almost every holiday feast is accompanied by a dessert in the form of a cake.  He can act both as part of the presentation, and as the main gift made to a man with his own hands.  A photo of the original, creative baking, decorated with cream and figures from sugar mastic, will tell the chef many ideas.  After all, even in this case, you can turn the treat into an extraordinary unique gift.  If the cake will look like a guitar or a cello, then it is clear that this gift is intended for the musician.  The hunter can perform a sweet miniature that resembles the picture "On a halt."  If the confectioner finds it difficult to sculpt the faces of hunters, it‚Äôs quite possible to use doll heads, for example, detached parts from toys named Ken.  And you can make a sweet car or a castle on the seashore, a doctor‚Äôs bag or a book with a binding on which is written the name of the future writer, that is, the gifted.  And cakes made in the form of half-naked pretty women will look absolutely super-creative.  Although such a frivolous plot for decorating a dessert can be made only for a very close friend, whose sense of humor will make it possible to appreciate the joke. </p>
