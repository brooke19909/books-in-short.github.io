    <h2>  Hydronym </h2><p>  It is believed that the name "Alabuga" of Turkic origin and translated means "perch."  However, literally, it sounds like a "mottled bull."  Locals called it perch.  It is known that in ancient times there were a lot of this fish in nearby lakes and rivers.  And now nothing has changed, perch is considered the main wealth of the reservoir. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  Alabuga is a drop-shaped lake, expanding from west to east, covering an area of ​​8 square meters.  km  The level of average depth reaches 3 m. It increases sharply near the coast to 2.5 m, and then almost does not change until the very center of the lake.  The maximum depth reaches 5 m. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Bolshoi Kasli Lake in the west is connected with the Alabuga Canal, and in the northern part with the Karabolka River.  Nearby are such reservoirs as Maly Kisegach, Kutashi, Big Allaki, etc. </p><p>  Alabuga is a fresh lake, the water here is crystal clear, with a salinity of about 700 mg / l.  Excellent visibility remains at a depth of 2 meters.  In those years when the water level noticeably increases, the lake becomes flowing, this ensures the invariability of its water load.  The oxygen regime is unstable.  In the warm season, the water in the lake is sufficiently rich in oxygen.  But in the winter, when Alabuga is covered with ice, the oxygen concentration is significantly reduced, its insufficient amount can be up to 80%.  The bottom of the lake consists of sand off the coast and silt in the central part, which is presented in the form of sapropelic mud enriched with organic and mineral substances. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The banks are slightly indented, low and in some places swampy.  The water is overgrown with cattail, reed, reeds and water lilies.  Overgrowth rate is about 10%.  Along the coast you can see a dense mixed forest, sometimes there are small birch groves. </p><p>  Alabuga is a lake belonging to a number of main fishing facilities, as it is characterized by high fish productivity of up to 40 kg / ha.  The main maintenance of fish stocks is the stocking of the lake in spring and the spawning of some species. </p><p>  For fishermen these places are a godsend.  There are many species of fish in the pond.  Dominated by bream, roach, carp, perch, burbot, peled.  Previously, whitefish could be caught in the lake, but recently it has hardly been found.  Now they go to this reservoir for a large perch.  In some individuals, the weight reaches up to 2 kg. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This pond is a well-known place for recreation, all year round there is no end to fishermen and savage tourists. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chelyabinsk lakes Alabuga" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140939.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Alabuga Lake: fishing </h2><p>  You can relax here, taking with you a tent and fishing equipment.  Fishing in Alabuga is paid.  In the summer, in open water, fish are usually caught from boats, because the entire coastline is covered with reeds, or from constructed piers.  And with the advent of cold weather, fishermen scatter around the lake.  Winter fishing is considered the best on the first and last ice. </p><p>  They mainly fish on spinning rods and fishing rods.  For fishing of the cyprinid family, bottom, float and side gear are used.  The most common for hunting perch is spinning with various artificial baits. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alabuga lake fishing" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1140941.jpg" width="533"></div>
