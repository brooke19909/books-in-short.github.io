And if many representatives of the older generation are ready to save for several years for one or another purchase, young people want to get everything at once.  The easiest way to get what you want is to borrow from a bank.  But where do they give loans from the age of 20? </p><h2></h2><h2>  Common Borrower Requirements </h2>

    <p>  It is much easier to get a loan at the age of 20 to a student receiving a scholarship.  In this case, a certificate from a college or university is attached to the main list of documents, and the bank considers the real monthly income.  Reluctantly, organizations collaborate with young people because of their likely conscription.  The presence of a military card is an optional requirement, but if this document is available, it is advisable to indicate this in the questionnaire. </p><p>  As practice shows, it is much easier for women to get a loan, regardless of age.  Even serious lending programs often require a minimum borrower age of 1-2 years less for girls than for men. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  The simplest types of loans </h2>

But to get a consumer loan for a small or medium amount or a card with a limited limit is quite realistic.

    <p>  Do not forget about loans for purchases.  From 20 years, such loans can be issued directly in the store.  You select the goods, enter into an agreement and go home with the purchase.  Moreover, many banks offer this type of loan without down payment, and the decision will take a few minutes. </p><p>  Today, on credit you can buy household appliances and electronics, jewelry, clothes made of fur and leather and much more.  As for the choice of a card or a cash loan, this is a purely individual issue.  It is important to understand that a loan obtained in a bank with money can be used at one‚Äôs own discretion.  Credit cards are more suitable for cashless payments, and it is often very unprofitable to cash out finances at an ATM. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Large loans on serious terms </h2>

But agreeing to such conditions, it is important to understand that when you stop <span>repaying the loan,</span> it‚Äôs not difficult to stay without your favorite car or apartment. </p><p>  There are also loans with guarantors.  In this case, a third person participates in the contract, who undertakes to repay the loan amount in the event that the original borrower is unable to cope with this task on his own.  It is easy to get such loans from the age of 20, and they are quite popular.  But the problem is that not all young people seek to inform relatives and friends of the fact of their cooperation with the bank. </p><h2></h2><h2>  <span>How to get loans</span> from 20 years old? </h2><p>  Start by looking for a suitable bank.  The easiest option is to visit the offices of credible organizations in person and fill out applications under the guidance of consultants.  You can send the application via the Internet from the official website of the bank. </p><p>  Even if your goal is to get a loan (20 years) without guarantors, you should not agree to all the offers.  Collaboration is exclusively with large banks.  Little-known credit companies provide loans to almost everyone, but their interest is higher, and in case of problems with the client, the problems may be the most unpredictable. </p><p>  Before signing the contract, carefully study all of its terms.  Often, the amount of overpayment can unreasonably increase due to insurance or other margins.  It is advisable to ask the finance specialist or a qualified lawyer to evaluate the proposed <span>loan agreement</span> . </p>
