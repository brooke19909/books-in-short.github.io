    <h2>  <span>The capital of the Chukotka Autonomous</span> Region: description </h2><p>  <span>The city of Anadyr,</span> which was previously called Novomariinsky, was founded by order of the tsar in 1889. Gradually developing, it multiplied its population. </p><p>  Anadyr can only be reached by plane.  Flights are made from Moscow or Khabarovsk.  The airport itself is not in the city, but on the other side of the estuary.  To ensure that the capital of the Chukotka Autonomous Region does not lose transport communications, helicopter flights are supported year-round.  In summer, small vessels run on water, and in winter a road is laid on ice. </p><p>  Despite the fact that navigation is possible only from July to November, there is a seaport in Anadyr.  Through it, communication is maintained with Magadan, Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The capital of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug currently does not have a year-round road that connects it with other areas of the Far East.  But since 2012, a road has been under construction from Kolyma to Chukotka, which will allow you to get to Anadyr by land in summer and winter.  It was planned to complete its construction by 2030.  The road should be 1800 kilometers long and have gravel.  Moreover, it will be single-lane, and it is planned to equip special extensions for driving cars. </p>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  With an area of ​​720 thousand square kilometers, Chukotka Autonomy cannot boast of a large population.  Only about 50 thousand people live here.  This means that the density per 1 square.  km of land is only 0.07. </p><p>  The peak of the population occurred at the end of the 80s of the XX century.  During this period, the number of people reached almost 162 thousand.  In the 90s, the population of the district began to decline.  A sharp decline can be observed at present.  In recent years, this has been mainly due to the large outflow of people moving to other cities, because the birth rate in Chukotka exceeds mortality rates.  But the average life expectancy in this harsh place is not so long, it is only about 60 years. </p><p>  The indigenous population of the Chukotka Autonomous Region is the Eskimos, Chukchi, Chuvans, Evens and others.  Now they are settled throughout the autonomy.  Most Eskimos live in the east, by the sea.  The Chukchi are scattered throughout the coast and in the center of the district, and the Chuvans occupied the middle course of the Anadyr River.  Part of the indigenous population in the district capital is 15%.  Least of all are the people called Yukagirs.  They can be found only in the village of Omolon, and their number does not exceed 50 people. </p><p>  Kopin Roman Valentinovich - Governor of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.  He was elected in 2008.  Appointed Acting Governor after the early resignation of a previous politician.  Kopin R.V. himself comes from Kostroma. </p>
