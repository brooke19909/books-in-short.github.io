If he didn‚Äôt play drafts, then everyone heard.  But, do you know what the Japanese version of this game is, and how it differs from the usual one for us?  It is possible that not.  Let‚Äôs figure it out, and after that we‚Äôll even possibly play them! </p><h2>  Japanese checkers are ... </h2><p>  A logical board game designed for two people and involving a sequential sequential rearrangement of chips in a rectangular field with markings in black and white cells in order to surround as much space as possible - this is, as they are called, Go's checkers.  In their complexity, they are not inferior to chess, since it is also necessary to think over moves in advance, otherwise the game may fail, and are considered one of the most difficult games in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese checkers" class="if" height="204" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35098/829281.jpg" width="204"></div>

    <p>  Today they are played by more than 50 million people.  They are very popular in eastern countries, among the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, where Japanese drafts are considered a special sport.  With their help, <span>logical thinking</span> and the ability to systematize information develop.  In addition, with the help of images that develop during the game, people have an inclination towards philosophy.  Maybe that‚Äôs why there are quite a few computer alternatives to ‚Äútalking hands‚Äù (as the Chinese call them), and if they are, they are not very productive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History </h2><p>  What does the term "Japanese checkers" mean?  The name of the game consists of two characters: the first means the word ‚Äúprotect‚Äù, and the second - Go - means the figures themselves. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the game bears such a name, it arose in ancient China about 2.5 thousand years ago.  Probably, readers will have a fairly fair question about what caused such an unfair attitude to <span>Chinese culture.</span>  The answer is very simple: this game came to the European continent from Japan, where local masters explained all its subtleties to Western travelers. </p><p>  In the 7th century, the game came to Japan, and in the 15th century it gained great popularity in the eastern part of the world.  One of the Chinese legends says that it was invented by Emperor Yao for his thoughtless son, in order to develop his ability to concentrate and mind, but there is no documentary evidence of this. </p><p>  The first textbook with the rules of the game of Japanese drafts in Europe was published by engineer Korschelt in Germany at the very beginning of the 20th century. </p><h2>  Attributes </h2><p>  Before you start the gameplay in Japanese checkers, you need to make sure that all the equipment is present, namely: gobana, chips and bowls.  The first term refers to a special rectangular wooden board with lines drawn vertically and horizontally to form cells.  The number of lines can be any, however, 19x19 parameters are welcome.  The board itself is non-square in order to provide players with a good angle of view on the field. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="japanese checkers" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35098/829296.jpg" width="466"></div>

    <h2>  The basic rules of the game of Japanese checkers </h2><p>  The goal of the duel is to surround the square as soon as possible so that you have more of it than the enemy.  Usually <span>black stones</span> go first, and after them - the turn of white.  This cycle is repeated throughout the game.  The chip is placed at the intersection of the lines, provided that it remains a handicap - an unoccupied place at any of the neighboring points.  If the figure is surrounded by enemy forces, and it has nowhere to go, then the opponent has every right to take it to himself from the battlefield.  You can skip the turn by saying the word ‚Äúpass‚Äù, however, if you have already touched the chip, you must definitely move it - these are the rules of Go. </p>

    <p>  In the case when twice in a row one player rearranges his chips without waiting for the move or passing the opponent, he loses.  The winner is determined by counting the captured stones and cells surrounded by his pieces. </p>
