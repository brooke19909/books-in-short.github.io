It is worth noting that most modern and recently released laptops from other manufacturers are much inferior to the 2008 MacBooks.  All available models in the line work without failures, freezes, however, this does not guarantee the smooth operation of the device.  Unforeseen situations sometimes happen.  This article is devoted to exactly the same.  Consider the reasons why the "MacBook" may not turn on, as well as how to eliminate them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MacBook does not turn on" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1869109.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to understand that the "MacBook" does not turn on? </h2><p>  In order to understand that the technique does not turn on, you do not need to have the knack and any special knowledge.  It is enough to pay attention to what is drawn on the screen when loading.  If an icon appears in the form of a gray folder with an exclamation mark on it, it means that there is a problem with the laptop.  No need to panic right away.  If a system failure does not occur, then laptop technology can protect all the data that is on the hard drive. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Macbook pro does not turn on" class="if" height="485" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1869110.jpg" width="600"></div>

All data after this will not be deleted and will remain on the hard drive.  What needs to be done for this?  First, turn off the laptop while holding the Command-PR-Option buttons, then press the power key.  You should press on them until a loading screen appears.  This will quickly get rid of freezes, the memory will be cleared, and the work of "MacBook" will be fully restored.  In the future, in order to avoid such troubles, it is better to backup your computer and put it on any cloud storage.  Then, in the event of an unexpected failure, it is easy to recover all the data. </p><p>  If after this manipulation the laptop still does not start, then you need to check the status of the hard drive, as well as what kind of cable is attached to the motherboard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MacBook screen does not turn on" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1869111.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Possible reasons </h2><p>  In order to save all your data when the operating system crashes, you need to perform all actions carefully, deliberately and in turn.  Then you can achieve the desired result. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Before choosing ways to solve the problem, it is necessary to determine the reason why the freeze occurred.  The question of why the MacBook does not turn on will concern every owner who finds himself in such a situation.  What caused the shutdown of the provision: system failure, error in memory, processor, or any other problems?  In addition, a breakdown could occur as a result of unstable operation of the operating system.  Often such a reaction in a laptop occurs on the update process.  Sometimes this happens when you connect an incompatible device to the MacBook.  This problem can be solved with ease - just turn off all the additional equipment. </p><p>  In order to establish the cause, you also need to look at the status of the battery.  If it is discharged or stops working, and the system is updated, then a 99% failure occurred precisely because of the interruption of the process.  Next, we consider in detail how to <span>solve the problem.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why macbook doesn't turn on" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1869112.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Fix the problem: first way </h2><p>  First of all, you should use the safe way to turn on the laptop - Safe Boot.  What is it for?  When working with it, MacBook only downloads software that has been verified and installed from certified sources.  In order to turn on the laptop in this mode, you must press the Shift button and then carry out the usual manipulations.  Unfortunately, the download process can be a long one, but it is not worth rushing or breaking it off, because all the data should remain unharmed. </p><p>  If the user needs to make a detailed download in order to understand why the failure occurred, you should start turning on the laptop in the usual way, holding down the Command, Shift and V keys. Then the MacBook will boot in safe mode with the ability to see all the startup details.  In other words, Verbose Mode is additionally activated.  What does this mean?  This download method allows you to find out all the information about the files of utilities and drivers, as well as to see all the errors that occurred as a result of their work. </p><p>  In the event that, after such a start-up, the laptop functions normally, then it can be downloaded as standard.  But sometimes this method does not help to solve the existing problem, then you need to proceed to the second option for troubleshooting.  If after that the MacBook Pro does not turn on what to do, you can understand further. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MacBook does not turn on about what to do" class="if" height="303" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1869113.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fix the problem: second method </h2><p>  Of course, a laptop may freeze and not turn on for many reasons.  If you make the assumption that the problem is in the hard disk, you are allowed to use the Disk Utility program to check its status. </p><p>  First of all, you need to turn off the laptop.  If the display shows a gray / blue / other color screen and this does not work, you will have to turn off the power forcibly.  To do this, hold the start button for 7 seconds. </p><p>  Now you can open recovery mode.  It is from it that you need to run the Disk Utility.  How to do it?  You need to hold down the MacBook power button, as well as Command and R at the same time. After that, the user will see a screen with utility icons installed in the operating system.  You need to find the Disk Utility program and run it.  Now you need to find the name of your hard disk on the screen and enable its verification.  After finishing, you need to fix all the problems and restart the laptop.  However, if the ‚ÄúMacBook‚Äù turns on and off, and the above methods did not help, then proceed to the next step. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if the macbook does not turn on" class="if" height="352" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53878/1869114.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Fix the problem: third way </h2><p>  If the user made a backup copy of the documents, but cannot get to it due to a failure in the MacBook, then the third method is suitable for him.  You must enter the external drive mode, which is called Target Disk Mode. </p><p>  How to run it?  A second MacBook is needed.  It is needed in order to connect them with one cable.  Now you can turn on your own laptop.  If any problems arise, it is allowed to hold down the power button for a few seconds until the logo appears.  Now you need to instantly press the T key. Keep it in this state until an inscription appears on the screen in the form of Thunderbolt.  External drive mode is running.  At the moment, the laptop is actually it, and not the usual computer.  If the download is successful, a new hard drive will appear.  Thanks to this, you can easily transfer the necessary data to this medium.  Now it is allowed to perform a laptop recovery.  Even if the information is deleted from the main disk, it will remain on the new secondary one. </p><h2>  Fix the problem: fourth way </h2><p>  If none of the above methods could help to fix the problem and its results, and the MacBook screen does not turn on, then the last option remains - reinstalling the operating system.  In order to carry out everything correctly and not get a failure as a result, you need to enable laptop recovery mode.  How to do this is indicated above in the article: you should click on the MacBook launch button by holding down the R and Command keys. </p><p>  After that, the operating system will turn on.  You need to find the Reinstall menu.  A dialog box will open.  You must follow all the instructions that are described in it.  Now the question of what to do if the MacBook does not turn on should be decided by itself. </p>
