However, not all parents trust the camps, and they do it right.  Often, non-professional educators work there who are not able to provide normal child care. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tubercle camp" class="if" height="222" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/147348.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  Muscovites and residents of the Moscow region were lucky.  In the Domodedovo district there is a wonderful summer camp for children, which more than once became the winner of a variety of shows and competitions.  More than 800 children can live in it at the same time, and each of them teachers, counselors, cooks, doctors and other employees provide excellent care, safety, an interesting pastime.  ‚ÄúBugorok‚Äù is a camp that is under the scrutiny of the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions (MFP).  MFP representatives ensure that nothing bad happens to this kid or teenager in this camp. </p><p>  Accommodations </p><p>  Children are very fond of the "hillock."  The camp is located in a picturesque place, and its visitors live in comfortable two-story buildings.  Each room has a maximum of four people.  Amenities are located on the floor, in the halls there are TVs.  The shift lasts 24 days, and the ‚Äúhillock‚Äù is a camp that also works during the <span>winter holidays.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Nutrition </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer camp for children" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/147349.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Five meals a day in the camp.  On the table is always useful ‚Äúright‚Äù food, lots of fruits and vegetables.  Nutrition is carefully monitored by nutritionists seconded to the camp during its operation. </p><p>  Entertainment </p><p>  ‚ÄúBugorok‚Äù is a camp in which there is everything: a sports complex, several stadiums and <span>sports grounds,</span> gyms, its own cinema, a press center and even its own newspaper ‚ÄúGorod‚Äù.  Experienced educators plan children's vacations in such a way that something happens every day in the Bugorka: relay race or festival, competition or concert, KVN or theater performance, camp day or themed evening.  The interests of each baby and adolescent are taken into account.  Constantly busy with interesting things, the guys do not have time to think about offenses, so they were not in the camp for a very long time.  When the first frosts begin, children under the guidance of teachers fill in a skating rink and an ice slide, and in summer children can sunbathe freely. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="summer camp for teens" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3352/147350.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Interestingly, the camp staff communicate with parents not only by phone.  They post <span>parental days</span> announcements in Odnoklassniki and other social networks. </p><p>  To go or not to go? </p><p>  Does everyone like the "hillock"?  Of course not.  After all, all children have their own tastes, their habits.  Some make too high demands on the camp, believing that living in rooms without a bathroom is below their dignity.  The latter do not like healthy food, preferring chips and fizzy drinks to it.  Still others are too lazy to participate in events and take offense at educators who involve them in public life.  However, most of the guys who visited the camp tend to go there again and again, because they understand that this camp is interesting and safe. </p>
