If you are familiar with the work of A. Green, then you definitely should see the sculpture “Running on the Waves”, installed in honor of the heroine of the writer’s story of the same name.  It is located at a small pond.  The stone for the work was brought from the Urals.  And the monument was paid with money from the governor's fund.  It was performed efficiently, so weather disasters are not fearful to him.  In addition, security cameras are installed next to the sculpture to protect against vandalism.

    <p>  There are even more original monuments of Kirov.  For example, all visitors are interested in the sculpture "Family".  The city was presented by the Megafon company.  They opened it festively and cheerfully.  And already on the first day, the couple celebrating the wedding, engendered a good tradition - make a wish, sitting down on an impromptu bench.  Now all tourists coming to Kirov do this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2></h2><h2>  Monuments of architecture </h2><p>  Kirov's monuments are represented not only by original contemporary compositions.  Attention deserves, for example, the house of A.Yu.  Levitsky, provincial doctor.  The architecture of the cottage is similar to that which can be seen in England, Holland and the Baltic countries. </p>

And next to the Drama Theater is the Wish Tree.  This composition is unique.  Several centuries ago, the famous Silk Road passed through the city.  And the merchants of the Lyangusovs received permission from Peter I to transport silk, leather, furs, and herbs from China on this route to the country for the manufacture of medicines.  It was on this site, where caravans allegedly once passed, and the Wish Tree was established.  The foundation for this was laid for seven days.  And under the tree is a box with the desires of local residents, which they sent to a local radio station.  That is, the monument literally stands on the aspirations of the townspeople.  It is made of concrete.  The master who created the monument carved a large ear on it.  It is in it that everyone can come and whisper their dreams and desires.

    <p>  The place for the construction of the monastery was reserved by order of Tsar Ivan the Terrible.  And construction began where there used to be an old city cemetery.  Rev. Tryphon became the first abbot, and he was engaged in erection.  The first buildings became possible thanks to the donations of the inhabitants of the city.  At first the monastery was a small monastery, but over time it turned into a beautiful wooden ensemble.  It included 4 temples, a belfry, a chapel.  After a while, the buildings began to become stone.  And new ones were built on the site of the old. </p><h2></h2><h2>  The development of the monastery in our time </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the monastery looked amazing.  He was surrounded by an old garden with raspberries, linden, currants, flower beds.  Color was added by arbors, a cast-iron pavement, bridges, asphalt paths, a pool, a chapel, ponds, a well-kept cemetery.  Tryphon has collected more than 150 books in his entire life.  They became the basis for the rich library at the monastery.  A little later, a museum of church values ​​was founded here.  By the way, the relics of the first abbot are buried in the Assumption Cathedral.  Due to hostilities in the mid-20th century, part of the buildings was lost.  And their restoration began in 1980. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Museums for history buffs </h2>
