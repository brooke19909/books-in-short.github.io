The equipment is widely used in industry, construction and architecture.  The device can also be used in domestic conditions. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Levels form a projection of the laser beam on the surface.  The guidelines for the various activities are the points and lines obtained. </p><p>  Laser marking is used for: </p><ul><li>  Tile laying. </li><li>  Drywall installation. </li><li>  Wallpapering. </li><li>  Stucco lighthouses. </li><li>  Carrying out work on electrification. </li><li>  Furniture manufacturing. </li></ul><p>  Laser devices are divided into five categories.  When choosing the levels are guided by 8-10 factors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hilti.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laser level instruction" class="if uuid-2786090" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2786090.jpg"></div><h2>  How and which laser level to choose? </h2><p>  When choosing a laser level, they rely on several parameters: </p><ul><li>  Cost.  For household use, an inexpensive device without additional functions is suitable.  Models with wide functionality are selected for continuous work and are more expensive. </li><li>  Duration of work.  For many hours of trouble-free operation, only electronic devices are capable.  Pendulum counterparts function for 20 minutes and require recharging. </li><li>  Type of level.  The most accurate measurements are guaranteed by point equipment.  Linear instruments are used to create a perfectly smooth surface.  Rotational levels project vertical, horizontal and inclined planes. </li><li>  Projection range.  It is impossible to work on construction sites of a large area with a level of minimum range. </li><li>  The number of projections.  For domestic use, a level forming two intersecting projections is sufficient.  At large work sites and workshops, a model with a large number of projections is required. </li><li>  Measurement error.  Powerful and <span>functional models</span> have an error rate of 0.3-0.4 mm / m.  The error of household appliances is greater. </li><li>  Working temperature range.  A considerable advantage is the ability to use the level at a negative temperature in an open area. </li><li>  Self-leveling.  The best option is a limit angle of 5 degrees, the ability to adjust the compensator for a short period of time.  Qualitative models of laser levels are equipped with a function to turn off the compensator. </li><li>  Type of mount.  Stable level support is required when operating in an open area.  An important parameter when choosing a level is a wall element for installation and tripod mount. </li><li>  Housing protection.  It is indicated in the marking.  The standard IP54 protection allows you to work with the device in a dusty area and in the rain. </li><li>  Equipment.  The standard set includes a bag, flat targets, special glasses, a battery and a charger. </li><li>  Design.  It does not affect the quality of work, but the usability of the device depends on it. </li></ul><h2>  Which brand should I prefer? </h2><p>  Laser levels of any manufacturer are promoted on the market as one of the best, which greatly complicates the choice of a particular brand of equipment.  A wide range of levels is presented on the market, however several brands are preferred: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  ADA.  A well-known company specializing in the production of laser equipment: rangefinders, levels, pyrometers and other devices.  The products are of excellent quality. </li><li>  DeWalt.  Supplies equipment and tools of the highest class.  Brand laser levels are distinguished by quality and reliability controlled by engineers. </li><li>  Bosch  An ad-free German company renowned for perfect product quality.  Laser levels manufactured under the Bosch brand have high quality, reliability and accuracy of measurements.  Devices are checked by engineers at each stage of production. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bosch-professional.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="laser level rating of the best" class="if uuid-2786066" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40706/2786066.jpg"></div><h2>  Perfect level </h2><p>  The best laser level, according to reviews, is a multifunctional model with a tripod mount, a robust body and the ability to mount on the wall.  The determination of the search point at a considerable distance is possible with five outgoing rays. </p><p>  It is desirable to have a function to automatically turn off the device when it is in standby mode for more than 20 minutes.  The ability to rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees allows you to project markings on other walls. </p><p>  Optimal characteristics: </p><ul><li>  The projection range is 25 meters. </li><li>  Measurement accuracy - ¬± 0.4 mm / m. </li><li>  Duration of work - 15 hours. </li><li>  The horizontal plane is 360 degrees. </li><li>  The level of protection against moisture and dust is IP54. </li><li>  Tripod socket - ¬º. </li></ul><p>  Advantages of laser levels: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Wide functionality and the possibility of application in various fields of activity.  High leveling accuracy and 360 degree rotation of the device allow it to be used in geodetic and topographic works. </li><li>  Simplicity of operation.  Management of modern models does not require special skills. </li></ul><p>  The main disadvantage of laser levels is their cost: the more functions the device has, the higher its price. </p><p>  Below is an overview of laser levels of various categories.  The listed models have their pros and cons, allowing them to be used in various fields of human activity. </p><h2>  Best Point Laser Levels </h2><p>  The ranking of the best laser levels is opened by the professional Bosch GPL 5. The projection range is 30 meters.  The functionality of the device allows you to build lines in the horizontal and vertical planes, plumb lines and corners.  The search point is determined by five outgoing rays with high accuracy.  On the body there are rubber pads that make working with the level easier.  Automatic shutdown is provided if the device is not used for 20 minutes. </p><p>  Benefits: </p><ul><li>  Compact size and light weight. </li><li>  Cruciform sight. </li><li>  High accuracy of measurements. </li><li>  Thread for two types of tripods - 1/4 and 5/8. </li><li>  Non-volatility. </li><li>  High level of protection against moisture and dust. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  Cost - 18 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Fragility.
