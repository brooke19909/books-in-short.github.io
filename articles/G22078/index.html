Unfortunately, many people do not even suspect that you can have a good rest without going outside of Russia. </p><p>  This is not only about the Black Sea coast or the North Caucasus - recently, the hotels of Belokurikha located in the marvelous Altai Territory are gaining popularity. </p><h2>  For dignitaries </h2><p>  The resort village was founded on the site of the village in the 1920s.  Ten years later, sleeping quarters, a solarium, an outpatient clinic, a clinic and a hydropathic center were built on the territory.  In Belokurikha, state leaders rested and improved their health. </p><p>  Studies of thermal waters, in which various trace elements (fluorine, radon, <span>silicic acid,</span> nitrogen, and others), played a large role in the development of a large resort in the east of the country.  Healing mountain air contains light air ions, the amount of which exceeds the same figures in the famous Swiss Davos. </p><p>  The climate is considered favorable for health: non-hot summers, warm autumn and spring months, mild winters with short-term frosts and thaws. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotels of belokurikha" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1300874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The Belovodye Hotel often comes with small children, because for them there is the most important entertainment here - a water park.

    <p>  Disadvantages: </p><p>  - high cost of living; </p><p>  - lack of animators in the children's room. </p><h2>  "Grace" </h2><p>  In the immediate vicinity of the Katun-2 and Katun ski lifts is located the Grace Hotel (Belokurikha, 77 Slavskogo St.).  On the territory there are a restaurant, rental, sports equipment storage room, secure parking and a small health center. </p><p>  Several categories of rooms are available for booking: from a modest attic to spacious apartments with two bedrooms and a kitchenette.  Regardless of the cost, all rooms are equipped with necessary furniture, a set of dishes, a kettle, a hairdryer and a TV. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="neo hotel belokurikha" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1300879.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The location of the hotel, according to guests, is ideal for winter sports.  Nearby there is a ski school and, of course, magnificent slopes designed for any level of training. </p><p>  Traveler reviews note the friendly attitude of the staff, high quality cleaning and attentive maids.  The restaurant’s work is a little upsetting - leisurely waiters, annoying live music and not the most delicious food. </p><h2>  "Russia" </h2><p>  In the very center of the resort is the sanatorium “Russia”, which offers guests to relax in comfortable buildings, as well as in two hotels that make up the complex. </p><p>  A modern interior, high <span>standards of service</span> and the possibility of holding business events are offered by a business hotel (Belokurikha, Slavskogo St., 22).  There are three categories of rooms available for booking: “Standard”, “Studio” and “Suite”.  For the convenience of guests, a work area is equipped, there is a set of dishes, an LCD TV, a safe, a telephone, a set of cosmetic accessories, a minibar, a kettle and even an alarm clock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="business hotel belokurikha" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1300876.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Guest opinions </h2><p>  Hotel "Russia" (Belokurikha) is perfect not only for business trips, but also for families.  Guest reviews mark the magnificent interior and cleanliness, compliments in the form of delicious honey with tea and a free two-hour visit to the pool. </p><p>  The most negative reviews went to catering: the restaurant has no menu, breakfasts are served for a long time, and the quality of the dishes leaves much to be desired.  Unfortunately, guests pay attention to the unprofessional attitude of the staff.  During check-in and check-out, many are faced with a lack of elementary politeness and interest on the part of hotel managers. </p><h2>  "Echo" </h2><p>  For traveling with young children, guests often choose the Echo Hotel (34 Belokurikha, Slavskogo St.), which belongs to the Rossiya sanatorium. </p><p>  The building, resembling a chalet in Switzerland, offers only 24 rooms for booking.  A cozy atmosphere is created by handmade interior details. </p><p>  Near the hotel there is a ski slope for beginners, you can rent the necessary equipment in winter and bicycles in the warm season.  The guests of “Echo” appreciate, first of all, solitude - the building is a little away from the life of a large sanatorium, and the few neighbors are unlikely to bother. </p><p>  On the other hand, travelers can use the infrastructure of the Rossiya complex at any time.  Consultations with experienced specialists, therapeutic procedures and excellent SPA programs.  One of the best medical centers is open here, and in their free time, guests are offered a huge number of options for leisure. </p><p>  Horseback riding, sports fields and swimming pools, gyms, tours on snowmobiles and ATVs, evening programs, a concert hall, billiards and bowling, a night club and a karaoke bar - few Belokurikha hotels can boast such a variety. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel grace belokurikha" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1300880.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Traveler reviews note the excellent organization of children's activities.  For younger guests there is a games room, playground, labyrinth and dry pool.  Every day, a new event awaits the children: a culinary master class, sports competitions or broadcasting cartoons. </p><h2>  "Neo" </h2><p>  Opposite the already familiar Belovodye complex is the Neo Hotel (Belokurikha, Ak. Myasnikova St. 13).  Within walking distance guests have a water park, restaurants, grocery stores and cafes. </p><p>  In a modern four-story building, travelers are offered comfortable rooms at a reasonable price, including breakfast.  It includes a fridge, kettle, TV, hairdryer and a set of toiletries. </p><p>  Many travelers choose Neo because of their low cost.  The cheapest accommodation option - “Double economy” with a double bed in the midst of the summer season will cost only 2000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="echo hotel belokurikha" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32365/1300875.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Reviews emphasize that there is no special infrastructure in the hotel.  Breakfast is served in a cafe on the ground floor, and for entertainment and medical procedures, you should contact the major motels and hotels of Belokurikha.  The most important drawback, according to the guests, is the complete lack of sound insulation. </p>
