    <p>  In all ages, from the most ancient times to the present day, mankind has been worried about the issue of its own origin.  During this period, a considerable number of theories arose that expressed the most diverse, sometimes diametrically opposed, hypotheses of the origin of man.  However, most of them were not built on clear evidence, but rather on intuitive assumptions, sometimes backed up by certain historical or anthropological factors.  Moreover, the hypotheses themselves cannot be called emerging from scratch - their appearance in a particular historical period is quite logical and is due to the development of science. </p><p>  <strong>The main hypotheses of human origin as an illustration of the development of scientific thought</strong> </p><p>  Initially, a person, faced with highly developed nature around himself and realizing that he more than harmoniously fits into the world around him, nonetheless surpassing other life forms in mental development, attributed the origin of all living things to divine forces.  In almost all religions, both existing today and those that have left us together with ancient civilizations, the <span>origin of life on Earth</span> was exclusively the merit of the gods.  In some religions, man was created from a piece of clay, in others he was a direct descendant of the gods, but somehow life on our planet was explained by supernatural interference.  Similar hypotheses of the <span>origin of man</span> were called creationism, that is, the theory of creation, in science. </p><p>  These hypotheses functioned as the only reasonable explanation for the appearance of man for a long time - until the development of science reached the stage when the connection between man and other forms of life on Earth became apparent.  Moreover, it was no longer possible to explain this connection by outside interference.  So there was an evolutionary theory of the origin of man.  The date of its occurrence is considered to be 1739 - it was in this year that the natural scientist and anthropologist Karl Linney introduced the modern man to the classification of primates, designating him as Homo Sapiens. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Later this theory was developed and consolidated by Charles Darwin, with whose name it is associated today.  Proponents of this hypothesis of human origin argue that modern humans are the logical conclusion to the evolution of primates, which gradually, under the influence of natural disasters, and also as a result of the process of <span>natural selection,</span> have reached their current level of development.  In support of this theory, numerous data of historical and anthropological studies are provided, confirming the fact that monkeys undoubtedly evolved in their development and gradually came to humanoid life forms.  Unfortunately, there is no direct evidence of this theory, that is, it is impossible to trace the entire evolutionary chain, as well as it is impossible to explain why some of the monkeys remained at the animal level.  But this theory remains official to this day, and most modern classical scientists are adherents of this particular hypothesis of human origin. </p><p>  But in recent decades, starting from about the second half of the last century, in contrast to the classical theories of the development of mankind - religious and scientific, others began to appear.  The most common of them is an explanation of the appearance of a person on the planet under the influence (or with the direct participation) of alien civilizations.  The rapid <span>exploration of outer space,</span> periodically arising assumptions about the existence of other civilizations, possibly significantly exceeding the Earth in its development and inexplicable from the point of view of modern science, have led to the fact that modern hypotheses of the origin of man deny previous scientific experience. </p><p>  Proponents of the paleovizit theory argue that the monkeys remained a dead end branch that did not lead to the creation of reason, and modern life forms were introduced from outside by more developed creatures. </p>
