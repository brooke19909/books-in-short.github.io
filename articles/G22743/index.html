You can do this by breaking away from your parents and going to a children's camp.  The readiness of the child for his first trip is evidenced by his desire to go there.  In addition, he becomes sociable, easily finds a common language with people and has many friends. </p><p>  The optimal age for a trip to the camp, psychologists consider eight or nine years.  But parents should carefully look at the child and evaluate its capabilities.  Since Soviet times, Anapa has been considered the center of children's recreation.  Here is the camp "Ural gems", which will be discussed today. </p>
