  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communications Development: From Telegraph to the Global Network</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Communication is an integral element of the existence of modern human society.  In our technologically advanced age, we simply cannot imagine our life without phones.  But a hundred years ago, a person could not even dream of such luxury. </p><p>  Until the middle of the XIX century, communication between Europe, England and America was established using ship mail.  But since this means of communication did not allow receiving news quickly, the human mind began to think about a better solution to the problem. </p><p>  The development of communications has gained new momentum with the discovery by Volta in 1800 of an electric battery.  The first was invented by the electrochemical telegraph, it was thanks to him that it became possible to transmit messages from two different ends in a few hours, or even minutes. </p><p>  The inventor of the telegraph Semmering used gas that was released as a result of the passage of current through water (acidified) to <span>transmit information</span> .  But the design was too complicated, Schweiger simplified it, but, nevertheless, messaging was too tedious. </p><p>  In addition, alas, such a telegraph could transmit only written messages, so the inventors began to think about a more advanced version of the device.  Some attempts were made by the American physicist Page in 1837, but his invention only remotely resembled a telephone. </p><p>  The development of communications has gained a new round thanks to the Flight telephone.  He made about ten devices that could partially transmit human speech, as well as music, but there was too much <span>noise.</span>  The signal was often drowned out, and sometimes it was very difficult to make out what exactly was being said on the other end. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <span>Alexander Bell,</span> who began the construction of a new telephone, contributed to the development of communications.  Together with his assistant, the inventor achieved his goal and was able to make an apparatus that more or less distinctly began to transmit speech.  But, unfortunately, the sound quality in such devices depended on the distance, the further - the worse the audibility. </p><p>  Over time, the phone improved.  The Baron Schilling, the Englishman William Cook, the inventor from Germany, Steingel, and many others worked on the development of this device.  Before the phone got its current look, it went through many tests.  <span>The twenty-first century was</span> marked by the advent of wireless communication devices, namely mobile phones that perfectly transmit all sounds without any delay. </p><p>  An equally important place in the development of communications is the invention of television communications and photo telegraphs.  It was with the help of these tools that video signals began to be transmitted.  Initially, these were primitive transmitters of sound and video, which later developed into color television.  In the initial version, the choice of programs and channels was small, but every year their number increases significantly. </p><p>  But the classification <span>of communication channels</span> will be incomplete, if not to recall the global communication system itself, namely the Internet.  Now we can not imagine our life without it.  Indeed, it is thanks to him that you can easily find out all the news, keep abreast of events, pay for services, and control almost all aspects of your life. </p><p>  But the <span>global network</span> plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between people.  After all, being thousands of kilometers apart, people can easily exchange photo, video and audio materials.  See each other online, communicate in real time, without delay or delay. </p><p>  Every year, people come up with more and more new devices, upgrading existing ones and creating absolutely unique ones.  Progress does not stand still, which means that the development of communications will not stop. </p>
