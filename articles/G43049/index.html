    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  Many parks bear the names of famous personalities.  In particular, the names and surnames of writers and artists are often used for names.  So, the Chukovsky park in Rostov-on-Don reminds the townspeople of a writer who made a considerable contribution to literature.  In addition to wonderful fairy tales for kids, he is known for many more outstanding deeds.  The author also studied linguistics, translations, studied literature, and tried himself as a critic.  During his life, he wrote many significant works that gave pleasant minutes and emotions.  Thanks to Chukovsky‚Äôs translations, children and adults were able to learn such popular books as Robinson Crusoe, Tom Sawyer, and others. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Citizens call this park in another way.  His second name is Ashgabat.  The place has a rather curious shape, since on the map it looks like a triangle.  In the Soviet era, one could come here to enjoy a movie directly in the open air.  Now in the park you can see only a reminder that there was once a cinema here.  But he still remains one of the favorite places of Rostovites.  Here you can see a considerable number of people not only on weekends, but also on weekdays.  People save the park from pollution and clutter, as they spend subbotniks here.  Usually, organizations involved in environmental protection are responsible for this. </p><h2>  The perfect place to relax </h2><p>  The park attracts citizens with shady alleys and fresh air.  It is also beautiful in the cold, so you can often see family photo shoots.  Chukovsky's park in Rostov-on-Don is decorated with another attraction - the church of the Roman Catholic parish of the Last Supper.  She collects a lot of people, and in the summer near her you can admire beautiful flowers, among which roses and other gifts of nature.  The building began to be built back in 1999, and the church opened a little later.  Divine services are held in it, to which many people come.  In 2004 the church was consecrated. </p>

    <p>  In the park you can see mothers with children, couples walking and nature lovers.  Many people come here with their four-legged friends, for whom there is expanse.  In 2017, a plan for landscaping was approved.  The park will be able to boast a brand new football field and a complex for children.  This is great news for parents, as their children will be even more interesting to walk there.  Model Natalya Vodyanova and her foundation have allocated the necessary funds for this.  The park will soon also have new paths, benches and lighting. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fight for the park </h2><p>  The history of the park, which is one hundred years old, could be supplemented by the construction of another church.  The townspeople decided to stand their ground firmly, as they opposed the development of their favorite vacation spot.  Not far from the park, in addition to the Catholic Church, there is also the Orthodox Church.  Residents of Rostov created a petition and actively participated in ensuring that everything remains as it is.  The government of the region after a wave of protests reported that in the near future they do not plan to build anything like this in the Chukovsky park in Rostov-on-Don. </p>
