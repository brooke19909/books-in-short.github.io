  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Energy bracelet Power Balance. Reviews, recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Just a few years ago, energy bracelets began to come into fashion in the West.  First, they began to show off on the wrists of Hollywood stars, and after a few months later, ordinary people in Europe and the USA, and now the CIS countries, began to massively buy new items. </p><p>  A bracelet made of medical silicone with an insert - a milar hologram in the form of a disk - this is the famous Power Balance.  Reviews about him, it is worth noting, are very controversial.  However, most consumers confirm the properties declared by the manufacturer.  And the manufacturing company says the following: ‚ÄúThe bracelet is made of medical silicone and, therefore, is hypoallergenic,‚Äù with which, of course, you can‚Äôt argue.  However, the main component of the miraculous invention is the disc with the hologram.  Due to him, the bracelet comes into resonance with the human biofield and, without exaggeration, works wonders!  It improves working capacity and mood, gives endurance, strength and flexibility, cures a number of various chronic diseases, relieves inflammation, relieves pain of various etiologies. </p><p>  Of course, every sane person has a logical question: "What is the mechanism of operation of this device?"  Considering that the biofield is mostly hypothetical and has not been established by traditional science, the process of its interaction with something is also not possible to establish, and therefore no <span>physical device</span> is able to register any effect on the human body of the Power Balance bracelet.  Customer reviews, however, suggest the opposite: most people who regularly wear a bracelet talk about a significant improvement in well-being and quality of life. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Once, Spanish scientists were still interested in this fact, but studies have shown that the effect of the bracelet is nothing more than a placebo, that is, a banal auto-suggestion.  And a milar, according to physicists, is an ordinary dielectric of the latest generation, which has absolutely no healing properties, and therefore has absolutely no therapeutic effect and a Power Balance bracelet.  The reviews testify to the ever growing popularity of the product among all segments of the population, including the world elite.  According to the representative of the corporation that produces the bracelet, all statements about its inefficiency are only black PR, and rare cases of customer dissatisfaction are explained by the fact that, due to the growing popularity of the product, its counterfeits are increasingly found. </p><p>  Initially, the Power Balance bracelet was designed for professional athletes with the goal of maintaining the body's natural strength in competitions under intense physical exertion.  Then, having discovered an effect amazing in their strength, the bracelets were put into mass production.  The radius of the product does not exceed 6 centimeters and is designed for the body of one person.  The manufacturer in no way guarantees the incredible recovery of seriously ill people, but emphasizes its preventive effect on the body of a healthy person.  If you want to stay healthy for a long time and prolong youth, this bracelet is for you. </p><p>  In addition, there are absolutely no contraindications for using Power Balance, reviews of which only emphasize this fact.  The energy bracelet is useful for both children and adults and the elderly, regardless of health status.  It helps to increase defenses, normalize blood pressure, relieves meteosensitivity, drowsiness, depression and chronic fatigue syndrome, increases working capacity and brings harmony to the body and spirit. </p>
