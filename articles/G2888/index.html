    <h2>  Antiseptics </h2><p>  There is a whole system of measures to destroy in the wound, tissues and organs, and in the human body as a whole, harmful microorganisms that can cause foci of inflammation.  Such a system is called antiseptics, which is translated from Latin as ‚Äúagainst decay‚Äù.  This term was first coined by the British surgeon D. Pingle in 1750.  However, Pingle is not at all the Englishman who laid the foundations of the antiseptics you might think of.  He only described the disinfecting effect of quinine and introduced a familiar concept. </p><p>  Already by one name you can understand the principle of operation of these funds.  So, antiseptics are drugs that, with various lesions of tissues and organs, prevent blood poisoning.  Each of us has been familiar with the simplest of them since childhood - this is iodine and zelenka.  And the most ancient, used back in the days of Hippocrates, were vinegar and alcohol.  Very often, the term ‚Äúantiseptic‚Äù is confused with another term - ‚Äúdisinfectant‚Äù.  Antiseptics have a wider spectrum of action, since they include all disinfecting drugs, including disinfectants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Herbal remedies </h2>

    <p>  Many antiseptics are made from natural materials.  These are various herbal preparations, which include St. John's wort, yarrow or sage.  This also includes the notorious tar soap, which is made on the basis of birch tar, and the tincture "Eucalymin", which is an extract from eucalyptus. </p><h2>  Fundamental achievement of medicine </h2><p>  The advent of antiseptic drugs in nineteenth-century surgery, as well as other scientific discoveries (anesthesia, the discovery of blood groups) brought this field of medicine to a whole new level.  Until that moment, most doctors were afraid to go for risky operations, which were accompanied by the opening of tissues of the human body.  These were extreme measures, when nothing else was left.  And not in vain, because the statistics were disappointing.  Almost one hundred percent of all patients died on the operating table.  And the reason was surgical infections. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in 1874, Professor Erickson said that such parts of the body as the abdominal and cranial cavities, as well as the chest, would always be inaccessible to surgeons.  And only the appearance of antiseptics corrected the situation. </p><h2>  First steps </h2><p>  The history of antiseptics began in ancient times.  In the writings of doctors of ancient Egypt and Greece, you can find references to their use.  However, there was no scientific justification then.  Only from the middle of the nineteenth century did the antiseptic purposefully and meaningfully be used as a substance capable of preventing the processes of decay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Englishman laying the foundations of antiseptics" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/583683.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <p>  Surgeons performed many successful operations at that time.  However, serious problems continued to occur in the treatment of wounds.  Even simple operations could be fatal.  If we look at the statistics, then every sixth patient died after or during surgery. </p><h2>  Empirical beginnings </h2><p>  The base of antiseptics was laid by the Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis - professor at the Budapest Medical University.  In 1846-1849, he worked in the obstetric clinic named after Klein, located in Vienna.  There he drew attention to strange mortality statistics.  In the department, where students were allowed, more than 30% of women in labor died, and the percentage was much lower where students did not go.  After conducting a study, he realized that the cause of the <span>maternal fever,</span> from which the patients died, was the dirty hands of students who, before coming to the obstetric department, were involved in the anatomy of corpses.  At the same time, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweiss at that time did not even have a clue about microbes and their role in decay.  Having made such scientific discoveries, he developed a method of protection - before the operation, doctors had to wash their hands with a solution of bleach.  And it worked: the death rate in the maternity ward for 1847 was only 1-3%.  That was nonsense.  However, during the life of Professor Ignaz Semmelweis, his discoveries were not accepted by the largest Western European experts in the field of gynecology and obstetrics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The Englishman who laid the foundations of antiseptics </h2><p>  Scientifically substantiating the concept of antiseptics became possible only after the publication of the works of Dr. L. Pasteur.  It was he who in 1863 showed that microorganisms are behind the processes of decay and fermentation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Joseph Lister" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/583682.jpg" width="387"></div>

    <p>  For surgery in this area, Joseph Lister became the star.  In 1865, he was the first to declare: "Nothing that is not disinfected shall not touch the wound."  It was Lister who invented how to fight <span>wound infection</span> using chemical methods <span>.</span>  He developed the famous dressing soaked in carbolic acid.  By the way, back in 1670, this acid was used as a disinfectant by pharmacist Lemer from France. </p><p>  The professor concluded that suppuration of wounds occurs due to the fact that bacteria enter them.  He first gave a scientific justification for such a phenomenon as a surgical infection, and came up with ways to combat it.  So, J. Lister became known throughout the world as an Englishman who laid the foundations of antiseptics. </p><h2>  Lister method </h2><p>  J. Lister invented his own method of protection against germs.  He consisted of the following.  The main antiseptic was <span>carbolic acid</span> (2-5% aqueous, oily or alcoholic solution).  With the help of solutions, microbes were destroyed in the wound itself, and all objects in contact with it were processed.  So, surgeons lubricated hands, processed tools, dressings and suture materials, the entire operating room.  Lister also suggested using an antiseptic catgut as a <span>suture material</span> , which tended to dissolve.  Lister attached great importance to the air in the surgical room.  He believed that this is a direct source of germs.  Therefore, the room was also treated with carbolic acid using a special spray. </p>

It was also an invention of Lister.  The dressing did not let air through, and its lower layer, consisting of silk, was impregnated with five percent carbolic acid diluted with a resinous substance.  Then another eight layers were applied, treated with rosin, paraffin and carbolic acid.  Then everything was covered with oilcloth and bandaged with a clean bandage soaked in carbolic acid.

    <p>  Thanks to this method, the number of dying during operations has decreased significantly.  Lister's article on how to properly treat and disinfect fractures and abscesses was published in 1867.  She turned the whole world upside down.  It was a real breakthrough in science and medicine.  And the author became known throughout the world as an Englishman who laid the foundations of antiseptics. </p><h2>  Opponents </h2><p>  The Lister method became widely used and found a huge number of supporters.  However, there were those who did not agree with his conclusions.  Most opponents claimed that the carbolic acid chosen by Lister was not an antiseptic suitable for disinfection.  The composition of this tool contained substances that had a strong irritating effect.  This could injure both the patient‚Äôs tissue and the surgeon‚Äôs hands.  In addition, carbolic acid had toxic properties. </p><p>  It should be noted that the well-known surgeon in Russia Nikolay Pirogov also came close enough to this problem before Joseph Lister.  In his method of treatment, the main disinfectants were <span>bleach,</span> camphor alcohol and <span>silver nitrate,</span> which are less toxic than the carbolic acid proposed by the Englishman.  However, Pirogov did not begin to create his teaching on the use of antiseptics, although he was very close to this. </p><h2>  Aseptics versus Antiseptics </h2>

It was not to disinfect the wound, but to immediately prevent infection from entering it.  This method was more gentle than antiseptic, due to which many doctors called for a complete rejection of Lister's developments.  However, life as always arranged everything in its own way.

    <p>  Chemistry as a science did not stand still.  New antiseptics appeared in medicine, which replaced toxic carbolic acid.  They were softer and more gentle.  During the First World War, there was an urgent need for powerful tools that can disinfect gunshot wounds.  Old antiseptic and septic drugs could not cope with severe infectious foci.  So, chemicals came to the fore. </p><h2>  All new and new developments </h2><p>  In the thirties of the last century, the world received a new high-quality antiseptic.  It was a sulfa drug capable of preventing and inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the human body.  The tablets were taken orally and acted on microorganisms of certain groups. </p><p>  In the forties, the world's first antibiotic was created.  With his appearance, completely unthinkable before this opportunities were opened for surgeons.  The main feature of the antibiotic is the selective effect on bacteria and microorganisms.  Almost all modern antiseptics belong to this group.  It seemed that it simply could not be better than the drug.  However, it later became clear that excessive use of antibiotics causes a kind of immunity in microorganisms, and no one canceled the side effects. </p><h2>  Unique drug </h2><p>  Scientific and medical progress does not stand still.  And in the eighties of the twentieth century, the world learned about such a drug as Miramistin.  At first it was developed as an antiseptic, disinfecting the skin of astronauts traveling to orbital stations.  But then it was admitted to widespread use. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="antiseptics drugs" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15681/583680.jpg" width="275"></div>

    <p>  Why is it so unique?  Firstly, this medication is absolutely safe and non-toxic.  Secondly, it does not penetrate the mucous membranes and skin and has no side effects.  Thirdly, it is aimed at destroying a huge circle of pathogens: fungi, bacteria, viruses and other simple microorganisms.  In addition, its unique property lies in the mechanism of action on microbes.  Unlike <span>antibiotics, the</span> new generation <span>drug</span> does not develop resistance in microorganisms.  Miramistin medication is used not only in the treatment of infections, but also for their prevention.  So today, the unique drugs created for space exploration are available to all of us. </p>
