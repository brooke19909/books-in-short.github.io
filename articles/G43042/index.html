And when it comes to the Greek islands, here begins a real flight of fantasy.  After all, each of them is associated with a myth.  For example, Cyprus is considered the birthplace of the <span>goddess Aphrodite,</span> and Crete is famous for the <span>legend of the Minotaur,</span> Knossos Palace and the labyrinth.  Every year, thousands of tourists from all over the world come here to relax on the wonderful beaches, swim in the azure waters of the Aegean Sea and plunge into the world of antiquity and legends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden beach 4" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/466470.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hersonissos resort: rest, hotels, prices </h2><p>  The island of Crete, despite being the largest of the Greek islands, is not so large that it could not be inspected in a couple of weeks.  However, if you are most interested in places associated with the legend of the Minotaur, then you better settle near the Knossos Palace.  Closest to it is the village of Hersonissos.  This is a beautiful resort with a well-developed tourist infrastructure.  Right on the coast are dozens of fashionable hotels, for example, Golden Beach 4 *, Arminda 4 *, Atlantica Sensatori 5 * and others.  Due to the abundance of noisy entertainment, numerous discos and nightclubs, this village is especially attractive for young people: student companies, couples in love, newlyweds.  And this category of tourists, as you know, prefers to stay in inexpensive, so-called budget hotels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The best hotel of this category in Crete is Golden <span>Beach Hotel 4 *,</span> in which there is an optimal combination of price and quality of services.  In fact, island Greece is considered more expensive than mainland Greece.  The same can be seen when comparing the prices of the Greek and Turkish resorts of the Aegean.  So, for example, in the hotel of the same name on the coast of Turkey Golden Beach 4 * (Bodrum), you can relax for 46 thousand rubles (for two for 7 days), which is almost half the cost of a ticket to Crete.  Well, in a hotel of the same name on the island of Cyprus (by the way, these two hotels are often confused with each other because of the similarity of names), the cost is much more expensive.  So, in the high season, a week tour for two in Atlantica Golden Beach 4 * (Paphos) will cost 100 thousand rubles, and this is not about a suite, but an ordinary standard room.  This indicates that the Greek islands have always been and remain popular as the best resorts for both beach and educational recreation.  Here, the sun shines almost 300 days a year, and the beach season lasts from April to the end of October, while the average air temperature during this period is +28 degrees, and water + 25. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  General description of the hotel Golden Beach 4 *: location and address </h2><p>  As already noted above, this hotel is located in the village of Hersonissos - in one of the most noisy and full of entertainment resorts in Crete.  More recently, it was an unremarkable quiet place.  Its inhabitants were engaged in fishing, and today they are involved in the tourism business of the island, which is developing with incredible speed.  In a word, life is in full swing here, nightclubs and discos are crowded with young people from different countries: Holland, Great Britain, Germany, and, more recently, from Russia. </p>

As for the Golden Beach 4 * hotel, the ratings of vacationers are mostly positive, although some believe that it does not pull 4 *.  By the way, from the reviews you can understand that this hotel is suitable for families.  It is curious, but all the hotels of the same name, wherever they are - in Spain (The Gates Golden Beach 4 *), Cyprus ("Atlantic Golden Beach") or Turkey ("Golden Beach" 4 *) - according to vacationers' reviews, are cozy places for families.
