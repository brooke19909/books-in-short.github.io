    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Yalta is located on the same latitude with such a famous city as Italian Ravenna, which indicates the similarity of climatic conditions.  The number of sunny days in the city is the same as in Nice or San Remo. </p><h2>  Big Yalta </h2><p>  Yalta includes such villages as Alushta, Alupka, Nikita, Gurzuf and many others.  On the coast, the climate is close to Mediterranean.  And if you climb the mountains, then the air becomes much drier.  Many connoisseurs of the resort believe that autumn is the best time to relax in Yalta.  Especially this period is good for people who have health problems. </p><h2>  The Velvet season </h2><p>  Yalta became a popular holiday destination after members of the royal family erected summer residences in Oreanda and Livadia on the coast.  Since then, the city has become fashionable among the Russian aristocracy, and its air has been declared incredibly healing.  It was from that time that the term ‚Äúvelvet‚Äù season appeared, since the aristocracy came in velvet dresses and arranged all kinds of holidays and evenings.  Since then, rest in Yalta in September is considered very respectable.  And the season itself is called velvet. </p><h2>  Weather in September </h2><p>  Rest in Yalta (Crimea) in September is also facilitated by weather conditions.  In early autumn, the temperature regime is much more comfortable than in the summer.  But at the same time, there is still a lot of sun on the coast, especially in the first half of the month.  The first two weeks the weather is usually not inferior to summer.  And by the end of September, the temperature will gradually drop to autumn levels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in yalta in september reviews" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2036867.jpg" width="600"></div>

The temperature is quite comfortable, but there is no extreme heat.  In the first half of the month the air temperature is + 26-28 degrees.  Further indicators are reduced to the level of + 20-25 degrees.  By the end of September, the number of hours of sunshine and the length of daylight are gradually reduced, and winds are also increasing.  Nights are pleased with the long-awaited cool, so you can sleep comfortably with an open window without air conditioning.  Going to Yalta in early autumn, it is worth taking a few warm things with you so that you can throw in case of need.  As a rule, there is no rain, except in the second half of the month. </p><p>  In the first weeks of autumn, you can safely swim, the sea has not yet had time to cool.  As a rule, the water temperature fluctuates between + 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees, then it cools down and by the last days of the month the temperature can reach + 18-19 degrees.  In general, we can say that the first weeks of autumn are more successful for a beach holiday, since in the future, whatever one may say, there is a tendency to lower temperatures. </p><h2>  Transport Yalta </h2><p>  Based on the reviews of tourists about holidays in Yalta in September, we can say that at this time it is very comfortable to travel and see the sights, and for this it is worth knowing what kind of transport is available.  In Yalta there are trolley buses, fixed-route taxis, buses and cruise ships.  City transport begins to work from five to six in the morning, and ends at 23.00 or 24.00.  Taxis can be called at any time of the day.  But motor ships (voyages) transport tourists from May to October, so in September navigation is still in full swing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are 53 bus routes and 4 trolleybus routes in Yalta.  In addition, the city has a pretty decent selection of taxi services, as a rule, all cars are equipped with taximeters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in yalta in september what to do and where" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2036870.jpg" width="600"></div>

Reviews of tourists about holidays in Yalta in September give reason to recommend a sea trip as a must-see resort destination. </p><h2>  Holidays in Yalta in September: hotels </h2><p>  In September, a slight decrease in prices for all services, including housing, is observed at the resort.  In the city you can find housing for every taste: from expensive five-star hotels to cheaper options.  In the city you can find both expensive hotels and guest houses.  If you want to organize an economic vacation for yourself in Yalta in September, you should look for cheap housing away from the center and the promenade, since the most expensive hotels are concentrated here.  In more distant areas, hotels are probably externally and not so attractive, but they provide a wider range of services at more affordable prices. </p><p>  Fashionable fours and fives of Old Yalta - a high level of prices at any time of the year, luxury and stunning views.  Perhaps the most famous complex in the promenade is Oreanda.  No less famous is the Yalta Intourist complex.  Accommodation in such institutions per day will cost no less than 4,500 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rest in yalta in september hotels" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2036875.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As a budget option, you can consider rest in Yalta in September in the private sector.  The choice of guest houses in the city is large, so you can choose the right option.  Such establishments have proven themselves: ‚ÄúSeaside Park‚Äù (cost of living from 4 thousand rubles), ‚ÄúMontpensier‚Äù (from 2.5 thousand rubles), ‚ÄúThree dolphins‚Äù (from 1.5 thousand rubles), ‚ÄúKarina‚Äù (from 2 thousand rubles).  The cost of apartments in private houses does not differ from the prices in mini-hotels. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  What is a good vacation in Yalta in September?  Reviews of tourists provide an opportunity to say that during this period you can still soak up the beach in the gentle rays of the sun and swim in the sea.  Currently, almost all the beaches of the city are municipal property.  Only some sections of the coast are assigned to pathos.  Municipal beaches are open to all comers, admission to them is completely free, but the services are paid.  Pebble coast as if created for swimming.  Of course, in the city center it is not so clean on the coast thanks to the tourists themselves, but on the Massandra beach the water is clean and clear, and the cost of sunbeds is about 400 rubles per day. </p><p>  <span>The coast of Yalta is</span> divided by concrete breakwaters so that the elements do not erode the coast.  Almost all sites are equipped with paid toilets, changing rooms and showers.  However, the loungers themselves on municipal beaches are far from modern standards, so many people prefer to rest on paid sections of the coast. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea rest in Yalta in September" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2036880.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition to the "Massandra" beach, it is also worth highlighting "Nikitsky", "Actor", "Donbass", "Yalta-Intourist", "Livadia", "Primorsky", "Dolphin". </p><h2>  Holidays in Yalta in September: what to do and where to go on an excursion? </h2><p>  The beginning of autumn is a great time for active trips.  If you are a lover of sightseeing, then it makes sense for you to go on holiday to Yalta in September, the reviews of vacationers are a direct confirmation of this.  It is no secret that the resort is famous for its many palaces and other interesting places that are definitely worth a look.  However, in the summer, even with all the desire, it is difficult to devote time to numerous trips that are very exhausting in the heat.  September is quite another thing, when it is still very warm, but there is no intense heat, this is the most wonderful time when you can get acquainted with local beauties. </p><p>  In Yalta and around it are the main symbols of the Crimea - From the Massandra Palace to the Swallow's Nest.  Culturally, the resort is not inferior to many European cities.  Numerous historical sights are so beautiful that they are worth seeing with your own eyes.  Due to the fact that since the nineteenth century representatives of the royal family came to rest on the peninsula, the whole aristocracy also rushed after them.  The resort has gained unprecedented popularity, so quite a lot of beautiful palaces and estates appeared here quite quickly.  Of course, not all of them have survived to our time.  And those that survived cause genuine interest and admiration. </p><h2>  swallow's Nest </h2><p>  In the center of Yalta, you can see the famous <span>palace of Emir of Bukhara,</span> made in the Moorish style.  Currently, it is part of the Yalta sanatorium.  The main symbol of the South Bank - the Swallow's Nest - cannot be ignored.  A small castle on the edge of the cliff is made in a medieval style.  The history of the place of this unusual place is rooted in ancient times. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Yalta in September" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2036887.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, the present appearance of the castle acquired only in the early thirties of the last century.  Once a one-story building was an ordinary summer residence, and only by order of Baron Shtengel the Swallow's Nest began to look the way we used to see it.  At one time, the castle was in disrepair due to the effects of the earthquake.  Subsequently, the corresponding work was carried out and since then everyone can enjoy its beauty and make amazing photos on its background. </p><h2>  Famous palaces </h2><p>  Resting in Yalta, you should definitely see the Livadia Palace, which served as the summer residence of Emperor Nicholas II.  The architectural monument has a long, eventful history.  Incredibly beautiful complex deserves close attention from tourists.  During a tour of it you can admire the beautiful work of Krasnov. </p><p>  No less interesting is the <span>Vorontsov Palace,</span> built by order of one of the powerful families of the empire.  He rightfully bears the title of palace-movie star.  A lot of domestic films were shot on its territory, including: ‚ÄúOrdinary Miracle‚Äù, ‚ÄúScarlet Sails‚Äù and many others.  The palace building is made in the style of English romanticism.  It is surrounded by a beautiful <span>Alupka park,</span> laid down simultaneously with the construction of the palace complex.  Rare plants grow on its territory, the age of which is estimated at more than one century. </p><h2>  Interesting places of the resort </h2><p>  If you plan to spend your vacation on the South Coast, then you should consider your vacation: where can I go to Yalta in September?
