Probably everyone knows at what price the South Korean manufacturer was given the fame that he gained in the mobile device market.  The basis of the company's arsenal is precisely budget devices.  The devices of the company always have a good price-quality ratio corresponding to one or another segment in which they are located.  The same applies to the smartphone Samsung Galaxy J1, which became the subject of our review today. </p>

    <h2>  A little about the manufacturer and the lineup J </h2><p>  Devices of the South Korean manufacturer differ, including reliable assembly.  They sometimes have good technical specifications.  It was they who paved the way for the company to the glory that it has gained at present, thanks to them (but not only them), the manufacturer was able to rise almost to the top.  But now such a tendency has been noticed that Samsung is abandoning its previous schemes, gradually removing inexpensive devices from the assortment and replacing them with more productive, but also more expensive models. </p><p>  Probably, the company management decided that the brand has strengthened enough in the market and now it is possible to work in this direction.  Most likely, according to the plan, the calculation is made exclusively on the high popularity of the company's devices.  Theoretically, the J series was supposed to be the best-selling among all the devices of the company.  But in practice, it turned out that the effectiveness of the very first model, for example (and this is the <span>Samsung Galaxy J1, reviews</span> of which we will give in this article), turned out to be worse than the ‚ÄúLumiya‚Äù released by Microsoft.  It turns out that J1 is inefficient?  Probably yes, it is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  One gets the impression that the budget line was created by an army of adherents of the corresponding opinion.  Frankly speaking, the Samsung Galaxy J1, reviews of which quickly spread over the Internet, is just some kind of useless device in terms of filling that does not really justify the money spent on its purchase.  Probably, by right the phone can be called a personal anti-record of the South Korean manufacturer. </p><p>  Nevertheless, no matter how sad it may seem, let's not forget that the Samsung Galaxy J1, whose characteristics are still worthy of attention, is being delivered to the smartphone market in various versions.  Among them there is a version with a module that allows you to work in fourth-generation networks, that is, with LTE support.  The same modification is equipped with a slightly different platform, which works more quickly.  But the acquisition of such a phone may make sense, unlike the original standard version.  Meanwhile, we will consider the main parameters of the device. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy J1.  Smartphone Features </h2>

    <p>  The device is delivered to stores and mobile phone stores with the Android operating system version 4.4.4.  The matrix of the screen is made by TFT technology.  The diagonal of the display is 4.3 inches.  At the same time, its resolution is 480 by 800 pixels.  There is no function to automatically adjust the backlight level.  Density - 217 pixels per inch.  Capacitive touch screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Samsung J100F Galaxy J1 is equipped with a lithium-ion type battery with a capacity of 1850 milliamps per hour.  As the South Korean manufacturer assures potential buyers, the smartphone will be able to withstand about 10 hours of continuous talk in third-generation networks, 40 hours of non-stop music playback, 9 hours of watching video clips or movies.  Internet time through Wi-Fi can be 9 hours with a minimum level of backlight. </p><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy J1</span> phone has a built-in processor of the Spreadtrum family.  Two cores work simultaneously in it, the maximum clock frequency of which can reach 1.2 gigahertz.  The amount of RAM is 512 megabytes.  In the modification of the SM-J100F, it is increased to 768 MB.  Not really a big difference in fact, but still it will be a little easier to cope with multitasking.  To store personal data, the owner of the phone is allocated 4 gigabytes.  There is support for external drives up to 128 GB. </p><p>  The resolution of the main camera is 5 megapixels, the front one is only 2. For night shooting, an LED flash is provided, and to obtain good (relatively) pictures, the auto focus function on the subject was built in.  The phone allows you to use two SIM cards at once.  This is a modification of DS (‚ÄúDual Sim‚Äù).  Before applying them, you will need to process according to the MicroSIM standard. </p><p>  The smartphone can use second and third generation cellular networks.  Wi-Fi interacts with b, g, and n bands.  To transfer files between two devices, you can use the bluetooth module version 4.0.  To synchronize with a computer or laptop you need to use a standard MicroUSB cable.  In <span>three-</span> dimensional <span>space, the</span> dimensions of the apparatus are as follows: in height - 129, in width - 68.2, and in thickness - 8.9 mm.  The mass of the device is 122 grams. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Options Samsung Galaxy J1 </h2>

    <p>  The instruction, like other elements of the documentation, is unlikely to interest the potential (or actual) buyer.  The rules for the first launch of a smartphone have been firmly set in our heads, and only a warranty card will be of special value among documents.  In addition to these elements, a battery for the device, a charger, a cable of type MicroUSB-USB 2.0 to it were included in the delivery set.  Well, actually, the phone itself. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  From the very first glance it becomes clear that we are faced with nothing more than the most typical representative of a device running the Android operating system, manufactured by our beloved South Korean company.  However, not everything is so bad.  In fact, the subject of our review today is quite qualitatively and interestingly brought down.  Around the device‚Äôs screen is a small edging that automatically makes the device more interesting in some respects. </p><p>  If we talk about aesthetics, then, in principle, there is nothing new here.  Everything that is typical for Samsung smartphones.  In the mobile device market, the model is presented in three color combinations at once.  The first two are quite standard.  This is a white solution (with a pearly shimmer), as well as black.  Well, the third variation is the blue color. </p><h2>  Materials of manufacture </h2>

    <p>  A big plus in the piggy bank of the smartphone is the plastic from which the device‚Äôs body is made.  Its quality is really at a high level, I want to praise the company employees for their excellent work in this direction for a long time and non-stop.  Plastic, which was used in the manufacture of this smartphone, very favorably distinguishes it from similar competitive devices.  Now let's talk about the controls. </p><h2>  Left side </h2>

    <p>  On the opposite side you can see the phone‚Äôs power management button.  By tapping it, the device can be locked and unlocked, as well as turned on or off. </p><h2>  Bottom end </h2><p>  Here we have a connector for synchronization with a personal computer or laptop.  This is MicroUSB version 2.0.  It is also used to recharge the device by connecting to the device or from the mains. </p><h2>  Top end </h2><p>  Nothing particularly interesting.  Only the jack into which the wired stereo headset (or headphones) is connected is standard 3.5 millimeters. </p><h2>  Rear panel </h2><p>  Here we have a lid.  If we remove it, we can find a battery under it, as well as slots for SIM cards processed according to the MicroSIM standard.  If you purchase a modification with only one socket, then instead of the second you will see an ordinary stub.  There is also a slot for installing an external microSD format drive. </p><h2>  Reliability </h2><p>  The device in the hand is not bad, it does not slip anywhere.  In a way, it‚Äôs even convenient.  Thank you for this again, the company employees who were not too lazy and finally made a nice plastic.  With ease, the device is hidden in pockets.  The mechanical key below the screen is designed to quickly minimize applications.  In addition to it, there are two touch controls. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  So, what are the advantages of the device reviews?  They got here: </p><p>  - Good call quality. </p><p>  ‚ÄúNice microphone.‚Äù </p><p>  - Vibration alert of medium intensity. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings, users note: </p><p>  - The only microphone.  Although it is of high quality, it will convey your voice very quietly in a noisy environment. </p><p>  - Price. </p><p>  Indeed, the cost of the device is ten thousand rubles.  For this money, you can safely buy a <span>Lumia 640</span> smartphone <span>,</span> which by its characteristics will definitely surpass its competitor.  And inside the Android segment, you can find many more productive models at the same price. </p>
