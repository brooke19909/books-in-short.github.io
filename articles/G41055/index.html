If you decide to take a trip through the territory of Belarus, and the path will run through the capital of this state, information about where Minsk bus stations are located will be very useful. </p><h2>  East Bus Station </h2><p>  The location of the bus station is the south-eastern part of the city.  The decision to build arose as a result of the fact that the Central Bus Station of Minsk could not cope with the huge passenger flow in the 70s.  To implement the project, a site was allocated at the intersection of Rokossovsky Avenue with Vaneeva Street.  In 1983, the bus station was commissioned.  There are hotel rooms and a catering point. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ttransport.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="east bus station" class="if uuid-2399655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32232/2399655.jpg"></div><p>  Schedule: </p><ul><li>  from Monday to Friday starts to function at 5:20 and ends at 1:30; </li><li>  on weekends it works from 5:20, closes at 23:30. </li></ul><p>  It is located at: st.
