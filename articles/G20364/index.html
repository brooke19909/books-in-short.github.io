    <p>  In terms of storage devices, ZenFone 2 has 16 GB of internal memory, of which only 10 GB can be used for its intended purpose.  However, this is not a problem, since you can use microSD cards with a capacity of up to 128 GB.  The battery life of this smartphone is provided by a well-balanced removable lithium-polymer 2070 mAh battery. </p><p>  The main camera is manufactured by Toshiba and has 13 megapixels, 5 lens elements, autofocus, dual LED flash, laser focusing technology and HDR capabilities, while the <span>front camera</span> has a resolution of 5 megapixels. </p><p>  Speaking of connectivity, we note that the Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb (which is generally positive) includes a MicroUSB 2.0 port, a Bluetooth 4.0 chip and a wireless network that uses 802.11 A / B / G / N / AC standards.  In terms of wireless support, you can connect to Wi-Fi networks with a frequency of 2.44 to 5 GHz.  The ASUS ZE500KL functionality also offers the ability to use two SIM cards at the same time, but only one of them supports 4G mobile networks (LTE and HSPA +).  The second SIM will only offer 2G connectivity. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  The Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb smartphone has a height of 143.7 mm and a width of 71.5 mm.

    <h2>  Design and build quality </h2><p>  Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb, reviews of which mainly concern its appearance, copies the design of its predecessor - TheZenFone 2 ZE551ML.  The 5.65-inch frame in this device is made of high-quality plastic and has a matte metallic sheen on the lower front.  This makes the smartphone really stand out and gives the impression of a premium gadget.  Nevertheless, it would be much better if this metal finish continued to the top panel. </p>

    <p>  ASUS developers have paid much attention to ergonomics.  This is primarily manifested in the fact that 70.8% of the front surface is occupied by a screen.  This suggests that Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb White does not have large unused areas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The top edge of the smartphone has a power button, which is easily accessible using the device with one hand.  Next to it you will find an audio jack designed for headphones. </p><p>  The bottom edge accommodates a micro-USB connector, which allows you to easily transfer content between the Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb Black and the computer. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  On the lower edge, just above the front brushed metal finish, you will find three capacitive buttons that make it easy to access and use the Android functionality: Home, go back and the ‚Äúlatest app‚Äù.  These physical buttons work flawlessly, and their backlight looks pretty nice. </p><p>  One of the most interesting features of the new Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb Red is the volume settings.  The corresponding button is located on the back plate of the smartphone, under the main camera.  ASUS has made this change, taking into account ergonomics, since the thin sides of the device could not accommodate any serious buttons.  Nevertheless, this is a good solution, as it only adds convenience to using the gadget.  In addition, since there are no side buttons on the device, you can not worry about accidentally pressing one of them when you hold it in your hands. </p>

    <h2>  Zen UI: Useful Services </h2><ul><li>  ASUS Support - Provides information on Zen UI and support for any smartphone-related issues. </li><li>  MyASUS - access to 24/7 ASUS support. </li><li>  AudioWizard - allows you to personalize sound settings. </li><li>  Data Transfer - helps you connect ZenFone 2 to old phones that have Bluetooth. </li><li>  Do It Later - helps you create and organize daily tasks, reminders, notes, and other planning tools. </li><li>  Kids Mode is a great app that helps parents control what children can access on their smartphone. </li><li>  Mini Movie - the ability to create movies from photos stored on your smartphone, which can then be posted on the Internet. </li><li>  Share Link is an application that helps you transfer files between your smartphone and computer without having to use mobile communications. </li><li>  Splendid - personalized settings for the IPS panel. </li><li>  Zen Circle is a social network that works by sharing video created on a smartphone. </li><li>  ZenMotion - a touch control setting that allows you to open many applications from a locked screen, configure the interface for use on the one hand, and other useful functions. </li><li>  ZenTalk is a forum dedicated to all owners of ZenFone, discussions on which can be very useful. </li></ul><p>  Another feature worth mentioning about the UI Zen is its Lockscreen.  Its minimalistic design is customizable, you can choose a number of shortcuts that send you directly to the designated applications.  By default, the lock screen contains shortcuts for the camera, phone, and messages. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  A battery capacity of 2070mAh will allow you to use the Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb smartphone (reviews of which did not work for long, were a little disappointing) for 10-12 hours with moderate use and 6-7 hours with intensive mode.  The device can be used for a day or more, if you set the brightness to 50%, and then you will make short calls, send a few messages or periodically drop an email.  As with all other smartphones, battery life depends on your personal habits. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The main camera on the ASUS ZE500KL has 13 megapixels and uses a Toshiba PixelMaster sensor.  It comes equipped with laser autofocus, which allows you to provide a focusing time of only 0.3 seconds (this feature was also available on the flagship ZenFone 2).  The camera works fine and when shooting at close range, if you place the lens 5 cm from the captured subject, you get a great macro shot.  As follows from user reviews, on this device you can take pictures with a maximum resolution of 4096x3072 pixels. </p><p>  Nevertheless, in low light conditions, image clouding is quite noticeable.  ASUS is trying to solve this problem with a low-light mode, which manages to eliminate interference, but it also reduces the sharpness of details.  To help you in such situations, we have found that using a dual LED flash can reduce noise. </p><p>  At the same time, the dual LED flash provides accurate color and especially skin tones in portrait shooting.  It is worth mentioning the fact that Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb (black and other color options) offers a number of camera functions that are not available in most middle-class smartphones.  First of all, it is the presence of manual mode, GIF mode, a timer, simultaneous shooting of several frames (the camera captures several images from which you can choose the best one), the Selfie option (allows you to use the rear camera for self-portrait), the mini mode (blurs the surroundings of the subject ), HDR and others. </p><p>  The front camera, with an extension of 5 megapixels, will help you take a lot of good selfies on which you will look good thanks to the available effects and settings. </p><h2>  Asus ZenFone 2 Lazer ZE500KL 16Gb - specifications and verdict </h2><p>  As the above review shows, <span>ASUS ZenFone 2 ZE500KL</span> is a mid-range smartphone with excellent technical specifications.  Its functionality will not allow you to play the most demanding games available on Google Play, but it is undoubtedly able to satisfy all the needs of the average user. </p>
