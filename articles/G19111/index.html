Description</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Mojave Desert is a symbol or even an embodiment of the southern <span>states of America.</span>  It stretches along three US government units and reaches the border with Mexico, where it smoothly passes into the Sonora desert.  Here the hellish heat reigns all the time and the winds blow, and in ancient times only brave cowboys dealt with such bad weather. </p><p>  Numerous natural treasures, unique landscapes, valleys and endless horizons - this is what the Mojave Desert today includes.  <span>Aircraft cemetery,</span> and, most importantly, Las Vegas - these are the main attractions of the area.  Now we will take a closer look at this tourist site. </p><h2>  Flora and fauna of the region </h2><p>  Alas, not everyone can enjoy the flora of this area.  The Mojave Desert has a very meager set of plants, and all those that are here are very specific and non-standard.  Firstly, there are numerous cacti, among which you can find populations that are not even sold in our latitudes.  Secondly, in the desert there is a tree-like yucca.  Various types of undersized bushes are very widespread. </p><p>  A characteristic feature of this desert area are ephemerides.  These are one-season populations that themselves sow and germinate only if it rains.  At these moments, the desert is dressed in all kinds of colors, but such beauty does not last very long.  Of the representatives of the fauna, birds, insects and reptiles are most common here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mojave Desert" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/604286.jpg" width="600"></div>

Later, the government began to build new highways that bypassed these settlements, and over time, life in them completely died out. </p><p>  One of the most attractive ghost towns in Mojave is Calico.  These are the ruins of an ancient typically western town in which brave cowboys and their families lived.  It is followed by the settlement of Kelso, from which only the depot has survived.  The main asset of this area are the buzzing sands.  The local dunes, subject to strong winds, show the world real melodies, which are simply unrealistic to forget. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mojave Desert Aircraft Cemetery" class="if" height="442" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/604287.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Death valley </h2><p>  Now consider what the most famous attraction boasts the Mojave Desert.  Death Valley is the driest part of the area that the Indians used to call <span>Tierra del Fuego.</span>  From April to October, the air temperature rises here to 52 degrees, and at the same time not a single drop of rain falls.  The amount of water that a person who is here for an hour can lose is one liter, so you can die from dehydration in the Death Valley very quickly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Man-made cemetery </h2><p>  For several decades, people sent flying liners and fighters on their last journey, and the ideal place for them was chosen - the Mojave Desert.  The airplane cemetery here is located near the local airfield, and in recent years this dump has become a real open-air museum.  Airplanes, the last refuge for which was the Mojave Desert, volunteers and residents of the surrounding villages transformed.  Some cabins and salons were disassembled, and a backlight was mounted in them.  Of course, these wastes of aboveground transport have not yet been converted into restaurants and hotels, however, it is possible that soon a new tourist corner will appear on our planet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mojave Desert on the map" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/604288.jpg" width="352"></div>

    <h2>  Joshua Tree Park </h2><p>  The Mojave Desert has a very specific flora, which is not found anywhere else on the planet.  Therefore, the authorities carefully guard it, collecting each of the species in one national park. </p><p>  On the territory of the Joshua Tri Nature Reserve, you can find a variety of types of flowers, shrubs, as well as a desert symbol plant - yucca.  Here are presented all its varieties, which cause delight in every tourist.  It is worth noting that the national park is also rich in artifacts of the past.  In this area, Indians previously lived, household items and battlefield equipment of which remained in the lands of Mojave to this day.  Now they are excavated and presented in numerous museums. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mojave Desert Death Valley" class="if" height="403" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/604285.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  An oasis in the middle of the wasteland </h2><p>  The Mojave Desert on the map is located in the tropical and subtropical climatic zones.  This suggests that there should be a mild and humid climate suitable for summer vacations.  In fact, the land is covered with hard rocks, which are tirelessly surrounded by winds.  But among the unbearable heat and the eternal wind, you can find an oasis - Lake Mead.  This is the largest reservoir in the United States, which feeds California and Nevada with its waters.  It is surrounded by picturesque bays, sandy beaches where you can swim, sunbathe, enjoy water sports or just admire the scenery.  In the days of water decline, islands emerge here, which makes the landscape even more unusual and attractive. </p>
