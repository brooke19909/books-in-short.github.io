    <p>  Station "Paveletskaya" - the metro, performing the role of a magnificent transport interchange of the modern metropolis.  Situated between Avtozavodskaya and Novokuznetskaya, it daily receives a huge stream of Muscovites and guests of the capital who are always in a hurry. </p><p>  In principle, the name of each metro station is considered to be considered separately.  In this case, everything is extremely simple.  Art.  Paveletskaya metro station got its name in honor of the railway station of the capital of the Russian Federation located on the surface of the same name.  In general, if you go deeper into history even more, you can find out what the Paveletsky Station was named in the harsh post-war years in the modest village of Pavelets, located in the Ryazan Region. </p><p>  Today, the Paveletskaya station is a metro, which in fact can be considered a masterpiece of architecture.  Both walls and columns are finished with white marble.  The pylons, although made of the same material, have a pronounced light pink hue.  The floor is finished with gray granite.  Lamps mounted in the caissons of arches brightly illuminate the main hall of the station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The decoration tells visitors about the facts of the history of the armed forces of the former USSR.  In the central room, among other things, you can also admire the bronze medallions by sculptor Efimov and the original stucco decoration. </p><h2>  Station "Paveletskaya" - metro with its own history </h2>

    <p>  During the opening of this transport hub, the city was going through difficult times.  In 1943, Moscow experienced the horrors of wartime along with the entire country.  Metro Paveletskaya was put into operation on November 20. </p><p>  The station was opened on the already existing stretch between "Sverdlov Square" and "Plant them.  Stalin ‚Äù, that is, using modern names, we note that this happened on the site‚Äú Theater ‚Äù-‚Äú Avtozavodskaya ‚Äù. </p><p>  After the war, of course, the station had to be reconstructed.  However, the architects made a very wise decision to stick to the original design.  As a result, Paveletskaya, although it turned into a pillar, but outwardly changed slightly. </p><p>  But in 1953 the construction work did not end.  Again, and again forcedly, they had to start in the spring of 1987.  The reason for this was a fire that broke out in the cabin of a train station.  Finishing the southern end of the underground room was almost completely destroyed. </p><h2>  Station features <strong> </strong></h2>

    <p>  First of all, we note that the depth of the station is quite impressive - 33.5 meters.  This is what allows us to consider this building one of the deepest in the capital.  But that is not all.  Few people know that the ‚ÄúPaveletskaya‚Äù was once built on an individual project, so it has no analogues in Moscow in its structure. </p><p>  Now the station can boast of the presence of two vestibules at once: the north one, equipped with a modern escalator, and the south one, located inside the Paveletsky station.  Sights located on the surface clearly indicate that among its regular visitors there will be both local residents and tourists.  The Theater Museum, Mourning Drive, college, academy, many schools, food shops and several hotels at once make Paveletskaya one of the most popular in Moscow. </p><p>  And finally, it should be noted that the tunnel connecting the Koltsevaya and Zamoskvoretskaya lines is the longest inter-station crossing <span>of the Moscow metro.</span> </p>
