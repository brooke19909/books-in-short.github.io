History of the city</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Khmelnitsky is a city in <span>Ukraine, a regional center,</span> standing on a river called the Southern Bug.  Soon this settlement will celebrate its 600th anniversary.  It is believed that in these places people have lived since time immemorial.  Despite its turbulent and eventful history, Khmelnitsky is a city in which there are not many ancient attractions.  Should I include it in my tourist route, what monuments and interesting objects can be seen here? </p><h2>  The beginning of the history of the glorious city </h2><p>  It seems that in the place of the modern <span>Khmelnitsky region</span> people lived at all times.  During archaeological excavations in this area were found settlements of the Scythian period - VII-III century BC.  e., Chernyakhov culture - III-V century A.D.  e., as well as artifacts related to the early Iron Age (I century BC).  When exactly the modern city was founded, it is not known for certain.  The settlement with the name Ploskirov or Proskurov was first mentioned in historical documents dating back to 1493. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khmelnitsky city" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1102595.jpg" width="600"></div>  Much later, the modern name Khmelnitsky appeared.  The city was called Proskurov for many centuries, often even today it is so called by old-timers.  At the beginning of the 15th century, this settlement belongs to Poland.  At that time, a wooden fortress was being built on the right bank of the river, in which only about 100 people constantly live.

There were in Proskurov and peasant uprisings directed against the Poles.  From 1648 to 1654  The War of Independence lasted.  At that time, all the inhabitants bravely fought for the freedom of the city under the leadership of the chieftain Bohdan Khmelnitsky.  In 1672, the war with the Turks ended; few survived from the local population.  In 1699, Proskurov again became a <span>Polish city</span> and the Poles actively moved here.  And in 1795, the settlement was part of Russia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Khmelnitsky city population" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1104170.jpg" width="600"></div>  A little later, Proskurov became the center of the Proskurovsky district of the Podolsk province.  At this time, the city is actively developing trade and industry.  Lush fairs were held here up to 14 times a year, and in 1870 a railway was launched.  Khmelnitsky is a city in which many chic buildings built in the XIX-XX centuries have been preserved.  It was also in the Soviet period, in 1954, that the city received its current name - in honor of the chieftain Bohdan Khmelnitsky.

    <h2>  Khmelnitsky during WWII </h2><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, the city was captured by the Germans.  A concentration camp was created here, in which, according to preliminary estimates of experts, at least 65 thousand people died.  Locals try not to recall those terrible times, but, nevertheless, this is the true history of the city.  Khmelnitsky was badly damaged during the German occupation.  Many citizens were killed, parks were cut down and most of the urban development was destroyed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the city of Khmelnitsky" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10441/1102598.jpg" width="446"></div>  The concentration camp lasted about three years.  March 25, 1944 the city was liberated from invaders by the Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front.  The return of freedom - this was only the first step, the settlement (as well as the entire region) needed a long restoration.  After all, during the war, residential buildings, administrative and public buildings, as well as other important facilities, were destroyed.
