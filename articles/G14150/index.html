Find a suitable bank program, collect the necessary documents - and now the money is in your pocket.  But in reality, everything is not so simple.  Often people who see an advertisement for a particular lending program find that in reality the conditions turn out to be completely different, and sometimes such a discrepancy is revealed already at the stage of signing documents that a client who is unaware of all the intricacies of the process can wave without looking.  To minimize the risk of errors on the part of the client and to control the honesty of the bank, there is a credit broker.  Reviews, who helped, what these experts contributed to - all this information you will find later in our review.  Let's try to understand the essence of this profession. </p><h2>  Who is it? </h2><p>  In short, a loan broker is an intermediary between a bank and a potential client.  Its work is comparable to that of realtors: the broker is looking for the optimal program for a particular client, while he owns information about all possible options and can explain to the client the difference between them, then the broker helps to collect all the necessary documents, and at the last stage of his work, he already makes sure that the bank is extremely honest with the client. </p>

    <p>  Of course, all this can be done independently, without interfering with a third-party specialist.  But for the most part, the positive collects a loan broker reviews.  Those who have been helped by these specialists already understand how facilitated the participation of a third party in their relationship with the bank is. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is he doing? </h2><p>  It is worth noting that real credit brokers who help, collect the best reviews about themselves, thereby promoting their profession.  A broker can be useful not only at the stage of searching for the most profitable <span>loan program,</span> but also if you already have a loan: the specialist will tell you whether it is possible to change the size of payments, their schedule, and whether there are, in principle, options that will help the borrower to pay his debt with minimal losses for your budget.  That is, it‚Äôs never too late to turn to a credit broker: even if you already have a lending program that is right for you, it is better to play it safe and consult a specialist if everything is as smooth as you think. </p><h2>  Underwater rocks </h2><p>  But in any work there are people who defame her.  The profession of "credit broker" was no exception.  Testimonials to whom they helped, how they helped - all this information can be fabricated to cover up the criminal activity of a specialist.  For example, a borrower cannot rely on a loan because of a low level of his income or a not very good credit history, in such cases a black broker helps to hide all undesirable nuances of a client‚Äôs biography, thereby deceiving banks. </p>

    <p>  The opposite situation also occurs: a broker, having an agreement with a certain banking institution, leads his clients there, even if other banks have much more favorable credit conditions.  It‚Äôs worth it to think twice before contacting a broker who is ready to do his job almost for nothing ‚Äî this may signal that the specialist is not as clean as he wants to seem. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to choose?  Based on reviews </h2><p>  So, how is a suitable loan broker chosen?  Reviews, who have already helped, location, advertising - which part of the information should influence your choice?  All of the above!  Now, many people rely on the feedback of previous customers, considering them almost the ultimate truth.  Yes, you should definitely find out what other people think about this or that broker, but still you shouldn‚Äôt completely trust everything written, especially on the official website of the brokerage office.  Employees of the office themselves can leave positive feedback by registering under different names, while negative feedback can be deleted.  Therefore, choosing a company by reviews, make sure that the writing style of the latter is different (after all, people cannot use the same sentences and turns), in addition, along with the opinions of satisfied customers, those who have remained after the work of specialists certain issues. </p>

    <h2>  And also look at the location of the office </h2><p>  With regard to the location of the office, it is worth paying attention to its "sedentary".  A company that has been working with clients for a long time will definitely have a <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãphone</span> number, its habitability will be felt in the office itself - yet people eventually adjust their workplace for themselves.  Special attention should be paid to the information stand, which should contain information about the institution‚Äôs license, work schedule, the necessary phone numbers and a <span>book of complaints and suggestions.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  And pay attention to advertising </h2><p>  With advertising, you should be even more careful: it is unlikely that ads that are printed on a black and white printer and glued to poles belong to a truly reliable brokerage office.  In no case can you not believe in those advertisements that promise assistance in a credit transaction on the most favorable conditions only ‚Äúwithin a week‚Äù or any other promotional time limits.  Usually unscrupulous brokers lure gullible people this way, so that later they can run away with their money.  So, choosing a broker, check everything: what is the reputation of a credit broker (reviews, who have helped), the result of his work (whether the customers were satisfied), the location of the office and its advertising.  In addition, for a final decision, you can contact the "National Association of Credit Brokers and Financial Advisers", whose members are only those companies that not only have a license, but also provide really high-quality services. </p><h2>  Credit broker in Moscow </h2><p>  How to find all the necessary information: where to find such a specialist as a good credit broker, reviews, who helped?  Moscow is a city that can give very concrete answers to all these questions.  So, Creditmart and Ideal Consulting are considered the best brokerage offices in the capital. </p>

    <p>  Creditmart, whose branches are located throughout the city, works not only with banks, but also with insurance and investment institutions - that is, specialist consultations are possible in many directions.  The company offers more than five hundred different programs aimed at solving the financial problems of customers - mortgage, lending and other banking programs.  However, some customers say that the company greatly overestimates the cost of its services and requires payment of almost every step of the lending operation. </p><p>  Among the credit brokers and financial advisors approved by the National Association there is also ‚ÄúIdeal Consulting‚Äù, whose specialists work not only in the field of consulting, but also are involved in legal registration of logistics and customs services, as well as assist in business administration.  The membership of this company in AKBR (namely, the aforementioned association is abbreviated as such) confirms its professionalism and reliability.  And versatility allows you to have a huge network of customers. </p><h2>  Services of a credit broker in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Fosborn Home is St. Petersburg's oldest loan broker.  Reviews, who were helped, how exactly they helped, what were the results of the work - satisfied customers answer all these questions with their own stories, which only confirm the good reputation of this company.  The field of activity of Fosborn Home <span>is credit</span> counseling to businesses and individuals, mortgage counseling, as well as assistance in working with real estate (both the selection of the most suitable premises and assistance in their sale).  The network, existing on the market for more than ten years, has branches in many cities of the country. </p><h2>  Cons of broker intervention </h2><p>  Now that we already have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwho credit brokers are, whether it is worth contacting them is the next question.  Of the minuses of the intermediary services, one can name a commission (usually this is about 2% of the transaction amount, however, in some cases, the broker may request 20%, in which case, most likely, the operation will be related to crime), and another, according to some scrupulousness of consultants who try to collect as much information as possible about their client. </p>

    <p>  In defense of brokers, we can say that they are forced to exercise excessive caution, figuring out every little thing that could somehow affect the receipt of a loan or mortgage. </p><h2>  Is the game worth the candle? </h2><p>  And what are the reviews about credit brokers?  Are they really necessary when making deals?  Some experts note that during the existence of brokers, their role has completely changed: initially people turned to them because they did not have enough knowledge to conduct banking operations on their own.  Today, customers often want to save their time - that is why they entrust the execution of all necessary securities to a third party. </p>

    <p>  Of course, even entrusting your banking business to a specialist in this matter, you need to have at least the slightest idea about the loans that interest you: taking advantage of the lack of knowledge of the client, an unscrupulous loan broker can easily offer far from the best option.  Plus, if what the consultant offers is not a suitable option for you, you still have to pay for the services.  Yes, if you want to spend a minimum of effort, you need loan brokers.  Should you turn to them for help - decide for yourself. </p><h2>  What do people think? </h2><p>  A loan broker collects the most controversial reviews about his work.  Some believe that this is only <span>extortion of money,</span> they say, the consultants themselves do not comply with all the conditions prescribed in the agreements with borrowers, and even they pay a lot of money for their services, delegating the client to financial organizations that issue loans at huge interest rates. </p>

    <p>  Others note that competent specialists helped them get a loan even with a not very good credit history, and indeed helped to find the best option for obtaining a loan.  How many people, so many opinions - everyone knows that.  But still pay attention to the feedback of previous customers when <span>choosing a broker,</span> as mentioned above, it is necessary. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now we know who credit brokers are.  Everyone can draw up an opinion about their need for credit operations for themselves.  Of course, among specialists there are charlatans who have agreements with banks and lead clients there, completely not caring for the interests of the borrower, there are those who help to fix all the dark spots in the credit history.  What can I say, in any profession there are those who are unclean on hand.  But still, many people agree that consulting brokers, their assistance in obtaining all the necessary securities and monitoring the process of obtaining a loan significantly facilitated a rather unpleasant and complicated banking operation.  Yes, everything can be done independently, but it is better to entrust some tasks to professionals. </p>
