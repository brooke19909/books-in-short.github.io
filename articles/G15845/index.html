Holidays in this island country of the Arab world are not like the usual ones - in Hurghada or Dubai.  The name of the country is translated from Arabic as ‚Äútwo seas‚Äù.  From the point of view of the strict science of geography, Bahrain has one.  And not even the sea, but the Persian Gulf, part of the Indian Ocean.  But the main island, on which the kingdom's capital, Manama, is located, has an almost rectangular shape.  So people thought that there were two seas. </p><p>  But not only a <span>beach holiday</span> attracts tourists to Bahrain.  In this dwarf state, there was a place for the desert and many other natural and cultural attractions.  Two objects are included in the list of <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> Sites, which is a good result for a dwarf state (765 square kilometers).  In this article we will tell you all about the rest in Bahrain.  Guest reviews provide a lot of valuable information about this wonderful country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahrain tourist reviews" class="if" height="262" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1272523.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Bahrain and other useful information </h2><p>  The state includes thirty-three islands, but only three of them are more or less large.  They are grouped in an archipelago and are not so far from the coast of Saudi Arabia.  A sixteen-kilometer bridge connects the main island - Bahrain - with the city of Al Khobar on the mainland.  Moscow is linked to the smallest state in the Arab East by daily scheduled flights operated by Golf Air.  You can also get to Manama with transfers: in Cairo, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Dubai or Istanbul.  Do I need to open a visa in advance to come to Bahrain?  Reviews of tourists claim that the sticker in the passport can be obtained upon arrival at the airport.  But the visa is valid only two weeks.  There is no time difference with <span>Moscow in Bahrain</span> .  The monetary unit is the dinar, in which there are a thousand fils.  It is equal to approximately 175 Russian rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Vacation in Bahrain tourists reviews" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1272521.jpg" width="600"></div>

The proximity to Saudi Arabia suggests that Bahrain also has a dry desert climate.  But this is not so.  The presence of water softens the seasonal and diurnal amplitudes of temperature fluctuations.  Winters are dry, but not cold at all.  But in the summer in Bahrain it is hot and humid.  It is impossible to call this period the rainy season, as in the Philippines, but rains are still frequent.  Therefore, the best time to travel for a vacation to Bahrain is called by late reviews and early spring.  In principle, the islands are good in the winter months.  January temperature is +20 degrees in the afternoon.  But the nights are cold in winter.  The thermometer column drops to +8.  Summer in Bahrain is a low season.  The heat of 37-45 degrees is adjacent to high humidity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews of tourists about the rest in Bahrain" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1272525.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bahrain Resorts </h2><p>  In this country you can hunt with falcons, watch the Formula 1 race car race or dive for pearls.  There are many colorful Arabian exotics and ancient monuments.  But it is no secret that the most popular is a beach holiday in Bahrain.  Reviews of tourists claim that the coast of the main island is dotted with resorts.  Most tourist hotels are concentrated in Manama.  The capital has beautiful sandy, well-equipped beaches.  Entrance to them is paid.  The exception is those coasts that belong to hotels on the first line.  In Manama, Emir Beach, Al-Zallak and Cornish are popular.  In the north of the main island are the resorts of Sitra, Budaya and Abu Subh.  At the southern end of Bahrain, rest in Sanabis and Bapko.  By boat you can reach the free beaches of Al Dar.  Noteworthy is the rest on the Hawar archipelago.  There are many top star resorts there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="All about vacation in Bahrain reviews" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1272526.jpg" width="600"></div>

And indeed, leaving Bahrain, you will feel like Adam and Eve, expelled from paradise.  Both UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located in the northern part of the island.  They must certainly be seen.  The ancient fort of Calat al-Bahrain reviews of tourists are called the most interesting place on the island.  It was built in 2300 BC, and since then it has been perfectly preserved.  In Muharraq, there is a second attraction - an ancient place of extraction and processing of pearls.  Other interesting places that tourists insistently recommend visiting are the Barbara temple, the necropolis of the blessed with the royal graves, the house of Sayyadi. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahrain Travel Reviews" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1272529.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Bahrain nature </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists in Bahrain praise the beauty of the country.  More than two thousand species of coral grow in coastal waters.  Therefore, going on vacation to Bahrain, grab the mask and snorkel.  Inhabitants of coral reefs are stingrays, moray eels and giant turtles.  The center of the main island is a plateau.  On a guided tour of the desert, you should climb to the highest point of Bahrain - Mount Ed Dukhan (134 meters above sea level).  Not far from it grows a "tree of life" - the same fruit from which Adam and Eve did not have time to taste.  In fact, this mesquite is four hundred years old.  But a tree grows where there is no water.  And this is a miracle.  Wildlife lovers should visit the famous Al-Arin Nature Reserve, which is located near Manama. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bahrain Vacation Reviews" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1272528.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Reviews of tourists about holidays in Bahrain mention all the famous world hotel chains.  But such hotels as Crown Plaza, Ritz-Carlton, Radisson Sas, Banyan Tree Al-Arin, Gulf are not cheap.  Especially chic hotels on the Hawar archipelago.  It is noteworthy that in Manama there is no shortage of four-star hotels.  And often they also stand on the first line.  The sea off the coast of the islands is warm, the beaches are sandy, the bottom is freed from corals and gradually descends to the depths.  Therefore, Bahrain tourists reviews are often called a place for a great family vacation. </p><h2>  What to try and what to bring as souvenirs </h2><p>  The cuisine in Bahrain is predominantly Arabic.  That is, everywhere in cafes and eateries you will be offered falafel, couscous, tabula and kebab.  But there are also regional gastronomic features.  They are expressed in the abundance of fish dishes and seafood delicacies.  Bahrain residents love the exotic, so the resorts have many restaurants Thai, Indian and even Russian cuisine.  But if you want to try something exclusively local, order a makhbus with fish, yachts, dajaju or kebab of teak, and for dessert - rice pudding with dates Muhammar. </p><p>  Reviews about holidays in Bahrain often mention the fact that this <span>island nation</span> is famous as a place for inexpensive shopping.  There are many traditional <span>oriental bazaars</span> in the country (they are called ‚Äúbitches‚Äù) where you can buy everything: from dried dates to the Arabian horse.  Tourists mainly bring wonderful jewelry made of gold and pearls, as well as ethnic Arabic souvenirs - rugs, embossing, fabrics. </p>
