  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile air conditioning: customer reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Mobile air conditioners have this name because they can be easily moved from one room to another as needed.  They are compact, no larger than a bedside table or a suitcase, up to 70 cm high and up to 40 cm wide. </p><p>  The simplest of them is a monoblock <span>mobile air conditioner,</span> reviews of which characterize it as a very convenient mechanism in operation.  In summer it can be used for cooling, and in winter - for heating air.  Another convenience - it can easily be moved from one room to another and even transported to another room.  All parts of this unit are located in one housing.  The principle of operation is very simple and based on the intake of warm air through special openings, cooling it with fans and an evaporator, and then throwing it into the room.  The heat generated during operation of the evaporator and compressor is removed to the street through a corrugated hose. </p><p>  There is also a mobile split system or a two-unit mobile air conditioner, reviews of which indicate its more complex installation, although easier than that of stationary units.  These air conditioners have an indoor unit installed in the room, and an external unit that is carried out to the street and suspended on belts, ropes or fixed on brackets.  The blocks are connected by a flexible hose in which refrigerant circulates.  This design of the air conditioner allows you to reduce the noise resulting from the operation of the compressor mounted in the outdoor unit. </p><p>  All <span>portable air conditioners</span> have a number of advantages and a number of disadvantages.  The main and undeniable advantage of them is the ease of installation.  <span>How to install a</span> mobile air conditioner, even a layman will understand.  In this case, you do not have to hollow the wall of the room, as when installing stationary air conditioners.  You just need to install it on a flat surface in the desired room closer to the window.  The flexible corrugated hose that comes with the kit must be attached at one end to the air conditioner hole specified in the instructions, and the other should be taken out into the street - and that‚Äôs all.  To exit the hose, you can use the window.  To prevent air from entering the room from the street, the window is closed with something, for example, with a piece of plywood in which a hole is left for the hose. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  On the prices of mobile air conditioning, reviews are also not silent.  The price range ranges from 13,000 to 60,000 rubles, so even the poor can purchase them.  The only problem is that the main manufacturer of this equipment is China, whose products are often not happy with quality. </p><p>  What are the disadvantages of mobile air conditioning?  Customer reviews are as follows: </p><p>  1. Low, lower than that of stationary <span>air conditioners, power.</span> </p><p>  2. Noisy (especially monoblock). </p><p>  3. The need to regularly pour water from the tray where condensate is collected.  During normal work, about 5 liters of liquid is collected per day. </p><p>  Basically, these are the nuances in operation, and this is how mobile air conditioners work.  Customer reviews are almost identical in this.  Such electrical equipment is in high demand because of the low price and the ability to easily install the mechanism in the country, in a country house for the duration of residence there.  It is easy to simply disconnect the hose, close the window and move the air conditioner to another place.  Of course, Chinese production does not guarantee quality at the European level, and in the domestic market models of mobile air conditioners are mainly represented by China.  But this does not mean at all that the acquired miracle of technology, designed to create coolness, will necessarily break in two days.  Usually they work decently for several years. </p><p>  If you focus on price, window air conditioners are a good alternative to mobile air conditioners.  Although it‚Äôs more difficult to install them, and only a professional should do it, but at a price they are about one and a half times cheaper, they work with less noise and with greater productivity. </p>
