    <h2>  Tele2 communication is not available: what to do </h2><p>  To begin with, it should be said about the causes of the problems.  The main problem is the lack of Tele2 equipment in any area.  You should go to the window or leave the room and try to call again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not always the problem lies in the SIM card.  Sometimes the phone itself is to blame for the malfunctions.  The following check is required: </p><ul><li>  turn on and off the mobile phone; </li><li>  check the SIM card slot for liquid, wipe; </li><li>  examine the card for damage and scratches; </li><li>  check installed network settings; </li><li>  pull out and reinsert the SIM card; </li><li>  check balance. </li></ul><p>  If, after these manipulations, "Tele2" does not work, then it is not the phone.  Loss of connection may be the result of technical work or difficulties with the equipment.  The reasons, of course, are good, but the operator‚Äôs users usually need to get high-quality communication services.  The timing of the malfunctions can be found on the official website, by the technical support number or directly in the cabin. </p>

    <h2>  Why does 4G Internet not work, and how to fix it? </h2><p>  Many Tele2 customers complained about internet problems.  And not always these claims were unjustified.  As previously mentioned, a company does not have towers everywhere in boundless Russia.  In addition, cellular communications even in rooms junk and breaks.  However, stones cannot be thrown only at the operator.  Sometimes some carelessness of the user or problems in the phone can cause a lack of access to the Network. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There can be a lot of reasons for the fact that the Internet does not work in Tele2.  Firstly, the connection disappears due to the lack of proper communication settings.  Even for users who have recently logged on to the network, this sometimes happens.  To know for sure, you need to go to the "Internet Settings" section and make sure that they are not lost.  If a problem has occurred with these parameters, then there are two ways to solve the problem: contact the help center or call 679. The user will be sent a message with the Internet settings package. </p><p>  Secondly, the problem of connecting to the Internet can be much more prosaic: only the traffic has ended.  The service provider has disabled access to the network due to a used packet.  How to know for sure that this is the cause of connection problems?  You must dial the command * 155 #, and the information will be provided.  If there is no Internet connection due to traffic, you can wait for the next gigabyte package to accrue or order it additionally. </p><p>  Thirdly, the reason that the Internet does not work in Tele2 may be the lack of funds on the balance sheet.  In order for the connection to return again, you need to replenish the account.  Fourthly, it is worth checking whether data transfer is turned on at all.  For Android phones, this can be recognized as follows: you need to drag your finger from top to bottom on the screen, click on the "icons" section in the menu that appears, and click on the "data transfer" image. </p><p>  Fifth, malfunctions can be the result of breakdowns in the mobile device.  Phones can not work forever, sometimes there are malfunctions in their functioning.  It is worth contacting the salon to repair this equipment or purchase a new model. </p><p>  It is undeniable that problems may arise due to the fact that Tele2 does not work well.  To confirm this thought, you need to conduct the following experiment: insert the Tele2 SIM card into another phone.  If the problem is still there, then the matter is in the map.  Perhaps this is due to technical malfunctions or a bad signal.  You can find out about ongoing updates on the official website in the "Region News" section. </p>

    <h2>  3G / 4G modem does not work - how to fix it? </h2><p>  The main problem for users with Tele2 home Internet is that the computer does not recognize the device.  To understand everything, you need to go to the "Device Manager" and make sure the modem is present or not in the list.  The device may not be detected for a number of reasons: </p><ul><li>  the modem is not plugged in; </li><li>  problems with drivers; </li><li>  inoperative USB port; </li><li>  the device itself may be broken. </li></ul><p>  If the modem is marked in the list as unrecognized, then you need to try inserting the cable into another connector or turning off / on the computer.  It is also worth trying to reinstall the driver.  Nothing helped?  Is Tele2 Internet still bad?  Then you should contact technical support or a service center. </p>

    <h2>  How long does the problem with this operator solve? </h2><p>  The official website of the company contains all the deadlines for resolving problems in the system.  A technical support officer works expeditiously when the Tele2 connection is down.  The maximum troubleshooting time is 7 days.  Some issues are resolved during the individual period. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of Tele2 </h2><p>  Some users note many unpleasant features of this operator.  Flattered at a low price, people connect a SIM card.  But they do not know about some not the best aspects of the operator.  From the beginning it is worth saying that Tele2 does not have its own towers in all areas.  This leads to a lack of mobile communications and the presence of strong interference during a call.  Secondly, the Internet "Tele2" does not work efficiently.  All this is due to hardware problems.  Sometimes the Internet and telephony are unavailable for several days.  In the subway and on the premises, there is practically no connection.  Before moving on to this operator, you need to read reviews of other users and know the full picture. </p><h2>  Advantages of Tele2 </h2><p>  The main advantage of this operator is the relatively low cost of communication.  Tele2 is trying to quickly establish work and eliminate its technical flaws.  Support is fast and ready to help at any moment.  Rates are very profitable.  Operator services are available in almost all cities of Russia. </p>
