Charging begins on the 1st of the month that follows the month of putting the facility into operation.  Calculation also ceases from the 1st day of the month following the month of writing off the fixed asset or disposal of depreciated property on any basis. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Nuances </h2><p>  For depreciated property included in groups 8‚Äì10, regardless of the term of putting it into operation, accruals are made using the linear method.  To other objects, an economic entity can apply either of two methods. </p><p>  Please note that the selected method cannot be changed throughout the depreciation calculation period. </p><h2>  Accrual Features </h2><p>  When using the linear method, the depreciation amount is defined as the product of the initial cost of fixed assets and depreciation rates.  The latter is calculated as follows: </p><p>  K = [1 / n] x 100%. </p><p>  In this formula: </p><ul><li>  depreciation rate in% of the initial cost - K; </li><li>  the useful life of the facility, expressed in months, is n. </li></ul><p>  If the non-linear method is used, then the desired value is determined by multiplying the residual value of the depreciable property by the norm: </p><p>  K = [2 / n] x 100%. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wisebread.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="depreciable value of depreciable property" class="if uuid-2917971" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2917971.jpg"></div><h2>  Important points </h2><p>  When calculating, it is necessary to take into account that from the month following the month in which the residual value of depreciated property reaches 20% of the original, accrual should be made according to the following rules: </p><ol><li>  The residual value is recognized as the base. </li><li>  The depreciation amount per month is calculated by dividing the base amount by the number of months remaining until the end of the useful life. </li></ol><h2>  Odds </h2><p>  They are used in calculating the depreciation of depreciated property operated in aggressive conditions or with increased shift.  The coefficients can also be used by agricultural enterprises: greenhouses, poultry farms, livestock farms, etc. However, some restrictions are set. </p><p>  In particular, a ratio of no higher than 2 can be applied to these entities. For fixed assets that are the subject of a leasing agreement, it is allowed to use a coefficient of no higher than three in the calculation. </p><p>  These provisions do not apply to an object included in groups 1-3, if the non-linear method is used. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.divestopedia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="depreciable property is recognized property" class="if uuid-2917974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/2917974.jpg"></div><p>  Aggressive are artificial or natural factors, the influence of which causes increased wear of the OS.
