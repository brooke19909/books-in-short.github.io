    <h2>  In the name of science </h2><p>  The Monkey Nursery in Adler was founded back in 1927.  It is located on the territory of the Research Institute of Medical Primatology.  And this suggests that the monkey nursery in Adler is not only an entertaining, but also a research organization.  It's no secret that primates are experiencing new types of drugs.  They are also used in other types of scientific research.  For example, before sending a woman into space for the first time, tests were conducted on female monkeys to draw a conclusion about whether the female body can withstand the load of space flight. </p><h2>  Live well </h2><p>  Humanity should be grateful to these representatives of the animal world for sacrificing health, and sometimes life, for its good.  But if you distract from the thought that the monkeys in the nursery not only sleep, eat and play, you can enjoy watching the hamadryas, baboons, macaques, rhesus monkeys and monkeys.  Total in the nursery in 1 square.  km live about 4,000 monkeys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Easy to reach </h2><p>  Some people think that there is a monkey nursery in Sochi.  But this is not entirely true.  And to consider that the monkey nursery is located in Adler is also wrong.  To be precise, his address is: Vesyoloye village, st.  Mira, d. 177. But it refers to the Adler district, so it is assumed that this is very close to the city limits.  However, to get to it, you have to use vehicles.  It is necessary to get to the stop "Sovkhoz Russia".  For this, bus routes No. 134 d, 134, 133. are suitable. Having reached the desired stop, you will still have to walk a distance of 3 km.  But it is better to get on a special free shuttle. </p>

    <h2>  Anytime </h2><p>  Nursery work days are Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday.  These days, the shuttle leaves at 11, 13 and 15 hours.  On Friday, he departs from the stop "State Farm Russia" at 11, 13 and 14 hours.  Monkey nursery is open daily from 9 to 18 hours.  Tickets cost 400 rubles for adults and 200 rubles for children under 14 years of age.  Children under 7 years old are free.  Excursions are regularly held in the nursery.  And at any time of the year, and not just in the summer.  The duration of the standard excursion is 40 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Watch and listen </h2><p>  It includes a standard walk in the nursery and an overview of the individuals living in it.  The guide will tell you what the habits of these animals are, what they eat.  Such an excursion will be interesting for both children and adults.  If you want to learn more about how the primates made a contribution to science and medicine, then you should visit a tour that focuses on this side of the life of the inhabitants of the nursery.  Moreover, such excursions come in different subjects and you can choose a topic that interests you specifically.  In the nursery you can see how monkeys live in large families (20-50 individuals in one enclosure).  In addition, the nursery has an observation deck with a beautiful view of the sea and mountains. </p>

    <h2>  What's inside </h2><p>  Monkeys in the nursery can only be fed by staff.  After all, the primates that are in it are not accustomed to humans and can scratch or bite.  It is worthwhile to be prepared in advance for the fact that there is a strong unpleasant smell in the nursery, which is emitted by the monkeys themselves (there are several thousand of them) and their metabolic products.  The enclosures are tightened with a mesh netting, so the view is not as good as behind the glass in the zoo.  Most of all, the nursery will appeal to children.  Moreover, for them you can rent bicycles or scooters.  This pleasure costs only about 100 rubles, and on a vast territory there is a lot of space for skiing. </p><p>  But we should not forget that monkeys are dangerous animals, and children must be watched.  By the way, from the entrance to the nursery to the enclosures it is not necessary to walk.  Although a walk in the fresh air will also be useful, it is better to use a free car to save energy in order to examine the aviaries.  Of course, to see all the several thousand inhabitants will not succeed.  But there will be many impressions. </p><h2>  A lot of interesting </h2><p>  Do not go past the stands and announcements.  At one of them you will read about how visitors should behave nursery.  Another contains information about how many <span>species of monkeys</span> exist in the world and where they live.  On the enclosures there are signs on which the names of the inhabitants and brief information about them are indicated.  On the territory of the nursery there is a memorial complex in memory of scientists and employees of the nursery who took part in the preparation of monkeys for flight into space.  Here is a real spacecraft.  Interestingly, the chimpanzees Dasha and Tisha, who flew into space in 1998, still live in the nursery. </p>

    <p>  If you really like primates and want to learn more about them, then you can visit the Sukhumi monkey nursery.  It is located in the territory of Abkhazia on the slope of Mount Trapezia, near Adler.  But this is a different country, therefore it is more convenient to take a bus tour to quickly and easily cross the state border.  So, in a short time you can get double pleasure from the contemplation of these smart and useful animals.  Sukhumi contains 300 people from Asia, Africa and South America. </p>
