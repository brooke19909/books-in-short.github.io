He is not famous for heroic deeds, like the famous Russian heroes, he does not perform feats for the sake of saving the fatherland or any person.  The story about him comes down to love adventures.  There are only three Bylin about Churil, although they are told in different versions, and an erroneous opinion is created about their larger number. </p><h2>  Russian epics </h2><p>  Bylina is a folk epic song that tells about significant events or the heroic feat of the Russian hero.  In epic stories, historians see the events that took place in Russia in the period from X to XIII centuries.  The work was performed by a singer-storyteller, often accompanied by a guselny accompaniment. </p><p>  In the center of many epics stands the figure of Prince of Kiev, Vladimir.  Churila Plenkovich also lives near Kiev.  Bylina tells about events taking place in the same regions. </p><p>  In each epic there is a description of either a terrible battle or a feast of fun - two events that could be described in a colorful and fascinating way for a simple listener. </p><div class="photo" data-original="bigartshop.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guslars Vasnetsova" class="if uuid-3148558" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3148558.jpg"></div><p>  There are widely known Russian heroes, whose strength and loyalty to the Fatherland are described by epic storytellers.  These are Ilya Muromets, Alyosha Popovich, Dobrynya Nikitich and others, heroes loved by the people.  There are other, visiting heroes, the attitude to which, judging by the stories of epics, is far from unambiguous.  For example, Churila Plenkovich or Dyuk Stepanovich. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Scene ‚Ññ 1. Acquaintance of Prince Vladimir with Churila </h2><p>  This epic is called differently, but we are talking about the same events in which Churila Plenkovich participated.  The summary of the epic is as follows: complainants are at a feast in the palace of Vladimir, asking to punish their offenders, who attacked peaceful fishermen and took away the whole catch.  The prince only waved it off.  A second group of peasants appeared with a complaint about people who had taken all the game they had caught.  The prince did not listen to them.  The third group began to complain about the encroachment on the princely good: "... They cleared clear falcons and pulled white gyrfalcons ..." The prince was surprised: "Who is so insolent?"  It turned out that he lives nearby, seven miles from Kiev Churila, a very rich man.  "The first gate into the courtyard is sloppy, the second is crystal, the third is pewter." </p><p>  The prince, taking with him his heroes, boyars, princes, went to see a miracle.  Meet their father Churila, the old film.  Opens the gate to the courtyard, such as told by Bermyat.  Then the hero Churila Plenkovich drove up.  The fellow went down to his cellars, brought out stocks of furs, brocade, a golden treasury from there and gives everything to the prince. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mypoliticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="A feast with Prince Vladimir" class="if uuid-3148576" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3148576.jpg"></div><p>  Vladimir called the hero to his service, he did not disobey and ended up in Kiev.  One day I looked at his curls Apraxia and accidentally cut her hand.  Gossips noticed this and started to chat.  And the woman began to ask her husband to transfer the handsome man to bedding.  Vladimir did not like this, and he sent Churil back home from himself. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Scene ‚Ññ 2. Bylina about Duke Stepanovich </h2><p>  In the story of the boastful Duke, Churila is involved only in a small episode.  Duke, a visiting hero, came to Kiev to the prince with a message.  On the way, he was loudly surprised at the poverty of Kiev, boasted of the luxury of his Indian court.  He scolded dishes and treats at the table, claiming that his house was tasted better.  Boasted of his dresses and outfits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.kholuy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Churil and Duke fight" class="if uuid-3148579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3148579.jpg"></div><p>  The local dandy Churila Plenkovich could not stand this, who was rightly considered the first handsome Kiev.  He challenged Duke Stepanovich, but not to a fair fight, as is customary for real heroes, but to competitions in panache and horse racing.  The visiting hero won: every day he was brought clothes on horseback from India, in a jump across the Puchay River his horse was also stronger.  And the ambassadors, having seen Duke‚Äôs court in India, reported to the prince that if Kiev and Chernihiv were sold, then there would be enough money only on paper to compile an inventory of the wealth of the visiting hero. </p><h2>  Scene ‚Ññ 3. The death of Churila </h2><p>  Consisting of the prince in the service of "a feast-bearer", Churila Plenkovich saw the beautiful Katerina, the wife of old Bermyaty Vasilyevich.  When her husband went to church, Katerina let a young handsome man into the house.  I sat down to play chess with him.  But since her head was spinning, and her thoughts were about something else, she lost to Churila three games, and only 200 rubles.  Then she threw the board, grabbed the young man by the hands and led her to her bedchamber. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The hay girl ran to the church and told the master everything.  Churila and beauty Katerina die in each other's arms, and Bermyat marries a traitor servant. </p><h2>  The name of the hero </h2><p>  Researchers still have not come to a consensus about the origin of the name Churil.  Some argue that this is a derivative of Dzhurilo or Tsurilo, and academician Veselovsky is inclined to believe that the old Russian name Cyril is distorted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mypoliticum.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Churila under the umbrella" class="if uuid-3148575" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3148575.jpg"></div><p>  The patronymic of the hero is also not easy.  Plenkovich is the son of the Film.  But the fact is that at first the father was not in epics, only the middle name of the son sounded.  Researchers believe that it arose from the characteristics of the hero himself.  Chip - a dandy, spit - flaunt.  And at first Churila's middle name was Schaplenkovich, that is, Shchegolevich.  Then it was transformed into Plenkovich, and then in the eyes of the people the image of the father of the hero was formed. </p><h2>  The image of Churila </h2><p>  What was the hero of the visiting Churila Plenkovich?  Positive or negative hero?  He is handsome, and from his beauty all women immediately lose their heads.  He red tape, does not miss a single girlish look, not a single reddened cheek. </p><p>  He even differs in some humanity among the heroes of Prince Vladimir, at least in relation to women.  All his thoughts are about them, all his dreams are connected with them.  Critics note that in the epics there is not a single rude or vulgar expression in the descriptions of the hero himself and his visits to women.  It has been suggested that the epic cycle about Churil was written for female performance. </p><h2>  Novgorod origin of the hero </h2><p>  Trying to trace the life of the hero, the researchers came to the conclusion that he lived seven miles from Kiev for only a short time.  Most likely, Churila Plenkovich, whose biography interested historians, is the specific prince.  But where from? </p><div class="photo" data-original="hystory.mediasole.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Handsome man in Kiev" class="if uuid-3148583" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3148583.jpg"></div><p>  His wealth, which struck Prince Vladimir and his squad;  warriors of the hero who dared not only with impunity to take prey from hunters and fishermen, but also to beat them;  the large number of his troops, whom Vladimir was frightened at the very beginning of his acquaintance, all speak of Churil as a native of the northern lands of Russia.  These are principalities separated from Kiev, which became independent, surpassing Kiev in strength and wealth, but lacking that power. </p><p>  It was suggested that the epics about Churil Plenkovich are the result of Novgorod folk art.  The insignificant role of the Kiev prince, who was sincerely afraid of the hero‚Äôs squad, mistaking her for the Golden Horde, which could not protect his subjects from robberies, suggests that Churila is a Novgorodian.  It was there that the princes could behave this way. </p><p>  Not every family was allowed to own such wealth that Churila and his father owned.  Significant capital, rich yards, numerous servants - this is also characteristic of the Novgorod princes. </p><p>  The beating of subjects of Prince Vladimir, the management of his possessions - this is also the norm for behavior of Novgorod at that time.  ‚ÄúLatin stallions‚Äù under the riders, Churila‚Äôs boots of ‚ÄúGerman cut‚Äù, buttons on Churila‚Äôs fur coat - a golden ‚Äúapple‚Äù covered with ornaments, experts say, hint at the Novgorodian way of life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hystory.mediasole.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Churila Plenkovich" class="if uuid-3148585" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/3148585.jpg"></div><p>  Even nature, although it happens in Kiev, recalls the Russian north in the stories of Churil.  On the day of the Annunciation, when Katerina‚Äôs husband went to church, a powder falls, that is, a young snowball on which traces of Churila are clearly visible.  And he drives up to Katerina‚Äôs house in a sleigh and in a fur coat.  Of course, these are northern paintings. </p><h2>  Churila's character </h2><p>  Description of his appearance occupies most of the story.  The hero does not perform any feats for the glory of the Fatherland, he does not smash enemies, does not protect the weak.  He is proud and enjoys his beauty.  Goldfinch - this harmless, but eloquent characteristic passes through all the epics about him.  He appreciates his beauty, takes care of appearance, dress, environment.  What is the fact that the hero forces the servant to carry a ‚Äúsunflower‚Äù behind him, that is, an umbrella from the sun, so as not to spoil the color of the skin.  Harmless and some kind of funny hero turned out. </p>
