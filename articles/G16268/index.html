If inhaled or swallowed, they enter the human body, causing catastrophic damage due to internal exposure and heavy metal poisoning.  Radioactive contamination will last for centuries, turning the local population into hibakusha - victims of the nuclear bombing. </p><h2>  Depleted uranium shells: what is it? </h2><p>  Uranium, which remains after the extraction of radioactive isotopes from natural material, is called depleted.  It is a waste of <span>nuclear fuel</span> production for nuclear power plants.  Its radioactivity is 60% of the initial radiation level.  The name of the material gives the impression that it is no longer radioactive, but this is not so.  Depleted uranium shells can cause serious pollution. </p><p>  This weapon was designed to penetrate armor and form sharp fragments that damage and burn the target from the inside.  Conventional shells contain detonating compounds that explode on impact.  They are designed to destroy armored vehicles, but are quite ineffective in terms of destructive ability.  Steel cores can penetrate, punch a hole and penetrate materials that are softer than steel.  They are not so destructive as to pierce the steel armor of tanks. </p><p>  Therefore, a depleted uranium projectile was created that could pass through the armor, burn and destroy the target from the inside.  This was made possible thanks to the physical properties of this material. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Depleted uranium shells: how do they work? </h2><p>  Uranium metal is an extremely solid substance.  Its density is 19 g / cm <sup>3</sup> , 2.4 times higher than that of iron, in which it is equal to 7.9 g / cm <sup>3</sup> <sub>.</sub>  To increase strength, about 1% of molybdenum and titanium are added to it. </p><p>  A depleted uranium projectile is also called an armor-piercing incendiary projectile, because it pierces the steel shell of tanks, penetrates inside and, bouncing off obstacles, destroys the crew, equipment and burns out the equipment from the inside.  Compared to steel cores of a similar size, which have a lower density than uranium, the latter can make a hole in the target 2.4 times deeper.  In addition, steel cores should have a length of 30 cm, and uranium cores should be only 12. Although all shells have the same air resistance, when fired, the speed of the latter decreases less, since 2.4 times more weight gives a greater range and speed of fire.  Consequently, uranium ammunition can destroy a target from a distance unattainable to the enemy. </p>

    <h2>  Anti-bunker weapon </h2><p>  The further development of the military use of depleted uranium is large-sized ammunition, called concrete-piercing or bunker-fighting, which penetrate the concrete fortifications located a few meters below the surface of the soil and explode them, they have already been used in real combat operations.  This guided weapon in the form of bombs and cruise missiles is intended for the breakdown of concrete-reinforced bunkers and other purposes.  They are charged with uranium elements, each of which weighs several tons.  It is said that these bombs were used in large quantities in Afghanistan to destroy al Qaeda hiding in mountain caves, and then in Iraq to destroy Iraqi command centers located deep underground.  The mass of weapons used in Afghanistan and Iraq containing depleted uranium is estimated at more than 500 tons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Effects of exposure </h2><p>  The main danger posed by depleted uranium shells is the consequences of their use.  The main characteristic of this type of ammunition is its radioactivity.  Uranium is a radioactive metal emitting Œ±-radiation in the form of helium atom nuclei and gamma rays.  The energy of the Œ±-particle emitted by it is 4.1 MeV.  This allows you to knock out 100 thousand electrons that bind molecules and ions.  However, an alpha particle can travel only a small distance, a few centimeters in atmospheric air and not more than 40 microns, which is equivalent to the thickness of one sheet of paper in human tissue or water.  Consequently, the degree of danger of Œ±-particles depends on the form and place of exposure to radiation - in the form of particles or dust outside or inside the body. </p><h2>  External exposure </h2><p>  When depleted uranium is in a metal state, alpha particles emitted by its atoms over a distance of the thickness of a sheet of paper do not leave it, except those emitted by atoms on the surface of the alloy.  A bar a few centimeters thick emits only a few tens of parts per million of the total number of Œ±-particles. </p><p>  The metal burns intensely when heated in air and spontaneously ignites when it is in the form of dust.  That is why a depleted uranium shell that hits a target instantly ignites. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As long as the substance remains outside the body even after being converted to particles, it is not very dangerous.  Since alpha particles decay after a certain distance, the detected dose of radiation will be much less than the actual one.  If it enters the human body, Œ±-rays cannot pass through the skin.  The radiation exposure in terms of weight will be low.  That is why depleted uranium is considered to be low radioactive, and its danger is often underestimated.  This is true only when the radiation source is outside the body, where it is safe.  But uranium dust can enter the body, where it becomes tens of millions of times more dangerous.  Published data indicate that low-level radiation is more likely to cause biochemical disturbances than intense high-level radiation.  Therefore, it would be wrong to neglect the danger of exposure to low intensity. </p>

    <h2>  Internal exposure </h2><p>  When uranium burns out to a state of particles, it enters the human body with drinking water and food or is inhaled with air.  In this case, all its radiation and chemical toxicity are released.  The effects of the poisoning action vary depending on the solubility of uranium in water, but radiation exposure always occurs.  A speck of dust with a diameter of 10 Œºm will emit one Œ±-particle every 2 hours, a total of more than 4000 per year.  Alpha particles continue to injure human cells, preventing them from recovering.  In addition, U-238 breaks down into thorium-234, whose half-life is 24.1 days, Th-234 breaks up into protactinium-234, whose half-life is 1.17 days.  Pa-234 becomes U-234 with 0.24 Ma half-life.  Thorium and protactinium emit beta decay electrons.  Six months later, they reached radioactive equilibrium with U-238 with the same dose of radiation.  At this stage, depleted uranium particles emit alpha particles, twice as many beta particles and gamma rays accompanying the decay process. </p><p>  Since Œ± particles do not pass beyond 40 microns, all damage will be done to tissues within this distance.  The annual dose received by the damaged area only from Œ±-particles will be 10 sievert, which is 10 thousand times the maximum dose. </p>

    <h2>  Problem for ages </h2><p>  One Œ±-particle travels hundreds of thousands of atoms before stopping, knocking out hundreds of thousands of electrons that make up the molecules.  Their destruction (ionization) leads to DNA damage or causes mutations in the cellular structure itself.  There is a high probability that only one particle of depleted uranium will cause cancer and damage to internal organs.  Since its <span>half-life</span> is 4.5 billion years, alpha radiation will never weaken.  This means that a person with uranium in the body will be exposed to radiation until death, and the environment will be polluted forever. </p><p>  Unfortunately, studies conducted by the World Health Organization and other agencies did not address internal exposure.  For example, <span>the U.S. Department of Defense</span> claims to find no link between depleted uranium and cancer in Iraq.  Studies conducted by WHO and the EU have come to the same conclusion.  These studies have established that radiation levels in the Balkans and Iraq are not harmful to health.  Nevertheless, there are cases of birth of children with birth defects and a high incidence of cancer. </p>

    <h2>  Application and production </h2><p>  After the first <span>Gulf War</span> and the Balkan War, which used depleted uranium shells, what kind of weapon they were, it became known only after some time.  The number of cases of cancer and pathology of the thyroid gland (up to 20 times), as well as birth defects in children, increased.  And not only among residents of affected countries.  The soldiers traveling there were also injured in health, called the Persian Gulf Syndrome (or Balkan Syndrome). </p><p>  Ammunition with uranium in large quantities was used during the war in Afghanistan, and there is evidence of a high level of this metal in the tissues of the local population.  Iraq, already contaminated as a result of the armed conflict, has once again been exposed to this radioactive and toxic material.  Production of "dirty" ammunition established in France, China, Pakistan, Russia, Britain and the United States.  For example, depleted uranium shells in Russia have been used in the main tank ammunition since the late 1970s, mainly in the T-62 tank cannons and the T-64, T-72, T-80 and T- 125 mm cannons 90. </p>

    <h2>  Irreversible consequences </h2><p>  In the 20th century, mankind survived two world wars, accompanied by massacres and destruction.  Despite this, they were all, in a sense, reversible.  The conflict, in which depleted uranium shells are used, causes constant radioactive pollution of the environment in the areas of warfare, as well as the continuous destruction of the body of their inhabitants for many generations. </p><p>  Using this material does fatal damage to a person that has never been experienced before.  Uranium ammunition, like nuclear weapons, should never be used again. </p><h2>  Prevent disaster </h2><p>  If mankind wishes to preserve the civilization he created, he will have to decide to forever abandon the use of force as a means of resolving conflicts.  At the same time, all citizens who want to live in peace should never allow the use of science in the development of means of destruction and killing, for example, depleted uranium shells. </p><p>  Photos of Iraqi children suffering from thyroid diseases and birth defects should encourage everyone to raise their voice against uranium weapons and against war. </p>
