This payment is a constant and every year increasing means for replenishing the budget, due to the growing number of car owners each year, as well as owners of air and water modes of transport. </p><p>  Taxes include motorcycles, cars, buses, scooters, mechanisms and self-propelled vehicles operating on a pneumatic or caterpillar track.  Owners of aircraft, helicopters, yachts, motor ships, sailing ships, boats, snowmobiles, snowmobiles, motor boats, jet skis and other modes of transport must pay car tax. </p><p>  The calculation of the tax amount is based on information received by the tax authorities from organizations that carry out state registration of all types of vehicles. </p><p>  Individuals have to pay the car tax in accordance with the tax notice sent to them.  Starting in 2011, taxpayers who are individuals are required to pay the car tax in the same way as the land tax, starting on November 1 of the year that follows the tax period. </p><p>  There are some features of this type of taxation.  The car tax must be paid by the person for whom the vehicle is registered.  Information about the transport and its owners come to the tax from the traffic police and the authorities that register the equipment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If the car was sold by proxy, then the original person is still considered the owner of the vehicle and must pay tax.  Many car owners want to quickly get the money, thus issuing a power of attorney, and shift all the trouble of further re-registration to the new owners.  In this case, the old owner of the car should check the removal of the car from the register.  Otherwise, he will have to pay a car tax. </p><p>  Some categories of citizens have car tax benefits.  Due to the fact that the tax belongs to the regional category, each subject of the federation has its own list of beneficiaries.  Moreover, the general rule is that concessions to individuals are allowed only in respect of one transport from the moment of receipt of confirmation documents from the taxpayer to the inspection. </p><p>  Almost all regions exempt from tax on the heroes of the Soviet Union, Russia, participants in the war against Nazi Germany, as well as disabled and war veterans, citizens involved in the aftermath of the accidents exposed to radiation in connection with the Chernobyl disaster and nuclear tests. </p><p>  Some regions exempt or reduce the <span>tax on cars, the</span> calculator allows you to calculate the amount of payment for domestic cars with low power. </p><p>  In addition, benefits can be established for people of retirement age who have motorcycles or low-power cars with a certain engine power. </p><p>  Individuals who own vehicles will not need to make any effort to calculate the tax.  Everything will be done by the tax inspectorate, which knows well how the VAT, transport and other taxes are calculated.  However, errors may creep into the <span>tax notice</span> , especially if in one year a new car was sold and purchased.  Therefore, in order not to pay too much, with the help of calculators presented on the Internet, you can independently calculate the tax on cars. </p>
