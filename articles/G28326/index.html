And buying a ‚Äúcool‚Äù phone is an even bigger event with a big financial investment.  Special?  if it's a fashionable iphone.  People do not always have the opportunity to purchase it in its original design.  This became a prerequisite for the emergence of such a concept as refresh.  What is it, we will understand further. </p><h2>  How to buy an expensive phone cheaply </h2><p>  This question worries many of our fellow citizens.  To allocate 50-60 thousand rubles for the purchase of an iPhone seems an unrealistic amount for many.  At the same time, there is a great desire to have an expensive and stylish toy.  So, official resellers and large retail chains came up with a refresh.  What is it and how is it used? </p><p>  In fact, everything is very simple.  <span>Moral wear and tear on the</span> phone is 2-3 years.  Therefore, it‚Äôs enough to take a slightly worn model, which was used on the strength of the year, and maybe several months, to correct a little - and you're done!  Brand new iPhone for 10-15 thousand! </p>

    <h2>  Benefits of Refresh </h2><p>  For both sides, the benefits are obvious.  For sellers, this is a way to get rid of outdated models and get decent money for it, while spending a minimal amount. </p><p>  For buyers - a way to purchase a good, high-quality and fashionable gadget at a reasonable price for our market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who is doing this? </h2><p>  Initially, Apple came up with a refresh.  What it is, how the circuit works in our market - it was not yet known.  The company seized second-hand phones, changed the case, battery and screen in them for similar parts of its production and issued ‚Äúfresh‚Äù gadgets to the market (that‚Äôs how it is translated from English). </p><p>  After a successful innovation, the whole world picked up the idea.  Now in any service center you can clandestinely make a refresh.  What is it is no secret to anyone.  Only buyers suffer from such fraud.  Chinese parts for iPhones are fakes that quickly wear out and break. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone 6 Refresh" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2187587.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Where do they sell refurbished phones? </h2><p>  On the market for iPhone 6 refresh can be done anywhere.  In the "Messenger", "M. Video", official points of Apple or just in small electronics stores.  All trading online sites are full of ads: "Sell iPhone cheaply."  The only question is who can be trusted? </p><p>  Of course, all large companies, such as Svyaznoy, M.Video do not want to face the dirt and will maintain their brand.  They, like the official resellers, you can buy an iPhone Refresh original.  That is, the model that was restored directly by the manufacturer. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In all other sources, no one gives a guarantee.  Most likely, products assembled using Chinese cheap counterparts will be sold there.  The quality of such a gadget will be significantly lower than that of the original. </p><h2>  How to distinguish an original from a fake </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="iPhone Refresh Original" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39464/2187589.jpg"></div></h2><ul><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><p>  Pay attention to the packaging.  The one that Apple does has no images.  Just a white box with the inscription of the model.  Fakes are stacked in iPhone boxes with a picture of the phone, a series and other inscriptions. </p></li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><p>  Equipment.  All refurbished phones are equipped with new headphones, a charger and a cable.  In fakes, too, all this is, but without the corporate badge "apple". </p></li><li data-leveltext="%1." data-font="Arial" data-listid="1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><p>  Appearance.  It is very difficult for an ordinary person in appearance to determine where the fake is and where the original is.  This can only be done by a professional store or service center employee.  The Chinese camera has a different color rendering, and if you look closely, you can see that the font on the case is different.  A real iPhone does not peel off paint and does not scratch the glass. </p></li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Of course, buying a refresh is much more profitable than a real iPhone.  But the price for this can be poor quality and quick wear.  When deciding on such a deal, it is important, it is even necessary to be confident in the seller and in the product. </p>
