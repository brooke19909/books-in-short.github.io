    <h2>  Where is it used? </h2><p>  There is a common belief that non-woven formband is one of the specific types of tissue.  However, this is not so; it is not even a type of ordinary <span>non-woven fabric.</span>  <span>This is</span> just a piece of ordinary adhesive non-woven, cut for convenience in the form of a <span>slanting inlay</span> with a width of 1.2 cm. At a distance of 0.4 cm from the edge there is a chain seam necessary to stabilize the shape of the product. </p><p>  Most often it is used in the neck, gates or shoulder seam.  If you want to knit the neck of a sweater or sew parts of the product at an angle of 45 degrees, then the non-woven formband, the photo of which is below, is perfect for this.  He is able to reliably fix the shape of the product, soft when in contact with the skin and, importantly, prevents the fabric from losing elasticity. </p><p>  There are a large number of color shades, from gray to pure white, however, most often on sale you can find white and the <span>color of graphite.</span>  Material is sold per meter in specialized stores. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  History of occurrence </h2><p>  The use of non-woven formbands began in the 19th century.  This idea arose in Germany in factories when it was necessary to find cheap and easy-to-use lining material for clothing production.  In fact, the non-woven formband is not even a fabric, since a paper-like cloth is used for its production. </p><p>  People often call it fabric, perhaps due to low awareness, and maybe because it is actively used when sewing fabric products.  Most often it is used during embroidery with beads and a cross. </p><p>  As for Russia, it began to be used in factories only at the end of the 1920s, and in the manufacture of hand-made things only 16 years ago. </p>

    <h2>  Features and properties of the material </h2><p>  This is a unique material that can be both on a regular basis and on a glue one.  But no matter what the basis is, the non-woven formband is always elastic, very thin and is able to quickly restore its original shape.  In its production, ordinary non-woven is used, which is cut into strips of a certain width.  Since it is most often used on turns of a product, these strips should be cut obliquely.  Often needlewomen ask the question that if it is impossible to find a non-woven formband, how can I replace it?  You can take a regular non-woven and cut from it stripes of the required width at an angle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Flizelin itself is made from specific fibers that have undergone a certain chemical treatment.  Do not underestimate the non-woven formbands, because it is very thin, but it can protect the product from twisting, shedding and deformation.  The value of this auxiliary material lies in the fact that it is able to improve the technical characteristics of the main material of which the product consists. </p><p>  The main feature that the material possesses is its strength.  It has been experimentally proved that products stitched with its use are more resistant to wear and abrasion.  Formband protects them from high humidity and dirt.  Very often this material can be found on sequins and when embroidered with beads and ribbons.  In such products, the ability to maintain shape is the main quality of non-woven fabric. </p><p>  A very important feature of water-soluble non-woven is its sensitivity to high temperatures.  If you iron the product for the decoration of which non-woven was used, then its parts are glued together. </p>

    <h2>  Application area </h2><p>  The scope of non-woven formbands is quite extensive. </p><ul><li>  <em>When sewing clothes.</em>  Flizelin is used in the manufacture of both outerwear and delicate delicate dresses. </li><li>  <em>Making various pieces of clothing.</em>  Most often this applies to the neck of the product.  An adhesive-based non-woven fabric is used to trim the edges of a fabric or a specific product.  Thanks to the additional protection, the shelves, shoulder seams, necks, and other parts of knitted clothing, most often subjected to stress, retain their original appearance and are not subject to wear. </li><li>  <em>For creativity.</em>  The needlewomen also took note of the non-woven fabric.  Most often it is used for embroidery with threads, beads, sequins, ribbons.  Thanks to him, the threads will lie evenly and beautifully, without creating tension and "accordion".  If we are talking about beads, then there is certainly no way to do without non-woven fabric. </li><li>  <em>For compositions.</em>  For florists, this material for use in boutonnieres and bouquets is also in the first place, well, except for the flowers themselves.  The interlining laid out by separate fibers on a bouquet in the form of a web looks especially beautiful. </li></ul><h2>  Using </h2><p>  In order for the product to maintain its shape, you need to know how to properly iron the non-woven formbands to it.  To do this, it is necessary to cut out the non-woven fabric of the same size as the part from the fabric, making allowances for the seams.  We heat the iron a little, iron to the fabric from the wrong side.  This must be done carefully and dry.  So that the non-woven fabric does not move out, it is best to first of all glue it in several places, only then completely heat it.  When the parts are stuck together, they must be set aside for some time to cool. </p>

    <h2>  Material Care </h2><p>  If the interlining is in a skein, then it must be stored in a place protected from sunlight and with a relatively constant temperature.  If it is part of floristic compositions, then it is still worth avoiding contact with water, since non-woven will lose its shape. </p><p>  But no warning applies to non-woven fabric, which was used to make garments, since it is protected by a layer of fabric. </p>
