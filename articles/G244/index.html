At least that's what tourists say about him who have been here.  In this article we will try to describe all the charms and secrets of this resort town and the hotel itself, so that readers can get an idea about the rest in Avlida Hotel 4 *.

    <h2>  Where is the hotel situated? </h2><p>  We can immediately say that the organizers and managers of this complex violate all ideas about stereotypes.  Usually hotels of this type are characteristic of country hotels.  And Avlida Hotel 4 * is a hotel, which is not only located on the outskirts of Paphos, but also very close to the historical and archaeological sites of this place.  And everything here is very close.  Want to go to the beach?  Two hundred and fifty meters - and you are by the sea.  Want to ride a yacht?  The harbor is a quarter hour walk away.  About the same to the market and the old city.  Various souvenir and grocery stores, supermarkets, bars, taverns and other Greek artisans can not be found nearby.  There you will find nightclubs, discos and youth parties.  In general, transport has to get unless from the airport, and even then no more than half an hour. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Avlida hotel 4 cyprus" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/471097.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Get to the hotel </h2><p>  <span>A bus stop</span> is right next to the Avlida Hotel 4 * (Cyprus).  Therefore, those who do not have a transfer can easily get here from Paphos.  After all, this city has its own airport, where both scheduled flights and charter flights arrive.  Since the hotel is located in the city, it is not difficult to get here by bus, and a taxi will not be expensive.  However, it often happens that planes from Russian cities land in Larnaca, which is quite far from the hotel.  In this case, you can not do without a transfer or rental car.  However, this road is not tiring at all, the buses are air-conditioned, and from the window you can see many interesting and beautiful places.  After all, Cyprus is famous for its stunning scenery.  Drive from Larnaca for about an hour and a half. </p><h2>  Paphos: features of the resort </h2><p>  Before choosing a hotel for a holiday in Cyprus, it would be nice to know what exactly this area is typical for.  Therefore, it is worth a little talk about the resort, where Avlida Hotel 4 * is located.  Paphos is a respectable place to relax, where usually very wealthy people come.  The vibrant nightlife is boiling here, as well as many interesting archaeological sites.  Beautiful antique mosaics, the ruins of an <span>ancient Greek theater, a</span> column, near which, according to legend, the <span>Apostle Paul</span> preached <span>,</span> and besides, the most popular place for tourists is the ‚ÄúTombs of the Kings‚Äù - all this is located very close to the hotel.  On the other hand, there are few good beaches, in our understanding, in the vicinity, but there are many picturesque cliffs and beautiful secluded places.  If you have a half-board power system, rather than an ‚Äúall-inclusive‚Äù, know that in the local cafes and taverns they give huge portions - just from the heart.  So you can safely order one for two. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Avlida hotel 4" class="if" height="239" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/471098.jpg" width="600"></div>

The hotel building is small.  The last repair and renovation of the hotel was in 2003.  A long building of three floors is located among very green and well-kept gardens.  Many colors, aesthetics in the style of antique Greek decor - paintings, columns, statues.  The feeling that you spend your vacation among the romantic ruins of the ancient kingdom does not leave you.  There are shady places where it is very pleasant to sit in the heat.  Everything you need for relaxation is located either on the territory of the hotel itself or next to it, just a few steps away.  Well, the location exactly where the goddess of love was born, encourages tourists to plunge into the sea near the hotel in order to preserve youth and beauty. </p><h2>  Where do they live? </h2>

The all inclusive buffet system works not only in the main Adonis restaurant, but also in the bars George (in the lobby), Angelos (by the pool) and the Lazy River attraction.  If you want to have lunch without looking up from sunbathing and swimming, this is also quite possible.  The pool bar has not only light snacks, but also more substantial dishes, and the rest of the establishments are known for snacks and cocktails.  I go to Avlida Hotel 4 * tourists praise the reviews.  People write that there are several types of meat and fish, a lot of seafood (octopus, squid), local ‚Äúhalloumi‚Äù cheese, various desserts, fruits and vegetables.

In the evenings, real culinary shows are organized here - Cypriot, Mexican, Italian, Mediterranean and so on. </p><h2>  Sea, beach, pools </h2>

    <p>  Avlida Hotel <span>4 * Paphos</span> is a five-minute walk from the coast.  On the way there is a supermarket and some good restaurants.  The closest beach to Faros is sandy, although small.  The sea is very clean.  There are several other beaches with cliffs away from the hotel, but since the sea in Cyprus is always worried and there are underwater currents, only experienced swimmers can swim there.  Although the sunbeds on these beaches are free, and lifeguards also work.  Some guests preferred to take a bus to the equipped Coral Bay beach, where there are all amenities and children can enter the water well.  But the hotel pools also attract bathers.  After all, this hotel is traditional for Paphos, mainly oriented to the British and Germans, who do not really like to swim in the sea.  Therefore, there are several pools - open and under the roof, with fresh water and sea water, in the form of a lagoon and with an attraction, with and without heating.

For twelve days of rest, they usually give about 1800 dollars for two (including a flight).  Therefore, some tourists even at first are scared of the low price.  But then they read good reviews and still choose this particular hotel.  It is designed for wise travelers.
