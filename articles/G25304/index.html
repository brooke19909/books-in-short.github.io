    <p>  Considering the question of what the dollar looks like, you need to study not only a 100-dollar banknote, but also money with a different denomination.  It is customary to print the currency itself on paper, which includes about 75% of cotton and only 25% of flax.  The average thickness of one banknote is 0.1075 millimeters.  Silk fibers of red and blue are included in the paper structure.  Like paper itself, silk fibers do not luminesce under <span>ultraviolet rays.</span>  Each of the banknotes that has been issued since 1861 is today the official means of payment in America.  In free circulation, you can find banknotes with denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollars.  Of the coins distributed 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 cents and one dollar.  In American reserves today you can find banknotes with denominations of 500, 1000, 5 000 dollars, as well as 10 thousand and 100 thousand dollars.  They are intended for internal payments within the country and for treasuries.  Banknotes were issued before 1936 and were actively used in interbank operations or in settlements between criminal associations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  General information </h2><p>  Studying the question of what the dollar looks like, it is worth saying that each banknote is accompanied by an oval frame in the center.  In it, depending on the face value of the banknote, is a portrait of one of the state rulers of America.  The watermark on money completely repeats the portrait of the president, which is located in the frame. </p>

    <p>  Studying what 1 dollar looks like, one can say about the portrait of George Washington.  A portrait of Jefferson was placed at $ 2, Lincoln at $ 5, Hamilton at $ 10, Jackson at $ 20, Grant at 50, and Franklin at 100.  Dollars, being the reserve world currency, are very actively protected by the state from fakes.  The issue of money, including the release of paper with ink, is carried out by only one company.  According to the law, transferring ink secret and other subtleties of issuing a dollar to third parties is strictly prohibited.  This information may be available only to the government and the Fed. </p><h2>  Security elements </h2>

    <p>  The new banknote has a number of similarities with its predecessor.  The first bright difference is the color saturation.  Of the new signs of protection, it is worth noting the safety strip with three-dimensional graphics.  In the void area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe banknote is a watermark in the format of a portrait of Benjamin Franklin.  You can see it if you look at the currency under a ray of light.  To the left of the portrait in an upright position is a strip on which two inscriptions alternate: 100 and USA.  This text is visible when viewing a bill through the light.  When exposed to a strip of ultraviolet radiation, it turns pink.  Considering how the new dollars look, one can <span>not</span> help <span>but pay attention</span> to the convex figure 100 in gold color.  When you change the viewing angle, the digit turns green.  And the most inconspicuous watermark is the seal on Franklin‚Äôs shoulder, which can only be felt by touch. </p><h2>  Reverse side of a 100 dollar bill </h2><p>  On the back of the new hundred-dollar bill there is a large number of one hundred.  According to the government, this is for people with low vision.  On the back, on the collar of Benjamin Franklin, you can see the text ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù.  It is clearly visible in the light.  The most striking feature is a three-dimensional protective strip, which is not located on either side of the bill, it is practically woven into it.  On the strip you can see an inkwell and a bell, which disappear when you change the viewing angle, and in their place appears the number 100. An inkwell with a bell has always been considered symbols of America, since Franklin used ink to sign basic documents, and the bell informed all residents of the state about the long-awaited freedom .  Both the bell and the number 100 must change color when changing the viewing angle. </p><h2>  Dollar coins </h2>

    <p>  Studying the question of how the dollar looks, it is worth paying attention to <span>coins.</span>  One cent <span>coins have been</span> minted since 1973.  They are presented in many formats.  Since 2010, 1 cent has been decorated with a shield with 13 vertical stripes, indicating state and national unity, on the reverse.  Obverse adorns the image of <span>Abraham Lincoln.</span>  The 5-cent coin was issued from 1956 to 2003. The obverse adorns the portrait of Thomas Jefferson, and the reverse depicts his estate in southern Virginia.  The smallest coin has a value of 10 cents.  It is called 1 dime.  The obverse was decorated with a portrait of Roosevelt, and the reverse with a torch and oak with olive branches.  Coins of 25 cents are a huge variety, but since 2010, quarters are decorated with a bust of Washington.  On the reverse, it was customary to place the National Parks of America.  The issue of 50 cents began in 1977 and does not end today.  On the obverse is John Kennedy, and on the reverse is a bald eagle. </p><h2>  One dollar coin </h2><p>  One US dollar Sakagawi - this is one of the types of coins that are available today.  They are usually referred to as gold dollars, since they imitate the color of gold.  Coins are made of copper and coated with brass.  On the reverse is Sakagavea with a baby.  Coin reversals are updated annually. </p><p>  Since 2009, a one-dollar coin has been issued with portraits of all the <span>presidents of America.</span>  The new design was approved by the US Congress itself. </p><h2>  How to distinguish an original from a fake? </h2><p>  In order to distinguish a real banknote from a fake, it is not enough in theory to know which US dollar has the distinctive signs.  What an American banknote looks like is best studied in practice.  Ideally, it is worthwhile to conduct a comparative analysis of genuine money with those on hand.  The difference between them will be noticeable. </p>

    <p>  Since more than 1/3 of all dollars is located outside the state, the approach to their security is very serious.  Today in circulation around the world is about 900 billion dollars.  The amount of money due to emissions is constantly increasing.  <span>New money is</span> systematically created and issued <span>,</span> but not ordinary, but electronic.  According to preliminary estimates, paper metal signs and their paper equivalents account for only 4-10% of the national currency of America. </p>
