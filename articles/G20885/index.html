Louisiana Restaurant in Nha Trang</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thanks to the wonderful bays, golden beaches and crystal clear waters, this place is rightfully the beach mecca of Vietnam.  Its coastline stretches along the entire length of the city of Nha Trang, and every year this resort attracts many tourists on its sands. </p><p>  The article provides some information about one of the parts of Nha Trang beach - Louisiana. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="12.2387911" data-lng="109.19674880000002" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/5/7/1/6/15716.png"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city of Nha Trang is located in central Vietnam, on the coast of the South China Sea.  It is surrounded by a picturesque bay and majestic mountains. </p><p>  From Hanoi, the distance is 1280 kilometers, from Ho Chi Minh City - 439 km.  It is one of the most popular and favorite tourist resorts in Vietnam. </p><h2>  A Brief History of Nha Trang City </h2><p>  The city was founded by tamiam, and it was part of the state of Tampa.  He was called at that time Kauthara.  One version of the origin of the name "Nha Trang" says that it has a Taman origin.  This is a Vietnamese reading of the name of the river ("Yachang") on which this city stands.  In the past, it was an ordinary fishing village located on the seashore.  In the early nineteenth century, this city began to develop as a resort.  Since then, it has been one of Vietnam's resort centers and has been incredibly popular with tourists. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, urban residents are engaged in fishing and processing, as well as serving tourists.  There is also a small seaport in Nha Trang, and the city is also notable for interesting historical sights. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnamtourbooking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beaches of Nha Trang" class="if uuid-3149120" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3149120.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach Overview </h2><p>  Louisiana in Nha Trang (in more detail later in the article), as well as other beaches twice took first place in the world in the ranking of the most beautiful and well-developed.  In this Vietnamese city, the capital of Khanh Hoa province, there are absolutely no identical beaches.  Moreover, many of them are located at a fairly large distance from the central part of the city, however, the trip to them in beautiful picturesque places also deserves special attention. </p><p>  Bai Dai (Bai Zai or Bai Dai) is the southernmost beach of Nha Trang, Doc Let (Zok Let or Doklet) is the northernmost.  The main beach is Nha Trang Beach.  For tourists, in the city there are two mineral-mud springs and one mud baths. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vietnamtravelblog.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Nha Trang" class="if uuid-3149125" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3149125.jpg"></div><h2>  Louisiana Beach </h2><p>  Nha Trang, as noted above, has many beautiful beaches, among which this one, which is part of the urban beach area.  This place belongs to the wonderful Louisiana restaurant. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The thing is that there is no Louisiana beach in Nha Trang as such.  This place, which is part of the city beach, belongs to the famous cafe of the same name in the city.  This institution has its own brewery, so real lovers of a foamy drink flock here.  There is a private beach and pool. </p><p>  The cafe is located almost in the middle of the city beach.  Here visitors are offered comfortable sun loungers and deckchairs with mattresses near the seashore.  The area is very well maintained and clean.  Visitors behave calmly, although in this cafe they sell alcoholic drinks.  The guards of the institution carefully monitor the order. </p><div class="photo" data-original="passthefishsauce.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach at the restaurant" class="if uuid-3149150" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3149150.jpg"></div><p>  Louisiana waiters in Nha Trang quickly and politely serve vacationers around the entire perimeter of the beach site.  If there are waves at sea, you can swim in the pool.  It offers vacationers - toilets and showers with fresh water.  In the evenings, live music is played on the beach. </p><h2>  Louisiane BrewHouse </h2><p>  Nha Trang is famous for this vacation spot.  This is the brewery restaurant above, which brews several varieties of live beer. </p><p>  "Louisiana" is very popular in Nha Trang.  This is one of the best institutions of this type in the city.  Here you can have a bite to eat or dine well, lounging on the deck chair on the very shore of the sea.  While waiting for an order, you can take a dip in the magnificent pool.  In the evening there is an opportunity to see and listen to the performance of local musicians performing local and foreign compositions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.agladdiary.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Louisiane Brewhouse" class="if uuid-3149159" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3149159.jpg"></div><p>  "Louisiana" in Nha Trang is the best restaurant in the city thanks to its own brewery.  There is always fresh beer, which is quite tempting for tourists.  If you wish, you can use the service and book a small tour of the brewery, of course for a fee. </p><p>  Many are pleased with the presence of a beer mix menu: for a sample, you can order immediately 4 types of beer (200 ml each) produced here.  Beer tastes unusual for some tourists, and prices are slightly above average.  The portions of the dishes are quite large and tasty.  For many, the best restaurant in Nha Trang is Louisiana. </p><div class="photo" data-original="beervn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beer in Louisiana Nha Trang" class="if uuid-3149141" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3149141.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Holidays in Vietnam are becoming more and more popular every year.  There are modern hotels and amazing beaches, incredibly beautiful nature and many interesting places for excursions.  The most famous and popular resort of Vietnam is Nha Trang, which, even during the time of emperors and during the period when Vietnam was a colony of France, was famous for its wonderful nature and beaches. </p><p>  Since 2013, the city is actively building hotels and residential buildings.  This is a great place to relax in the winter.  Even in February, Nha Trang is sunny and warm.  The territory of Vietnam belongs to the South-East of Asia, so there is no climatic winter as such.  On the contrary, it is at this time that this is the best period for relaxing and swimming in the sea.  In February, the weather is wonderful - mild, tourists are not bothered by heat or stuffiness. </p><p>  The population of the city, which is approximately three hundred thousand inhabitants, in the winter months is much increased due to numerous tourists.  Many of them are in no hurry to leave this warm and sunny paradise, providing great opportunities for beach, cultural and outdoor activities. </p>
