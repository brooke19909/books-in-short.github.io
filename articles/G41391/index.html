  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of Personality in Sociology</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The formation of personality is a long and complex process.  Society makes certain (and rather stringent) requirements for individuals.  Through the system of education and upbringing, it seeks to form the type of personality that best meets the requirements presented to them.  In this regard, and separate types of personality in sociology. </p><p>  Due to various objective and subjective characteristics, various types of personalities are formed in society.  This is influenced by various aspects of a quantitative nature <span>(social activity of</span> people) and qualitative (the orientation of activity can be conscious or spontaneous, creative or destructive).  These characteristics are determined by the social structure of society, its normative culture and value orientations, as well as self-awareness, attitudes and thinking styles of individual individuals. </p><p>  A person from the point of view of sociology is the core that connects the <span>mental processes of a</span> person and gives his behavior a certain stability and logical sequence.  According to the principle that mainly affects this core, personality types in sociology are determined by different theories: psychobiological (W. Sheldon), biosocial (F. Allport, C. Rogers), psychosocial (K. Horney, K. Adler), psychostatic (" factorial ‚Äù- D. Eisenck, R. Kettel and others). </p><p>  <span>Social types of personality</span> in sociology are defined as the product of a complex interweaving of socio-economic and historical-cultural conditions of human life. </p><p>  In sociological science, various typologies of personality are proposed.  M. Weber for the criterion of typology took the features of social action, that is, the degree of its rationality.  K. Marx considers class and formation affiliation to be the main sign.  E. Fromm identifies personality types depending on the social (as opposed to individual) character.  According to Fromm, personality types are distinguished by receptive (passive), exploitative, accumulative, and market ones. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Types of personality in sociology are personality models that are used by sociology (as well as psychology) as models for grouping in the classification, study and ordering of sets of personalities.  Various theories highlight the ideal concrete historical and empirical personality types. </p><p>  In Western theory, a typology based on personality indicators is widely used.  So C. Jung identifies types on the basis of sensitivity, thought, experience of evaluation, intuitiveness, extroverted or introverted orientation.  According to H. Isaac, the main characteristics of individuals are such concepts as extraversion and introversion.  Extroverts are characterized by a tendency to direct the energy of the psyche outward, and introverts - inward. </p><p>  The types of personality in sociology at the present stage are also distinguished as follows: traditionalists, idealists, frustrated type, realists, hedonists. </p><p>  Traditionalists focus on values ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as order, duty, law obedience, discipline.  At the same time, they have almost no independence, the desire to realize themselves.  Idealists deny traditional norms, are independent, skeptical of authorities and oriented towards self-development.  Frustrated type is characterized by <span>low self-esteem,</span> suppressed well-being and a sense of abandonment from life.  Realists strive for self-realization, have a sense of responsibility and duty, self-discipline and self-control.  Hedonists seek pleasure, mainly in the form of satisfying simple consumer desires. </p><p>  The role <span>theory of personality</span> in sociology was created by representatives of the structural and functional direction D. Moreno, T. Parsons and others.  They viewed personality through the prism of social roles in society.  The division of labor is objective in society, in connection with which various social statuses and the roles of people in functional connection appear. </p>
