    <p>  A rather unusual place with a special atmosphere is the Chaika Hotel.  Park Hotel (Barnaul is proud of it) is located in a very picturesque corner and has a modern design.  The attentive administration monitors all the fashionable news and tries to improve its institution.  This paradise is a 20-minute drive from the outskirts of Barnaul.  Park Hotel is located in a pine forest, almost on the banks of the Barnaulka River.  Old pine trees grow here, which in the heat create a beautiful shade, so it does not happen hot here.  But the water in the river is always cool and pleasant for swimming.  The Seagull (park-hotel) will definitely save you from the summer heat.  Barnaul in the summer is quite hot in the weather. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The territory of the institution is divided into two zones - for adults and for children.
