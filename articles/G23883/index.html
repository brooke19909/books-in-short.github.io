And while the well-being of the billionaire who created his own empire only arouses admiration and motivates self-realization, the luxury to which the first persons of the state are accustomed, who are, in fact, ordinary high-ranking officials, sometimes raises many questions.  In particular, many Russians are interested in Putin's residences.  How many of them actually exist?  Let's try to figure it out together. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Putin's residence" class="if" height="250" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/243935.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <p>  Putin's official residences </p><p>  According to the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, the former Russian Prime Minister has four in all.  The most important of them, of course, is the Moscow Kremlin.  It is followed by Gorki-9.  In this suburban residence of Putin, which is only 15 km from the capital, D. Medvedev now lives with his family.  By the way, the size of this complex is 80 ha.  As the third residence of Putin, it is customary to consider a small-sized house on Valdai.  Well, the fourth place is occupied by Bocharov Ruchey, which is located in Sochi.  Compared with the leaders of Germany and the United States, which have only two places for work and leisure, this, it seems, is not so much.  But is this information true?  If you count only the official residences of Putin, then yes.  The question arises: "And how many palaces and dachas are at the disposal of the former Russian prime minister?"  According to Boris Nemtsov and Leonid Martynyuk, who wrote the sensational report on ‚Äúthe life of a slave in galleys,‚Äù their total number came close to two dozen.  And this despite the fact that the officially declared income of the prime minister slightly exceeds one hundred thousand dollars.  And the most interesting is that 9 of the 20 current palaces appeared just during the reign of GDP. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Putin's residence in Gelendzhik" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/243932.jpg" width="600"></div>

Kolesnikov, who left the country on time (?), Wrote an open letter to D. Medvedev stating that a luxurious residence is being built on the Black Sea coast specifically for the personal needs of the Russian prime minister.  According to him, Putin‚Äôs new luxurious residence in Gelendzhik is estimated at no less than a billion dollars in value.  What do you think could be built with such funds?  They say in with.  Praskoveevka, which is located near Gelendzhik, for no reason a whole luxurious town arose.  It consists of a huge main building with a palace gate, made in an exquisite Italian style, a helipad that can accommodate three helicopters, a health center, elevators to the beach, a ‚Äútea house‚Äù and much more.  If you believe S. Kolesnikov, and he used to be very close to the current president‚Äôs entourage, V. Putin personally controlled the construction process ... Bocharov Ruchen is no less remarkable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sochi residence of Putin" class="if" height="378" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7400/244615.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  That is what Putin‚Äôs Sochi residence is called.  This two-story villa is made in the spirit of Stalinist classicism.  There are two pools (with sea and fresh water), <span>a helipad, a</span> marina and a gym.  When you learn about such facts, you somehow don‚Äôt even believe <span>that such residences are</span> used not by some oil tycoon or <span>Arab sheikh,</span> but by the first person of the country, whose twenty million inhabitants are barely making ends meet ... </p>
