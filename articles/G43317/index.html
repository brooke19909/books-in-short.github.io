    <p>  Combine flour, salt, cream and butter in a bowl.  Dye food coloring in water and pour the resulting solution into flour, preventing the formation of lumps. </p><p>  Place the container on low heat while stirring constantly.  As you heat, the batter will turn into a thick mass.  When it is fully thickened, remove from heat and lay on the table.  Knead the dough until it is soft and suitable for modeling.  The same can be done in the microwave.  To do this, place the bowl with the dough inside at full power (650 W) for one minute.  At the end of the time, take out for stirring, then put it inside again.  Watch for some more time until the dough starts to rise from the bowl.  Remove the container from the microwave and wait about three minutes until the workpiece for the crafts from the salt dough thickens.  How to make the dough, now it‚Äôs clear, it remains to knead the <span>mass for modeling,</span> as in the first case. </p><p>  <em>The second option:</em> </p><ul><li>  150 g of flour; </li><li>  150 g of salt; </li><li>  ¬Ω tbsp  l  vegetable oil; </li><li>  100 g of water. </li></ul><p>  Mix the ingredients and knead the elastic material in the same way as making salted dough for crafts in a custard way.  To make it easy to sculpt, it is recommended to prepare the material the day before the intended work.  You need to store it in a plastic bag on the shelf of the refrigerator, and for a long time it does not deteriorate. </p>

    <h2>  Salt dough coloring </h2><p>  If you want to color the salty dough, then in the process of cooking, drop a few drops of food color in the desired color into the water.  Please note that after baking, the colors brighten, but if you coat the product with varnish, the shade will again become saturated. </p><p>  To make fragile embossed crafts, 20 grams of PVA glue and a little potato starch are added to the dough. </p><h2>  Painting </h2><p>  You can not dye the dough in the cooking process, and decorate the already molded and baked figure.  You can use watercolor, gouache, acrylic paints.  Many craftswomen even apply nail polishes.  The final touches can be painted on or highlighted with ordinary felt-tip pens.  Please note that painting temporarily softens the surface of the figure.  Therefore, after registration, let the finished copies dry a little more in the air or in the oven. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make salt dough for craft recipe" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40036/1196484.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  What you need for work </h2><p>  To sculpt the figures you will need a working tool, often they are ordinary objects in everyday life.  You can use a knife, rolling pin, comb, rods from the handles, which are convenient to make various holes.  Embossed knives, children's sets of ready-made molds for working with plasticine are well suited.  Everything in the house can also come in handy.  Beads, lace, forks, soles of children's shoes, buttons, details of the designer - how to make a print on the product. </p><h2>  Drying </h2><p>  Finished products can be dried in the fresh air, but usually it takes a long time, so they often do this in the oven at the lowest temperature, occasionally swapping sides of the figures.  Drying time depends on the size of the crafts.  Sometimes products are slightly browned to give a natural color, for example, Christmas gingerbread cookies, little men, pies for decor. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="crafts from salt dough dough how to do" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40036/1196483.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Flowers </h2><p>  You can start your work with making flowers, especially women will like it.  Moreover, you already know how to make salty dough for crafts.  Daisies are very easy to make.  Petals can be made by rolling small strips in the longitudinal direction.  And to arrange the middle with a flattened ball, to which to attach the resulting petals from below.  Twigs can be taken from a real thuja - they are so similar to chamomile leaves, moreover, they do not deteriorate.  Put the composition in the basket, also made by yourself.  It is woven from long strips of the same material as flowers.  After everything is dry, you can start painting. </p>
