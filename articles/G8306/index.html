    <h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  This monastery was named after its founder, John of Rila, who laid the foundation for the monastery in the 10th century.  The building was destroyed and rebuilt many times, the monastery has been at its current location since 1335. </p><p>  At the beginning of the 14th century, a stone church was built, and all buildings were renovated and strengthened.  In subsequent years, the <span>Turkish army</span> almost completely destroyed and ruined the monastery.  After that, he was deserted for several decades - the flow of pilgrims decreased, and part of the land of the monastery was taken away. </p><p>  Then the Rila Monastery was rebuilt by three brothers - Joasaphan, David and Theophanes.  The cult of the relics of Ivan Rilsky also returned, which became a symbol of the power of the Christian church and the growth of consciousness of the Bulgarian people.  People from all over the country came here to see the restored Rila Monastery.  Bulgaria was able to hold out in difficult times and maintain the spirit and strength of its people, thanks in large part to this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the late XVI - early XVII centuries, the monastery was badly damaged by the Turks.  And much of the restored in it was again destroyed.  But despite all the hardships, the Rila Monastery continued to remain the center of the country. </p><p>  In the 1830s there was a serious fire.  It was very difficult to obtain permission to restore the shrine from the Turkish authorities, which ensured that the monastery did not expand. </p><p>  Currently, the Rila Monastery is a national historical Bulgarian monument, and is also included in the <span>UNESCO World Heritage</span> List. </p>
