For example, few people could observe with their own eyes how the Olympic flame was lit.  And in our time, everyone can see this ritual on the Internet or on TV.  But many do not understand its meaning and why it is in this way that the symbol of the Olympics should be lit. </p>

At this time, all wars ceased, and representatives of different cities proved their superiority not in battle, but in sports.  Such games were held every four years for almost a thousand years, until they were banned for religious reasons.

    <p>  Only at the end of the 19th century this tradition was revived.  And since 1896, the Olympics have been held in the world every four years.  They preserved all ancient traditions, for example, the Olympic flame or symbols of games.  In ancient times, the winners of the competition were given an olive branch and a goblet with olive oil.  A mandatory attribute was the lighting of the sacred fire.  Indeed, at that time he was worshiped and considered a gift of the gods. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first Olympic flame was lit in the bowl of the Marathon Tower in Amsterdam during the 1928 Games.  It symbolizes peace and friendship, the struggle for victory and the pursuit of perfection.  Since then, this tradition accompanies all international Olympics.  Where is the Olympic flame lit? </p><p>  This action takes place in the <span>homeland of the Olympic Games</span> - in Greece.  As before, it is lit in Olympia, on the ruins of the temple of Hera.  Now this is done by actresses dressed up in the clothes of ancient priestesses.  This is done a few months before the start of the games and it burns until they end.  Spectators are allowed into the ceremony, and everyone can watch the Olympic flame being lit. </p>

    <p>  This symbol travels to all countries participating in the Olympics.  The torch relay was first held in the 30s of the 20th century, and since then the torch has been carried around the world by the most famous athletes, passing it to each other.  Most often these are runners, but sometimes the fire travels on a bicycle, kayak and even a <span>reindeer sleigh.</span>  Only on the day the games begin the fire is lit in the Olympic bowl at the stadium.  Who will do this becomes known at the last moment. </p><p>  How to light the Olympic flame?  As in antiquity, this is done from the sun's rays, which are focused by a special parabolic mirror.  The ceremony itself is very beautiful, accompanied by dancing, wrestling competitions.  All participants are dressed in ancient Greek tunics. </p>

    <p>  The main characters of the process are 11 girls symbolizing the priestesses of the temple of Hera.  The main one brings the torch to the mirror, and it flares up.  From it a fire is lit in a special bowl, which the priestess transfers to the ancient stadium.  Raising the cup, she turns to the gods.  In addition to the fire at the stadium, special lamps are also lit.  They are needed if the main fire goes out for some reason, but this has already happened. </p><p>  The main priestess is accompanied by a young Greek with an olive branch.  This branch and torch are transferred to the first relay athlete.  Usually this is a Greek, who begins to carry the Olympic flame to other countries.  After that, a white dove is released into the sky, symbolizing the world. </p><p>  This beautiful ancient ceremony can now be observed by all people on any continent.  If desired, everyone can learn how to light the Olympic flame. </p>
