After all, such attractions are a kind of calling card of the Northern capital. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hirondelle.it" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="evening St. Petersburg" class="if uuid-2955134" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2955134.jpg"></div><p>  In the city you can find places that deserve no less attention and are unique, inimitable and attractive, especially for young people.  Such objects do not put on the maps of popular tourist routes, considering them as if secondary.  But all of them are also quite interesting.  So where do young people go to St. Petersburg to get a complete picture of their impressions of the city? </p><h2>  Cinema </h2><p>  The list of interesting places in St. Petersburg for young people includes a building erected in 1842. The author of the project was architect R. I. Kuzmin.  It was built by the merchant Strom for his wife.  Later, the building changed its owners.  They were N.A. Bezobrazov, who was a real state adviser, Prince Khovansky, as well as an honorary citizen of the city A.S.  Wagenheim, which increased the height of the building by another two floors.  From 1901 to 1902  the writer Kuprin lived in this house.  Since 1911, N.V. Tchaikovsky, captain of the 1st rank, became the owner of the building.  At the same time, the Saturn Cinema, owned by the entrepreneur Y. F. Krynsky, began working here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the Soviet period, the building, a cinema in which in 1935 became known as "Artistic", was reconstructed twice.  And today it can simultaneously accept up to 800 visitors in its seven halls. </p><p>  Cinema "Artistic" is a popular destination for moviegoers.  Here, the audience is equipped with a premier hall.  It is intended for festivals and film debuts, equipped with microphones, speakers.  In front of the screen is a scene.  There is also a VIP zone in this room, with comfortable chairs and tables with buttons designed to call waiters.  Designed for 30 people. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews of the audience, the small hall of the Khudozhestvenny cinema is also very popular.  It is designed for 20 people.  Equipped with ergonomic chairs and a small screen. </p><p>  All cinema halls have furniture with armrests, adjustable backrests and drink stands.

Not far from the cinema center of the metro station Mayakovskaya and Ploshchad Vosstaniya. </p><h2>  Lion Bridge </h2><p>  We will continue our acquaintance with the most interesting places of St. Petersburg for young people.  Their list includes a suspension bridge built in 1825-1826.  according to a project developed by engineer G. Tretter.  He is called Leo because of the four cast-iron figures of these animals located here, made by the sculptor P.P. Sokolov.  Tourists visit this bridge as often as the famous Bankovsky and Anichkov. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.trover.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lion Bridge" class="if uuid-2955146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5308/2955146.jpg"></div><p>  The construction is quite interesting.  It attracts the attention of residents and visitors of the city with its cast-iron fence, which has a rather original pattern.  In addition, the design of the bridge has certain technical difficulties.  So, being suspended, the structure rests on chains that are held with the help of mechanisms inside lions.  Its length is a little over 27 m and its width is 2.5 m. </p><p>  In 1954, the bridge was subject to reconstruction.  Lanterns were installed near him, the support mechanisms were repaired, and the sculptures were painted in the color of marble.  Snow lions become especially expressive at night.  With the advent of darkness, their silhouettes are especially clearly reflected in the waters of the canal. </p><p>  Even the tourists who are not particularly interested in classical architecture are worth seeing the ‚ÄúLion Bridge‚Äù.  After all, this building is remarkable not only for the beauty of its appearance, but also for the legends associated with the history of its existence.  So, this miracle of St. Petersburg architecture is considered a very romantic place, and has long been chosen by the residents of the city for dates.  It is worth noting that this status has been preserved at the bridge to this day. </p><p>  There is also an urban legend according to which a pregnant woman who approached the crossing could determine the sex of the child.  If the cavalier was the first to cross the bridge, then she must have a boy, and if the young lady is a girl.  Also, being near one of the four lions, you should certainly touch his paws.  According to the citizens, this will fulfill the most cherished desire.  All students of the Northern capital know where the <span>Lion Bridge</span> in St. Petersburg is located.  They come to his sculptures before passing a difficult exam. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Where is the Lion Bridge in St. Petersburg on a city map?
