How to make a decorative snowman out of cotton wool with your own hands?  First of all, you need to stock up on the necessary materials: </p><ul><li>  Soap and glue. </li><li>  Sequins and brush. </li><li>  Cotton wool and dry twigs. </li></ul><h2>  Work sequence </h2><p>  Carefully read the instructions on how to make a snowman out of cotton wool and start acting. </p><ul><li>  To make it easier for you to roll up the base for the snowman, soap your hands with soap.  Take two pieces (one should be smaller), form a head and a body from them, and then leave for a while aside. </li><li>  While the lumps are drying, work with glue.  Dilute the PVA with water and add some sparkles to it. </li><li>  Brush the adhesive solution on the surface of the figure and let it dry again. </li><li>  Wrap the tip of a toothpick with a piece of cotton and glue it with glue.  When the future nose dries, paint it with red or orange paint. </li><li>  Connect the parts of the craft with a greased toothpick, attach eyes, nose and hands, decorate with a knitted hat and scarf.  The snowman will look even more interesting if his arms and legs are made of the same balls, but smaller in size. </li><li>  Do-it-yourself snowman made of cotton wool is ready.  If the child liked this craft, then invite him to make a family or friends for his hero.  You can create an entire composition, place it on a stand, add an elegant Christmas tree or sled.  It will also make a wonderful decoration for the New Year tree, which the child can hang himself in the place he likes. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to make a decorative snowman out of cotton wool with your own hands" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/22797/581926.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Voluminous snowman </h2><p>  We want to introduce you to another version of crafts made from junk material.  This time we will use: </p><ul><li>  Newspaper or tissue paper. </li><li>  Cotton and glue. </li><li>  A simple <span>pencil, colored</span> markers and scissors. </li></ul><p>  <span>Crumple the paper</span> and form three balls of different sizes out of it - they will serve as the basis for the body of our snowy friend.  So that the lumps do not fall apart, they need to be generously lubricated with glue.  When the base has dried, apply a second coat of PVA and wrap it in cotton.  Draw a smile on the paper, eyes and buttons for the snowman, cut them out and attach them to the appropriate places for them.  The nose for our snowman can be made in the way described above (using cotton wool and toothpicks), and then glued to the face.  The torso and head of the craft are best fastened together with toothpicks or with sharp wooden skewers, previously moistened in glue.  As you know, making a snowman out of cotton with your own hands is quite simple, but children get great pleasure from the creative process. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Do-it-yourself snowman made of cotton.
