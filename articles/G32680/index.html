Among them there are full-fledged driving simulators in which you can control the car with the help of the steering wheel and pedals.  This conveys the atmosphere and feelings of the driver when driving.  However, not everyone knows how to configure the steering wheel for the game.  To do this, you must follow clear instructions. </p><h2>  Types of devices </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bsimracing.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Good steering wheel" class="if uuid-2633111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2633111.jpg"></div><p>  There are many models on the market, among which it is very difficult to choose a decent device.  They are expensive, cheap, with vibration, pedals, a handbrake and so on.  There are many devices on the market from manufacturers Hori, Defender, Sven and so on.  There is no need to wait for the complete transfer of driving from the products of these companies, because these are simplified and cheap models.  More serious steering wheels are manufactured by Logitech, Thrusmaster.  Models from these brands are of high quality.  They are more suitable for a real car simulator, as they well convey all the subtleties of driving. </p><h2>  How the steering wheel conveys sensations </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Game steering wheel and pedals" class="if uuid-2633112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2633112.jpg"></div><p>  Cheap models cannot offer any additional features.  Often, you can just turn the steering wheel and press the pedals on them.  More expensive models allow: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Feel the return.  Thanks to this function, a person feels every hole and roughness on the road.  It can also convey the feeling of a car sliding.  On heavy turns, the steering wheel can literally break out of the hands. </li><li>  Feel the vibration.  High-quality devices are able to transmit the movement of the car through vibration.  Also, thanks to this function, a person feels the car more realistically. </li><li>  Realistic twist steering wheel.  A variety of manufacturers produce models that can rotate from 180 to 900 degrees. </li><li>  Shift gears.  On some devices it is.  This allows a person to feel close to real driving. </li><li>  Tactile sensations.  Most rudders are made using high quality materials.  Some parts have rubber pads.  This allows a person to drive virtual cars more comfortably. </li></ul><p>  Everyone chooses a steering wheel from personal preference.  Someone will have a fairly inexpensive model with limited functionality.  The main thing is to approach the issue of purchase as responsibly as possible, because it costs decent money. </p><h2>  How to adjust the steering wheel </h2><p>  The modern video game industry offers many driving simulators and street racing.  Some companies are developing them specifically for the full immersion in the atmosphere of car driving.  However, not everyone knows how to adjust the steering wheel in the game.  To do this, you must: </p><ol><li>  Install software.  Many people wonder how to configure the steering wheel on a computer.  First you need to install the drivers that come with any device, often on the disk.  This is just an installation wizard, you need to follow the suggested steps in it.  Then you need to go to the ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù, click ‚ÄúInstall Equipment‚Äù, where a person must select his steering wheel and click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  Some companies do not supply the installation CD in the kit, however, drivers can be downloaded on the official website.  After these steps, you can connect the steering wheel to the computer. </li><li>  Check if the device is working properly.  To do this, go to the ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù, then select ‚ÄúGame Devices‚Äù and in the ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù item make sure that there is an ‚ÄúO / C‚Äù signature, and in it click on ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù.  Then you can test whether the pedals, steering wheel, buttons and various switches work.  If the device is working, then it will be displayed on the screen. </li><li>  Customize the steering wheel in the game.  To do this, open any racing game.  Then you need to go into the options and select the device as the main type for control.  In the same section, you can adjust the sensitivity, recoil, degrees of rotation and so on.  Ideally adjust the steering wheel for yourself on the first try will not work.  You will need to spend a little time on this. </li></ol><p>  Such an action algorithm is suitable for almost all steering wheel manufacturers.  Also, with the help of such manipulations, some devices are quite problematic to calibrate.  However, these are basic steering settings; more advanced users need to follow other instructions.  To make driving comfortable for everyone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Setting up standard programs </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.pcworld.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Setting the steering wheel on the computer" class="if uuid-2633116" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2633116.jpg"></div><p>  On each personal computer there are utilities that can help in calibrating the device.  You should resort to them to a person who does not have enough functions in the game and needs something individual.  To do this, go to the "Control Panel" menu, "Equipment and Sound", and then open the "Devices and Printers".  A menu will appear where you need to click on the section with the name of the device.  A section will appear, in it you need to go to the ‚ÄúParameters‚Äù and ‚ÄúCalibrate‚Äù columns.  After that, before the human eye there will be all the necessary equipment data, where it will be possible to calibrate all the necessary parameters of the manipulator, keys and pedals individually. </p><h2>  Utilities from Logitech </h2><p>  Some manufacturers make separate software with parameters for this.  For example, you can configure the Logitech steering wheel using the bundled utility.  This is a very convenient solution where you can create a profile for each individual game.  It is called Logitech Proffile.  Thanks to this utility, you will not need to configure the steering wheel in the game itself and the operating system.  It also turns on itself when you run any racing simulator. </p><h2>  Customization in popular games </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.porsche.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Racing simulator" class="if uuid-2633113" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2633113.jpg"></div><p>  In different driving simulators, the list of functions may vary.  Some people don‚Äôt even know how to adjust the steering wheel in GTA, Crew, Need for Speed, and so on.  Basically, everything is the same, but there are some nuances: </p><ul><li>  Crew game.  A lot of gamers do not know how to configure the steering wheel in it.  In this game, the individual characteristics of the device for each player are very important.  It will be most convenient for users of the Logitech brand.  They only need to go into the original utility and calibrate all the settings for easy turns.  Users of other devices need to do everything according to the standard in the main menu. </li><li>  The line of GTA games.  In it, people are faced with the problem of synchronizing rudders and pedals.  Often, one thing works.  To fix this problem, you need to install the special program San Andreas Advanced Control.  It must be installed, in all the steps that are required for this.  Then you need to open the application and configure the steering wheel with pedals for the game. </li><li>  3D instructor.  This is a very popular driving simulator, it was created to be played on the steering wheel.  In the game settings there are all the options for the settings.  This can also be done with Logitech Proffile. </li><li>  Euro Truck Simulator 2. One of the most famous driving games.  However, users are wondering how to configure the steering wheel in Euro Truck Simulator 2?  It is pretty simple.  You just need to go to the game settings and calibrate them individually.  This can take a lot of time, because they will need to be tested in practice. </li></ul><p>  These are the main problem games where it is necessary to do slightly different manipulations.  Basically, the settings are suitable for almost all games.  The differences are only in the main menus of racing simulators. </p><h2>  Set-top box </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebgames.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Game console" class="if uuid-2633115" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2633115.jpg"></div><p>  This can be done only on those <span>gaming platforms</span> that support the steering wheel.  Most manufacturers indicate compatibility with game consoles.  If the model is suitable, then you must first connect it, and then go to the game settings and set all the necessary settings.  A person should calibrate based on his personal preferences. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.supercars.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car from driving simulator" class="if uuid-2633114" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/88942/2633114.jpg"></div><p>  Thanks to the development of modern technology, a person can receive a large number of sensations and emotions from video games.
