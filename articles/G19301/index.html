What is the documentation for him?  If we consider the interpretations of the corresponding concept that are widespread among experts, then we can conclude that design is primarily a type of human labor activity.  It can be carried out by people representing a wide variety of professions.  Design can be done by builders, programmers, economists, lawmakers.  In each case, they will develop a certain project, which is a combination of various algorithms, properties or parameters that can be applied for one or another purpose. </p>

    <p>  A project can be part of a larger system, business plan, strategy.  In this case, it is intended to contain algorithms that allow solving specific problems in order to ensure the functioning of this system.  The result of the design is the development of documentation that allows you to organize the production, construction of a particular object, its implementation in a different required form - for example, in the form of a computer program or legal act, if it comes to designing legislation.  Thus, the term in question is universal, applied in a wide range of legal relations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is included in the design process? </h2><p>  Studying the basics of design, it makes sense to pay attention to what components its process can be represented.  In accordance with the approach widespread among experts, it can consist of: </p><ul><li>  design algorithm; </li><li>  interim design decisions; </li><li>  result. </li></ul><p>  Under the design algorithm, it is customary to understand a certain list of requirements and schemes in accordance with which competent specialists should conduct their work.

At the same time, specialists, when designing systems, can apply both standard solutions and those that are published in the course of work directly on the current project. </p><p>  After the intermediate schemes are properly studied, the design result is formed on their basis: it will be presented by a set of documents necessary for the production of the product, the construction of the building or structure, the implementation of any other scheme of the beneficial use of the object in the economy. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the purpose of the design presented in the framework of the process considered by us is the development of <span>technical documentation</span> necessary to ensure the economic use of an object.  As part of this process, active feedback is possible between the customer and the contractor regarding the coordination of individual elements of the design algorithm, the procedure for making certain decisions, and designing the result. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In turn, after the transfer of project documentation to the plant or other production infrastructure, feedback between the recipient of the relevant documents and their developer will be minimal.  In fact, it is initiated only when the customer has tangible difficulties in implementing the schemes proposed in the documentation in practice.  But here we are talking, as a rule, about the suspension of the project in terms of its implementation in the form of production and the direction of project documents for serious revision. </p><p>  Therefore, the main task of the designing organization is to prepare the most complete and objectively reflecting set of documents for the customer's needs.  The solution to this problem requires, first of all, highly qualified specialists of the executing company, as well as a responsible approach to work on their part. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the design of systems can be carried out in a variety of fields, the practice of applying the term in use in construction can be considered widespread.  Let's find out how this process can affect the functioning of systems in the relevant sector of the economy. </p><h2>  Construction Design </h2><p>  Designing in the field of construction is the most important area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity of competent specialists, implemented in order to prepare documents, on the basis of which it is supposed to implement the construction plan.  We are talking about the formation of project documentation, which in some cases can be supplemented by sources related to engineering developments. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There are design standards adopted at the level of legal acts, to which documents developed by specialists in the field of construction must comply.  The quality assessment of these sources according to the noted criterion is carried out in the order of state or private examination.  The most important component that enters the design process in construction is design.  We study its specifics in more detail. </p><h2>  Design as part of design in construction </h2><p>  In this case, construction should be considered as a direction of activity of competent specialists, which is associated with the creation of drawings, sketches, full-scale or computer models of construction objects.  We are talking about the formation, thus, of the structures of an object.  For example - related to capital construction infrastructure. </p><p>  Let us examine in which varieties design can be presented, what it is in the context of widespread approaches to the classification of the term in question. </p><h2>  Design Varieties </h2><p>  The type of activity in question can be represented by design, in particular: </p><ul><li>  engineering infrastructure; </li><li>  in the field of architectural and construction developments; </li><li>  in the field of solving urban problems; </li><li>  in the field of design; </li><li>  in software. </li></ul>

    <p>  There are a large number of other criteria on the basis of which design can be classified.  So, the approach is widespread in accordance with which it can be: </p><ul><li>  functional; </li><li>  optimal; </li><li>  systemic. </li></ul><p>  Consider the features of understanding in the appropriate contexts of the term "design": what is each of the noted varieties of this type of human activity. </p><h2>  Functional Design Type </h2><p>  The indicated type of process involves the consideration of the object as a carrier of a separate function.  Moreover, its development and implementation in a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe economy is due to the inability to perform the corresponding function by another object.  So, the ventilation system in the structure of the building cannot effectively replace any other type of infrastructure.  Therefore, the design of objects of the corresponding purpose will be carried out taking into account the fact that only they are able to perform the required function. </p><p>  The considered approach to understanding design allows you to effectively place emphasis in the sequence of building the infrastructure of the system.  First of all, the development of design documentation for key objects is carried out, after - designing for secondary components. </p><h2>  Optimal design </h2><p>  The type of process under consideration is the development of documentation taking into account the interests of various groups of citizens.  For example, it may be tenants of a commercial facility who intend to deploy different types of production infrastructure in it after its construction.  As an option - dissimilar types of ventilation.  For the first company, it will be more profitable, relatively speaking, to supply system, for the second - exhaust system.  The contractor will have, one way or another, to seek a compromise before carrying out the technical <span>design of ventilation</span> and offer partners the optimal model for implementing the function of ventilating the premises in the building. </p><h2>  System type design </h2><p>  The indicated type of process involves combining the first two in cases where this is possible.  In practice, this situation does not always develop, but if the necessary conditions have been formed for this, the introduction of a systematic approach to design may be desirable.  Consider in what cases. </p><p>  System design of objects can be implemented if: </p><ul><li>  there is a fundamental opportunity to provide the required functionality of a component of the system‚Äôs infrastructure through solutions that suit each of the parties to the legal relationship; </li><li>  if the project developer has the necessary resources to provide this functionality in practice. </li></ul>

    <p>  In this case, the implementation of system design is possible, and it makes sense for the contractor to pay attention to the quality elaboration of each of its stages.  There may be quite a few.  It will be useful to consider the essence of the respective stages in more detail. </p><h2>  Design stages </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the list of stages in question is governed by design standards approved by the Russian legislator.  These are: </p><ul><li>  predesign surveys; </li><li>  creation of technical specifications; </li><li>  formation of a technical proposal; </li><li>  implementation of preliminary design; </li><li>  implementation of technical design; </li><li>  development of working documentation. </li></ul><p>  We study the features of the corresponding design stages in more detail. </p><h2>  Study performance </h2><p>  As part of the first stage - <span>pre-project research</span> - competent experts primarily analyze the objective needs of the developer and customer interacting within the project.  The main actor in the study in question is the customer.  He independently or with the assistance of competent specialists determines his needs, desirable characteristics of an object created by the project or, for example, being modernized in order to bring it into line with the optimal parameters. </p><h2>  Technical task </h2><p>  The design assignment is also most often formed by the customer.  The main source of data for it may be the documentation obtained at the previous design stage.  The corresponding task may already reflect the exact parameters of the object that must be manufactured according to the project.  In some cases, the contractor, that is, the designer, can clarify with the customer certain characteristics of the product.  In many cases, this interaction between partners can be carried out in the form of a technical proposal. </p><h2>  Technical Proposal </h2><p>  This document, in turn, is developed by the project executor.  He can initiate the formation of a <span>technical proposal</span> if he finds, for example, that the calculation in the design in accordance with the initial task contains inaccuracies.  The customer may accept or reject the offer from the contractor.  In the first case, documents can be drawn up confirming the consent of the parties to make certain adjustments to the project. </p><h2>  Sketch design </h2><p>  After the technical task is ready and if necessary changes are made to it, preliminary design is carried out.  What is unusual contains this stage? </p><p>  Such a procedure involves the implementation by the contractor of the modeling project, as well as visualization of the key characteristics of the object, its appearance, and its movement algorithms on the ground.  That is, a model is being created.  Based on the results of preliminary design, the object‚Äôs characteristics are formed that are as close as possible to those described in the terms of reference in terms of their practical applicability, based on modeling and calculations. </p>

    <p>  The design result may be the development of a model of a product, possibly full-size. </p><h2>  Technical design </h2><p>  The next stage is the formation of a functional diagram of the product, that is, the manufacture of its prototype.  The documentation generated as part of the technical design allows the customer to decide on the launch of the product into production.  If it is positive, then the next stage of communication is implemented - the formation of a working draft. </p><h2>  Launch a working draft </h2><p>  In this case, we are talking about developing a complete set of documentation, which is necessary for organizing the production of an object.  If this is an industrial product, then the documents can be adapted to transfer drawings and diagrams to the automated infrastructure that is involved in the production.  If the design of the building structure, a full-fledged real estate object is carried out, then the documents, in turn, can be adapted for use by competent specialists - engineers, managers of the construction company. </p><h2>  Application of design systems </h2><p>  The implementation of the noted design stages in practice can be carried out within the framework of specialized systems.  Let's study what they are.  A design system is an environment in which participants in the development of project documentation, competent employees of specialized enterprises or private developers carry out interaction and solve tasks. </p><p>  The components of the respective systems can be adapted to solve specific problems.  For example, if technological design should be carried out in production, then the infrastructure available to specialists will include, firstly, the necessary technical solutions, programs, testing tools, and secondly, the organizational resources needed to interact with colleagues, management, partners in the study of various issues in the development of projects.  The systems in question can consist of separate subsystems that have a special functional purpose, but are interconnected. </p><h2>  The specifics of computer-aided design systems </h2><p>  At modern enterprises, computer-aided design systems, or CAD, are actively used, which are a complex infrastructure by which the development of certain projects can be carried out on the basis of algorithms that are implemented largely autonomously, that is, with minimal human involvement.  Of course, if we are not talking about the stage of their development and implementation at the level of program code.  Here, the role of specialists will be significant.  Effective automation of the <span>design</span> documentation <span>development</span> processes involves competent people conducting quality work in the field of debugging basic algorithms that ensure the functioning of the systems in question. </p>

    <p>  CAD systems are used not only as a tool for organizing the work of specialists in a single production, but also with the goal of effectively scaling production processes.  If we are talking about opening a branch or a second factory, the transfer of production processes from the central office or from the first factory can be carried out using the systems in question.  In this case, competent specialists will have at their disposal algorithms for developing project documentation that have proved their effectiveness, as well as schemes for organizing interaction with other employees of the enterprise and third-party companies on certain issues.  The design of enterprises within the scope of scaling up with the use of CAD can be carried out in the context of ensuring the development of their various structural divisions - engineering, production, those that are responsible for the legal support of the business, especially in terms of standardizing the production of certain products. </p>
