On the south, it is washed by the Caribbean Sea, and on the north, by the Atlantic Ocean.  Rest in this country is an excellent opportunity to forget about gray everyday life and plunge into the world of the sun, happiness and fun.  The most popular resorts among Russian tourists are Juan Dolio, Punta Cana, Santa Domingo, Boca Chica, La Romana and Puerto Plata.  Due to the geographical location and climatic features of the country, the holiday season in the Dominican Republic lasts almost all year round.  <span>The average</span> air <span>temperature</span> throughout the year is 26-27 degrees Celsius, and the water temperature does not drop below 22 degrees.  Here you can carry out not only a relaxing holiday on snow-white beaches, but also make many exciting excursions, do underwater fishing or diving. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="season in dominican republic" class="if" height="325" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/376749.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  The most favorable period for rest </h2><p>  Many seek to visit this country, but not everyone knows when the best season in the Dominican Republic comes for a good rest.  The most favorable period for visiting this country is the period from December to March.  During these months, the sun shines more gently and evenly, the temperature of the water rises to 27 degrees Celsius, the sea is calm, there is practically no rain, and the night temperature does not drop below 24 degrees Celsius.  Thanks to the ocean breeze and high humidity, the heat is quite easy to carry here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic Vacation Reviews" class="if" height="357" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/376756.jpg?1397752019713" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vacations in April </h2><p>  Those who want to enjoy the fresh sea air, but can not stand the hot weather, are advised to go on vacation after the end of the tourist season in the Dominican Republic.  There is still not too much rainfall at this time.  The sun is not so active, as quite often the sky is covered in clouds.  This month is not possible to sunbathe every day.  In April, lovers of spearfishing and diving gather here, because despite the cloudy sky, the sea is still calm.  Plus, stay prices are already slightly lower compared to the high season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rainy season in the Dominican Republic" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/376752.jpg?1397752065735" width="600"></div>

This month <span>has the most rainfall.</span>  Clear weather is very rare, and during the day mostly heavy rains occur.  In addition, hurricanes may occur in May.  The sea is troubled, so those who can not swim well enough are not recommended to try their luck.  Similar weather accompanies the whole of June.  But in July, rainfall becomes much less.  The beaches and hotels this month come to life significantly and are filled with numerous tourists.  The main disadvantages of June are the scorching sun in the daytime and the rains still not ending, albeit not as frequent as in May. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best season in dominican Republic" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/376757.jpg?1397752181261" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in August-September </h2><p>  The hottest month <span>in the Dominican Republic</span> is August.  During this period, the air temperature practically does not drop below 30 degrees heat.  If it were not for the cool enough sea wind, which makes the heat portable, in August during the daytime it would be impossible to go outside.  In addition, the rainy season in the Dominican Republic has not yet ended, so this month there is still quite a lot of rainfall, typhoons and hurricanes often come.  It is for these reasons that it is not recommended to go on holiday to the Dominican Republic in late summer or early autumn.  But despite this, many tourists choose this period for a trip due to low prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rainy season in the Dominican Republic" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/376751.jpg?1397752133941" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Holidays in October </h2><p>  October weather in its features is almost completely consistent with April.  This month, the rainy season in the Dominican Republic has not yet ended, but the rainfall is becoming much less.  There is already no scorching sun, since the sky is quite often covered by clouds.  The sea is already calm.  And most importantly, prices have not yet managed to rise to those that are celebrated in the midst of the tourist season.  The month of October is ideal for sightseeing trips, during which you can get acquainted with the traditions and culture of local residents, appreciate the uniqueness of the architectural structures of medieval cities and just take a walk through the lands where <span>Christopher Columbus</span> set foot <span>.</span> </p><h2>  What to see while relaxing in the Dominican Republic </h2><p>  What else attracts tourists to the Dominican Republic?  Rest (reviews of tourists confirm this), in addition to excellent beaches, the azure sea and a favorable climate, is accompanied by numerous excursions, during which you can see many interesting sights of the country.  So, the Cathedral of the Highway Basilica, located in Santo Domingo, has an unusual architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Dominican Republic holiday season" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/376758.jpg?1397752230879" width="375"></div>  In the same city is a beautiful Lemon Falls, shrouded in secrets, with which many legends are associated.  The Aguas Blancas Waterfall, located 10 kilometers south of the city of Constanta, is considered no less fascinating.  While relaxing in the Dominican Republic, it is recommended to visit the Miracle Cave, which is located in the Kumayasa and Soko rivers.
