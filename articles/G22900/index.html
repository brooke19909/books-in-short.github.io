    <p>  The first place in the rating ‚ÄúThe Strongest People‚Äù goes to the Soviet weightlifter, multiple world and Olympic champion <span>Vasily Alekseev.</span>  He was born in 1942 in the Ryazan region (the village of Pokrovo-Shishkino).  At 11 years old, the boy moved with his family to the village of Rochegda (Arkhangelsk region).  He began to engage in sports in his youth, but met with the first coach only at the age of 19.  Throughout his life, Vasily Ivanovich set many world records.  Among them: biathlon - 435 kg;  heavyweight bench press - 237 kg;  push - 257 kg.  And this is only a small part of all the achievements of this great athlete.  On the set of the show "Big Race" in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãVasily Ivanovich began to have heart problems.  He was taken to a German clinic, where he died after 2 weeks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>2. ydrunas Savickas</strong> </p>

    <p>  This talented athlete was born in 1975 in the Lithuanian city of Birzai.  As a kid, he was significantly superior to his peers in height and weight.  At the age of 14, the boy saw the competitions of strong men and wanted to lift weights in the same way as they did.  A year later, Savickas took up triathlon, and in the second in his life competitions he set a record for Lithuania.  In 1998, he won the Strongman international competition, and in 2000 won the <span>silver medal</span> at the Japan Eventing Championships.  In 2001, Savickas injured his knees.  But that did not stop him.  In the following years, he won many serious competitions.  By the way, Zhydrunas also won the last Strongest, which was held this year in Vladivostok. </p><p>  At these competitions, our compatriots also pleased their fans.  Alexander Lysenko took fifth place.  For this, he can be assigned the unofficial title of ‚ÄúThe Strongest Man of Russia in 2013‚Äù. </p><p>  Let's go back to Zhydrunas.  Savickas can be proud of himself.  Here are just some of his records: bench press - 286 kg;  throw the ball (27 kg) up - 5.2 m;  thrust - 462 kg.  So, he rightfully takes the second place in the rating ‚ÄúThe Strongest People‚Äù. </p><p>  <strong>3. Vasily Virastyuk</strong> </p>

    <p>  Who has not heard of this legendary Ukrainian athlete?  For his merits in power all-around, he takes the third place in the rating ‚ÄúMost Strong People‚Äù.  The future master of sports was born in Ivano-Frankivsk in 1974.  The boy grew up in an ordinary family.  His father <span>worked as a trucker.</span>  Even at school, Virastyuk was fond of athletics.  Then he moved on to the shot put.  After school, Vasily entered a technical school at the department of physical education.  Then he spent 2 years in the army.  Since 1994, he worked as a coach in a sports club.  In 2000, Virastyuk decided to try his strength at Strongman, where he subsequently won twice (2004, 2007).  Let's talk about several of his records.  Some of them were in the Guinness Book of Records.  For example, Vasily pushed tram <span>cars with a total</span> weight of 100 tons, rolled back 7 cars (11 tons) by 25 meters, lifted and installed four 150-kilogram ice cubes on platforms in just 1 minute. </p>
