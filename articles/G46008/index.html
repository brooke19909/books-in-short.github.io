You can go to courses, lectures or master classes.  The format of the event can be any, everything should depend on what needs to be mastered and how quickly.  In what way can information be learned in a short time?  Well, of course, you need to go through a master class.  But not many of our compatriots are well aware of the format of this event.  What is a master class?  We will talk about this below. </p><h2>  What is a master class </h2><p>  This concept came to us from the English language.  It consists of two words.  The first word master denotes an expert in any field.  The second word class translates as "lesson" or "lesson".  Combining the two values ‚Äã‚Äãtogether, we get an event in which the master shares his experience and knowledge. </p><p>  <span>What is a master class</span> in Russia?  This is an event where an expert, for example, in the field of marketing, talks about the best sales techniques.  But this is not just a lecture.  At the end of the lesson, the expert should play small scenes in which students will be directly involved. </p>

    <h2>  How does the master class go </h2><p>  Typically, such an event takes place according to the scenario described above.  People come to class, listen to the introductory part, and then, depending on the subject, they begin to put the acquired knowledge into practice.  Most often, this method of training is used by people to improve their skills. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is a master class for experts in their field?  No matter how well a person understands one or another subject, he cannot know everything.  For example, workshops are often held for practicing manicure masters.  Why do qualified professionals go to such events?  To expand your knowledge base and learn about the latest in the nail industry. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bouquets master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2087034.jpg"></div>  The constant maintenance of their competence at the proper level makes a specialist a middle-class professional.

    <h2>  How well is the information absorbed </h2><p>  It is best to learn knowledge in practice.  And you need to learn from the best specialists.  Often, such trainers do not know how to teach, but they can clearly and clearly explain certain problems that a person who is only trying to learn the basics of the profession will encounter.  But not because of its theoretical part, the master class took a leading position in the training market.  Practice is what matters most in these classes.  People come to such events to see how an expert will perform tasks.  Take for example a hair dye master class.  Hairdressers are well aware of how you can give the client's hair a snow-white shade.  But here's how to make sure that the blonde in a week does not become red again, not everyone knows. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="step by step master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2087035.jpg"></div>  At the master classes, <span>muscle memory of the</span> hands develops, so the hairdresser, leaving the training, will already have skills that will be useful in further work.

At such an event, people gather who want to raise their skill level and listen to how the maestro evaluates their talent.  How is this event going?  Each participant in the master class plays a piece of the well-known work, and the maestro criticizes and corrects.  Thus, he hones knowledge, and most importantly, skills.  Why do such events take place before the concert?  Yes, because it is in the process of explaining the theory that the teacher himself better understands the essence of the work. </p><h2>  Master class on drawing </h2><p>  Today on the Internet you can find many lessons that tell you how to draw with watercolors, gouache, etc. There are even step-by-step master classes.  What is it?  This is an instruction in pictures, how to draw this or that drawing.  When you look at how a masterpiece is created, it no longer seems that it will be difficult to reproduce it yourself. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="master class photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34178/2087226.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Master classes in drawing are not only in virtual space.  Experienced artists convey their secrets at such meetings to a growing galaxy of painters and graphic artists.  During the master class, one of the small topics is usually sorted out, because such an event is usually limited in time and does not last more than three hours.  The topics of such master classes can be: the technique of drawing the sky, architecture, interior, etc. </p><h2>  Creative workshops </h2><p>  Talented people rarely hide the secrets of their skills.  Usually they share them with their students, and meetings are often arranged at which they are taught absolutely unfamiliar people.  Let's take an example.  A Moscow florist arrives in a provincial town to teach local specialists how to collect fashionable bouquets.  A master class on the production of floral arrangements will include not only the theoretical part, but also the practical one. </p><p>  Today, many girls are fond of needlework.  They find inspiration in master classes, photos of which are freely available on the network.  Subjects can be different: how to knit a rug from fabric scraps, how to sew a dress or how to restore a wardrobe. </p><h2>  Children's workshops </h2><p>  Modern parents, concerned about the education of their child, often give him to various circles.  But sometimes this seems to them not enough.  It was for such parents that master classes for children were invented.  Thanks to these activities, the child, of course, will not be able to become an artist or a sculptor.  But he will be able to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe subject under study.  Usually, the goal of children's master classes is to attract as many children as possible to a circle or section. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what is a master class" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2087039.jpg"></div>  And also, sometimes in some educational institutions, students are offered to take one additional lesson in a subject.  For example, to study in depth the solution of the logarithmic equation.  This event can also be called a master class.
