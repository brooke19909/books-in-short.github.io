    <p>  First of all, you need to understand what kind of tasks a universal card can solve.  Regardless of the fact that the card is primarily a means of payment, its main value is to facilitate the access of citizens to the services provided by the state and municipalities in electronic format. </p><p>  It is worth noting that projects that are implemented at the federal level are not commercial startups, and therefore there is a difference in financial opportunities depending on the region.  The UEC card is funded not only from the federal, but also from regional budgets (Moscow, Tatarstan, Bashkiria and some others). </p><p>  But still, the transition to electronic services instead of live queues and papers is a global trend that most countries are striving for.  The most important advantage is that these innovations make it possible to avoid bureaucratic delays.  In addition, mainly countries practice projects that allow UEC to be issued free of charge. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What features does the card have? </h2>

    <p>  Of all the available card features, the most enjoyable is that the UEC signature is electronic.  In other words, an electronic signature can be a worthy replacement for a conventional one.  In addition, it can be attached remotely.  For example, on a public services website, such a signature can serve as an <span>identity card.</span> </p><p>  In addition, the universal electronic card contains data from most documents - passports, policies, insurance certificates and others.  As practice shows, such a card can be presented in many services in exchange for a regular paper document. </p><p>  Many even imagine in this way UEC that this is a universal tool for replacing documents, and not for payments.  But it can also be used for calculations.  The limitation here is probably the PRO100 system.  You can not use it everywhere, but if Sberbank issues UEC, then its ATMs will take such a card.  In this case, the card can also be considered as a second wallet, where you can easily store your funds and, if necessary, get them at an ATM. </p><h2>  How to get an electronic card? </h2><p>  To draw up a card, it is enough to come to the registration point and submit a passport and other documents, information about which will be entered on a new card.  In addition, you must write an application for release, and after a while you will become the owner of UEC. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Can I pay for UEC travel? </h2>

    <p>  One of the most poorly implemented functions is the payment for public transport.  If you have a UEC, how to get such a service, you should not have a question.  But it should be remembered that it appears only in some regions.  This card is a kind of wallet, with which you can instantly pay for travel.  This is a great idea and quite useful, you can only wait until it is very well developed. </p><h2>  What are the prospects for UEC cards? </h2>

    <p>  What is it - a great project without development?  Mess, don't you think?  It is very pleasing that they pay attention to this banking product and develop it.  The project is becoming more developed, the number of places to receive such cards is also becoming wider, and probably the most important thing is that the functionality of the card is also growing. </p><p>  Today, universal cards for the most part are considered a pilot project, since their small presence in important life spheres is felt, but when many people use them, the system will still show all its usefulness. </p><p>  So, we found out that UEC is what it is, so now we can say that this is a product of the future.  Its application is relevant in most areas of life, but so far the system is not sufficiently developed.  Obtaining such a card is quite simple.  You can contact the branch of Sberbank or another bank issuing such cards, or apply on the official website. </p><h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  Using UEC is no different from a simple card.  You can pay for services, purchases, cash withdrawals and so on.  The only thing that can become an obstacle to use is the PRO100 system, which is not used in every ATM.  In particular, Sberbank has it.  The map also contains all the data about the user, which is very convenient because you do not need to carry a bunch of pieces of paper with you, but you can show only one card from which the necessary information will be read. </p><h2>  Can I <span>refuse a universal card?</span> </h2>

    <p>  Every citizen has this right.  To do this, just contact the point where you filled out the card and submit the appropriate application. </p><p>  Upon receipt of such a card, you can receive all <span>public services,</span> as before, in any usual way with the presentation of a passport and other documentation.  If you refuse the card, you are not deprived of the right to receive services. </p><p>  As the migration service promises, <span>passports of a new generation</span> will soon be used <span>.</span>  It talks about plastic electronic cards that store all the information a person needs.  It is also planned that such passports will be used as a key to enter the public services portal. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  I want to say that UEC is a great idea.  Let's hope that it will develop, grow and expand its functionality.  Who knows, maybe after many years it will completely replace all documents, and we will no longer have the usual paper media, but only cards - and nothing more. </p>
