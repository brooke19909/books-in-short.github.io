  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Golden Age of Russian Culture</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In history, almost always the cultural heyday preceded global changes in a particular state.  Our country was no exception.  The "Golden Age" of Russian culture ended with popular unrest and the <span>coming of the Bolsheviks to power.</span>  At that time, the idea was formed of the overthrow of the old system. </p><p>  The history of <span>Russian</span> culture <span>in the 19th century is</span> characterized by the rise of domestic education, the flowering of various art forms, and the greatest scientific achievements. </p><p>  According to scientists, <span>the</span> country's <span>social structure</span> had a significant impact on development.  At that time, Russia was considered a class state.  Class principles were present not only in the state structure, but also in the legislation, the situation of each subject.  The nobility, being the first estate, was endowed with privileges, which were enshrined in the "Charter."  The "Golden Age" of Russian culture is inconceivable without a noble intelligentsia.  It was she who enthusiastically picked up the proclaimed ideas of the French Revolution about freedom, fraternity and equality.  Of great importance at that time was the growth of industry, the formation of new capitalist enterprises. </p><p>  It should be noted that at that time there were no official channels for expressing public opinion to authorities.  Representative institutions, an independent court, and a responsible government were not formed.  This prompted people to express themselves through cultural mechanisms. </p><p>  The "Golden Age" of Russian culture is, above all, the development of literature.  This type of art has become a way of expressing public opinion.  The main figure of that time was Alexander Pushkin.  A circle of talented poets arose around him (Baratynsky, Zhukovsky, Batyushkov, Tyutchev).  With their works they created a bright atmosphere of pure culture.  The literature of that time spread the concept of moral independence, taught to overcome class and class restrictions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the conditions of growing cities, the formation of the people became the most important necessity for continuing the progressive development of the state.  Educational ideas about the education of ‚Äúuseful citizens‚Äù and ‚Äúnew people‚Äù were embodied later in the writings of Bestuzhev and other figures of that time. </p><p>  The "Golden Age" of Russian culture has become an important stage in the development of realism, primarily in literature, as well as in other <span>forms of art.</span>  All types and directions of Russian art of that time carried a trace of the deepest seriousness, sincerity, problematic nature of that era. </p><p>  It should be noted that the high development of the intelligentsia, excellent command of the language, and great attention to all the riches of folk life opposed the other part of the "uncultured" country.  The ‚ÄúGolden Age" of Russian culture, in short, was distinguished by the desire to bridge the chasm through enlightenment.  Literary geniuses (Chekhov, Lermontov, Dostoevsky and others) appeared in this era. </p><p>  However, of course, new ideas were embodied not only in the literature.  Actively manifested Russian realism in the visual arts.  Russian realist artists tried to express the truth of society as creatively and accurately as possible.  In some ways, artists followed literary figures, embodying the ideas of popular novels of that time in paintings.  Thus, a kind of artistic encyclopedia of the problems of Russian reality was created.  Philosophically trying to explain their era, such masters as Vasnetsov, Ivanov.  Nesterov.  Their appeal to the subjects of the Bible became a kind of reflection of the moral and religious searches of the great Russian classics Tolstoy, Gogol, Dostoevsky.  Figures of musical art, the great <span>composers Glinka,</span> Dargomyzhsky, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, relying on folk art, created magnificent examples of music - symphonies, operas, ballets, which brought Russia world fame. </p><p>  Masterpieces created by geniuses of the 19th century have rightfully made this century the Golden Age of Russian culture. </p>
