Even the residents of Moscow have such an opportunity; within the region there is the Klyazma reservoir.  It appeared as a result of the construction of the Pirogovsky hydroelectric complex.  Located within the borders of the urban district of Khimki and Mytishchi.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe reservoir is 16.2 square meters.  km </p><p>  On the banks of the Klyazma reservoir there are several microdistricts and villages: </p><ul><li>  Kapustino; </li><li>  Boltino; </li><li>  Sorokino; </li><li>  Ostashkovo and others; </li><li>  Khlebnikovo district, referred to the city of Dolgoprudny; </li><li>  gardening partnerships. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="breadbnikovo beach how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226574.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Purpose of the reservoir </h2><p>  The reservoir is primarily used for water supply of the capital and the region.  It also allows you to control the level of pollution in Klyazma and is a water "reserve" Skhodnenskaya hydroelectric power station. </p><p>  And, of course, the banks of the reservoir are a recreational zone.  There are many yacht clubs, recreation areas are located on the southern shores: </p><ul><li>  Khlebnikovo beach; </li><li>  "Slides"; </li><li>  Novoaleksandrovo. </li></ul><p>  There are always many fishermen on the shores.  Here, pecking bream, perch, roach and catfish are good.  There are moist meadow shores, with oak forests and pine forests and mixed forests. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Breadnikovo beach" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226560.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Khlebnikovo Beach </h2><p>  The relaxation area includes 2 beaches.  One side is sandy, and on the other side grassy gentle slopes connected by a bridge.  A special fenced area is provided for children. </p><p>  There are gazebos for visitors (a total of 30 pcs.), And barbecue facilities can be prepared for barbecue.  Each gazebo will fit 25 people.  There is also a catamaran rental service and there are places for playing table tennis.  There is a playground. </p><p>  On the beach "Khlebnikovo" equipped with changing cabins and toilets, showers, a first-aid post.  If you wish, you can spend the night here, in the recreation area there is a base with the same name.  There is a restaurant "Lacada" and several cafeterias.  You can‚Äôt enter the territory of the recreation area with motor vehicles, but there is a guarded parking lot for 1 thousand cars near the entrance.  Entrance to the beach is free.  And all this is located in a green area of ‚Äã‚Äã3,000 hectares. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="beach bakovo reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226578.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Restaurant "Lacada" </h2><p>  In this institution, on the beach "Khlebnikovo", on the Klyazma reservoir, you can taste Russian, European and Georgian cuisine.  The institution has 2 floors, with a main hall for 120 people and a banquet room for 500. There are VIP arbors for 25 people and a veranda for 40 visitors. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In the restaurant you can hold a corporate festive event or a wedding, another holiday.  At the request of the customer, the hall can be decorated with balls and a host is invited.  Various shows can also be held, there is live music and karaoke. </p><h2>  Road junction </h2><p>  There are always a lot of Muscovites on the Khlebnikovo beach, as it is very easy to get here both by car and by train. </p><p>  Bus No. 17 regularly leaves from the Altufyevo metro station, shuttle buses No. 19 and 459, 572 also run. When leaving the metro car, you need to move towards the first car and go near the Perekrestok store, that's where the minibuses stop. </p><p>  If you get your own vehicle, you need to move along the Dmitrov highway, before turning on the bridge over the canal to them.  Moscow, turn right. </p><p>  How can I get to Khlebnikovo beach?  In the summertime, river transport departs from the River Station. </p><p>  If you go by train, you need to take any next in Savelovsky direction and get to the station "Khlebnikovo" or "Vodniki".  The direction from the station can always be checked with local residents, but you need to move towards the automobile bridge over the canal and turn right in front of the bridge and walk about another 1 km. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bakernovo beach on the Klyazma reservoir" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2226586.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Muscovites opinions </h2><p>  Naturally, it is impossible to please every person.  Nevertheless, reviews about the Khlebnikovo beach are pretty good.  Parents are pleased that the children's beach is fenced, and do not worry that something will happen to the child.  Others, on the contrary, did not like the coast, as it is uneven and a little hilly. </p><p>  The main problem that worries vacationers is the huge lines for shuttles and buses in the direction of Moscow.  It is clear that after sunbathing everyone is tired and want to get home, and when they come to a stop, you see and understand that it will not work out quickly.  Not the best situation with the owners of vehicles, as in the evening and morning traffic jams on the roads. </p><p>  It pleases vacationers that admission is free, but the cost of renting the same barbecue is quite high, as are the prices in a cafe.  In any case, the Khlebnikovo beach is only 6 km from Moscow, and you are already in a small paradise in the region where you can swim, bask in the sun and relax in the summer season. </p>
