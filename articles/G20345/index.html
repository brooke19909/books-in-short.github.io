At first, everything is fine, and the phone restarts only at the behest of its owner.  But after a while, the unexpected can happen, and now the iPhone is constantly rebooting and does not allow you to perform a single operation.  When this happens twice or thrice, there is nothing to worry about.  But if multiple reboots are a reason for excitement. </p>

    <p>  Typically, such gadgets are easily replaced in official Apple stores.  But what if the warranty has already expired?  What if the iPhone constantly restarts, what should I do in this situation?  First of all, do not panic.  In most cases, this problem is solved without the use of specialized equipment and does not require any fantastic knowledge of electronics from the phone owner. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth noting that the problems associated with the fact that the iPhone is constantly restarting began after the new version of iOS.  Most users who installed iOS 11 / 11.1.2 firmware noted such "quirks."  However, the problems affected not only outdated phones.  Many noted that the iPhone 5S, 6, 7 and 8 are constantly restarting by itself. Thus, if this version of the operating system is installed on the phone, then the firmware error is most likely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is quite possible that there are problems in the device itself if a short circuit occurs.  However, most often the malfunction lies precisely in the software part.  Accordingly, you can try to fix the damage at home on your own.  However, before performing certain manipulations, it is worthwhile to carry out preparatory work. </p><h2>  Backup </h2><p>  If the iPhone is constantly rebooting, it’s best to immediately copy all the important data from it.  To do this, you can use numerous utilities for archiving or manually transfer folders and documents to a removable hard drive or to the "cloud". </p>

    <p>  This is necessary, because in some situations (after updating the software or when restoring the factory settings), data is permanently deleted from the iPhone.  After that, if the iPhone is constantly restarting, you can try some useful recommendations. </p><h2>  Software Update </h2><p>  As already mentioned at the beginning of the article, the problem may lie in the “broken” firmware.  Therefore, it is best to upgrade the system to iOS 11.2 or newer.  This may very well solve the problem. </p><p>  You can do this yourself using the standard iPhone tools.  To do this, go to the general settings and find in them the item “Software Updates”.  After that, the gadget will offer a new version of the software that will need to be installed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  However, in some situations, the smartphone “refuses” to voluntarily perform such operations, but this does not mean that everything is lost.  It is possible that the gadget has the function of notifying about new software versions disabled.  In this case, it must be activated.  To do this, just go to the settings and find the “Notifications” item there.  They must be activated both for the entire system and for each individual application.  As a rule, after this, the phone will automatically inform you about new software versions ready for installation. </p>

    <p>  If this does not help, and the iPhone 6 is still constantly rebooting, then you can try to go the trickier way.  No special effort is required for this. </p><h2>  Change the date </h2><p>  As you know, updates usually occur at regular intervals.  Most often, the installation of new software is tied to certain dates.  If a failure occurs, the phone starts to perform this procedure all the time.  In this case, the easiest way is to change the current date to December 1 and thus “trick” the naughty gadget.  To do this, just go to the general settings and find the item responsible for the date and time.  In this menu, you must manually set December 1 and save the changes. </p>

    <p>  Usually after this the phone “hangs”.  However, this may not help.  If the iPhone 6S is constantly rebooting, then you can try to perform another simple procedure. </p><h2>  Device reboot </h2><p>  This procedure will force the device to reset to factory settings.  Thanks to it, all processes that could cause trouble with constant reboots will be stopped.  To do this, hold down the power and Home keys simultaneously.  Then you need to wait until the characteristic apple logo appears on the monitor.  Then the gadget will reboot and the problem should disappear. </p><p>  This option is relevant for all versions of iPhones, except for the seventh model.  If the iPhone 7 constantly restarts, you must perform the same procedures, however, after the logo appears, you must additionally hold down the Home key and at the same time press the volume up or down button on the side of the device. </p>

    <h2>  Reset </h2><p>  This is another effective method, which is slightly different from returning to the factory phone options.  To reset the settings and try to stabilize the device, you need to perform a few simple manipulations.  The only thing to consider: after that, you will need to reinstall the ringtone and more. </p><p>  So, for this you need to go to the general settings of the gadget and find the corresponding key there.  After clicking on “Reset all settings” the phone will reboot.  Based on the experience of other users, we can conclude that this method does not delete the personal data of the owner of the phone, but it is better to be safe again and still move the most important data to a separate medium. </p><h2>  Uninstall or update applications </h2><p>  Not everyone pays attention to the fact that sudden device reboots begin immediately after installing a new utility or a popular messenger.  In this case, the problem may lie in the fact that it is not the phone itself that is trying to update, but a specific game or program. </p>

    <p>  In this case, it is recommended to carefully study all applications.  If possible, it is better to reinstall them.  If you don’t want to delete your achievements in games, then at least it’s worth updating them to the latest version offered by the manufacturer. </p><h2>  System Recovery Utility </h2><p>  On the network you can find a huge number of useful utilities that can greatly simplify the life of the user of "apple" products.  For example, the PhoneRescue application can fix the main problems of the system.  In addition, this program often helps if the gadget is completely “frozen” and only the manufacturer’s logo is displayed on its monitor.  The program is also able to fix errors associated with incorrectly installed or incorrect firmware.  By the way, after a "makeshift" update, troubles such as sudden reboots can also occur.  Therefore, the manufacturer so strongly does not recommend doing homework.  It is better to receive all updates in the standard way, using the tools of the iPhone itself. </p><p>  If 5, 6, 7 or 8 iPhone constantly reboots while charging or connecting the unit to other devices, then such problems may be related to the hardware. </p><h2>  Clean the device port </h2><p>  If troubles occur while charging or connecting the headphones, you must carefully remove the Lightning connector.  It is possible that fluff, dust, or other debris has collected in the connector and leads to poor electrical connections when the gadget is connected to the charger.  For cleaning, you can use a toothpick, a hairpin or a small needle.  However, experts recommend purchasing a specialized can of compressed air.  It is used for better cleaning of various equipment. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the use of a non-native telephone cable can lead to such problems.  In this case, you should take care of a better wire, which is best purchased in the official Apple store.  If the phone is under warranty, it is easiest to contact a service center. </p>
