Bimetal 10 ruble coins</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In Soviet times, it was customary to coinage commemorative coins.  They were issued in various series depicting the great scientific, political figures, animals and cities of Russia.  Some of them were intended for easy circulation, while others were minted for investment, because it was so possible to increase your capital.  Bimetallic coins begin to be collected, in addition, many are interested in the questions: “How many are put into circulation?”, “What will be in circulation in the country next year?”, “How much will each of them cost?”  Let's pay a little attention to this topic. </p>

    <h2>  Memorable "tens" </h2><p>  <span>Bimetallic coins of 10 rubles are</span> united in a special group, they are connected by historical events of the Russian Federation.  They sing unique cities and personalities related to the development of the country.  Very unusual, but affordable coins can be found in the collections of Russians.  They were issued in millions of copies and fell into the circulation of Russia. </p><p>  Collectors often ask themselves: "Is there a chance of discovering the anniversary" top ten "in change?"  However, getting an unambiguous answer to this question is rather difficult.  All coins are distributed by region, and their number is uneven, and no one knows what it depends on.  Just always be careful, and perhaps fortune will smile at you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  List of Bimetal Coins </h2><p>  I would like to highlight the series, the release of which is simply huge: </p><ul><li>  "Russian Federation". </li><li>  "Ministry of the Russian Federation." </li><li>  "Ancient cities." </li></ul><p>  They also minted bimetallic 10-ruble coins associated with commemorative dates.

    <p>  Despite the fact that these coins were issued in huge numbers, today it is difficult to find them.  This is due to the collection hype.  No less sad is the fact that for some people such coins can simply gather dust in a piggy bank.  According to collectors, this is simply unacceptable, and you need to learn to collect the "tens" correctly.  For this, special albums are purchased.  Equally important for professionals is the condition of the coins.  Agree, because a beautiful and good thing looks much better than worn by time. </p><h2>  Series “Memorable Dates” </h2><p>  The most famous bimetallic "tens" include: </p><ul><li>  The 55th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945.  On these coins you can see the image of a soldier and a five-pointed star, moving from disk to ring. </li><li>  All-Russian Census of 2010. These bimetallic coins were made of an alloy of brass-cupronickel.  On the rim you can read 2 inscriptions: "Everyone is important to Russia" and the name "dozens". </li><li>  60th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945.  On the reverse of the coin, it was decided to depict the Eternal Flame.  The inscription that is displayed on it: "Nobody is forgotten, nothing is forgotten." </li><li>  40th anniversary of Gagarin's space flight.  Of course, on this "top ten" there is a relief portrait of a man in a spacesuit indicating his last name. </li></ul>

In October 2002, seven jubilee coins appeared in the country's turnover, which are dedicated to the 200th anniversary of the ministry.  Each ten-ruble was issued in 5 million copies.  The approximate cost of bimetallic banknotes of a series of ancient cities is as follows: the coinage of 2002-2006 is 200 rubles, dozens of 2007 were estimated at 400, with later issues the situation is slightly worse: only 100 are ready to pay for them. </p><h2>  Features of commemorative coins </h2><p>  Numismatists are very interested in these two-tone “tens”.  As a rule, commemorative coins are minted in honor of significant dates.  In addition, a country may issue special metallic banknotes.  That is how coins appeared that are dedicated to the cities of Russia.  In all likelihood, this is not the end of the release of new series. </p><p>  In the capital of Russia and in St. Petersburg, commemorative coins are made according to the same “recipe”.  To do this, use a special alloy brass cupronickel.  Of course, they can not be compared with the gold pieces of tsarist Russia, however, they are also quite beautiful! </p>

    <p>  Bimetallic coins with a face value of 10 rubles reach a diameter of 27 mm.  The obverse of almost all is identical, they differ only in the trademark and year of manufacture. </p><p>  But the reverse of the coins is different, each series has its own unique image, which corresponds to a specific event or object. </p><h2>  What determines the price of jubilee dozens? </h2><p>  The cost of coins depends on several components.  First of all, it is worth noting that most of the circulation of the series "Regions of the Russian Federation" will be in those areas to which they are dedicated.  So it turns out that in the Far East there is a greater likelihood of finding a coin issued in honor of the Sakhalin Region in deposit than than, for example, in Moscow.  It is with this unevenness that the formation of the market value of jubilee ten-ruble bonds is connected. </p><p>  In addition, the price depends on the safety.  For a coin in the state of the AC, they will pay much more than for the one that has been in many wallets and pockets. </p><p>  Over time, money disappears from circulation and is becoming less common, of course, this also affects the increase in value, so collectors are willing to pay several times more for releases from the beginning of 2000 than for those that appeared relatively recently. </p>

    <p>  Circulation is still of great importance.  For example, the bimetallic coins of Russia of the Ancient Towns and Ministries series were minted in 5 million copies, therefore they cost twice as much as the Regions of the Russian Federation, which issued 10 million copies. </p>
