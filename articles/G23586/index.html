That is what Aga is.  Locals even claim that the coast of their village is the cleanest water.  In recent years, Agoy has become popular among holidaymakers who stop there during a summer vacation. </p><h2>  A little bit about the resort ... </h2><p>  For many of us, the name of the village is completely unfamiliar, since not everyone has heard of it.  Where is Agoy located?  <span>Krasnodar Territory</span> is rich in resorts.  On its territory there are many famous resorts, as well as small resort villages.  Including Agoy. </p><p>  The village is located on the Black Sea coast, only twelve kilometers from Tuapse.  Agoy can also be reached by car, if you move along the highway to Novorossiysk.  In general, at present, the transport connection between the resorts is well established.  Tuapse can be reached from any region of Russia.  Well, then by bus to the village of Agoy.

    <p>  From the village to Krasnodar, the distance is approximately 160 kilometers.  There are several small villages near Agoy, but the territory is very poorly populated.  The village stretches along the river, which flows from the mountains and flows into the sea.  Due to it, a valley was formed, and after it goes the Agoysky pass, which separates the village from the rest of the territory.  It has formed its own microclimate.  In Agoy (Krasnodar Territory) subtropics begin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Agoy is a very small village, whose population is about three thousand inhabitants.  Regarding transport, the choice here is very small.  In the village everyone moves on foot, by bicycle or car.  Minibuses periodically pass through Agoy.  The nearest airport is in Krasnodar, so many prefer to travel by car, because this is the most convenient option. </p><h2>  Resort beach </h2><p>  The village of Agoy of the Krasnodar Territory attracts holidaymakers with its beaches.  The clean pebble coast is a good place to relax.  Sunset in the sea is very gentle, at first the depth is very small and it increases gradually.  Among the spa there are those who come to Agoy in late spring, when the water has already managed to warm up.  The beach season lasts until October. </p><p>  The central beach of the village is free.  It is very spacious, and entry into the sea is absolutely even.  The rest of the coast belongs to various boarding houses, so they are not always accessible.  There are many cafes built on the shore where you can have a great time.  For lovers of marine entertainment on the coast there are rental points for catamarans, jet skis and other equipment. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agoy village, Krasnodar Territory" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2077815.jpg"></div>

    <p>  In general, the beaches of Agoy (Krasnodar Territory) are considered one of the best in the region.  This is due to the fact that the water here is very clean due to natural water exchange.  The bottom is clearly visible even at a depth of three meters.  In addition, the local beaches, although pebble, are incredibly wide and spacious.  On average, their width is about forty meters.  Despite the modest size of the village, its coast is well-maintained.  And you can relax on the beaches for free.  For supporters of a wild holiday on the coast, there is a car camp in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kiselev cliff.  There are amazing places for spearfishing, it is for their sake that lovers of such entertainment come here. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The origin of the name of the village </h2><p>  The village of Agoy in the Krasnodar Territory once received its name from the river of the same name.  Translated from the Caucasian languages, the word Agoy means nothing more than ‚Äúmiddle river‚Äù.  The fact is that the river was formed by the merger of two mountain streams - Kolaho and Gynikospy.  The history of the village began back in 1915.  From a legal point of view, Agoy (Krasnodar Territory) is now part of the Neburgburg settlement.  In general, it is worth noting that the village is partly military, as military personnel of the airfield located nearby live there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnodar Territory Tuapse District Agoy" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2077820.jpg"></div>

    <p>  No less interesting is the Agoysky pass, through which you can get to the rocks of the same name.  From afar, it looks like a piece of paper washed into an accordion.  At its peak was a monument to the soldiers of the Taman army, who fought here with the White Guard forces.  On the observation deck, you can stand for hours and enjoy the panorama of the sea and mountains.  Wedding processions usually come here to take beautiful photos. </p><p>  As a place for entertainment, you can consider the local airfield.  A local club hosts car races on its runway.  Everyone can take part in such exciting competitions.  An aeroclub operates at the airport, offering to fly and parachute. </p><p>  As an entertainment in Agoy (Tuapse district of the Krasnodar Territory) you can see mouse holes.  Such an interesting name was given to small caves in the coastal cliffs.  They can be seen walking towards Tuapse.  However, for walking it is worth choosing quiet weather, in a storm this can be a dangerous hobby.  After all, the seabed is rocky and not flat everywhere. </p><p>  Not far from the village is the village of Aguy-Shapsug.  It is located on the Agoy River.  Near the village you can see the stunningly beautiful Wolf Rocks.  But the local tract Satenok is known for its mineral waters.  In the mountains, scientists found the sites of an ancient man. </p><h2>  Agoy Hotels </h2><p>  By the beginning of the holiday season, hotels are starting to operate in the village.  Many of them are located near the sea.  Most hotels correspond to the level of two or three stars.  However, it should be understood that such a status is only a formality.  Accommodation conditions in different hotels may vary, as well as cost.  The biggest money for housing is taken at the peak of the season - July and August.  But you can save significantly in May and September-October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="agoy hotels" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2077549.jpg"></div>

    <p>  If you want to find apartments closer to the sea, then you can pay attention to the guest house "Sea Breeze", which is located on Centralnaya street.  Accommodation without meals will cost guests from a thousand rubles a day and above.  The rooms are equipped with all amenities, furniture and appliances.  Guests can eat at the nearest caf√©. </p><p>  Assol Guest House is also located near the sea and offers apartments for two, three and four guests.

In general, in the village you can choose housing for every taste and budget, since there are many offers. </p><h2>  Reviews about the rest in Agoy (Krasnodar Territory) </h2><p>  Continuing the conversation about the resort village, we recall the feedback from the spa guests who were lucky enough to relax in it.  According to them, Agoy is a good place where you can have a good time.  Currently, the village is being actively built, probably soon new hotels and guest houses will appear on its territory.  But already now there is a fairly good selection of housing.  If you decide to spend your vacation in Agoy, then you should pre-select a possible accommodation option.  What to choose: private sector, hotel or recreation center?  The decision is up to you.  As a rule, the decision is directly dependent on the cost.  In Agoy, as in any resort, the price of accommodation is much higher by the sea.  And the farther the establishment is from the coast, the cheaper its rooms.  Near the sea in the village are mainly recreation centers and hotels.  But all the shops are located just in the center of Agoy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Agoy Krasnodar Territory reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2077582.jpg"></div>

    <p>  When analyzing the cost of living, do not pay attention to cheap offers.  If the owners offer accommodation at 300 rubles per day, then for sure you will get to the beach for a very long time.  Through the entire village runs the track.  Along it is a narrow sidewalk, along which you will need to make an everyday promenade. </p><p>  The inconvenience of living off the coast is that you will never know what the weather is like at sea.  In the village it is always very hot, but on the coast at this time a strong wind can storm and blow.  In this weather, you can devote your time to sightseeing or trips to nearby resorts. </p><p>  The beach of Agoy is pebble, but sometimes sand is also found.  The sea is very clean and beautiful.  On the coast there are sun loungers and sea activities - bananas, jumpers and scooters.  The beaches of Agoy are quite clean, but after storms ashore throws household garbage.  True, the rangers take it all away.  The beaches of the village are not as crowded as in the famous resorts, but still, during the high season, even here it is crowded, so you should not count on a secluded vacation. </p><p>  In bad weather, you can go to the neighboring village of Nebug to the water park or dolphinarium.  By minibus, the road takes no more than fifteen minutes. </p><p>  Summing up the conversation, it is worth saying that in the village of Agoy you can have a good rest.  However, when planning a vacation, you need to soberly assess the situation and understand that relaxing in such a small village has its pros and cons.  So that in the future you do not experience disappointment.  Agoy is a small village in which there are not many residents.  Accordingly, local landscapes are more like rural ones.  In the center of the village there is a pharmacy, first-aid post and a network of Magnit grocery stores, the prices of which are slightly higher, as in any resort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is Agoy Krasnodar Territory" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2077586.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The village has more reasonable prices for accommodation than in large resort cities.  But the infrastructure is much weaker.  There is very little entertainment in Agoy.  Holidays in the village are designed for those people who want to plunge into a more relaxed atmosphere.  If you want to go for a walk in the evening, for example, along the promenade or walk through the park, then you will not succeed.  In the village there is simply no familiar promenade.  To many, Agoya may seem like a rather boring place.  The most active holidaymakers can get to Tuapse on a minibus and see the city.  In general, the traffic intersection makes it possible to travel to the nearest villages in between visits to the beach. </p>
