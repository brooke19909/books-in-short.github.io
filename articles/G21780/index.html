    <p>  Ski resorts "Silichy" were created by order of the President of the country.  This object is designed to improve the nation.  Today the Silichi complex is the pride of the Belarusian tourism industry. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It is located 35 km from the capital of the country - Minsk.  This is a modern, well-equipped complex that welcomes guests throughout the year.  In winter, ski lovers from all over Belarus and from neighboring countries come to Silichi.  Since 2011, the complex has a magnificent snowpark with a halfpipe.  There are excellent conditions for corporate parties, relaxing with friends on a weekend day or vacation. </p><h2>  International snowpark </h2><p>  There are chair lifts at three ski slopes.  Despite the fact that the elevation difference is not too large (100 m), the Silichi complex (Minsk) is not inferior to the best European resorts in the length of the routes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Here, children's and educational trails with a length of 70 and 120 meters with a <span>ski lift have been created.</span>  I would especially like to note the snowpark equipped for any rider: the highest jumps for pro riders and very modest kickers for beginners, seven figures of superpipe and jibbing, on which freestylers can hone their skills. </p><p>  Do not think that you will master difficult tricks on your own.  You will be taught to jump by local instructors. </p><p>  Here you can ride a snowmobile on a 2.5 km long track, <span>cross-country skiing</span> on a 1.1 km track. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="silichi prices" class="if" height="371" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/648481.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Weekend Holidays </h2><p>  For those who want to visit Silichy (Belarus) and stay in the resort for more than 1 day, the administration of the complex offers places in a cottage village with a three-star hotel with 100 beds and 12 two-story houses.  This is a great place where you can relax from the hustle and bustle of the city, there are no noisy parties. </p><p>  It offers guests - free parking for 850 cars.  And in two large restaurants and several cafes and bistros you can taste European and Belarusian dishes. </p><h2>  Rest all year round </h2><p>  Ski resorts "Selichi" originally had a height difference of 76 meters.  Belarusians used bedding, adjusted the slopes so that everyone could ride, even beginners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Silichi is a ski center, which is rightly proud of steep routes, as well as soft, gentle slopes for beginners and children.

In winter it is a magnificent ski resort, and in summer it is a usual recreation center for those who prefer to spend time actively. </p><p>  The ski season completely coincides with the winter period in the middle lane, that is, from December to February. </p><p>  In March, you can go to the Logoisk hills.  Those who really want to go ice-skating in the off-season can visit the closed complexes, which begin to work in the resort in October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Silichi ski center" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/648482.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Summer rest </h2><p>  In the summer, the Silichi ski resorts offer vacationers bicycles and skis.  Here you can work out in the well-equipped gymnasium, swim in the pool or go on an excursion. </p><p>  Local restaurants are happy to welcome guests.  They are offered a varied menu with an emphasis on European and <span>Belarusian cuisine.</span>  In the cafe you can always drink hot coffee or tea, German mulled wine.  You can enjoy fragrant kebabs or pancakes. </p><p>  In shops and rental points there is a wide selection of sportswear and all the necessary equipment, as well as many original souvenirs - wooden figures, cute crafts from straw, maple and lime spoons, cockerels, clay dishes, linen towels and shirts. </p><p>  In fairness, I must say that the resort complex does not always cope with the influx of tourists.  Therefore, I would like to advise - plan your trip so that it does not fall on holidays and weekends.  So you save time and money. </p><h2>  Ski resort "Silichi": prices </h2><p>  We want to note right away that they are not stable and fluctuate depending on the season, weekdays, weekends or holidays.  Remember that rooms in a hotel or cottage village must be booked in advance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Silichi Belarus" class="if" height="448" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/648485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Ski <span>holidays in Belarus</span> today are associated with the Silichi resort.  Prices for winter tours are pretty easy to calculate.  This should be done based on the cost of living per day: </p><ul><li>  double room - 66-86 euros (depending on whether you will live in the room alone or with a neighbor); </li><li>  double suite - 77-107 euros; </li><li>  triple - 62 euros; </li><li>  quadruple room - 60-79 euros; </li><li>  cottage - 79-111 (2-seater); </li><li>  four-seater cottage - 67 euros (it does not provide for a single stay). </li></ul><p>  The organization of the winter tour includes accommodation, meals, transportation (cable car) services and medical.  Transfer to the <span>capital of Belarus is</span> paid extra.  Ski rental for an hour costs <span>1 euro.</span>  The kit includes skis, poles, boots.  A snowboarding kit (snowboard and boots) costs about 0.9 euros per hour. </p><p>  If you want to use the services of a ski instructor, then for an individual lesson of 1 hour you will pay $ 4, instructing in a group (1 hour) - about $ 2.  Lunch at a restaurant costs about $ 20. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Today, many of our compatriots have visited the resort "Silichi."  Reviews about him are different.  Those who have previously visited European resorts believe that the Belarusian counterpart does not reach the international level.  But at the same time they note the cable car, which, in their opinion, wins over Czech or Polish. </p><p>  Belarusians are happy to spend their days off here, however, they have been complaining about the recent increase in prices. </p><p>  Many people find the tracks in Silichy short, but are satisfied with the high-altitude swings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="silichi minsk" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12260/648486.jpg" width="576"></div>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Silichi is a ski center, a rapidly developing resort that strives for European standards.  True, prices are rising along with this.  We hope that over time the Logoisky Hills will turn into a new Courchevel, so you should go there right now, while tickets are still quite affordable. </p>
