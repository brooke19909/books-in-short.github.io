  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Administrative law</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  <span>Administrative law</span> is an independent industry and is part of the legal system of the Russian Federation.  Depending on the challenges and taking into account its focus, this area has some distinctive features. </p><p>  As an industry, administrative law has been formed since the time when a certain place in the legal system was occupied by the norms enshrining individual rights, as well as guarantees against arbitrariness in the administrative sphere. </p><p>  This industry is considered one of the largest and most complex in Russia.  This is due to the variety of tasks that administrative law performs.  In social life, there is not a single sphere in which the state administration does not take part.  Moreover, in some areas (state security, healthcare, communications, transport, energy, public education and others), its (administration) role is considered decisive.  It determines the effectiveness in the management and implementation of many rights of citizens.  In Russia, therefore, administrative law is a very important legal sector.  This is due to the importance of the role played by the public administration. </p><p>  The subject of administrative law is the totality of social relations that take shape in the process of forming activities in the executive branch.  Thus, the implementation of the relations that arise in the process of formation and work of the state administration, as well as the maintenance of the sphere of municipal and state administration, takes place. </p><p>  It should be noted that management is present in all <span>social spheres</span> and has a diverse content and large volume.  In some cases, <span>managerial activity</span> has such a special specificity that it is regulated not only by administrative, but also by other branches of law.  So, for example, the financial management department implements financial, <span>preliminary investigation</span> and inquiry - the criminal procedure legal branch.  Thus, determining the <span>subject of administrative law,</span> it is necessary to clarify that regulation is carried out in all managerial relations, with the exception of those enshrined in other legal branches in the Russian Federation.  The regulation of social relations is carried out by establishing rules of conduct, enshrined in the norms and mandatory for all participants to observe regulated relations. </p><p>  The basics of administrative law can be divided into two groups.  The first includes intra-device relations, the second - the relationship between the administration authorities and citizens, as well as non-governmental and state organizations. </p><p>  The public administration industry is called upon to respond clearly to the changes that are associated with the needs of the economic and social life of the population.  In this regard, there is a need to improve legal standards. </p><p>  The subject of administrative law has certain duties and rights assigned to him in connection with the realization of his needs.  A citizen, a state body, a public association, and others may act as a participant in public relations. </p><p>  Obligations and rights of the subject form in the complex its <span>legal status,</span> which forms general norms.  For example, the general rules for compliance with fire safety rules are common. </p><p>  According to the administrative and legal status, entities are divided into organizations and individuals.  The latter include the following types: a citizen of the Russian Federation, <span>a stateless person</span> and a foreign citizen.  Organizations are divided into state and non-state actors. </p>
