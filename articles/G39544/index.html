  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY pony patterns made of felt</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The animated series "My Little Pony" immediately after the release of the screens won the hearts of millions of small viewers around the world.  Children constantly demand to buy them new characters in the film.  You can make a small horse perfectly at home, using several multi-colored sheets of felt.  They can be easily purchased at any sewing accessories store or ordered online. </p><p>  It is most convenient to sew little ponies with your own hands on a pattern.  Templates of each element are drawn separately on cardboard.  All that remains is to circle them with chalk on the fabric and cut them with sharp scissors along the contours.  Ask your child in advance what character he wants to have in his collection.  Consider his image in the picture, and only then begin to draw a pony pattern on paper.  If you do not have artistic abilities, then do not risk doing it yourself.  It is most convenient to use a printout of a hero‚Äôs image from the Internet.  This is a popular cartoon, so finding any character will not be problematic. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider how to sew ponies from felt according to patterns prepared with their own hands.  As well as how to make fabric cutting, what threads it is better to connect parts with each other, what to use as a filler to give the necessary volume to the figure of a small horse.  If desired, you can sew a unicorn.  This is also a pony from a cartoon with a magic horn growing on its forehead.  Children of this character are also very fond of. </p><h2>  Little pony pattern </h2><p>  Consider carefully the pony pattern presented below in the article.  The numbers on each element indicate the number of parts that need to be cut according to the drawing.  So, there should be 15 colored hairs for mane, and only two body parts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="pony pattern" class="if uuid-3164181" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3164181.jpg"></div><p>  The colors should match the pattern shown in the corner above the pony pattern.  When all the details are drawn on cardboard in the required scale, each part of the figure is cut out with scissors.  Then the template is superimposed on the felt sheet.  It is soft and comfortable to use.  It is perfectly sewn with kapron threads - they are selected to match the main color.  The craftwork with seams over the edge looks beautiful, despite the fact that they do not split in this fabric.  This is done with a decorative purpose. </p><h2>  Stitching parts together </h2><p>  When the details of the future pony toy are prepared according to the pattern presented above, they prepare the filler from a thin synthetic winterizer.  They do this according to the template of the body, but around the entire perimeter, cut off the edge by 0.5 cm so that when the parts are joined, the filler does not compress. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to sew a felt pony" class="if uuid-3164191" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3164191.jpg"></div><p>  The tail can be made single or cut an additional element from felt of a different color.  The horn is sewn at the request of the child. </p><h2>  Simple pony </h2><p>  Any pattern for sewing a pony can be done independently.  Even a senior preschooler can draw such a simple horse.  Separately, a mane and tail are prepared and cut from felt of white and brown color.  It remains to draw a heart and sew all the details together.  Do not forget to place a synthetic winterizer between the layers of felt! </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="craft pony" class="if uuid-3163984" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/3163984.jpg"></div><p>  Small details, such as eyes, can be embroidered with mouline thread.  It is interesting to arrange such an article in the form of a keychain for keys or pendants on a child‚Äôs portfolio.  To do this, it is enough to sew a metal ring into the horse‚Äôs head and attach a loop. </p><p>  Now you know how to make a pony on a pattern at home from felt sheets.  Good luck </p>
