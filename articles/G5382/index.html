    <p>  Personal income tax - the generally accepted reduction of <span>tax on personal income.</span>  Being one of the so-called salary, income tax ultimately goes to pay for all sorts of budget services. </p><p>  Who pays personal income tax and why </p><p>  Personal income tax payers include <span>residents of the Russian Federation,</span> as well as non-residents who receive income from Russian sources. </p><p>  The employers are directly involved in calculating, withholding and paying this tax: organizations and individual entrepreneurs, bar associations, private notaries and separate divisions of foreign enterprises. </p><p>  A tax at a rate of 13% is levied on all payments related to remuneration of labor, including supplementary (bonuses, surcharges) and compensating (vacation, sick leave) nature.  Withholding personal income tax is carried out from salary accruals, and the tax base is not reduced if the employee pays for debt obligations (including alimony).  However, the calculation of personal income tax provides the opportunity for the employee to receive various <span>tax deductions.</span> </p><p>  Deductions used in calculating personal income tax </p><p>  The Tax Code provides for three types of deductions for income tax: standard, social, property.  To obtain the last two types, an individual must contact the tax office at the place of registration.  Standard deductions are provided at the facility. </p><p>  In 2012, the procedure for calculating <span>standard tax deductions</span> underwent a number of changes, which directly affected the calculation of personal income tax in 2012 for almost all categories of employees.  Firstly, deductions of 400 rubles ‚Äúfor themselves‚Äù were canceled, which until that time relied on absolutely all employees whose income did not exceed 40 thousand rubles.  Secondly, the size of the "parental" deductions has changed.  From now on, it is possible to monthly reduce the tax base by 1,400 rubles for the first two children who have not reached the age of majority or 24 years old, but who are full-time students (graduate students, interns). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For parents with many children, taxable income is reduced on a progressive scale: in the presence of a third (and all subsequent) children, personal income tax will be calculated taking into account a deduction of 3,000 rubles.  Moreover, the age of older children does not matter, but only the order of birth.  Parents of children with disabilities or persons with disabilities of the two higher groups who are full-time students and have not reached the age of twenty-four are also entitled to reduce taxable income by 3000. </p><p>  Single mothers and widowed fathers can receive double deduction for each child.  The same right remains with the parent in the event that the second parent in writing renounced his right to reduce income tax in favor of another. </p><p>  ‚ÄúParental‚Äù deductions, regardless of their size, are due to the employee only until the amount of his income exceeds 280 thousand rubles. </p><p>  An example of calculating personal income tax at a rate of 13% </p><p>  Consider the example of calculating personal income tax taking into account the new procedure for providing deductions. </p><p>  Suppose that StolInvest LLC has five employees: </p><ul><li>  Ivanov A. D. (director) - a salary of 60 thousand rubles, 1 child (11 years old), pays alimony in the amount of 25%. </li><li>  A. Lemesheva (accountant) - salary of 30 thousand rubles, 1 child (14 years old), single mom. </li><li>  Raviolin V.S. (manager) - a salary of 25 thousand rubles, 3 children (17, 13, 5 years). </li><li>  Suprov R.V. (master) - salary of 15 thousand rubles, 3 children (25, 17, 13 years old). </li><li>  Ignatov P.R. (master) - salary of 15 thousand rubles, a disabled person of group II, no children. </li></ul><p>  In this case, the calculation of personal income tax for the period from January to April will be carried out as follows: </p><p>  Ivanov A.D .: (60000-1400) * 13% = 7618. </p><p>  Lemesheva A.I .:: (30000-1400 * 2) * 13% = 3536. </p><p>  Raviolin V.S.: (25000- (1400 + 1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 2496. </p><p>  Suprov R.V .: (15000- (1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 1378. </p><p>  Ignatov P.R .: (15000-500) * 13% = 1885. </p><p>  In May, the <span>total income of</span> Ivanov A.D.  will be 300 thousand rubles.  Since the limit allowed by law (280 thousand) will be exceeded, from this month no deduction will be provided to the director.  Therefore, from May to September, the calculation of personal income tax will look like this: </p><p>  Ivanov A.D .: 60000 * 13% = 7800. </p><p>  Lemesheva A.I .:: (30000-1400 * 2) * 13% = 3536. </p><p>  Raviolin V.S.: (25000- (1400 + 1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 2496. </p><p>  Suprov R.V .: (15000- (1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 1378. </p><p>  Ignatov P.R .: (15000-500) * 13% = 1885. </p><p>  In October, the allowable limit on total income will be exceeded and A. Lemesheva  Therefore, from this month, the calculation of personal income tax in the company will be carried out as follows: </p><p>  Ivanov A.D .: 60000 * 13% = 7800. </p><p>  Lemesheva A.I .: 30000 * 13% = 3900. </p><p>  Raviolin V.S.: (25000- (1400 + 1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 2496. </p><p>  Suprov R.V .: (15000- (1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 1378. </p><p>  Ignatov P.R .: (15000-500) * 13% = 1885. </p><p>  And in December, Raviolin‚Äôs income will also exceed the permissible limit: </p><p>  Ivanov A.D .: 60000 * 13% = 7800. </p><p>  Lemesheva A.I .: 30000 * 13% = 3900. </p><p>  Raviolin V.S .: 25000 * 13% = 3250. </p><p>  Suprov R.V .: (15000- (1400 + 3000)) * 13% = 1378. </p><p>  Ignatov P.R .: (15000-500) * 13% = 1885. </p><p>  Since Suprov‚Äôs income with the total for the year will not exceed the established limit, deductions will be deducted to him throughout the year.  For Ignatov P. R. the possibility of reducing the tax base by income is not limited. </p>
