There are more and more lovers of quality sound, but not all of them have money for an advanced speaker system, so many manufacturers have begun to create sets of speakers at a lower price than classic high-end options.  One of the leaders in the low price segment is the manufacturer of sound equipment SVEN.  In this article we‚Äôll talk more about the brand and its legendary 5.1 acoustics - SVEN HA-1410T. </p>

    <h2>  SVEN brand </h2><p>  Now the Scandinavian brand SVEN was created in 1991 in the USSR.  As part of the conversion, the company was engaged in the development and sale of multimedia devices (portable acoustics and speaker systems) and various computer peripherals (headphones, keyboards, headsets).  Throughout its history, the company has followed the only principle - to use the cheapest materials, to limit the functionality of the devices, but at the same time to put forth all efforts to achieve high quality of the main function of the device.  Thus, the manufacturer managed to create a market filled with high-quality, and most importantly, inexpensive speakers and headphones.  Next, we turn to the review of SVEN HA-1410T, the actual speaker system itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What is <span>active acoustics</span> 5.1? </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth deciding what active acoustics 5.1 is.  The number 5.1 means a complete set.  The user receives a ready-made set of 5 speakers (often referred to as ‚Äútweeters‚Äù or ‚Äúsatellites‚Äù), which are responsible for the upper and middle tones, and 1 subwoofer, which is responsible for the depth of sound and bass.  The subwoofer also acts as a kind of ‚Äúhub‚Äù to which speakers are connected, as well as a media player or computer.  The word ‚Äúactive‚Äù means that the system does not need a separate amplifier, the speakers are already equipped with built-in options. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  Since the stereo is far from small, it comes in two boxes.  In one of them you can find: </p><ul><li>  <span>Active subwoofer.</span> </li><li>  Cables for connecting system elements to each other ( <span>high-quality speaker</span> cables are used). </li><li>  Remote control system. </li><li>  Subwoofer feet </li><li>  Instruction from SVEN HA-1410T. </li></ul><p>  In the second box are: </p><ul><li>  Rear speakers. </li><li>  Front speakers. </li><li>  One central. </li></ul>

They look really worthy.  There are several color options that can be selected for a specific room.  Thanks to the minimalist and austere look, they can easily fit into even the most sophisticated interior.  The material for the columns is a fiberboard, the so-called MDF (transliteration).  The thickness of the plate is 15 millimeters.  A synthetic winterizer is laid in the inner part, which affects the acoustic characteristics of the ‚Äúsatellites‚Äù, which reduces the level of vibrations.  To connect the cables, screw sockets with a small amount of gold spraying are used.  To avoid confusion, the connectors are color coded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The subwoofer is made of the same materials.  It looks pretty neat, without any prominent elements.  On the front panel there was a place for a compact display.  On it looms information about the reproduced content and other useful information.  The speakers and power jacks are located on the back.  The subwoofer rests on four metal spiked legs.  This design contributes to the stability of the subwoofer, but may damage the flooring.  The manufacturer thought about this and put rubber tips in the kit. </p><p>  The remote control is not convenient.  It can be seen that the bias was made towards the accepted external design and compliance with the general style of the entire speaker system.  It is very thin and light, but the number of options on it is limited.  In fairness, it is worth noting that the available settings will suffice for the vast majority of users. </p>

    <h2>  Speaker design </h2><p>  Each SVEN Audio HA-1410T speaker is equipped with a bass reflex and a small plastic tube located in the back of the chassis.  Two-way speakers protected by a Butterworth filter are used.  Thanks to this filter, the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the speakers remains smoother and almost disappears at the frequencies of the suppression band.  Mid-range speakers, their cone is made of polypropylene, and its suspension is made of rubber, which is not very stiff, which is good for sound.  The high-frequency elements are in the shape of a small dome and made of silk.  There is a powerful magnetic system with full shielding.  The whole mechanism has a fairly wide stroke.  Another important detail is the acoustic impedance level (this characteristic indicates how many ohms are in the SVEN HA-1410T).  It is 6 ohms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Subwoofer design </h2><p>  Among the design features of the subwoofer, one can distinguish a large radiator grill that maintains the low temperature of the amplifiers.  The diffuser is made of dense material of an unusual shape with a large number of recesses, which favorably affects the level of resonance in the sound.  The bass reflex and two wide pipes are led out to the bottom panel. </p><p>  In general, the 5.1 SVEN HA-1410T acoustics is a truly ‚Äúserious‚Äù device.  It can be seen that the manufacturer wisely approached the creation of the device, focusing on the maximum level of quality.  An LM4731TA chip is involved, on which a stereo amplifier with a large power reserve is installed.  Among the shortcomings, it is worth highlighting a limitation of 20 watts, after the intersection of which there are obvious distortions that hit the sound quality.  Nevertheless, for such a set of speakers this power is usually more than enough, the main thing is not to overdo it. </p>

    <h2>  Listening experience </h2><p>  The speaker system perfectly copes with any music, no matter what genre you prefer.  The sound is beautiful and powerful, thanks to the advanced speakers and characteristics of the SVEN HA-1410T as a whole.  Even if you bring the power to full, it is hardly possible to notice any serious changes in the sound.  There are certainly distortions, but you can put up with them.  Mids are impressive.  The sound detailing and its saturation far beyond the price segment of the monitored acoustics, a higher level is heard worthy of many Hi-Fi systems.  High frequencies also bring a lot of pleasure, since they do not spoil the impression of a typical background whistle, wheezing and hissing typical for such systems.  The bass in the SVEN HA-1410T deserves a standing ovation.  Regardless of the length of the deep bass, the system copes with it with a bang.  Hard metalcore blast beats and lingering ‚Äúexplosions‚Äù of hip-hop music sound great. </p><p>  Of course, a lot depends on the location of the speakers in the room.  The speaker system is designed for installation in a room of about 30 square meters.  With the proper placement of all elements, an immersive presence effect can be achieved.  It is important that when you switch from another set of speakers to the brainchild of SVEN, you can discover new compositions for yourself that you have listened to for years.  Everything that used to seem familiar and hackneyed appears in new colors and again surprises. </p><p>  It is difficult to single out any drawbacks, since there is no even a frequently encountered problem with an excess of intrinsic noise in the columns.  A slight noise can be noticed only if the volume is set to maximum, and even then you have to snuggle up close to the speaker to notice it.  Nevertheless, the system is very sensitive to interference, so when you turn on other electronics, you can hear crackling and noise in the speakers.  Again, these clicks are hardly noticeable. </p><h2>  Measurements </h2><p>  The analysis data of the amplitude-frequency characteristics (hereinafter AFC) are encouraging.  To begin with, it is worth clarifying that when collecting data, frequencies in the interval 130-500 Hertz were intentionally overwhelmed.  <span>The characteristics of the speaker system</span> were taken at "zero" settings.  The fact is that the subwoofer has a wide working band, the upper threshold of which is 500 hertz.  Therefore, the data was shot in this way to combine the subwoofer and the ‚Äúsatellites‚Äù. </p><p>  Data was taken in a straight axis at an angle of 45 degrees.  The frequency response was uniform, with a slight deviation within 6 decibels. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews of SVEN HA-1410T </h2><p>  Those who like to annoy neighbors with heavy rock chorus applaud 5.1 SVEN HA-1410T speaker system.  It sounds a little pathetic, but in fact it is.  Most users speak positively about the monitored acoustics and are satisfied with it to this day.  Many have called the device the best creation of SVEN for all the years of the company's existence, and it is difficult to disagree with them.  Pluses are all the same.  High-quality materials, namely a thick layer of wood (analogues in this class are often made of plastic) and assembly.  Magnetic shielding of the case, which increases the level of security.  The visual design also pleased all the owners of this miracle.  A solid, impressive design is popular with lovers of high-quality male sound.  Of course, the sound was appreciated.  Fans of dancing in their apartment were satisfied, but with the neighbors there really can be problems.  An excellent SVEN HA-1410T solution turned out to be for those who use the 5.1 system as a home theater. </p><p>  Not without flaws.  First of all, it is the interference that occurs when turning on or off the light or electronics in the house.  Saving settings in the SVEN HA-1410T does not work.  When the power is turned off, all settings are reset, which causes a lot of trouble.  There were problems with the management.  Management is carried out only from the remote control, but it is not for sale, that is, you have to take care of the only control element like the apple of your eye. </p><h2>  Comparison with JetBalance JB-651CA </h2><p>  Compared with the brainchild of JetBalance, the product from SVEN clearly wins.  The advantage is felt already at first.  The main problem of JetBalance in comparison with SVEN is precisely the ‚Äúemptiness‚Äù of the sound of high frequencies, which fade and clearly do not realize the full potential of the device.  The sound quality of the mid frequencies also leaves much to be desired.  The range of amplitude-frequency characteristics of the "satellites" is strongly distorted in the range of 90-22000 Hertz.  The distortion in the frequency response of the subwoofer is even more pronounced. </p>

    <h2>  Comparison with Edifier S 5.1 </h2><p>  Here the SVEN product holds the lead again.  Unfortunately, the Edifier system does not have such a wide range of high frequencies, which SVEN HA-1410T boasts, and this is the main reason for the defeat.  The reliability of the timbre at medium frequencies also suffers, which many lovers of high-quality sound will note and will be disappointed.  The frequency response of the front speakers varies between 6 decibels over a 90-35000 hertz interval.  The distortion level of the speakers and subwoofer is moderate. </p><h2>  Comparison with Genius SW-HF 5.1 5000 </h2><p>  This Genius creation basically sounds mediocre.  This is understandable without any tests and comparisons, but if we talk about the specific advantages of SVEN, it is worth noting a more detailed and rich sound in the entire range.  The Scandinavian brand in the battle with Genius leaves the second no chance.  The frequency response of the front speakers is too uneven and ranges from 6 decibels in the range of 100-30000 Hz.  Distortions in sound are noticeable both at medium frequencies and at high frequencies. </p><h2>  Comparison with Microlab H-500 </h2><p>  Here the competitors are almost a draw.  SVEN has a slight advantage.  This is especially noticeable in terms of low frequencies, of which SVEN has more.  You can also note a more detailed sound and natural timbre, but these details are not so striking.  Frequency response is uneven, the average discrepancy is plus or minus 7 decibels in the range of 100-40000 Hertz.  The distortion level of the front speakers and subwoofer is moderate. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  We can definitely say that the work done at SVEN deserves respect.  For a modest price, not everyone can offer users an acoustic system of this level.  The overlooked 5.1 speakers are definitely a success.  High power, detailed sound, natural sound at all frequencies and a subwoofer will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  Pros: </p><ul><li>  Great visual design. </li><li>  High power. </li><li>  Quality sound. </li><li>  Speaker cables included. </li><li>  Low cost. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  Large dimensions (requires a lot of space for placement and a lot of energy for transportation). </li></ul>
