    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The battle on the Neva River in 1240 did not begin spontaneously.  She was preceded by a number of important political and historical events. </p><p>  In the first half of the 13th century, the Swedes, united with the Novgorodians, made regular raids on Finnish tribes.  They called them punitive campaigns, the purpose of which was to subordinate more and more people to their will.  The tribes of Sum and Em suffered the most from the Swedes.  This was the cause of protracted conflicts.  The Swedes were afraid of a blow from the Finns, so they sought to christen them and make them allies. </p><p>  The conquerors did not stop there.  They periodically carried out predatory raids on lands along the Neva, as well as directly on Novgorod territory.  Sweden was significantly weakened by internal conflicts, so it sought to attract as many soldiers and nobles to its side.  They did not disdain to persuade lovers of easy money to win over to their side.  For a long time, the Finno-Karelian troops raided Swedish lands, and in 1187 they all united with the Novgorodians.  They burned Sigtuna - the ancient capital of Sweden. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This confrontation lasted a long time.  Each of its sides, both Swedish and Russian, sought to establish its power on the Izhora land, which was located along the Neva, as well as on the Karelian Isthmus. </p><p>  The landmark date preceding such a famous event as the battle on the Neva River was the proclamation of the second crusade against Finland by Pope Gregory IX of December in 1237.  In June 1238, the King of Denmark Voldemar II and the master of the united order German von Balk agreed on the division of the Estonian state, as well as on the start of hostilities against Russia in the Baltic states with the involvement of the Swedes.  That was what provoked the battle on the Neva River.  The date, the events of which are known even now, became the starting point in the history of Russia and its relations with neighboring states.  The battle showed the ability of our state to repulse the powerful army of the enemy.  Keep in mind the fact that the battle on the Neva River occurred in difficult times.  Russian lands only began to recover after a long Mongol invasion and the forces of the troops were significantly weakened. </p><h2>  Battle on the Neva River: sources </h2><p>  Historians have to collect information about such long-standing events bit by bit.  Many researchers are interested in such an event as the battle on the Neva River, date.  Briefly, the battle is described in chronological documents.  Of course, such sources are not numerous.  One of the most famous can be called the Novgorod first annals.  Information can also be gleaned from the story of the life of Alexander Nevsky.  It is assumed that it was written by contemporaries of those events no later than the eighties of the XIII century. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If we consider the Scandinavian sources, then they do not contain detailed information about such significant battles as the battle on the Neva River and the Battle of Ice.  One can only read that a small Swedish detachment was defeated in the Finnish Crusade. </p><p>  It is also not known for certain who led the Scandinavian army.  Based on Russian sources, scientists say that it was the son-in-law of King Birger Magnusson. </p>

At the same time, Birger did not participate in it, although there is an opposite opinion.  So, the results of archaeological excavations indicate that Birger was injured in the front of his head during his life.  This coincides with the information that Alexander Nevsky wounded the king himself in the eye.

    <p>  Historical events until the sixteenth century were not recorded in certain official sources.  Very often, historians cannot establish the exact day or even the approximate period when a battle took place.  But this does not apply to such an important event as the battle on the Neva River.  What year did it happen?  Historians know the exact answer to this question.  This battle dates back to July 15, 1240. </p><h2>  Events before the battle </h2><p>  Not a single battle begins spontaneously.  A series of events occurred that entailed such a difficult moment as the battle on the Neva River.  The year in which it occurred began for the Swedes by uniting with the Novgorodians.  In the summer, their ships arrived at the mouth of the Neva.  The Swedes and their allies landed on the coast and spread their tents.  This happened at the place where Izhora flows into the Neva. </p><p>  The composition of the troops was motley.  It included Swedes, Novgorodians, Norwegians, representatives of Finnish tribes, and, of course, Catholic bishops.  The borders of the Novgorod lands were protected by the maritime guard.  It was provided by the Izhorians at the mouth of the Neva, on both sides of the Gulf of Finland.  It was the elder of this guard, Pelgusius, at the dawn of July, who discovered that the Swedish flotilla was already close.  About this, the messengers hastened to inform Prince Alexander. </p><p>  The Livonian campaign of the Swedes in Russia began only in August, which suggests that they took a wait-and-see attitude, as well as the immediate and lightning reaction of Prince Alexander.  Having received news that the enemy was already close, he decided to act independently, without resorting to the help of his father.  Alexander Yaroslavovich went into battle with a small squad.  The battle on the Neva River was a chance for the young prince to prove himself as a commander.  Therefore, many troops did not have time to join him.  On the side of Alexander, Ladoga militias also joined, who joined him along the way. </p><p>  According to the then existing customs, the whole squad gathered at the Hagia Sophia, where it was blessed by Archbishop Spiridon.  Then Alexander made a parting speech, quotes from which are known even now: "God is not in power, but in truth!" </p><p>  The detachment moved on land along the Volkhov to Ladoga itself.  From there, he turned to the mouth of Izhora.  For the most part, the army consisted of equestrian warriors, but there was also infantry.  To save travel time, this part of the squad also rode horses. </p><h2>  Timeline of the battle </h2><p>  The battle began on July 15, 1940.  It is known that in addition to the prince's squad, at least three more detachments of noble Novgorod commanders, as well as Ladoga, participated in the Russian army. </p>

    <p>  In the Life, the names of six warriors who committed heroic deeds during the battle are mentioned. </p><p>  Gavrilo Olekeich boarded the enemy ship, from where he was dropped by the wounded, but despite this he again boarded and continued to fight.  Sbyslav Yakunovich was armed only with an ax, but nevertheless rushed into the thick of the battle.  No less bravely fought and hunter Alexander Yakov Polochanin.  The young man Savva burst into the enemy camp and hooked the tent of the Swedes.  Misha from Novgorod took part in the foot battle and sank three enemy ships.  Ratmir, a servant of Alexander Yaroslavovchia, bravely fought with several Swedes, after which he was wounded and died on the battlefield. </p><p>  The battle lasted from morning to evening.  Opponents dispersed by night.  The Swedes, realizing that they suffered a crushing defeat, retreated on their surviving ships and crossed to the opposite bank. </p><p>  It is known that the Russian army did not pursue the enemy.  The reason for this is unknown.  Perhaps it was the knightly custom that did not prevent the burial of his fighters during the respite.  Maybe Alexander did not see the need to finish off a bunch of the remaining Swedes and did not want to risk his army. </p><p>  The losses of the Russian detachment amounted to XX noble warriors, and their warriors should also be added here.  Among the Swedes, there were much more deaths.  Historians speak of dozens, if not hundreds of killed warriors. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The battle on the Neva River, the date of which has been remembered for centuries, has prevented the danger of Sweden and the Order coming to Russia in the near future.  Alexander's army resolutely suppressed their invasion of Ladoga and Novgorod. </p>

    <p>  However, the Novgorod boyars began to fear that Alexander‚Äôs power over them would increase.  They began to build various schemes for the young prince, as a result of forcing him to leave to his father Yaroslav.  However, very soon they asked him to return to continue the battle with the <span>Livonian Order,</span> which approached Pskov. </p><h2>  Memory of the battle </h2><p>  In order not to forget about the distant events on the Neva, the descendants of Alexander sought to perpetuate memories of them.  So, monumental architectural monuments were created, which were repeatedly restored.  In addition, the image of Alexander Nevsky found its reflection on coins and commemorative stamps. </p><h2>  Alexander Nevsky Lavra </h2>

    <p>  This monolithic building was erected by Peter I in 1710.  The Alexander Nevsky Monastery was built at the mouth of the Black River in St. Petersburg.  At that time, it was mistakenly assumed that the battle took place in this place.  The inspiration and creator of the laurel was <span>Domenico Trezzini.</span>  Subsequently, work was continued by other architects. </p><p>  In 1724, the remains of Alexander Yaroslavovich were transported here.  Now the territory of the laurel is a state national reserve.  The ensemble includes several churches, a museum and a cemetery.  Such famous people as Mikhail Lomonosov, Alexander Suvorov, Nikolai Karamzin, Mikhail Glinka, Modest Mussorgsky, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Fedor Dostoevsky rest on it. </p><h2>  Church of Alexander Nevsky in Ust-Izhora </h2><p>  This building was erected in honor of the victory in the battle of 1240.  Date of construction - 1711.  The church burned and was rebuilt several times.  At the end of the 18th century, a stone church with <span>cast-iron grates</span> and a bell tower was built by the parishioners. </p><p>  In 1934 the church was closed and for a long time was used as a warehouse.  During the Leningrad blockade, the temple tower was blown up, as it served as a guide for German artillery. </p><p>  In 1990, work began on the restoration of the church, and a few years later it was consecrated.  At the temple there is a small cemetery, as well as a chapel monument with the image of Alexander Nevsky. </p><h2>  Printing coins and stamps </h2>

In the anniversary years after the battle, significant stamps are also issued, which are of great interest to philatelists. </p><h2>  Adaptations </h2><p>  In 2008, the author's film "Alexander.
