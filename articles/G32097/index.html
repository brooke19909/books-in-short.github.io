But now the tourism industry is rapidly gaining momentum.  And this is facilitated by the amazing nature and unique attractions of the country.  There are Zoroastrian temples, ancient mosques, ancient cities, snow-capped peaks of mountains, resorts on the Caspian Sea.  Azerbaijan experienced the powerful cultural influence of Persia, and this also has its own charm.  They speak Turkish and practice Islam.  However, the country is open to European development trends.  The capital of the state is known for its Baku Acropolis (the old part of the city) and the beautiful promenade.  The Iranian quarter is also interesting here.  There are many medieval castles on the <span>Absheron peninsula</span> .  You can also see unique cave paintings (in Gobustan).  But for beach people, Azerbaijan’s biggest attraction is the world's largest lake - the Caspian.  An overview of the <span>sea ​​resorts of</span> this country is devoted to our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts on the Caspian Sea azerbaijan" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1263967.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  How to get to Azerbaijan </h2><p>  The largest lake in the world washes the country from the east.  It is there that the resorts on the Caspian Sea are located.  Azerbaijan is connected with the Russian Federation by air and ground.  To get to the famous resorts of the country, you must first arrive in Baku, the benefit is that this city is also located on the sea.  Given the distance of two thousand three hundred kilometers between the capitals of Azerbaijan and Russia, the best transport is the plane.  Every day, Aeroflot aircraft depart from Moscow Sheremetyevo-2 (Terminal E) to Baku.  Flights from Domodedovo operate with the same regularity.  They are carried out by S7 and Azerbaijan Airlines.  Three hours in the air - and you are already in Baku. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is not necessary to go to Belokamennaya to go to the <span>resorts of Azerbaijan.</span>  Regular flights fly from Baku to St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.  By train Moscow - Baku the journey will stretch for sixty hours.  To get to the resorts of Azerbaijan by car, you need to go through Dagestan.  You can follow the roundabout route - through Iran.  Then you will find yourself in the southernmost resort of the country - Nakhichevan.  But for such a trip, you should open an Iranian visa.  But in order to enter Azerbaijan, it is enough for a Russian tourist to have only a foreign passport.  These are the requirements of the law. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azerbaijan resorts on the Caspian Sea Lankaran" class="if" height="315" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1263982.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  When to come to the resorts of the Caspian Sea </h2><p>  Azerbaijan lies in the same latitudes as Italy, as well as the French Cote d'Azur.  But, thanks to the continental climate, there is a clearer change of seasons.  Winter is pretty cold here.  There are frosts up to minus 10 degrees.  But the summer is very hot and dry.  The thermometer can sometimes jump up to +40 degrees.  But in the sea resorts, the heat is tempered by the presence of a large amount of water and a fresh breeze.  The best time to visit the country is from April to October.  The swimming season begins on the May holidays, and ends officially at the end of September.  Although some vacationers splash in the sea in April and October. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The nature of Azerbaijan </h2><p>  In this mountainous country, altitudinal zonation is well defined.  Therefore, here you can meet nine of the eleven existing climatic zones in the world.  In Azerbaijan, you can take a mini-journey around the globe, descending from the tundra to the hot and humid subtropics.  Another attraction of the country is oil.  Black gold is not only the backbone <span>of the Azerbaijani economy.</span>  Here, oil has healing qualities.  Many health resorts practice therapeutic wraps of clients in black gold.  Resorts on the Caspian Sea bring considerable income to the country.  Azerbaijan is developing a hotel base and tourism infrastructure.  Old Soviet resorts are being reconstructed according to European standards.  But new ones are being built - literally from scratch.  An example is the Nardaran-Kurdakhan resort.  After completion of construction, this chain of tourist hotels will not be inferior to such untwisted places like Antalya and Dubai. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azerbaijan resorts on the Caspian Sea" class="if" height="386" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1264020.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where to relax in Azerbaijan at sea </h2><p>  The largest lake in the world, which was part of the ancient World Ocean many millions of years ago, washes the country from the east.  The long coastal strip is covered by numerous resorts on the Caspian Sea.  Azerbaijan can provide high-quality beach vacations for all categories of tourists: hungry for entertainment, those who want to heal, with young children, etc. If you want to combine swimming with interesting and interesting excursions, choose the resorts of the Absheron Peninsula.  In its southern part, by the way, is the capital of Azerbaijan.  Baku is the largest city and port not only of the country, but of the entire Caucasus region.  This is a very ancient city.  Its ancient part, lying within the walls, is called the Baku Acropolis.  Among the most visited attractions include the Maiden’s Tower, the Juma Mosque, caravanserais, and the <span>Shirvanshahs Palace.</span>  Baku is known for its vibrant nightlife. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caspian resorts azerbaijan" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1263968.jpg" width="431"></div>

    <h2>  Absheron resorts of the Caspian Sea (Azerbaijan) </h2><p>  Photos advertising a beach holiday in this Transcaucasian country, mainly depict the latest hotels on the front page near the capital.  This area of ​​the Absheron Peninsula is called Greater Baku.  By the way, it lies 28 meters below sea level.  Which resorts near Baku can be recommended to vacationers?  If the price is not paramount for you, the ideal choice would be, according to travelers, the Jumeirah Bilgah Beach Hotel or Sea Breeze.

    <h2>  Type </h2><p>  In the north-east of the country is the city of Khudat.  Not far from it is the unique village of Nabran, where the best medical resorts of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea are located.  Here, hydrogen sulfide springs abound from underground.  But not only these are interesting Nabran.  A relict forest approaches directly to the beach.  Tourists say that in this region there is no shortage of sanatoriums, boarding houses, private hotels and cheap camp sites.  You can recommend "Caspian Sea Resort", "Palm" and the hotel "Atlant".  The resort village, like Baku, is famous for its evening life.  In Nabran there is a water park, a sports complex, excursion bureaus work. </p><h2>  Lankaran </h2><p>  And this city is located in the extreme south of the country's coastal strip, not far from the border with Iran.  Healing springs also hit here, which allowed the creation of medical and beach resorts of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea.  Lankaran arose in the tenth century and for a long time was the capital of an independent khanate.  Therefore, the city has many interesting cultural and historical attractions.  Recently, the local airport was renovated and received international status.  Now you can fly to Lankaran from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Surgut.  Here you can recommend “Kala Hotel 4 *”, “Caucasus Sahil 4” and “Khan Lankoran 3 *”. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea Sumgait" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1263979.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sumgait </h2><p>  This city is young in all respects, built just thirty kilometers from Baku.  Don't be scared that Sumgayit is the recognized center of the country's petrochemical industry.  In recent years, the best resorts of Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea have appeared here.  Sumgait captivates with its beaches.  They are all whitened by the sun, covered with shells worn in sand.  The city has a water park and plenty of entertainment.  With children you need to visit the puppet theater on the water.  There are no historical sights here, but the transport connection with Baku is excellent.  We can say that Sumgait has become a "sleeping area" of the capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Resorts of the Caspian Sea Azerbaijan photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1263972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other resorts </h2><p>  It should be said that Azerbaijanis themselves like to relax not only on the coast, but also in the mountains - in Ganja, Shemakha, Yardimli, Kusara, Cuba and others.  Local vacationers prefer small and quiet resorts of the Caspian Sea (Azerbaijan).  Reviews mention that Siazan, Khachmaz, Khudat and Astara are very popular.  The last resort is a border resort.  The city, in principle, is divided into two parts, the southern of which belongs to Iran.  The Astarachay River flows through the resort.  At this resort, you can recommend the Relax Beach Beachfront Hotel. </p>
