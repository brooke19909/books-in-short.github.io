    <p>  Every year, mobile devices become more sophisticated and hide in their miniature case an increasing number of functions and capabilities.  But not all cell owners are aware of all the features of their phones.  In this article, you will learn what the offline mode of a mobile device is and why it is needed by a regular user. </p><p>  Any mobile device, whether it is a regular phone, communicator or tablet with support for call capabilities, can work in several modes.  If things like the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or ‚Äúsilent‚Äù mode are familiar to almost everyone, then some of the ‚Äústates‚Äù of the cell phone still cause a number of questions for most users.  Relates to them and offline.  Let us finally find out why it is needed and when is it worth (if at all) to turn it on? </p><p>  Offline mode in the phone appeared a few years ago.  Some manufacturers of mobile devices have thus decided to circumvent the problem associated with the use of mobile phones for air travel, since, as is known to many, previously cell phones could not be used during the entire flight, which could last more than ten hours.  The new mode allowed owners to keep their gadget turned on, but limited their access to cellular networks.  Thus, the ‚Äúflight mode‚Äù (from the English ‚Äúfly mode‚Äù) - this is how several manufacturers of mobile devices presented this function - allowed to keep the cell on.  Despite the fact that in this state the phone cannot communicate with the operator‚Äôs network (and, accordingly, you cannot use it for its intended purpose, that is, call), during a long flight the passenger could play games, read and listen to music using your favorite cell.  Over time, the autonomous mode gained wide popularity and on the earth they began to use it much more often than during air travel. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is the reason for such a prevalence of such an unusual regime?  It would seem that the paradox is that using a phone without using it for its intended purpose, but with the development of technology, this was not enough for many users.  And after the stand-alone mode appeared, the cellular one could be used as a digital camera, player, game console or e-book without fearing that someone would distract you from your favorite activity with your annoying calls! </p><p>  But offline has other advantages.  For example, if you find yourself in such an area far from civilization where you can only dream of coverage, your phone will constantly try to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the network, because of which its battery will drain many times faster.  In such places, you can either turn off the mobile altogether, or use the ‚Äúfly mod‚Äù.  When you find yourself closer to civilization again, simply turn off the offline mode and the phone will immediately find the operator‚Äôs network.  This is exactly what experienced tourists usually do, who already know where it is worth keeping the mobile in normal mode, and where it is desirable to save <span>battery power</span> for future conversations. </p><p>  But the autonomous mode also has one undeniable minus.  In some models, when it is turned on, not only the GSM module, but also Wi-Fi, and sometimes GPS also stops working.  This is due to the fact that in such phones and communicators, when this mode is turned on, the phone turns off all radio modules at once.  In fairness, it should be noted that in many models, even in the "fly mode" GPS and Wi-Fi work when you turn it on again. </p><p>  Thus, we can conclude that the autonomous mode is a thing that is necessary not only for fans who often travel by plane, but also for a huge number of ‚Äúdown-to-earth‚Äù users.  The main thing is not to forget to turn off this mode in time, otherwise you can never wait for an important call. </p>
