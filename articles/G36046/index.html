    <h2>  A bit about headphones </h2><p>  The Panasonic RP-HJE125 is a good headphone model that can be purchased for just $ 9.  They are lightweight, sit perfectly in the ears, have a simple and attractive design.  Mostly in demand among students and youth.  This device is designed for those who love cheap, but high-quality devices.  The manufacturer has long established itself on the good side, so there are no complaints from consumers.  All headphones fully meet the expectations of potential buyers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Often, cheap models of any manufacturers are not pleased with their sound and durability, but this does not apply to the Panasonic RP-HJE125.  Some people, having heard the quality of playback, suggest that the price of the device is many times higher.  The bass is impressive, not blurry, the high frequencies sound good, and the middle ones are quite balanced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="inexpensive headphones" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1528330.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Headphone Benefits </h2><p>  Before you buy headphones, you must definitely familiarize yourself with their pros and cons.  This device has many more good sides. </p><ul><li>  The small price will please any consumer. </li><li>  The device has a fairly good sound, which in this category is a gift.  Often in reviews, people say that if you close your eyes and dream, you can fully imagine that there are vacuum cleaners in your ears for $ 20- $ 30. </li><li>  The frequency range is impressive, because it deviates from the standard: from 10,000 to 24,000 Hz. </li><li>  The bass is saturated, the sound is not distorted, it is clear and surround. </li><li>  Soundproofing will please anyone.  Of course, for such headphones, this aspect is familiar, but the fact that you will not hear extraneous sounds on the street is a definite plus. </li><li>  About two years they will serve their master Panasonic RP-HJE125.  Reviews confirm this. </li><li>  In the ears, the headphones sit quite well, comfortably.  Suitable for use during sports, as they do not fall out. </li><li>  The design, although simple, still attracts the attention of consumers.  The color range is quite large.  There are green, red, black, white headphones that look surprisingly interesting. </li><li>  The model is made of plastic that can withstand mechanical stress.  At first, the wire seems flimsy and thin to everyone, but after several months of careless use (and the headphones are tied into a knot quite easily), this feeling disappears without a trace.  It should be noted, it is the last thing that can break in this device.  Thanks to the L-shaped plug, the wire easily withstands bending. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panasonic rp hje125 reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1528332.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Device disadvantages </h2><p>  Like any device, the Panasonic RP-HJE125, a review of which will help determine the choice, has its drawbacks.  There are only two of them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  Short cord (1 meter).  For standard headphones, this is not enough.  However, as a rule, they are used in conjunction with a pocket player or smartphone, so this drawback is not always evident. </li><li>  Low volume  This minus is individual and completely depends on the preferences of the buyer.  Those who like to listen at a deafening volume, these headphones are definitely not suitable for that. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Consumers do not find flaws in Panasonic RP-HJE125 headphones.  Very rare claims are that the plug may come off and the wire may be tangled.  The first happens infrequently and, most likely, is a factory marriage. </p><p>  Buyers value headphones for their good sound.  Almost every review is filled with impressions of the reproduction.  Design and convenience occupy a special place, because all this is at a high level.  Consumers mark assembly and good materials separately.  They allow the headphones to last a long time.  Conveniently called ear pads.  Rarely, the question arises of the cessation of the operation of one earphone, which is undoubtedly pleasing.  The kit includes three interchangeable elastic bands of different sizes.  Among them, exactly everyone will find the right option.  Stores provide an average of one year warranty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panasonic rp hje125 review" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1528334.jpg" width="600"></div>
