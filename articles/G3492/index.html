    <p>  The first mention of poker dates back to the 16th century.  This game originated in Europe.  In those days, poker rules were a bit different.  But over time, they changed until they came to a modern look.  The first mentions of the modern version, which were certified in writing, appeared back in 1829, in the memoirs of the popular actor Joe Cowell.  Five years later, in 1834, a poker deck consisting of 52 cards began to be used in poker.  In the future, the rules of the game have not undergone significant changes.  Despite the fact that the rules of the game constantly varied, the essence remained the same.  Victory always depended on the presence of a particular poker hand. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now we will discuss the basic rules of poker for beginners, <span>poker combinations.</span>  After reading this article, you will get basic concepts that will help while playing hold'em. </p><h2>  How to play poker?

In it, we will consider the most important poker rules for beginners.  Towards the end, we will also talk about the main combinations.  Want to learn <span>how to play poker?</span>  <span>The rules of the game are</span> pretty simple.  At the table there are several participants (from two and, as a rule, up to ten).  The game itself begins with the distribution of cards.  The rules of distribution in poker are quite simple.  The player who deals cards is called the dealer (in online poker, the letter D is next to him).  After the end of the distribution, the dealer’s rank moves to the next player clockwise. 
      <br>

      <p></p>
    <p>  After the distribution, the first bets begin.  This stage of the game is called preflop.  Two players sitting at the dealer make automatic bets, which are called the small (MB) and the big blind (BB), respectively.  BB is twice as large as MB.  Next, the move goes to the next.  He, in turn, can perform one of the actions, which we will discuss below. </p><h2>  Poker action </h2><p>  If no one has raised the bet in the current round, then the player can say “check”.  After using this action, the move proceeds to the next player clockwise.  Typically, a “check” means that the player has no desire to raise the bet.  Most likely, he has a weak or unfinished hand. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The "bet" action can be used if no one raised the bet during the current round.  That is, if all previous players said “check”.  Using the action "bet", the player raises the bet by a given amount.  “Bet” is used to show the presence of a good combination on hand.  This function is also used for bluffing. </p><p>  “Pass” (“fold”) means the player’s refusal to fight for the bank.  Anyone who says “pass” has the right not to bet in the current hand.  However, he cannot win either.  As a rule, “fold” is used if the player has a bad, weak hand or combination. </p><p>  “Call” is used if one of the previous players raised the bet (said “bet”).  “Call” means that the player maintains the bet of the previous player and deposits the same amount of money into the common bank.  If the player said “call”, then there are two outcomes.  Either he has a good, competitive hand, which can develop into a strong combination, or he is bluffing. </p><p>  A raise can be used if one of the previous players said “bet.”  “Raise” means that the player not only supports the previous bet, but also makes an additional amount of money.  “Raise” means that the player has a powerful combination, or is he just trying to intimidate opponents to say “fold”. </p><h2>  Flop </h2>

    <p>  When the players are even in the bets, the preflop stage ends and the flop begins.  The flop is the stage when three cards are laid out on the table.  Thanks to this, players can soberly assess their chances, suggest possible combinations.  A new round of trading begins, which is no different from the previous one.  The player can also raise, equalize, support the bet or just save. </p><h2>  Turn </h2><p>  The turn is the period when the fourth card is revealed.  Thanks to this, the picture at the table becomes much clearer.  Players are clearly aware of their chances of winning.  The penultimate trade begins.  As a rule, it is at this stage of the game that the first bluffs begin. </p><h2>  River </h2><p>  The river is called the stage of the game, when the last, fifth card is laid out on the table.  Players see their final combinations.  The last round of betting begins.  During the river, players begin to actively bluff and intimidate opponents in order to pick up the pot without opening. </p><h2>  Showdown </h2>

    <p>  The essence of this stage is that players who remain at the table after the final round of betting show their cards.  The bank is taken by the one with the strongest card combination.  If two players managed to collect equally strong combinations, then in this case the bank is equally divided between them. </p><h2>  The rules of poker for beginners.

Knowing them, you can soberly assess your chances of winning, find out the potential strength of your hand.
