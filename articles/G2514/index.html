    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Samsung A7 received positive reviews primarily due to its attractive body made of metal.  The material that covered the metal base became a small aesthetic minus, which is why the surface of the smartphone feels like an ordinary plastic.  The following colors for Samsung A7 are available: gold, silver, white, turquoise, black and pink.  The case cannot be opened, so users will not be able to independently <span>replace the battery.</span> </p><p>  More than 70 percent of the front panel of the Samsung Galaxy A7 occupies a large screen.  Above it are motion sensors and a light indicator, a front camera and a speaker for conversations.  Under the screen, there are three main control keys: one physical and two touch keys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A volume rocker is placed on the left side of the device, on the right there is a button for turning the device on and off, as well as two slots for various cards hidden by special plugs.  The latter have a small round hole that opens only with a special key.  His loss will force the owner to use his wit and use, as a key, say, an open paper clip.  In general, this can cause some discomfort, because you cannot open the plug with your fingernail.  One of the slots is designed exclusively for a SIM card, the second accepts both SIM cards and memory cards, and this is another drawback.  The simultaneous use of two SIM cards and a memory card on the Samsung Galaxy A7 is physically impossible, so you have to choose what is more important - the ability to use the services of two operators at the same time or expand the memory of the smartphone. </p><p>  At the bottom of the model, the developers adapted a microphone, a 3.5 mm headset jack and a micro-USB jack.  The upper one was limited to a second microphone.  The back panel of the device has a main camera, an LED flash and a music speaker. </p>

    <p>  Overall dimensions of the device: 151 x 76.2 <span>x 6.3</span> mm, weight - 141 grams.  These data suggest a comfortable use of the device, which is convenient to store in your pocket or bag, so the ‚ÄúA7‚Äù is perfect for both men and women. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  Samsung A7 also earned positive reviews due to its excellent 5.5-inch display.  In the process of its creation, Super AMOLED technology was used, which allows achieving the highest quality image.  In addition to the advanced matrix, the resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels FHD is responsible for the stunning picture. </p><p>  The color rendering of the smartphone shows clear and rich colors.  In the brightness settings, you can adjust the picture: from saturated to natural colors.  Good viewing angles are also impressive: when viewed from the side, the information is viewed quite normally, and the font is not distorted.  The color does not fade in direct sunlight, which is why users will not have any problems using the device in clear weather. </p><p>  ‚ÄúSamsung A7‚Äù, whose screen characteristics are amazing, will allow you to fully enjoy the image by running a video, movie or high-quality game.  The picture will pleasantly surprise you with its realism.  It is especially interesting to observe what is happening in 3D games: the detail of drawing graphics, bright colors, voluminous models and impressive special effects will not let you tear yourself away from the screen for a long time. </p>

    <h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  As for the hardware, then the smartphone looks quite decent.  On board the device is an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor: 4 cores operate at a frequency of 1500 MHz, and 4 at a frequency of 1000 MHz.  To match the processor, 2 GB of RAM are installed, which allow pretty quick processing of information.  As a video processor, the Mali-T628 MP6 was chosen, doing an excellent job.  For data storage, 16 GB of memory is provided on the hard drive, it is expandable using microSD memory cards up to 64 GB.  The gadget runs on the Android 4.4.4 platform.  Among the communication capabilities there are Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 2.0, there is also NFC technology and support for LTE networks. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The technical component of Samsung A7 (the instruction is supplied with the device) is not satisfactory: the smartphone is quite fast, has good results when tested in the AnTuTu program, supports multitasking and does not slow down.  Unfortunately, no matter how impressive the hardware may look, it cannot be compared with models from the top device category.  The test is still in the same AnTuTu leaves the ‚ÄúA7‚Äù behind more eminent and expensive competitors.  But this fact should not be very depressing, since the device places more emphasis on the image component and is presented primarily as a stylish and <span>fashionable device,</span> and not as a super-productive portable computer.  But even in spite of the not very advanced stuffing, there are practically no cases where the Samsung A7 would freeze, so it is quite possible to use this device as a full-fledged handheld computer. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Samsung A7, the price of which is due not only to the stylish case and bright display, also has good optics.  The main camera is capable of taking pictures with a resolution of 13 megapixels in wide angle format.  This is a nice feature, because this option allows you to take a photo of, for example, a large company, while you can capture the maximum distance.  In the light of day, the pictures come out magnificent.  They can be deployed on a large screen, say, on a monitor or TV: graininess is practically absent, and thanks to the almost perfect color rendering, the photos look very presentable. </p><p>  Pictures taken at night or in a dark room are much inferior in quality.  Still, this is not a ‚Äúcamera phone‚Äù, and the flash here is just an LED light bulb, which is not capable of realizing full illumination.  But you can‚Äôt say that in the dark photos come out really bad.  However, it is recommended to give preference to daytime photography or take photographs in a room with plenty of light. </p><p>  The front camera can only take pictures in a resolution of 5 megapixels, but they are also obtained in a wide format, and their quality is slightly inferior to that of photos taken on the main camera. </p><p>  The developers have installed many interesting and different functions to achieve interesting effects.  Among the options there are: "Night", "Gif-animation", "Panorama", "Change resolution", "Auto-selfie" and much more.  You can take a picture of yourself without even pressing any keys: just set the automatic selfie mode, put the phone to your head, and the camera will capture the image.  You can set the voice mode, which is also a very convenient feature, since during selfie shooting it is not very convenient to press any keys on the smartphone or its screen. </p><p>  It is worth saying a few words about the video shooting in the Samsung A7 model.  The camera features remarkable 1920 x 1080 resolution and 30 frames per second.  It should be noted that, although the video comes out very bright and clear, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãimperfectly implemented.  There are also problems with autofocus.  Automation is very poorly rebuilt independently from distant objects to near ones, so you have to stabilize the picture with a touch. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  Although the speaker looks rather small, the sound it produces is quite loud.  Incoming calls, tunes in the player or clips in films sound loud and clear.  But the traditional problem of the speakers located on the back sides of smartphones remains to this day: if the device lies on any surface, then the sound hole is clamped, so the melody becomes several times quieter - this is a risk of missing an important call.  The smartphone is quite capable of replacing the mp3 player: if you buy good headphones, then the sound will turn out to be very high quality.  Among the options are automatic and manual adjustment of the <span>equalizer,</span> bass <span>settings</span> , creating a playlist and more.  Using a headset, playing games or watching a movie becomes much more interesting because of special effects that allow you to achieve a more attractive and realistic sound. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Today, there is not much software that the hardware of such a device as Samsung A7 could not handle.  The review showed that the system works quite well with many resource-intensive applications and advanced toys. </p>

    <p>  Traveling on the Internet will give fans of the World Wide Web a real pleasure.  Pages are processed very quickly, and there will be no problems downloading content or finding satellites for a GPS navigator. </p><h2>  Games </h2><p>  Thanks to advanced image transfer technologies, good resolution and large display sizes, spending time playing games on the A7 is even more pleasant.  The filling of the model launches the majority of complex and resource-demanding toys.  A rich picture and realistic sound effects, which can be achieved using a high-quality headset, turn any game into an exciting adventure. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery for the device is set quite modest, only 2600 mAh.  This is too little for Samsung A7: the characteristics of the screen and system are very decent, therefore, the battery should be a match for them.  As mentioned earlier, replacing the battery will not work.  With moderate use, the smartphone will "live" for about two days.  A decrease in brightness can slightly increase this period. </p><p>  To increase the period of working capacity, the phone has the function of energy-saving mode.  When it is activated, the bright screen palette acquires nondescript gray shades, which allows you to extend battery life.  Nevertheless, for such a device, the battery needs at least 3000 mAh.  Naturally, the intensive use of applications, the active viewing of videos and games at maximum brightness will ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the battery very quickly.  The developers say that the life of the device when starting a video with maximum sound is 9 hours.  In fact, this figure is slightly less - about 8 hours. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Before us is a stylish device in a metal case with a large high-quality screen, good optics and decent technical characteristics.  Thanks to the excellent design, the device is convenient to carry, and multi-colored design options will allow everyone to choose a device to taste.  It will also turn out to pick up an excellent cover for "Samsung A7".  In addition to the elegant appearance, I was pleased with a very high-quality screen of the model, showing an amazing picture.  The camera also turned out to be very good, but only the autofocus operation leaves much to be desired.  Specifications have become somewhat better when comparing Samsung A5 and A7.  Now users have access to even more high-quality games and advanced software. </p><p>  Of the minuses, we distinguish a weak battery, all the same unstable autofocus and the inability to run on a smartphone simultaneously 2 SIM cards and a memory card. </p><p>  Samsung A7, the price of which starts at about 22,000 rubles, proved to be an elegant, moderately powerful device with a large bright display.  Of course, there are many competitors in the market with telephones in a similar price category, which are worth paying attention to, but A7 is a very worthy opponent for them. </p><h2>  Reviews  Samsung A7: Pros and Cons </h2><p>  The design of the device impressed most users.  He liked the various colors of the case, style and small thickness.  The smartphone is convenient to carry, and although it looks quite large, the gadget is quite suitable even for a female audience.  It‚Äôs also easy to pick up a case for the Samsung A7. </p><p>  Demanding hardware users did not have the best impressions regarding performance.  They believe that the smartphone is clearly not intended for advanced games and applications.  Also, the speed of information processing leaves much to be desired - the weak processor and only 2 GB of RAM are to blame. </p><p>  Other users claim the opposite: everything that is set starts up perfectly.  It was also noted that the device quickly catches satellites and works well as a GPS navigator. </p><p>  There are other reviews: Samsung A7 received too weak a battery.  The energy saving mode corrects the situation somewhat.  In general, the owners agreed that the device requires a more resource-intensive battery. </p><p>  Some believe that the price-performance ratio is not quite correctly established.  Owners consider the amount somewhat overpriced for the device, although fashionable, but, in their opinion, with fairly modest technical indicators that do not allow the device to be used as comfortably as possible. </p>

    <p>  A single case of a problem with calls was noted: the screen went out during the dialing process.  After that, the gadget stopped working normally, and it needed to be replaced. </p><p>  Most liked the solid camera, capable of taking great pictures with both the main optics and the front.  The possibility of wide-angle shooting and an abundance of self-portrait modes impressed many mobile photo lovers.  We were pleased with the clear and vivid video recording with good frame processing.  Other optical functions, such as voice control, were also noted. </p><p>  The saturated Samsung A7 screen, whose characteristics were up to the mark, impressed all owners.  Color reproduction, viewing angles, brightness - all, according to users, are five points here.  Good work was noted under the sun's rays: if the information on the display fades, it is very slightly, and it quite turns out to be sorted. </p><p>  No one had any problems with sound and player.  Loud speakers: both spoken and musical - perfectly reproduce voices and melodies.  The player pleased with a large number of functions and high-quality reproduction of songs through the headset. </p><p>  The owners were dissatisfied with the following nuance in Samsung A7: a SIM card with a flash drive can work only one, since the connector for the second SIM card is also a microSD slot. </p>
