Surely even the most curious tourists who prefer European countries, will not give up the opportunity to be on the coast, get a beautiful even tan and swim in the warm and gentle sea.  India is considered a third world country, but despite this, the small Indian state of Goa is becoming more and more popular every year.  This is a paradise on the coast of the Arabian Sea. </p><p>  Goa is a great option for those who are planning their holidays in the cold season.  The season here lasts from October to May, at which time the air temperature rises to 30 degrees, sometimes higher.  But many tourists do even without air conditioning in the room, and all because the sea is pleasantly cool.  At other times of the year, relaxation can hardly be called comfortable, because the air temperature rises even higher, even in the shade reaching 45-50 degrees, and being on the beach is simply unbearable.  Therefore, if you are planning a vacation in the summer, it is better to pay attention to other areas.  In general, exotic, contrasts, gorgeous beaches, a clear sea and excellent opportunities for organizing leisure are intertwined in Goa.  You can relate differently to India and its resorts, but it is better to visit it once and make your own opinion. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  Exotic resort manifests itself in everything - not only in customs, traditions, but also in hotels.  Like most other Asian resorts, Goa offers a variety of options - from the most luxurious to terrifying.  That is why all tourists should be extremely careful and careful in choosing a hotel: there is a great risk of falling into terrible conditions and ruining your entire vacation.  Even if you plan to stay at the hotel only at night, you as a tourist need at least comfortable furniture and a separate bathroom with hot water.  We offer an objective review of the Jose Holiday Home 2 * hotel and find out how suitable it is for relaxation.  We will evaluate the condition of rooms, furniture, hotel territory and its location. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The southern part of Goa is ideal for a quiet and relaxing holiday.  It is here that people who value comfort prefer to relax, and all because the best hotels of the coast are located here.  Cozy bungalows surrounded by majestic palm trees, white sand and the gentle sea - all this creates the conditions for a truly paradise holiday.  So, Jose Holiday Home 2 * is just located in the southern part of the resort, due to which it attracts tourists from different parts of the globe.  Of course, the "stardom" of the hotel confuses many.  Surely you, as a tourist, would like to know why a seemingly good hotel was not awarded the highest rating.  There are not so many reviews about him, but even this information is quite enough to evaluate it from all sides. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Due to the fact that the hotel was opened in 1995, many consider it really old.  But everything is not so bad, as many tourists suggest, because the institution boasts an excellent location.  Just a few hundred meters - and you are on the beach.  That is what many people are attracted to by Jose Holiday Home 2 *.  Its description emphasizes the proximity to the entertainment of the resort, as well as shops, bars and restaurants.  Moreover, it is not far from the railway station and airport from here, so you do not have to spend time on the road.  Note!  The hotel is located along a busy street, so in the evening it is quite noisy and crowded. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  All vacationers can stay in a cozy guest room or suite.  A private bathroom, air conditioning or a fan, a TV with satellite channels - these are the conditions that Jose Holiday Home 2 * offers its guests.  Reviews of real tourists emphasize that the rooms are quite spacious and bright, equipped with everything necessary for a good rest. </p>

    <p>  Each room has a balcony with stunning views of the resort.  The windows of some rooms are facing the coast, so tourists have a unique opportunity to admire the gorgeous sunsets and meet the sunrises, enjoy the sound of the surf.  Each room has a large double bed, bedside tables, a table with a mirror, 4 comfortable armchairs on the balcony.  Some tourists consider it a drawback to have a double bed, since it is far from always convenient to sleep together, but you can even get used to it.  The condition of the plumbing is in good condition, there are no interruptions in the supply of hot water.  The only drawback, perhaps, is the lack of soap in the bathroom, but most tourists use their own cosmetics, so there should be no problems.  In a word, all the conditions necessary for a comfortable stay are created in the Jose Holiday Home 2 * hotel.  The description of the hotel could not but touch upon the question of the state of technology.  Yes, of course, in some rooms there may be problems with the air conditioner, TV, but, according to the guests, all breakdowns are eliminated by the administration as soon as possible. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The furniture is not new, which is understandable given the history of the hotel, but this does not in the least prevent it from remaining comfortable and functional.  But the isolation in the rooms is disgusting, or rather, it is simply absent - tourists hear everything that happens in the next room.  Of course, this creates a certain discomfort, but if you come to the hotel just to spend the night, there should not be any inconvenience.  Do not leave food in the rooms: even small crumbs will provoke an invasion of ants, which will be quite difficult to get rid of. </p>

    <h2>  Population </h2><p>  Of course, as in the case with other hotels, there are certain rules for check-in and eviction in Jose Holiday Home 2 *.  Reviews of tourists emphasize that check-in is quite fast, even if guests arrive earlier than the deadline.  If the room is not ready by this time, tourists will be offered to sit in a comfortable lobby and wait for the keys there.  If necessary, all vacationers can use a luggage storage room, and this service is completely free. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  According to the guests, rooms are cleaned daily, even if tourists do not leave the room key at the reception.  The staff responsibly approaches their duties, wipes the floor, furniture, plumbing, which creates a much-needed feeling of cleanliness and freshness on vacation.  Towels and bed linen are changed as needed.  Tipping is optional in Goa, but welcome if tourists consider it necessary. </p>

    <p>  The service staff is friendly, helpful and polite.  In Jose Holiday Home 2 * services are presented in a sufficient assortment.

They are typical of Asian resorts.  Most often these are scrambled eggs or omelettes, sausages, cold cuts of meat and cheese, toasts with butter and jam, boiled eggs, coffee, tea and freshly squeezed juices.  Not as diverse as in Turkey and Egypt, but none of the tourists will certainly remain hungry.  But you can have lunch and dinner at local restaurants and bars - there are plenty of them.

In fact, Goa is a great opportunity to get acquainted with exotic Asian cuisine. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Territory </h2><p>  The time has come to talk about the territory of the hotel Jose Holiday Home 2 *.  Photos taken by tourists and a description of the hotel confirm that it is deprived of its territory.  The hotel is built along the main street of the village.  There is no pool either.  You are waiting for a city-style hotel, represented by a single building with private rooms and a information desk.  However, this is not such a hindrance to rest.  Tourists coming to Goa are unlikely to stay in the room, they are likely to spend all their free time on the coast, so the lack of a huge surrounding area and pool should not be classified as a huge disadvantage. </p><h2>  Beach and sea </h2><p>  To the sea from the hotel only 5-7 minutes, so the lack of a swimming pool on site does not bother vacationers.  The beach here is large, even during the season there are not too many people, so the atmosphere is calm and peaceful.  All vacationers in Jose Holiday Home 2 * will be able to fully enjoy the silence, pleasant coolness and admire the beauties of the resort.  The sea is clean, with a gentle entry into the water - all that beach lovers need.  You can rent a motorbike and go around the entire coast - here you will find a lot of chic places far from human eyes. </p>

    <p>  The beach is equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, here you can rent sports equipment, go diving, go on a luxury yacht to the open sea.  As for nutrition.  Here you can buy soft drinks, local dishes and fully enjoy a beach holiday. </p><p>  The use of sunscreens with a high protection factor is mandatory on the beach - this is the only way to protect yourself from the scorching sun and get a beautiful even tan. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Jose Holiday Home Hotel 2 * (India, south of Goa) was created for those who want to fully enjoy the sun, sandy beach, warm and gentle sea, as well as get a lot of bright and positive emotions from relaxation.  Of course, not everything is so perfect here, there are drawbacks.  But the main thing is to learn about them early in order to prepare and not to encounter unpleasant surprises upon arrival at the resort.  In general, the hotel is not bad for living, so we recommend paying special attention to it, especially if you are looking for an inexpensive option. </p>
