Thanks to the dune, forming a beach of white sand, it has another name - the Siberian Riviera.  And thanks to the fabulous nature and mild climate, this paradise place attracts millions of tourists from all over the planet. </p><h2>  Location Sandy </h2><p>  Peschanaya Bay (Baikal) is one of the most delightful and unusual corners of Eastern Siberia.  In the form of a sandy slope covered with <span>pine forest,</span> it gradually descends to the water.  The silence of this amazing place, like two sisters, is protected by rocks - the Big and Small Belfries. </p>

On the north side of it is the village of Bolshoy Goloustnoye, and on the south - the village of Buguldeika.  The closest station and airport are present in the city of Irkutsk at a distance of one hundred and fifty kilometers.

    <h2>  Favorable climatic conditions </h2><p>  Peschanaya Bay (Baikal), among other things, is also the warmest place in Eastern Siberia.  Here prevails a mild microclimate with a considerable number of sunny days per year, as well as in the resorts of the Black Sea coast.  The average annual temperature in the bay is four degrees above zero, while in Irkutsk it is nine degrees below zero.  In summer, there is generally heat.  The air temperature reaches thirty degrees above zero, and the water warms up to twenty-two degrees, becoming as comfortable as possible for swimming.  However, the most favorable for visiting this paradise are July, August and March. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Lighthouse on the rocks </h2><p>  Peschanaya Bay (Baikal) is framed by rocks in the form of pyramids - the Big Bell Tower, with a height of eighty meters above the lake, and the Small Bell Tower with sixty meters in height. </p>

A wooden staircase led to it, moving closer to the top into a vertical metal one.  On the right side was a gutter made of wood, with which acetylene cylinders rose.  Before that, simple kerosene lights were used here.  They were ignited and extinguished by hand, for which it was necessary to go upstairs twice with long stairs.

    <p>  In the early 90s, after the destruction of the lighthouse, the administration of the tourist base transformed the neighborhood.  And for the sake of preventing the desire of vacationers to climb to the top of the cliff, the dilapidated and dangerous stairs were removed. </p><h2>  Local Attractions </h2><p>  Eastern Siberia is famous for its beautiful open spaces.  Peschanaya Bay (Baikal) also belongs to them.  On the map of the Russian Federation, this place is quite noticeable. </p><p>  Sandy is perhaps the only area on the Baikal coast, where there is a huge accumulation of stilted trees that have laid bare their roots.  These powerful giants mainly grow on sandy slopes from the north side of the bay.  Both wind and water constantly remove sandy soil from under their strong roots.  Century-old larch and pine with twisted crowns majestically rise above the surface of the earth.  Between the roots of these dancing trees, a person in his entire height can freely become. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

Transport regularly goes to him.  There are three ways to get to the necessary point on the coast of the lake.  The first is rail transport - trains and trains.  The second is to get to the bus station, which provides the movement of buses and fixed-route taxis.  And the third is the movement on yachts and motor ships provided by the Rocket berth.

    <p>  If you get by water to Peschanaya from the quite famous resort village of Listvyanka (located eighty kilometers from the bay), then the journey time by boat will be four and a half hours, and by boat about two hours.  And this is not the only way.  The bay can also be reached by land, starting the route from the Small Goloustnoye.  The length of this route will be about forty-five kilometers, before Baikal appears before the traveler.  Peschanaya Bay, a photo of which everyone is trying to capture as a keepsake, will show its beauty only after overcoming a difficult route.  It has a considerable number of fords through streams, windbreaks and swamps. </p><p>  In winter, a winter road is laid out to the Peschanaya from the village of Bolshoi Goloustnoye on the ice of Lake Baikal, the length of which is thirty-five kilometers. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baikal, Peschanaya Bay, photo" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19285/457681.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Rest in Sandy </h2><p>  In the summer, everyone tries to spend time unforgettably.  Namely, this will be the rest on Lake Baikal.  Peschanaya Bay, bewitching with its stunning landscapes, will not leave indifferent any tourist.  Here you can sunbathe on the white sand beaches, swim or just go fishing, get carried away with pictures of colorful water, stroll along unusual mountains or along the coast.  Of course, kayaking or boats to the coastal grottoes, as well as boat trips, will be fascinating.  Not far from the bay, near the Shumilikha River, you can admire the cascade of picturesque waterfalls as much as you like. </p>
