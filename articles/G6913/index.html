But the peninsula of Crimea is most famous for its health resorts.  One of the best tourists call the hotel "TPP-hotel."  Evpatoria (the city where it is located) has long been considered the most attractive resort on the western tip of Crimea.  It has excellent climatic conditions, wonderful beaches, interesting sights, rich infrastructure.  It‚Äôs good to rest in Yevpatoriya at any time of the year, and TES-hotel makes staying at the resort as comfortable and memorable as possible.  We suggest you take a small virtual walk through this wonderful health resort.  I would like to note that a hotel with the same name - ‚ÄúTES-hotel‚Äù is also located near the city of Simferopol, in the village of Gresovsky.  It is located on Evpatoria Street, but has nothing to do with the complex described in the article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  Evpatoria is located in the western part of Crimea, 65 km from Simferopol, 109 km from Sevastopol, 1500 km from Moscow.  In the new district of the city, just 400 meters from the sea, a modern ‚ÄúTPP-hotel‚Äù (Yevpatoriya) was erected.  His address is easy to remember: Pushkin Street, building 16a.  Its location is convenient for relaxation both in winter and in summer.  The beach from the hotel is literally 10 minutes walk with a walking step along the shady city streets.  Within a radius of about 500 meters from the health resort there are several green areas where adults are pleased to relax on a bench surrounded by flowers, and children have fun on the rides.  These are the squares of Kirov and Gogol, Duvanovsky Park with the theater named after them.  Pushkin, the garden to them.  V.I. Lenin, as well as the famous Yevpatoriya Arboretum.  Tourists resting at the TES-Hotel note that a tram stop is located two minutes from its gate.  This makes it possible without problems and very inexpensively (the ticket price is only 13 rubles) to travel to many areas of the city, get to the port, dolphinarium, Lenin Central Park, to Maynak Lake and to many other attractions of Yevpatoriya.  In addition to the tram on Pushkin Street, a couple of steps from the hotel, there is a bus stop number 9, and a five-minute walk on Lenin Avenue - stops of several city buses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel TPP hotel Evpatoria" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1737161.jpg" width="503"></div>
