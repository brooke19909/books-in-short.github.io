A popular holiday destination with fabulous palaces, oriental bazaars, variegated streets attracts travelers from around the world.  Enchanting Arabian magic, comfortable beach holidays, many city attractions and picturesque landscapes leave no one indifferent. </p><p>  Agadir is one of the main tourist centers located on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.  In 120 kilometers from it, in the valley of Sousse-Massa, there is a secluded beach "Legzira", which is especially loved by guests of the original country.  A kilometer-long section of the coast is located far from settlements, and it is easiest to get to it by rented car or bus. </p><h2>  Legzira beach </h2><p>  The unique miraculous landmark is fenced with arches of bright orange cliffs, and natural architecture delights everyone who first encounters stone arches descending directly into the raging ocean.  Amazing landscapes resembling the landscape of an alien planet look amazing at sunrise and sunset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="arch on the beach of legzira in morocco" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1524886.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A wide strip of golden sand stretched between the gigantic cliffs and the swaying ocean.  Slowly walking tourists seem to fall into a different dimension, and it seems that it was here that millions of years ago life was born on our planet.  The pristine beauty of a secluded corner delights and makes you forget about everything except the surrounding divine nature. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The unique beauty of a deserted corner </h2><p>  Legzira Beach is a very quiet place where crowds of curious vacationers do not roam: only fishermen living in the mountains, living in tents by the ocean, surfers and the small staff of several hotels located on the coast will meet on the way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Legzira Beach Photos" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1525002.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In the morning there is practically no one here, and by noon several buses with foreign tourists arrive.  Of course, people rush to admire incredible landscapes here, and even the most demanding guests will be shocked by the sight seen. </p><p>  The beach, whose fame is growing every year, offers incredible views of the stretching azure expanse and the dome of the sky merging with the majestic ocean with smoothly flying clouds of air. </p><h2>  The main attractions of the beach </h2><p>  The path to the beach, located away from noisy hotels, lies along winding roads, but its main attractions can be reached in half an hour.  For several millennia, sea tides, salty water, and violent winds honed from clay and sand fancy terracotta-colored arches resembling gigantic animals.  They owe their appearance to the ocean, whose waves washed away the giant rocks, and each guest is amazed at the power of their creator.  This destructive process continues now. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Legzira Beach" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1524937.jpg" width="585"></div>

The height of the opening is 20 meters, and during strong tides it is flooded.  A little distance away is the famous arch on the beach "Legzira", in which Mother Nature has invested all her artistic talent and love.  She is smaller than the first and looks much more elegant.  Towards evening, when the quivering sun rays penetrate it for the last time, it seems that the arch, similar to the leg of a huge elephant tasting water in the ocean, is filled with magic light. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone arch on the beach of legzira" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1524859.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Behind her is the third, the smallest of the openings. </p><p>  These works of art produce the proper effect on connoisseurs of natural beauty.  It is impossible to convey the whole gamut of feelings that embrace travelers at the sight of fabulously beautiful arches.  Sunlight creates textured shadows in the morning and in the evening, and from certain angles you can see images of people and animals in the sandy vaults. </p><h2>  Quiet place for relaxation </h2><p>  You can swim here, but a very strong surf, underwater currents and rocks make swimming unsafe, so you should be careful.  The beach "Legzira" with a strong surf was chosen by surfers who come here from different parts of the world.  This is a very quiet and peaceful place without noisy companies and picnics, it was created so that a person would be alone with nature and feel its unique beauty. </p><p>  According to vacationers, the best time for walking is the evening when a tired sun sets in the ocean, painting rocky cliffs in a warm golden color, fantastically looking against the icy blue of the Atlantic Ocean.  Indeed, these landscapes are fascinating and look like the surface of an alien civilization. </p><h2>  How to get and where to stay </h2><p>  Legzira Beach, whose photo will be a true decoration of any album, is located in the south-west of Morocco, and you can get to it by sightseeing bus, operating from Agadir to Sidi Ifni, a small village next to a natural monument.  Those who want to relax alone can hire a taxi, which will take you to the right place, and overnight will provide cozy hotels on the coast, snuggling tightly against each other.  Tourists staying here want to enjoy the fabulous views of dawn and sunset. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous arch on the beach of legzira" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1524879.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If it is not possible to spend the night in a hotel, then no one forbids to pitch a tent by the ocean to fall asleep and wake up to the insinuating whisper of waves telling about the secrets of being.  The air temperature allows you to feel comfortable even at night, when an amazing panorama of the starry sky opens, and a breeze gently caressing the skin takes away all the problems. </p><p>  Making an independent trip by car, there is a risk of missing the desired turn, not marked on the maps, and you will have to loop for a long time along the road leading to the ocean.  In case of problems, the locals will show the way to the beach "Legzira" for a low fee. </p><p>  There is no cellular connection, the electricity that is generated from hotel generators appears for several hours in the evening, hot water is often absent, but these are all trifles compared to the amazing landscapes that open to vacationers. </p><h2>  "Elephant Arch" is gone forever </h2><p>  Unfortunately, nature, which created unique sculptures, completed work and destroyed its creation in September of this year.  The admirable arch on the Lezira beach in Morocco collapsed under the influence of water, and now in its place tourists observe only piles of sand.  Back in March, the local attraction was seriously damaged: a piece broke off from it, and a deep crack formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Legzira Beach Morocco Photo" class="if" height="464" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1525031.jpg" width="463"></div>

    <h2>  Authorities fear </h2><p>  The first opening, the tallest, survived, but the stone arch on the Legzira beach, resembling an elephant‚Äôs foot, collapsed.  Local authorities believe that the flow of tourists to an exotic country will decrease, and experts agree with their fears: the disappearance of the natural monument will negatively affect the development of tourism.  After the threat of terrorism, the state faced a significant decline in the flow of travelers, and now, having lost its main <span>attraction, Morocco</span> risks losing even more foreign visitors. </p><p>  Located in the country of the scorching sun, Lezira Beach (Morocco), whose photo will tell more than a thousand words, is infinitely beautiful, and we hope that the destruction of one arch will not affect the number of tourists looking for a place to relax next year. </p>
