In order to perform their functions and in connection with the anatomical features of the location, these organs are divided into a lacrimal and lacrimal secretory apparatus.  The secret that stands out contains enzymes that not only moisturize the cornea, but also protect it from inflammation.  When blinking, tear fluid is evenly distributed over the surface. </p><p>  The lacrimal glands that secrete a watery secretion containing a potent antibacterial substance such as lysozyme are located in the recesses of the orbit bones above the outer edge of the eye.  Their length is approximately 2 centimeters, and they are very similar to <span>almonds.</span>  The lacrimal glands consist of two parts: the orbital (upper) and palperbial (lower), which are divided by the tendon of the muscle that raises the upper eyelid.  In addition, there are additional lacrimal glands.  They are mainly located in the conjunctiva of the superior arch. </p><p>  In order to effectively moisturize the <span>eyeball</span> , no more than 1 ml of tears per day is required, and additional glands produce them.  If there are no pathologies, then they perfectly cope with their functions.  The main lacrimal glands begin their work if any irritants appear that cause increased lacrimation.  This happens when exposed to various irritating substances, the foreign body gets on the conjunctiva or cornea, severe pain, too bright a blinding light, an excess of emotions. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Tear ducts are a rather complex anatomical formation, which consists of many elements.  It is through them that the <span>tear fluid</span> moves in the conjunctival sac and then is diverted to the nasal cavity.  The health of such an important organ as the eyes largely depends on their normal functioning. </p><p>  <span>Tear ducts</span> in the amount of 12 pieces are located in each gland and it is through them that the secret through the openings in the arch of the upper eyelid enters the <span>conjunctival sac.</span>  On the inner edge of the upper and lower eyelids there are small tubercles with holes, which are called lacrimal openings.  The excess secret gathered in the tear lake is carried through them through the lacrimal ducts, which are also called tubules.  Then it enters a peculiar collector - a lacrimal sac, and then into the nasal cavity, where it evaporates, moisturizing the air in it. </p><p>  Disorders in the work of the lacrimal organs can cause many factors, including inflammation of the lacrimal glands.  In this case, tear fluid can be produced as too little or too much.  The main symptoms of diseases of the lacrimal glands are: lacrimation, a feeling of friction in the eyes, swelling of the upper eyelid.  In acute inflammatory processes, patients experience pain, with chronic diseases, there are none. </p><p>  The lacrimal glands produce less secretion with age.  This is especially true for women during hormonal changes.  There is a decrease in the number of tears in Sj√∂gren‚Äôs syndrome, a rheumatoid disease with not very clear causes. </p><p>  Naturally, when crying, the amount of secreted secretion increases significantly.  A similar phenomenon occurs with eye injuries, burns, foreign bodies, irritation, for example, when cleaning onions, etc.  Thus, the body reacts and protects the eye.  <span>Inflammation of the lacrimal glands</span> often occurs with the development of such infectious diseases as flu, mumps, scarlet fever.  If the swelling of the lacrimal glands is painless and lasts quite a long time, then it is possible to suspect the presence of such chronic diseases as tuberculosis, diseases of the circulatory system, syphilis and some others. </p>
