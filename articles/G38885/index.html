    <p>  Andrey Gromyko was born on July 5, 1909 in the village of Stary Gromyki (the territory of modern Belarus).  He was from a poor family, and from the age of 13 he began to earn a living helping his father.  Education of the future diplomat: </p><ul><li>  seven year school; </li><li>  vocational school (Gomel); </li><li>  Staroborisovsky Agricultural College; </li><li>  Institute of Economics (Minsk); </li><li>  postgraduate study at the Academy of Sciences of the BSSR; </li><li>  received a degree at the Institute of Economics of the USSR Academy of Sciences. </li></ul><p>  For work in the department of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko, whose biography is under consideration, was suitable for two basic requirements.

Already in 1939, Andrei Andreyevich was appointed adviser to the USSR mission in the USA from 1939 to 1943.  From 1943 to 1946, he was appointed Soviet ambassador to the United States.  In addition, he took an active part in diplomatic relations with Cuba, in preparation for three world <span>conferences (Tehran,</span> Potsdam, Yalta).  The diplomat was directly related to the <span>creation of the UN.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  UN membership </h2><p>  Soviet politician Andrei Gromyko was one of those who stood at the origins of the UN in the post-war period.

    <p>  The diplomat felt the greatest difficulties in working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under Khrushchev, who was not satisfied with the lack of flexibility in negotiating Andrei Andreyevich.

This period is considered the heyday of the influence of diplomat No. 1 on state and party affairs of the USSR. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Until the end of his life, Gromyko was engaged in public affairs.

    <p>  By 1962, the confrontation between the USSR and the USA reached its zenith.  This period was called the <span>Caribbean crisis.</span>  To some extent, what happened is connected with the position of the diplomat.  Andrei Gromyko held talks on this issue with John F. Kennedy, but, not having reliable information, the Soviet statesman could not conduct them at the proper level. </p><p>  The essence of the conflict between the two superpowers of that time was the deployment by the USSR of its missiles with an atomic charge in Cuba.  The weapon was located off the coast of the United States under the heading "top secret."  Therefore, Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko, whose biography is being examined, did not know anything about the operation. </p><p>  After the United States provided photographs confirming that the Soviet Union did indeed use Cuban territory to create a military threat against the United States, a decision was made to quarantine.  This meant that all vessels located at a certain distance from Cuba were subject to inspection. </p><p>  The Soviet Union decided to export missiles, and the threat of nuclear war was removed.  The world lived in anticipation of the war for 38 days.  The resolution of the Caribbean crisis has led to a relaxation in relations between East and West.  A new period has begun in international relations. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2>
