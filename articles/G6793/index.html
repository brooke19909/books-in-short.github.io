    <h2>  Village History </h2><p>  Before talking about the rest in such a place as Abkhazia (Alahadzi), a few words should be said about its history.  The country itself was founded in the distant VIII century and was then called the Abkhaz kingdom.  After a while, the name changed.  This happened in 1491 - the kingdom began to be called the Principality of Abkhazia.  And the name of the village comes from the word “alaha” (from Abkhazian it translates as “figs”) and “adzykh” (spring).  So, Alahadzi means “fig at the spring”.  The village arose several hundred years ago, back in ancient times.  Then Alakhadze bore the honorary title of the religious center of Western Abkhazia.  And the river called Bzyb, which flowed near the village, was the place where sacrifices were carried out.  After the adoption of Christianity, a basilica was built in the village, by the way, it stands there to this day.  For a long time, the village was the richest in all of Abkhazia.  Today, about 3 thousand people live in it, but to this day, crops are grown here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Course of life </h2><p>  When planning a vacation in this country, you should familiarize yourself with the lifestyle that has entrenched in the country of Abkhazia.  The village of Alahadzi differs from other cities in a measured and calm life.  It is an ideal place for a relaxing holiday.  If you want to relax from the daily rush, city noise and dust, you should come to Alakhadze (Abkhazia).  Reviews of tourists who have been here, by the way, inspire the trip.  People are really impressed by the local nature and the lack of noise.  Having been here once, you will want to return again. </p><h2>  Hospitality </h2>

    <p>  Hospitality and friendliness - that is what Abkhazia is still famous for.  Alahadzi and other cities are always welcome visitors, and the indigenous people will never refuse help.  There is a large number of guest houses where tourists are greeted with all the honors and hospitality.  In general, this is a village that consists mainly of private sectors, but it has three central streets, where there are several guest houses and hotels where you can stay planning to come to a country like Abkhazia (Alakhadze).  Tumanyan, Abovyan and Shaumyan - that's what they are called.  It’s easy to find these streets, because the village is small, and almost anyone can navigate here just by reading the street names on the houses. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camping </h2>

    <p>  Abkhazia, the village of Alahadzy, is an ideal place for solitude with nature.  There are no noisy entertainments, however, the clean Black Sea and fresh air will be an excellent substitute for night clubs.  The beach, by the way, is not crowded even in the midst of the season.  Also, one cannot fail to note the view that opens onto <span>the Mamzyshha Mountain.</span>  Of course, the main attraction of the village is the diversity of fauna and flora.  Perhaps this is the natural center of such a country as Abkhazia.  Alahadzi is a place with a view of the majestic mountains, cypress groves, magnolias, banana trees and palm trees.  So the fact that tourists constantly go to this picturesque Abkhaz corner is not at all surprising.  Here you can combine business with pleasure - to relax and improve.  By the way, many people come here with children.  Tourists especially like the local beach - wide, consisting of a strip of pebbles and sand.  Those people who visited Alahadze (Abkhazia) leave positive reviews, since in so few places you can still see so “green” landscapes, a smooth entry into the sea, enjoy the peace and mild climate.  In a word, this is really a vacation for the soul. </p>

    <h2>  Climate </h2><p>  Rest in Abkhazia (Alakhadze) is not only pleasant, but also comfortable.  If you want unobtrusive heat and sunlight - you should go here.  Not every resort boasts such a favorable climate.  In Turkey, for example, there is such heat that it is even impossible to go outside.  The same can be said of Egypt.  However, in Abkhazia, this is not so.  It has a humid Mediterranean climate.  After all, Abkhazia (the village of Alahadzi) is located in the subtropics.  And this, as you know, is one of the most favorable and comfortable climates for humans.  Summer is warm, but not hot (in August the temperature can reach 29 degrees), and winter is mild.  Snow is rare.  The average temperature in January is 11 degrees.  That is why many people come here to rest, even in the off-season.  The only thing is that it rains quite often.  However, they are short-lived and warm.  There is practically no wind either. </p>

    <h2>  Popularity </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Abkhazia is not as popular as Spain, Georgia, Turkey, Egypt and other resorts, a large number of people travel here.  So, for example, in the first ten days of 2015 (from the first to the tenth of January) this small country was visited by about 15 thousand tourists!  By the way, in Abkhazia, not all hotels are closed for the winter.  About 20 hotels and guest houses continue to function and receive visitors.  Although many decide to stay in the private sector or rent an apartment with the owners.  As a matter of fact, there are a lot of options, and everyone chooses the one that is most suitable for him.  In general, here you can really have a good rest, enjoy the picturesque views stretching along the horizon to the mountains and the Black Sea.  No wonder Abkhazia is called the country of a big soul. </p>
