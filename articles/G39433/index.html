    <p>  According to an ancient and very beautiful story, the island of Sardinia appeared from the footprint of the great Creator when he stepped into the water.  The resulting piece of land had a bizarre shape, and unusually beautiful nature appeared on its surface: white sandy beaches, flower fields, crystal clear lakes and lush greenery.  That is how this corner appears before all those who decide to visit it.  Alghero is on the list of cities that you should definitely visit on the island. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Alghero City, Sardinia: Location </h2><p>  Alghero is located in the province of Sassari, its population reaches 44 thousand people.  This is one of the main cities of Sardinia, as there is an international airport. </p><p>  The coastline of the city is called Riviera del Corallo - "Coral Riviera".  Here lives a large colony of red corals, which made the city of Alghero famous far beyond Italy.  The collection and sale of corals are of great importance in the life of Sardinia - both economic and cultural. </p><p>  The Spaniards have long influenced the development of the culture and language of the inhabitants of Alghero, so the streets here have double names, and many residents speak two languages ‚Äã‚Äãfluently. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sardinia alghero" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2005781.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Weather </h2><p>  Alghero extends on the very shore of the sea, so the climate here is quite mild, and two capes (Punto Giglio and Capo Caccia) reliably protect the city from strong winds. </p><p>  In winter, the weather in Alghero is quite warm: the average temperature often stops at -10 <sup>o</sup> C. In summer, the thermometer rises to +22 <sup>o</sup> C. </p><h2>  The nature of the city and its environs </h2><p>  The rich landscape is represented by cliffs with sharp and flat stones, sandy beaches, luxurious Mediterranean vegetation.  Vast olive groves grow around the town. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The territory of Cape Capo Caccio is popular due to the large number of caves and gorges, most of which are still poorly studied.  The most famous of them is the cave of Neptune with hundreds of stalactites and stalagmites.  The territory of this cape has recently turned into a reserve. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What to see in Alghero" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2005748.jpg" width="600"></div>
