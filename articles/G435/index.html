    <p>  So, the hero of today's review is the Lenovo Y510p laptop.  Let's try to analyze in detail all its advantages and disadvantages, taking into account the opinions of experts and reviews of ordinary laptop owners. </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  The new model practically does not differ in appearance from its predecessor, which makes it a hostage to both the pros and cons of the design of the previous line.  The main shortcomings in the case remained the same: in some places the device bends and actively collects fingerprints. </p><p>  The rest is a solid model with familiar features from Lenovo: rough panels with clear edges, rounded corners and a combination of high-quality plastic with aluminum.  It should be noted separately that the cover of Lenovo Y510p is made of metal and decorated with a simple but quite friendly texture, the main component of which is horizontal stripes, so it‚Äôs very difficult to call the model strict.  The main shades of the background are black with a small inclusion of red in the key (according to designers) places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The lower part of the laptop is equipped with a ventilation grill, which occupies almost the entire bottom.  But for cooling the system, this is what you need, because a productive laptop will clearly not have such a detail.  There you can also find the clamps that hold the battery, and judging by the reviews, then any problems with its removal / replacement never arise. </p><p>  Dimensions Lenovo Ideapad Y510p fully comply with the benchmarks of 15.6-inch devices - 387 x 259 x 36 mm.  And even the weight, which with such a filling is kept within 2.7 kg, cannot be called large or attributed to factors that complicate the carrying or working with a laptop. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  A resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels is more than enough for a 15.6-inch device, and the aspect ratio (16: 9) corresponds to the parameters of FullHD displays.  The screen is characterized by excellent brightness of the order of 300 cd / m2 and very good contrast ratios. </p>

    <p>  Laptop owners respond especially warmly to the matte surface of the display, where the color rendering is set to a very high level, although not ideal for their segment.  You can also note the excellent viewing angles, which do not make you nervous when you reject the display or watching a video with friends.  In general, the Lenovo Y510p screen is able to compete with many similar brands, and the laptop owners appreciated the display in their positive reviews. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  The acoustic capabilities of the laptop are supported by Dolby Home Theater v4 technology, and two high-quality JBL stereo speakers, which are conveniently located under the keyboard, help it in this.  Thanks to the successful tandem, the sound is delivered richly, deeply and without any distortion. </p><p>  The speaker volume of the Lenovo Y510p is quite enough for an average room, which allows you to do without third-party speakers or headphones. </p><h2>  Webcam </h2><p>  The display frame of the laptop is equipped with a regular 1.3 megapixel webcam.  On both sides of the device are built-in bi-directional microphones with a high-quality noise reduction system. </p>

The buttons are slightly concave and slightly rounded from the bottom, which is very thoughtful from an ergonomic point of view. </p><p>  The key travel is carried out without visible effort and with good return, and the overall comfort of working with the keyboard was repeatedly noted by the owners of Lenovo Y510p, whose reviews were exclusively positive. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Another obvious advantage of the keyboard is the original two-level backlight.  At the time of its activation, the keyboard is highlighted in red, which is typical for gaming laptops with the only difference: the WASD buttons are not highlighted at all, so this may not seem like a convenient addition to gamers. </p><p>  Some people appreciate the unusual backlighting as something annoying, while others are just delighted with such a chip.  But be that as it may, the backlight can be turned off at any time, so intriguing moments like ‚Äúlike‚Äù and ‚Äúdislike‚Äù can not be taken into account. </p><h2>  Touchpad </h2><p>  The manipulator pleases the eye with its appearance, but what it lacks is sensitivity.  The owners have repeatedly noticed that after touching the touchpad in its lower part, responsiveness only works the second time, and this causes some discomfort, but the alternative in the face of the mouse will surely solve this small problem. </p><p>  As for support for multi-touch gestures, everything is fine with the Lenovo Y510p: scaling and rotation is excellent, vertical and horizontal scrolling works like a clock.  The only thing users sometimes complain about in their reviews is the rubberized surface of the manipulator, because of which fingers sometimes do not move as fast as they would like. </p><p>  The touchpad does not have a separate block of physical keys, but there is a bright red marker marker to help distinguish the left button from the right one. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The laptop runs on the pre-installed 64-bit Windows 8 and is equipped with a powerful and productive processor from Intel Core i7 4700MQ series of a new and proven generation of Haswell.  Fans of ‚Äúoverclocking‚Äù have the opportunity to increase the initial clock frequency from 2.4 GHz to 3.4 GHz using <span>Turbo Boost.</span>  This will allow you to quickly solve tasks or play, especially since with six megabytes of third-level cache and Hyper-Threading multithreading technology the laptop is able to "digest" up to eight data streams.  The Intel chip cannot be called energy efficient with a TDP of 47 watts, but you have to sacrifice something for the benefit of performance for the Lenovo Y510p. </p>

    <p>  The video card (HD Graphics 4600 from Intel) works in tandem with the processor and slightly surpasses its predecessors from the previous line of models 4000 and 4400. The only thing that remains the same is discrete accelerators of the initial and middle level. </p><p>  As an alternative to the integrated graphics chip, the laptop is equipped with a rather powerful system from Nvidia in the face of the GT 755M with 2 GB of GDDR5 memory on board.  But even if this doesn‚Äôt seem enough, then there is always the opportunity to install a second video card, since it provides for a design feature, but with one caveat: the second board should also be from Nvidia. </p><p>  Nevertheless, even with one video card on board, the device copes well with modern games, giving out 40-60 fps on average settings. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  The laptop is equipped with a powerful 6-segment lithium-ion battery with an enviable capacity of 5800 mAh (62 Wh).  Lenovo promises autonomous operation of the device at medium loads within five hours, but bench tests have shown that for simple surfing the device will last for three hours, and at maximum load the battery runs down after a half to a maximum of two hours.  Therefore, it is better to keep the power supply always at hand. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  We can say with confidence that in this laptop there is something to cling to and for which to love it.  Even despite the decent cost of the Lenovo Ideapad Y510p (its price is about 65,000 rubles), the device fully justifies the money invested in it. </p><p>  The main advantages of the laptop are the display with excellent viewing angles and a good margin of brightness and contrast, an enviable performance with the ability to add a second video card, the original backlight and design.  Of the minuses, you can distinguish only a very short battery life (the powerful stuff is to blame) and the touchpad is unresponsive in some places.  The rest is a solid and sensible laptop, which is sure to please you with its extensive capabilities. </p>
