That is, it does not respond to any actions.  But do not get ahead of time upset and rush for a new smartphone - the problem can be fixed and bring the phone back to life. </p><p>  To do this, you must clearly follow the instructions and have the right set of tools. </p><h2>  Firmware recovery methods </h2><p>  Depending on the degree of malfunction, there are several effective ways after which the gadget restores its functionality.  So, how to restore the firmware on the "Android"? </p><ul><li>  Method number 1. Rollback settings to the base / factory.  This is an effective method, but there are side effects in the form of loss of all data. </li><li>  Method number 2. Using third-party software to restore or install firmware.  It is advisable to use only official (stock) versions, in order to avoid the appearance of system errors. </li><li>  Method number 3. Using Recovery tools.  With their help, you can install both official and custom (custom) firmware. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="fee.org" data-author=": James Pethokoukis, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to repair IMEI on Android firmware" class="if uuid-3108654" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/3108654.jpg"></div><p>  Each method needs a detailed description so that in the future a person can independently correct the problems that have arisen and repair his device, without additional financial costs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Rollback to factory settings </h2><p>  In almost 100% of cases, the user himself is to blame for the breakdown of the smartphone.  Unsuccessfully installed applications, virus programs, unsuccessful firmware - and you have to figure out how to restore the firmware on Android. </p><p>  If this happens, you should perform a Hard reset of the gadget.  Almost all phones have the ability to quickly call a special menu - Recovery, with which the settings are reset.  Usually, these are simultaneous keystrokes of the lock and volume keys (each smartphone model has its own combinations). </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.arweb.com" data-author=": Saúl Campos Sojo, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore it on android after firmware" class="if uuid-3108682" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/3108682.jpg"></div><p>  You need to do a reset in the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  If the gadget is functioning, then you should transfer all the necessary data to a flash drive or PC. </li><li>  Turn off the smartphone and press the volume and lock buttons at the same time.  A black window should appear on the screen with the green Android logo in the center. </li><li>  In the window that appears, select the item “Wipe data / factory reset”. </li><li>  The next step is to select the “delete all user data” item and click “OK”. </li><li>  The device will turn off, but after a while the message “Reboot system” will be displayed. </li></ul><p>  After the reboot, the smartphone should start up and look as if it was just bought.  The only negative is that all data and settings will have to be re-entered. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Using third-party software to restore firmware </h2><p>  Not always resetting helps, and the phone still remains inoperative.  Then you can use another effective way to restore the firmware to Android on <span>Samsung, Lenovo, Sony, Huawei and other brands of mobile devices.</span> </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iuvmtech.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore old firmware on android" class="if uuid-3108676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/3108676.jpg"></div><p>  We are talking about special programs, the so-called resuscitators.  They allow you to restore the stock firmware and install a new one.  Each manufacturer has created a utility for these purposes, but the SP Flash Tool is the best application to date.  An exception is Samsung, which uses another processor as its base.  This program has many functions and, as practice shows, is able to restore even the most hopeless smartphones - "bricks". </p><h2>  Firmware Recovery Using Flash Tools </h2><p>  This software is suitable for owners of all smartphones based on the MTK processor.  After recovery or flashing, the device starts to work faster and changes its visual appearance. </p><p>  So, for work you will need: </p><ul><li>  drivers for pairing the gadget with a PC; </li><li>  downloaded firmware file from a reliable source; </li><li>  Flash Tool </li></ul><p>  First you need to install special smartphone drivers so that the computer recognizes the connected gadget.  They can be found on the Internet (for your model).  By the way, it’s not always possible to install them in automatic mode, so you need to do the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  connect the gadget to a PC; </li><li>  open device manager; </li><li>  find an unidentified device; </li><li>  click on it and select the item “Update drivers”; </li><li>  select the path to the folder with the downloaded drivers; </li><li>  install them. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="9to5google.com" data-author=": Ben Schoon, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore firmware on android" class="if uuid-3108647" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/3108647.jpg"></div><p>  Now you can proceed to the stage of how to restore the firmware on Android. </p><p>  You need to make sure that the smartphone is at least 30-50% charged (or better even more).  And yet - you need to flash the device off.  This is a prerequisite. </p><ul><li>  In the running program, the “Scatter-loading” item is clicked.  This selects the desired firmware file. </li><li>  Now you need to set the operating mode - the list contains Download Only, Firmware Upgrade and Format All + Download.  The first makes it possible to select the firmware sections of the smartphone, the second - the full recovery option with saving important data, and the third - formatting the device and installing it from scratch. </li><li>  Important!  Before clicking the “Download” button, you need to go into the program options and check the box “DA DL All with Checksum”.  Otherwise, the firmware may fail. </li><li>  Now you can connect a disconnected smartphone to the PC. </li><li>  The firmware will start automatically, immediately after connecting the device.  You need to wait until the green circle appears in the center of the window. </li><li>  Done!  The smartphone can be disconnected from the PC, turned on and enjoy. </li></ul><h2>  Using Recovery Tools </h2><p>  Another effective way to restore the old firmware on Android is to use a special mode. </p><p>  If custom firmware was installed on the smartphone, then you can try using the Recovery mode.  There are two types of work: </p><ul><li>  CWM-Recovery. </li><li>  TWRP-Recovery. </li></ul><p>  They have one principle of action, but the sequence of actions is somewhat different.  By the way, if there is a problem, how to restore imei on "Android" firmware, then this method is effective. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": FabrikaSimf/Shutterstock, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore contacts on android after firmware" class="if uuid-3108675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/3108675.jpg"></div><p>  So, the first way is CWM.  Before starting work, the archive with the firmware backup should be on the gadget's memory card.  Then: </p><ul><li>  you need to go into the recovery menu (combination of volume / lock buttons); </li><li>  select the item “Wipe data / factory reset”; </li><li>  Next, you need to confirm the reset in CWM Recovery - select "Yes"; </li><li>  in the main menu you need to select the section "Wipe cache partition"; </li><li>  Confirm cache flush </li><li>  final stage - “Install zip from sdcard” and “Choose zip from sdcard”; </li><li>  after rebooting the device everything should work. </li></ul><p>  The second way, how to restore the firmware on the “Android” using Recovery, is TWRP.  It is more modern, since the transitions on the Recovery menu items can be performed by touching the screen.  So: </p><ul><li>  First you need to select “Wipe”; </li><li>  after that, check the sections to be cleared; </li><li>  factory reset - “Swipe to factory reset”; </li><li>  “Install” is selected in the main menu, after which you need to specify the path to the Recovery file; </li><li>  After rebooting from the TWRP menu, the gadget can be started. </li></ul><p>  A side variant of both of these methods is the loss of all user files and data on the smartphone. </p><h2>  How to restore contacts </h2><p>  Perhaps the most important concern of the owners of mobile devices is the search for ways to restore contacts on Android after firmware. </p><p>  In most situations, this cannot be done if a backup has not been made.  However, with the help of some system tools and utilities, you can still recover what was lost. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hr.n1info.com" data-author=": N1 Zagreb, "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to restore firmware on Android &quot;Samsung&quot;" class="if uuid-3108658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71121/3108658.jpg"></div><ul><li>  With a Google Account.  If an Android user has a created Google account, then periodically the address book is saved in a special format and stored on the server for a month.  After flashing, you can click on the contact filter in the phone book and select Google Mail there. </li><li>  Another way - if all the contacts were transferred at one time to the SIM card.  There, in the book settings, you can import contacts from SIM to the phone. </li><li>  Finally, there is a chance to restore contacts using third-party utilities, for example, Android Data Recovery or Super BackUp Pro.  But here the chance is far from 100%, although some contacts can still be pulled out of nonexistence. </li></ul><h2>  Repair IMEI after smartphone firmware </h2><p>  But even in the case of a successful firmware, there is a chance of an error.  Namely: the mobile network will be unavailable.  In this case, you need to know how to restore “have” on “Android” after the firmware, because it is precisely because of its absence that the smartphone does not recognize the communication region. </p><p>  This problem may occur in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  incorrect completion of phone firmware; </li><li>  poor build firmware; </li><li>  critical completion of wipe settings. </li></ul><p>  There are several ways to fix this trouble. </p><h2>  Manual Repair IMEI </h2><p>  First you need to check that the smartphone will issue a request for IMEI.  To do this, enter the combination “* # 06 #” in the call menu.  If an error is issued, it means that IMEI needs to be restored.  By the way, these combinations can be found (if the smartphone has 1 card, then there will be one code) either on the gadget's body under the battery, or in the technical passport for the device. </p><p>  Manually IMEI is restored as follows: </p><ul><li>  SIM card is removed; </li><li>  in dialing mode, you need to enter the combination "* # 3646633 #"; </li><li>  after entering the engineering menu, go to the CDS Information-Radio-Phone section; </li><li>  there will be the line “AT +”, where after the plus you need to enter “EGMR = 1.7,“ IMEI number ”; </li><li>  you need to confirm the set and reboot the device. </li></ul><h2>  Software Repair IMEI </h2><p>  If manual code entry did not help, then you can use auxiliary utilities. </p><p>  To do this, you need: </p><ul><li>  install such a program on a smartphone and run it; </li><li>  click on the option “read / recognize IMEI”; </li><li>  uncheck the option “same IMEI” and enter your identifier in an empty field; </li><li>  reload the gadget. </li></ul><p>  Usually this measure helps even in the most critical situations.  If this did not happen, then this firmware is not suitable for this smartphone, and it is better to reinstall it. </p>
