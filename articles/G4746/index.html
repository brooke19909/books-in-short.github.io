About what <span>types of threads for knitting are,</span> what they are made of and how they are marked on the packaging, we will discuss this material. </p><div class="photo" data-original="doyousew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Types of yarn for knitting" class="if uuid-2454601" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454601.jpg"></div><h2>  We study the label </h2><p>  When purchasing thread for crocheting, knitting or using a machine, pay attention to the ‚Äúcover‚Äù of yarn.  What is written there tells a lot: </p><ol><li>  Composition.  This paragraph indicates what the yarn is made of.  Each type has its own marking. </li><li>  Weight and length.  These data will help calculate how many skeins of yarn you need.  For example, a regular sweater takes 10 tangles weighing 50 g with a thread length of 160 meters.  Thick and heavy fibers will need less, and more light. </li><li>  Color and batch number.  These data will help if you miscalculate the amount of yarn.  It is better to buy skeins of the same series, otherwise the shades of the threads will differ.  And this will spoil the appearance of the product. </li><li>  Hook and knitting needles.  Manufacturers often indicate the size of the knitting tool. </li></ol><p>  In some cases, the label provides instructions for caring for yarn, as well as the preferred density of knitting. </p><h2>  Bobbins or skeins? </h2><p>  Knitting threads are sold in different variations.  And each species has its advantages.  Yarn in bobbins is convenient in that products are created from it without additional knots.  And needlewomen know how difficult it is to "hide" them.  Such threads are processed with special compounds that prevent the web from rolling.  They are recommended to choose for machine knitting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But yarn in bobbins has a significant drawback.  It is sold in large volumes, to create one sweater or cardigan it is impractical to buy it.  In addition, before work, you will have to rewind the threads into balls.  After all, knitting from a bobbin is inconvenient.  Therefore, if you do not plan to create several products from one thread, then buy hanks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="microfiber threads" class="if uuid-2454625" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454625.jpg"></div><h2>  What animals give </h2><p>  The wool of domestic and wild animals has long been used for the manufacture of threads from which they sew or knit clothing.  Moreover, such fibers are expensive.  In terms of "warmth" little can be compared with them.  Types of threads for knitting of animal origin: </p><ol><li>  Wool (WO, Lana). </li><li>  Merino wool (WV, Extrafine). </li><li>  Moher (WM, Mohair). </li><li>  Camel hair (WK, Cammello, Camel). </li><li>  Alpaca (WP, Alpaca). </li><li>  Cashmere (WS, Kashmir). </li><li>  Angora.  (WA, Angora, Karin). </li></ol><p>  In parentheses are marked yarn.  Each of these types of threads deserves special attention. </p><h2>  Wool </h2><p>  This natural material is made from sheep wool.  Such fibers perfectly retain heat, allow air to pass through and retain moisture.  Wool is pleasant to the touch, although to some it seems ‚Äúprickly‚Äù.  From fiber create sweaters, warm dresses, scarves and hats. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Woolen threads for knitting" class="if uuid-2454608" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454608.jpg"></div><h2>  Merino Wool </h2><p>  This delicate yarn is obtained from the withers of a merino sheep.  Fibers are valued for their unusual softness.  Wool perfectly retains heat.  Due to the elasticity of the fiber, tight things are created from it.  In addition, merino wool products can be machine washed without fear, of course, under a special mode.  However, they do not lose shape.  The only drawback of good knitting threads is the high price. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.craftsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mohair threads" class="if uuid-2454613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454613.jpg"></div><h2>  Mohair </h2><p>  Yarn is obtained from goat hair.  The fibers are warm, fluffy, but short-lived.  In addition, their thickness is heterogeneous.  Therefore, 100% mohair is rarely found on sale, more often it is "diluted" with natural and synthetic fibers.  These threads are suitable for knitting with thin knitting needles.  Mohair is ideal for creating openwork shawls and stoles. </p><h2>  Alpaca </h2><p>  Yarn is obtained from the wool of a special variety of llamas.  These threads are suitable for knitting and crocheting.  Valued for lightness, softness and a silky sheen that does not get lost after numerous washes.  Alpaca products are warm and durable.  They do not crumple and do not break.  Moreover, there are never spools on them.  Another advantage is that alpaca does not cause allergies.  Outerwear is mainly knitted from wool - insulated cardigans, coats, wide scarves. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.nancyelizabethdesigns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cashmere Knitting Threads" class="if uuid-2454615" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454615.jpg"></div><h2>  Cashmere </h2><p>  The material is created from the undercoat of a goat.  These are beautiful and warm threads for knitting by hand and on a typewriter.  It is not surprising that they are the most expensive and they are called "royal yarn."  Soft-touch fibers are suitable for knitting jumpers, scarves and snoods.  Disadvantages - high cost and exacting care.  Items from cashmere are not recommended to be washed, only dry cleaning is allowed. </p><h2>  Angora </h2><p>  The material is extracted from the wool of Angora rabbits.  In its pure form, angora are practically not used, because the threads are inelastic.  Therefore, ordinary wool or acrylic is added to them.  Knitting needles are suitable, it‚Äôs difficult to crochet with them.  Yarn is appreciated for its lightness, tenderness and the characteristic "lush" pile. </p><p>  Angora has a drawback - over time, products wear out.  ‚ÄúBald spots‚Äù appear on them.  In addition, they cannot be washed, only mechanical cleaning is allowed.  But with proper care, things from this undercoat of rabbits will last more than one year. </p><h2>  Camel's wool </h2><p>  Camel down threads are 100% natural and environmentally friendly.  They are not processed and almost never stained.  This is not necessary, because the wool has a beautiful brown color.  Moreover, there are both light, beige tones, and dark, almost black shades. </p><p>  The fluff of young camels is soft and gentle to the touch.  If you came across stiff ‚Äúspiky‚Äù yarn, then it was made from the wool of old animals.  The material has a lot of advantages.  Products are unusually warm and durable.  They do not slip and do not lose shape.  In addition, fluff has healing properties.  There is only one drawback - the high cost of camel hair.  But the price is not surprising, because it is created exclusively by hands. </p><h2>  "Vegetable" yarn </h2><p>  Yarn obtained from plants is less expensive.  At the same time, it is quite durable, wear-resistant and pleasant to the touch.  Types of thread for knitting plant origin: </p><ol><li>  Cotton (Co, Cotone, Cotton). </li><li>  Hemp fiber (CA, Canapa, Hemp). </li><li>  Linen yarn (Li, Lino, Linen). </li><li>  Silk (SE, Seta, Silk). </li><li>  Nettle fiber. </li><li>  Bamboo fiber (Bamboo rayon). </li></ol><p>  Let's look at each of these types in more detail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Cotton Threads for Knitting" class="if uuid-2454630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454630.jpg"></div><h2>  Cotton </h2><p>  Knitting threads are obtained from the air mass that grows near the seeds of cotton.  This is the most common and popular material.  A typical representative of this fiber "iris" - thread for knitting, which beginner needlewomen study on. </p><p>  Yarn has many advantages.  The fibers are hygroscopic, they allow air to pass through and retain moisture.  They are durable, tolerate washing well, products from them will last for decades.  But fiber also has disadvantages.  It is abraded, wrinkled and loses color in the light.  Mercerization of yarn helps to fix this.  This process is expensive, after which the material increases in price. </p><p>  ‚ÄúIris‚Äù - crochet threads more than knitting needles.  They are suitable for creating light summer dresses, topics, children's clothes and even swimwear.  In addition, they are used for knitting household items, bags and covers. </p><h2>  Hemp fiber </h2><p>  This inexpensive knitting yarn is not very popular, although it is a 100% environmentally friendly product.  Indeed, when growing hemp, pesticides that process cotton fields are not used.  But the strings from the plant are tough, although they soften a little over time.  The advantages of the material are strength, durability, wear resistance.  Therefore, hemp yarn is ideal for creating shopping bags and napkins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Linen threads for knitting" class="if uuid-2455409" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2455409.jpg"></div><h2>  Linen </h2><p>  This natural material neatly lies in the canvas, does not fade, holds its shape and is worn for a long time.  The fiber is soft, smooth and pleasant to the touch.  Do not know what threads are needed for knitting summer things?  The answer is obvious - linen. </p><p>  The fiber perfectly retains moisture and allows air to pass through.  In addition, the material retains ultraviolet radiation by 95%, while other filaments cope with the task by 30-50%.  Flax looks spectacular in fancy patterns.  But also a garter or hosiery knitting from it turns out to be neat and attractive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="seagreenandsapphire.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Silk threads for knitting" class="if uuid-2454634" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454634.jpg"></div><h2>  Silk </h2><p>  Material is extracted from the cocoon of a silkworm caterpillar.  Silk is a very expensive yarn, because the process of its manufacture is laborious and delicate.  Products from the material are truly exclusive.  <span>Silk fibers</span> are used for knitting wedding and evening dresses.  But they have a significant drawback - a high price.  To reduce the cost of the product, other natural fibers are often added to this material. </p><h2>  Bamboo fiber </h2><p>  This material is valued for its 100% environmental friendliness and hypoallergenicity.  Unlike other fibers, bamboo threads have natural antimicrobial properties.  Therefore, they do not need additional chemical treatment.  In addition, the fiber is softer and softer than cotton.  And the tactile sensation resembles cashmere or silk.  These crochet threads are used.  They create airy, light shawls and capes. </p><h2>  Nettle strands </h2><p>  The production of this material is laborious and expensive.  And to create 20-30 g of threads, you need 4.5 kg of nettle.  Therefore, the material is not used independently, and it is spun into other natural fibers.  As a result, the canvas is lightweight, hygroscopic and durable. </p><h2>  Blended yarn </h2><p>  Each type of thread for knitting has its drawbacks.  Therefore, very often manufacturers mix types of yarn with each other.  The result is softer, more flexible or cheaper fibers.  Types of blended yarn: </p><ol><li>  Wool and cotton.  This material is also called woolly.  Thanks to the combination of fibers, the canvas is smooth, breathable and warm.  In addition, cotton removes excessive ‚Äúscratchiness‚Äù of the wool, which is why yarn products are suitable for people with sensitive skin and small children.  Wool does not stretch when washing, retains its shape for a long time.  Pellets rarely form on it.  The disadvantage of the material is that wool and cotton absorb dye in different ways.  As a result, the web may have a non-uniform color. </li><li>  A mixture of artificial and natural fibers.  Such filaments acquire the strength and elasticity of synthetic fibers, while maintaining air permeability, heat and hygroscopicity of natural materials.  The cloth does not sit and does not deform after washing.  The paint is not washed out and does not fade from the sun.  Blended yarn products retain their original appearance for a long time.  In addition, the material has an affordable price. </li><li>  Synthetic mix.  A mixture of artificial fabrics is used to create threads of different textures.  This inexpensive knitting yarn looks attractive.  But such a material is not able to retain heat.  Therefore, it is used to create light or demi-season things. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.purplepeach.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Wool Blends" class="if uuid-2455410" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2455410.jpg"></div><h2>  Faux yarn </h2><p>  Modern technology allows you to create yarn from various materials.  Such fibers are cheaper, while in terms of beauty and quality they are not inferior to natural yarn.  Synthetic types of threads for knitting: </p><ol><li>  Microfiber (Micro Fiber).  The material is used in the creation of woven and <span>knitted products.</span>  The yarn is pleasant to the touch, soft and velvety.  Often it is added to <span>natural fibers</span> to increase the elasticity and strength of the threads. </li><li>  Acrylic (PA, Acrylic).  This material is extracted from ethylene.  It has a lot of advantages.  Acrylic threads for knitting are cheap, while they are durable and durable.  In addition, the yarn is easily dyed in incredible shades, which are difficult to achieve from natural materials.  Therefore, it is used to create children's toys or products with drawings.  The disadvantage of acrylic knitting threads is their ability to accumulate electricity. </li><li>  Metallic (Me, Metall).  Shiny threads (Lurex) are not yarn per se.  But these fibers are added to other materials to give them a festive sheen. </li><li>  Nylon (NY, Naylon, Polyamide).  This strong and at the same time light fiber is often used to reinforce other materials.  Yarn is very elastic, so knitwear is knitted from it. </li><li>  Polypropylene.  Use these threads for knitting washcloths, beach bags, accessories.  The material is durable, holds its shape well, and is cheap. </li></ol><p>  Artificial inexpensive threads for knitting will be the best choice for a beginner needlewoman.  They are durable, wear-resistant, keep their shape and do not lose color after numerous washes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yarn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Synthetic Knitting Threads" class="if uuid-2454603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2454603.jpg"></div><h2>  Unusual <span>types of thread</span> for knitting </h2><p>  Fibers with different textures give the products a unique and completely exclusive look.  Such yarn is suitable for experienced needlewomen and beginner knitters who want to create original products. </p><h2>  Chenille </h2><p>  Yarn is made from a mixture of cotton and acrylic.  Products from the material are voluminous, velvety to the touch and with a velveteen texture.  Suitable threads for knitting with a simple stocking pattern.  Lace or braids cannot be made from chenille, because details are poorly visible due to the texture of the yarn.  Fiber products are not covered with spools, but they should not be worn under outer clothing.  Otherwise, the yarn will be wiped, over time ‚Äúbald spots‚Äù will appear.  Due to the unusual softness, yarns are suitable for knitting children's things and toys. </p><h2>  Pile yarn </h2><p>  The material is obtained by twisting yarns of different types.  Often, fibers with a long pile are added to the composition of the thread, which makes the fabric similar to faux fur and down.  Such threads are used for knitting scarves, hats, decorating individual parts of products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="twistedandpurlednyc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Twisted yarn" class="if uuid-2455428" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2455428.jpg"></div><h2>  Twisted yarn </h2><p>  Such a fiber consists of several twisted threads, with different colors.  The number of strands: from 2 to 6. The threads are dyed in different shades alternately.  As a result, the canvas is variegated, with characteristic ‚Äúwaves‚Äù.  Because of this combination, the material is also called "plaid" yarn.  It is good for knitting a regular stocking pattern, and fancy lace, braids.  Thread products are strong, durable, very well tolerate washing. </p><h2>  Knitted tape </h2><p>  The yarn is created in the form of a flat thin cord.  The manufacturing process of this material is complicated, and therefore the cost of fiber is quite high.  But the costs are worth it, because things are original and attractive.  <span>Knitted yarn</span> for knitting fit in loops at different angles.  Because of this, the product becomes uneven.  In addition, if the thread is knitted into the fabric ‚Äúsideways‚Äù, then the surface will turn out with bumps. </p><h2>  Buckled Yarn </h2><p>  Threads are created in a special way, thanks to which small balls are formed on them.  They are located at different or equal distances from each other.  When knitting "bukly" come forward.  As a result, the canvas acquires an interesting texture and deceptive density.  Bukley will be a great choice for beginner needlewomen, as they look spectacular in the simplest hosiery knitting.  But it will not be possible to make intricate patterns from threads, because due to the texture of the canvas, details will not be visible.  Depending on the thickness of the thread, suitable for knitting summer or warm clothes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Booklet yarn product" class="if uuid-2455413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2455413.jpg"></div><h2>  Tweed yarn </h2><p>  This is a monophonic fiber in which multi-colored blotches are present.  The composition of the material includes natural wool, but sometimes cotton or even synthetic threads are added to it.  As a rule, <span>tweed yarn</span> is dyed in natural colors: white, gray or black.  But there are skeins with a variety of shades.  And the brighter and more unusual the color of the material, the more artificial fibers in it. </p><p>  The advantages of the thread are strength, hygroscopicity and the ability to retain heat.  They make amazingly beautiful sweaters, skirts, scarves, cardigans and coats.  The lack of material is a small ‚Äúspiky‚Äù.  But this feature is characteristic of woolen cloths. </p><h2>  Bulk thread </h2><p>  This synthetic fiber is usually made in one addition.  The canvas from it is light, airy and voluminous.  At the same time, the products crumple well and quickly return to their previous shape.  The material is used for knitting on thick knitting needles or a hook. </p><p>  More recently, coats and scarves made of voluminous threads were trendy.  Now the demand for them has decreased.  But the home accessories made from this type of textile remained relevant.  It looks spectacular in multi-component patterns of harnesses and braids, interspersed with lace. </p><h2>  Blended yarn </h2><p>  The composition of the material includes several types of natural fibers and one synthetic thread.  Thanks to this combination, the canvas is hygroscopic, warm and passes air well.  Artificial fiber gives it strength and elasticity. </p><p>  Products made of mixed fabric sit well on the figure, look elegant and neat.  Synthetic thread is inside natural fibers.  Therefore, products from blended yarn retain all the positive properties of natural, expensive materials.    ,      . </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aajinternationalindia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt=" " class="if uuid-2455412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/37876/2455412.jpg"></div><h2>  Original ideas </h2><p> Want to ruin a traditional look at knitting clothes, accessories and household items?  Use unusual materials.  Indeed, in the hands of an experienced needlewoman, even used packages turn into original threads.  What can I knit: </p><ul><li>  Strips of fabric.  Such "threads" are traditionally used for knitting rugs.  But the material can also come up with another application: create a <span>plaid blanket</span> for a sofa or stand for a pot.  The main thing is to connect imagination.  To make a ‚Äúfabric thread‚Äù, cut old clothes or textiles into strips, and sew them together.  It will take a lot of time, but the result is worth it. </li><li>  Wire thread.  This material is used for knitting jewelry or home decor with beads.  In stores metal threads of any thickness and with a wide range of colors are sold.  Therefore, you can easily tie the original necklace or bracelet to taste. </li><li>  Rubber thread.  This material is known as jelly yarn.  Used for knitting accessories, belts and home decorations.  Working with a thread is not easy.  After all, it sticks to metal and plastic knitting needles.  Therefore, when knitting, it is recommended to lubricate the tools with oil. </li></ul><p>  In general, there are many varieties and types of thread for knitting.  And each needlewoman will pick up yarn to taste.  The main thing is to pay attention to the quality of the material.  After all, the beauty and durability of the product largely depend on it. </p>
