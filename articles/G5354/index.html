    <p>  Aptenodytes forsteri (Emperor Penguin) is a fairly large species of the Spheniscidae family.  He is the largest penguin on Earth, because the body of an adult is about 120 cm in length, and its weight is 27-40 kg.  The Emperor Penguin was first discovered by the Bellingshausen expedition around 1819. </p><p>  This species of birds looks like they are wearing a tailcoat: the head is black, with a blue tint, white chest, gray-blue back and purple-pink at the base of the beak.  The yellow-golden strip extends to the very neck. </p><p>  Since there are no fly feathers on the wings, and they are too short to hold the heavy body of the bird in the air, they play the role of fins.  The emperor penguin rakes them when diving, like flippers, which contributes to the rapid movement in the water masses. </p><p>  Emperor penguins during hunting can cover considerable distances.  Cruising speed - 20-25 km / h, achieved depth - up to 535 meters.  But if these animals are in a hurry, then the speed can develop even more (about twice).  The surface of the penguin blades is extremely large.  The muscles are attached to them, which is responsible for the rise of both wings.  The muscles of the chest are also well-formed and make up to 30% of the total body weight. </p><p>  A penguin is a bird that has lost the ability to fly, but it has perfectly adapted to the extreme temperature conditions.  Several layers of strong and warm feathers make it possible to withstand the icy wind and temperature up to -50 degrees Celsius.  A layer of fat can reach a thickness of three centimeters.  This protection under the skin does not allow the penguin to die during the cold. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About <span>swan fidelity,</span> people have composed many beautiful songs and poetic works.  But the fact that the penguin is also a monogamous bird, few know.  Meanwhile, they once and for all life form a couple. </p><p>  The emperor penguin attracts a female of interest to him by his voice.  The cry of the male contributes to the interest of the female, and his ‚Äúserenade‚Äù makes the female respond.  From this time on, the male and female stick together. </p><p>  The duration of such a "flirtation" is a month.  During this period, the penguin on the heels of his chosen one, then they dance for hours, shaking their heads to the beat of the <span>dance movements.</span>  After that, the emperor penguins bend, raising their heads up, and sing in turn.  The most interesting thing is that before the process of copulation, the female and the male bow low to each other, as if making a decision to never separate again. </p><p>  Only after 25 days, the female emperor penguin lays a single egg for the entire season.  Penguin eggs are quite large, weighing about half a kilogram.  Their color is pure white. </p><p>  Females lay their eggs in May and early June.  The emergence of such a pair of seabirds is accompanied by piercing, just jubilant screams.  For a certain time, the egg is on the feet of the female, covered from above by a fold of skin below the abdomen.  Then it passes into the care of the male, while the expectant mother, after 50 days of starvation, swims away for food in the sea.  By July, the penguin returns. </p><p>  The little chick at this time is still covered in fluff and can only swim six months after molting.  But he is already becoming quite curious, trying to get to know the area around him and in 3-4 weeks he begins to occasionally leave the place of his parents.  Sometimes this can end badly, because penguins are child-loving and ready to adopt a baby, which is a little gape. </p><p>  Penguins in appearance are very different from adults, held individuals.  They are grayish in color, with a white muzzle and a black cap on their heads.  After 6 months, the second down cover of the chicks is replaced by feather.  The molting period lasts more than one month.  During this period of time, penguin adolescents stand motionless in secluded places, do not eat food and suffer heavy losses in body weight.  Since the beginning of January, both young and adult emperor penguins have been swimming in the sea. </p>
