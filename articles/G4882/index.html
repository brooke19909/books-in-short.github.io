He made a huge contribution to the development of Christian history and became the author of the great works that formed the basis of Christian teaching. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Both the place and date of birth of Eusebius of Caesarea can be determined only approximately.  Most likely, this event occurred in Caesarea Palestinian tentatively in 260 AD  The name of his teacher has been preserved; he was Presbyter Pamphilus, who gave his ward a good education.  He took a direct part in the formation of the Christian library of his teacher and gradually turned into an archivist, a researcher who painstakingly studied the works that ancient Greek historians, Roman philosophers, and witnesses of the apostolic times left behind.  In gratitude to his teacher, Eusebius attributed the name of his mentor to his own. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eusebius of Caesarea" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1279633.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Wanderings </h2><p>  The beginning of the third century was terrible for all followers of Christian doctrine.  Emperor Diocletian set out to revive pagan beliefs and organized the persecution of Christians in all Roman provinces.  Escaping from the persecutors, the student of Pamphilus traveled through all the nooks of the empire.  Later wanderings were regarded by opponents of the theologian as evading the trials from which Eusebius of Caesarea fled. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The chronicle of his wanderings covers a large period of time.  In his travels, the theologian visited Egypt, Phenicia, Palestine, saw the authorities brutally cracking down on Christians.  From 307 to 309 he was in prison with his teacher, survived the death of Pamphilus and, in the end, was released.  In 311, his place of residence became Tire Phoenician - the capital of the province of the same name.  There he met the local Bishop Pavlin and in 313 he was ordained a bishop. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="gospel interpretation" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277996.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Church History </h2><p>  All this time, the future bishop selected and sorted materials for the future book.  He wanted to create a voluminous religious work of Eusebius of Caesarea.  Church History is the main work of the theologian.  The first eight books were written back in the period of wandering and imprisonment.  Two more final parts were later completed. </p><p>  ‚ÄúChurch History‚Äù represents the first attempt to assemble Christian traditions into one coherent chronological system.  For his work, Eusebius of Caesarea processed the works and extracts of various historians and theologians of an earlier period.  A significant role in this was played by the books of his youth.  The library of the friend and teacher Pamphilus provided an opportunity for the researcher to use the works of direct witnesses of the apostolic time.  The work began from ancient times, which preceded the appearance of Christ, and ended with the modern deeds of Christian society. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eusebius of Caesarea Church History" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1277993.jpg" width="410"></div>

This is the name of science that explains faith in terms of rationality.  Simultaneously with the ‚ÄúChurch History‚Äù, works were created that later served as the basis for scholasticism and which allowed a rational interpretation of the gospel.  Between 310-315  a whole series of books was written confirming the appearance of the messiah and proving the divine origin of Christ.  Of these, ‚ÄúGospel evidence‚Äù and ‚ÄúGospel preparation‚Äù have come down to our time, however, only in translations. </p><h2>  Christian position </h2><p>  The theological works and Christian zeal with which Eusebius of Caesarea related to his episcopal mission made him a prominent figure among religious philosophers.  His speech about the opening of the basilica in Tire was noted by contemporaries.  At their request, Eusebius of Caesarea included this sermon in the tenth volume of Church History.  He was closely acquainted with Arius, whose teachings were later recognized as heresy, but did not share the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãArianism.  Nevertheless, he opposed the excommunication of Aria. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient greek historians" class="if" height="475" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1278006.jpg" width="600"></div>  At <span>the Council of Antioch in</span> 325, such a position was regarded as a division of heretical teaching.  As a result, Eusebius of Caesarea himself refused the excommunicated.  But the Ecumenical Council of 325 not only annulled excommunication, now Eusebius returned to the ranks of church leaders and was able to become the ideological leader of one of the three groups into which those present were divided.  Eusebius tried to justify Aria, but he failed to do this.  Nevertheless, he accepted the canonical interpretation of the gospel, was a direct participant in the discussion of the single symbols of faith, and introduced the concept of ‚Äúconsubstantial‚Äù into the church language.

    <h2>  The formation of canons </h2><p>  The controversy surrounding the significance of the Son and his relationship with his father threatened to drag on for centuries.  <span>Emperor Constantine</span> intervened in the dispute and called the bishops to the Council of Nicaea.  Perhaps it was there that Eusebius of Caesarea first saw Basileus.  Chronicles of the meetings, unfortunately, do not allow you to find out how the greatest and most educated person of his time met.  But there is indirect evidence of such a rapprochement.  In the picture depicting the <span>Council of Nicaea,</span> Eusebius occupied one of the most honorable places - on the right hand of Constantine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eusebius of Caesarea" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1278007.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Friendship with the Emperor </h2><p>  Why, then, at the <span>Ecumenical Council,</span> which numbered about three hundred people, did the emperor not find a like-minded person closer than Eusebius of Caesarea?  "The Life of Constantine" does not give an answer to this question.  This book, written by the hand of a theologian after the death of the emperor, presents us with a biography of the Byzantine ruler, generously smeared with the oil of Christianity and humility.  Perhaps Eusebius saw an opportunity to preach Christianity in safe conditions, because he saw too much suffering and death throughout his life.  So, Eusebius convinced himself, he would serve Christ more than through martyrdom and death. </p><p>  Meanwhile, historical chronicles speak of a completely different story: the emperor was a calculating and cynical ruler who was the first to see the advantages of the new faith and, instead of fighting it, decided to adopt Christianity himself.  By this, Konstantin achieved a decrease in resistance among the poor. </p><p>  Christian doctrine preaches humility and submission to the authorities.  In addition, the Basileus received recognition and honor from the followers of the Christian faith.  Thanks to his power and influence, he was able to offer a key position on a complex theological issue, approved the unity of command of God the Father and God the Son. </p><p>  The authority of Constantine was so great that of the three hundred bishops, only two did not sign the new symbol, which later became one of the most important in the Orthodox Christian rite.  Whether there were Eusebius among these two, there is no answer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Eusebius of Caesarea Chronicle" class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/1278009.jpg" width="300"></div>
