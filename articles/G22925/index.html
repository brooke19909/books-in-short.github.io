    <p>  Kos Island is a fabulous place.  And the hotel complex Kipriotis Village 4 is located on the east coast, very close to the beaches of the Aegean Sea.  By the way, the village on whose territory the hotel is located is called Psalidi. </p><p>  The undoubted advantage of the hotel is that it is located near the large resort town of Kos.  The distance to the city center is only three kilometers - it is easy to get there by taxi, bus, car or even bicycle.  By the way, a public transport stop is located just a few minutes walk from the main hotel building.  But the international <span>airport of Kos</span> is a little further - 25 kilometers. </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  The hotel complex Kipriotis Village Resort 4 has a rather large private territory - its area is about 135 thousand square meters.  In the center is the main building with rooms and a reception desk, and around it are small two-story buildings.  It is worth noting that the architecture of the complex perfectly combines the national flavor and original modern styles. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The hotel was opened in 1994.  The last thorough restoration was carried out in 2008, so today the resort complex is equipped with all the necessary innovations. </p><p>  By the way, the territory is beautifully arranged: there are wide tiled paths for walking, and palm trees, in the shade of which you can have a great time, as well as secluded arbors, bright flower beds and real art compositions from exotic plants.  This is what the Kipriotis Village 4 hotel looks like. </p><p>  Psalidi is a great place for a beach holiday.  Every year couples with children come here, as well as youth companies who want to have fun.  In addition, an unforgettable romantic vacation can be organized at the hotel - often the hotel becomes a place for a honeymoon. </p><h2>  Rooms at the hotel: description </h2>

    <p>  The picturesque pebble beach is located very close to the Kipriotis Village 4 hotel complex. Kos is a hospitable island that is famous not only for its clean beaches and warm sea, but also for its mild climate.  This is what awaits all travelers.  Of course, loungers and sun loungers are placed on the shore.  There are umbrellas and a rental of beach towels here - these services are paid separately, but the prices here are more than reasonable.  By the way, the descent into the sea is smooth and safe, but since the bottom is still covered with pebbles, it is best to take care of suitable shoes. </p><p>  Fans of more active types of recreation will not have to be bored either.  All sorts of water rides await you at the beach, including boating, canoeing, boats, water skiing, parachuting, etc.  These services are paid, but again the prices are quite affordable. </p>
