Over the past few years, a large number of tourists have been visiting its surroundings.  But they do not go to admire the unique landscape and beautiful natural landscapes.  The reason for the tourist pilgrimage was the hot spring in Rezh <strong>,</strong> which has healing properties.  It is located in the resort complex "Baden-Baden". </p><h2>  What are the benefits </h2><p>  The discovery of thermal springs dates back to 1933.  They are located among perennial pines in the territory where industrial pollution has not yet reached.  Water rises from a depth exceeding 200 meters and enters the water reservoirs.  In this case, temperature indicators remain in the range from 35 to 39 degrees.  Passing through the earth's relief enriches the <span>hot spring in</span> Rezh with useful substances that help in the fight against ailments. </p><p>  In the composition of water, macro- and microelements, minerals (including radon) were found that help the body withstand various diseases associated with: </p><ul><li>  musculoskeletal system; </li><li>  skin integument; </li><li>  bone and muscle tissue; </li><li>  internal organs. </li></ul><p>  Also, hot springs located on the territory of the Baden-Baden complex contribute to wound healing, activate regeneration, and help to resist inflammatory processes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hot spring less commonly" class="if" height="299" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1963343.jpg" width="448"></div>

Today it is a developing complex "Emerald Coast", which is gradually being rebuilt on the site of an old sanatorium, opened in the 50s of the last century.  Over the entire period of functioning, the health resort, which did not change its name, experienced several unpleasant moments. </p><p>  Despite the fact that the main therapeutic agent in Rezh were hot springs, the Emerald Coast after the collapse of the Union was out of work.  The hydropathic center was idle and was slowly falling apart.  On the banks of the Rezh reservoir, instead of a health resort, there were ruins. </p><p>  The situation changed in 2012, when a group of companies began to restore the hydropathic.  After 2 years, the Emerald Coast has already received its first visitors.  The hot springs <strong> </strong>  scored with renewed vigor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dir hot springs emerald beach" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1963345.jpg" width="447"></div>

    <h2>  Modern realities </h2><p>  The new owners of the complex managed not only to restore the hydropathic establishment, but also to bring it to a new level.

Qualified specialists will help to improve their health and prevent the exacerbation of chronic diseases with the help of a whole range of measures: </p><ul><li>  detailed diagnostics; </li><li>  Spa treatments; </li><li>  dry carbon dioxide and mud baths; </li><li>  healing soul; </li><li>  hirudotherapy; </li><li>  various types of massage; </li><li>  stay in halochamber and others. </li></ul><p>  The hot spring in Rezh helps to get rid of: </p><ul><li>  from diseases of the respiratory system and heart; </li><li>  from disorders of the nervous system; </li><li>  from allergies and skin diseases; </li><li>  from diseases of the musculoskeletal system. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hot springs baden baden" class="if" height="297" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1963346.jpg" width="448"></div></li></ul><h2>  Positive and negative points </h2><p>  Tourists who have already visited the Baden-Baden hot spring in Rezh, note the high level of qualification of medical personnel, the availability of modern equipment and competent procedures.  The lack of handrails in the hydromassage area in the outdoor pool causes some inconvenience.  People whose weight does not exceed 60 kg are ‚Äúcarried away‚Äù by pressure.  Also, rubber mats at the sides would not be in the way, so that it would not be so slippery. </p><p>  An excellent decision on the part of the management was made in the organization of the sauna, Russian bath, hamam and aroma sauna.  You can choose for every taste.  True, there are drawbacks - these are small rooms and poor lighting, and another part of the premises is not completely renovated.  But the restoration of the hydropathic facility is not yet completed, and it is hoped that after a couple of years there will be no trace of the former dilapidated sanatorium. </p><p>  In the meantime, those who are going to visit the hot spring in Rezh have a few tips.  During a vacation in the sanatorium "Emerald Coast", you need: </p><ul><li>  get a consultation and permission from a doctor in advance; </li><li>  strictly observe the rules of staying in the pool; </li><li>  follow recommendations when visiting procedures; </li><li>  listen to the comments of service and medical personnel. </li></ul><p>  The spa resort recreation area at the hot springs in Rezh will give not only pleasant leisure, but also help to improve health. </p>
