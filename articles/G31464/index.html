  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The modern scientific picture of the world as a result of the evolution of scientific knowledge</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The modern scientific picture of the world is just one of the possible that can be present in the human mind and determine it.  Coexisting with all other paintings - theological, mythological, philosophical, it is somewhat similar to them, contains a common characteristic of other paintings, but also includes a number of fundamental features of its manifestation and impact on the consciousness and worldview of a person. </p><p>  The modern scientific paradigm of the world is based on a naturally <span>scientific picture of the world,</span> containing the basic ideas of people about <span>space, time,</span> nature, man and his place in this all.  Actually, all these problems are present in other pictures of the world, so our ability to single out this very ‚Äúscientific‚Äù in order to correctly identify our cognitive motives and interests seems to be the most important. </p><p>  The problem only initially, it seems, is quite simple, because we are all familiar with the main provisions of the modern world model from the school bench.  However, until now, the philosophy and <span>methodology of science have</span> not been able to give an unambiguous and final answer to the question of what is science and what is not. </p><p>  Some philosophers, representatives of positivist and neopositivist schools, argued that the modern scientific picture of the world is separated from the unscientific by a marking sign.  Such signs have consistently been the <span>principles of verification</span> and falsification of fact. </p><p>  Other philosophical schools (sophists, scholastics) found the main difference in the method of thinking, and the third - in the use or non-use of mathematical research methods.  But whatever method of differentiation would be applied, in the end, it became obvious that they did not give a clear answer.  For example, everyone knows that in extra-scientific fields it is appropriate to use methods of scientific analysis and interpretation of facts and vice versa, many scientific phenomena still do not find any evidence or refutation achieved using scientific methodology.  Thus, it became apparent that the <span>signs of science</span> are a certain integrity, a system of properties that are present in various combinations and proportions and in other areas that lie far from any branch of scientific knowledge. </p><p>  Science, as an integral system of knowledge and ideas about the most common signs, properties and laws of the universe, was formed as a result of the classification and generalization of some natural science concepts.  The classical scientific picture of the world was formed on the basis of interdisciplinary concepts that tried to give answers to the essential questions about the world.  The vast majority of these concepts included ideas about substance (matter) and the forms of its movement and development, about space and time, about causality, laws and interactions, and ideas about the Cosmos. </p><p>  As a result of the synthesis of separate, ‚Äúsectoral‚Äù pictures of the world ‚Äî geo- and heliocentric, electrical and mechanistic, atomic and cosmological, a modern scientific picture of the world has evolved.  It is based on the achievements of modern science and has a number of features that distinguish it from the prevailing ones.  Among the main such features can be called systematic, the ability to self-organization and self-reproduction, <span>global evolutionism</span> and historicity.  These signs simultaneously act as principles for constructing a model of a scientific picture, because they reflect the fundamental laws of the existence of nature. </p><p>  These essential characteristics of the modern understanding of the world order in its main features correspond to the level of scientific knowledge achieved at the moment. </p>
