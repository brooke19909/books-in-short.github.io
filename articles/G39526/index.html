    <h2>  Spain: photos, beaches </h2><p>  If you want to combine a visit to historical monuments with an unforgettable vacation by the sea, then go to this European country.  Indeed, in Spain there are continental, island, pebble, sand and even white beaches.  Some of them are wide and long, washed by the waves, others are small, secluded and calm.  However, there is one characteristic feature for almost all Spanish beaches - the presence of a blue flag, which symbolizes environmental cleanliness.  In addition, the accompanying infrastructure is well developed everywhere, which will make your stay rich and unforgettable. </p><p>  I would immediately like to draw attention to the fact that all, including the good beaches of Spain, are publicly accessible and free, unlike, for example, Turkey, where most of the coast is divided between hotels.  So here you can safely go to any beach you like.  The only thing you have to pay for is renting a sunbed and an umbrella.  However, you can take everything you need with you and settle down on a part of the coast that is not occupied by sunbeds for rent.  We offer to stay on the best beaches of this European country. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Spain - Costa Dorada beaches </h2><p>  Costa Dorada in translation from Spanish means "Gold Coast".  This region received its name for its picturesque sandy beaches, sparkling and shimmering in the sun.  Costa Dorada is a great place for people who lead an active lifestyle and go in for sports.  So, there are all conditions for windsurfing, sailing, as well as for golf and tennis, horse riding and fishing.  Costa Dorada has some very good beaches in Spain, perfect for families.  After all, the sea here is very warm and shallow, and the famous Port Aventura theme park is located nearby.  Along the coastline of the Costa Dorada are mountain ranges that reliably protect the coast from sudden temperature changes.  But the swimming season is not as long as in other parts of Spain.  In addition, in the summer it often rains. </p>

    <h2>  Costa Calida Coast </h2><p>  Considering the best <span>beaches in Spain,</span> one can not help but mention Costa Calida, located on the territory of one of the most promising resorts of this country - La Manga.  Of particular note is its location.  So, it is a 20-kilometer sandy ‚Äúsleeve‚Äù washed by the waves of the Mediterranean Sea on one side and the waters of the Mar Menor Lagoon (translated from Spanish as ‚ÄúLittle Sea‚Äù) on the other.  Thus, on the same day you have the opportunity to swim in two seas at once. </p><p>  The lagoon Mar Menor is shallow.  The content of iodine and salt is very high here, which makes the water temperature two degrees higher than in the Mediterranean Sea.  Taking sea baths in Mar Menor, you will not only get great pleasure, but also improve your body, because with its healing properties the local water is not inferior to the world famous Dead Sea. </p><h2>  Beaches of Torrevieja </h2><p>  When choosing the good beaches of Spain for a vacation, be sure to pay attention to the city of Torrevieja.  This place is literally the sunniest in all of Europe, because the sun shines here 350 days a year.  Within the city, several beaches stretch along the coastline: Los Lokos, La Mata, Asekien, de Cura, Punta Prima and Naufragos.  All of them have a very nice fine golden sand.  The coast of Torrevieja, thanks to the picturesque rocky landscape and numerous small secluded bays, is very beautiful.  City beaches have all the necessary infrastructure for a comfortable and varied vacation: scooter, catamaran rental, cafes, bars and restaurants, medical care points, shops, sunbeds, umbrellas, etc. </p>

    <h2>  Guademar Beach </h2><p>  A resort called Guardemar de Segur, located in the Spanish province of Alacante, can safely be called a typical Mediterranean "beach paradise."  At the height of the tourist season, up to 200 thousand tourists come to this small town.  The local excellent sandy beach stretches for 11 kilometers.  Those who want to isolate themselves for a while from the noise and crowds reigning on city beaches can take a walk to the so-called ‚Äúfree beach‚Äù.  This place fully justifies its name, since here you can not only sunbathe "in what the mother gave birth", but also bring pets here. </p><h2>  Costa Brava Coast </h2><p>  This resort is located in the Spanish province of Catalonia.  Due to the fact that the <span>Pyrenees mountains</span> are located very close <span>, the</span> sun here is not so scorching as in other regions of the country.  As for the coastline, it is dotted with cliffs that form picturesque small bays and capes.  If you wish, you can always find a secluded bay and relax in peace and quiet on a clean sandy beach.  Costa Brava is great for people who are fond of sports.  Here you can play golf or tennis, ride a horse, go diving or windsurfing, and go fishing. </p>

    <h2>  Nudist beaches </h2><p>  Interestingly, Spain is one of the most visited countries, not only ordinary tourists, but also nudists.  This is not surprising, because in this country for almost half a century there have been beaches on which there is no place for clothes specially designed for naked vacationers.  So, one of the most popular places with nudists is a club-hotel called Vera Playa, located in the northern part of Andalusia on the Costa Almeria.  Here is located not only a three-kilometer nudist beach, but also a nudist settlement is expanding.  I must say that if you like to walk naked, then a more comfortable place both for relaxation and for living, you probably cannot be found not only in Spain itself, but throughout Europe. </p><p>  Several beaches, designed for people who are free from complexes, are located on the island of Ibiza.  Among them, Playa de Cavale and Aikis Blanquis can be highlighted. </p>
