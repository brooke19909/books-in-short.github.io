The concept of development of additional education of children</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  No one doubts that the <span>additional education of the</span> child is a good basis for easier assimilation of material in educational institutions.  The basic program of the school does not guarantee the successful admission of a child to a prestigious educational institution, since it is designed for an average level.  For this reason, there is a training system in accordance with the document "Concept for the development of additional education of children." </p><h2>  Concept: General </h2><p>  The concept defines the goals and objectives of continuing education, its condition and problem areas, as well as the direction of development of children and the expected result. </p><p>  The document establishes the basic principle for the development of supportive education, including a guarantee for a safe and quality education.  The core element of continuing education is the program, not the learning organization. </p><p>  The concept is implemented in two stages: </p><ul><li>  Stage I involves the development of measures and the creation of management mechanisms, financing, information support for the Concept. </li><li>  Stage II is focused on the continuation of the implementation of action plans and programs for the development of additional training. </li></ul><p>  The main objective of the Concept is the problem of maximum coverage of children from 5 to 18 years in the system of additional education in order to ensure maximum adaptation to real life conditions. </p><h2>  Additional education from birth </h2><p>  Additional education of children up to a year is not carried out in special institutions due to age.  But any parent can cope with this task independently.  At this age, you can already teach your child swimming or focusing on certain subjects. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  If you conduct classes with the baby, he will be able to get ahead of his peers in overall development.  Therefore, additional education of children is relevant from birth.  Mugs, sections and clubs can be of a family type, where parents of newborns get acquainted with new trends in caring for children of this age and their upbringing. </p><h2>  The need for additional education for children </h2><p>  Additional education of the child provides a good incentive for general education and increase mental activity.  The need for such classes is indicated by the observations of educators on the success of children. </p><ul><li>  The guys develop a desire to work for future high results. </li><li>  The various interests of children that are not related to educational activities in an educational institution are realized. </li><li>  Increases incentive for classes and self-education. </li></ul>

But in standard educational institutions, similar work is carried out with children who wish to receive additional education.  The main objective of the process is the harmonious interweaving of the general training program with the formation of the personality as a whole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The main courses of education for children depend on the capabilities of the institution.  The following popular areas can be distinguished: </p><ul><li>  technical; </li><li>  scientific and chemical; </li><li>  aesthetic and artistic; </li><li>  fitness and fitness; </li><li>  biological and environmental; </li><li>  economic and legal; </li><li>  tourist. </li></ul><p>  This is not a complete list of areas in which additional education of the child is carried out.  It is possible to educate children after school using various technologies created by the teacher of such an institution, for example, a foreign language can be studied not only by memorization, but also thanks to interactive technologies or the game process. </p><h2>  Additional education in a preschool </h2><p>  Preschool is the first step on the way of the child to education.  Additional education of children before graduation provides the maximum development of abilities for this age, aimed at finding talent and the general development of the child both physically and psychologically. </p>

    <p>  When organizing work on auxiliary education in kindergarten, the following factors are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  age characteristics of groups of children; </li><li>  general interest and voluntary choice of a child when visiting a circle or section; </li><li>  solving educational problems through additional education of the child. </li></ul><p>  Such training in a preschool is mainly aimed at teaching kids a creative approach to various ideas, finding new interests and improving their physical fitness. </p><p>  As a rule, adults can observe the result in the results of exhibitions, concerts, during sporting events. </p><h2>  Additional education at school </h2><p>  Additional education of children at school is called extracurricular activities.  This type of training can be divided into several models depending on the personnel and material capabilities of the educational institution. </p><ul><li>  The first model is the presence of a variety of circles and sections whose work is not interconnected.  It is precisely because of this problem that there are no lines for the strategic development of education, which quite strongly affects the quality of additional education for children.  But even in this form, the overall development of children attending such societies is much higher due to the general employment of schoolchildren in their free time. </li><li>  The second model has the internal organization and original methods of work of teachers, which can be used in the general educational plan of the school. </li><li>  The third model, which is used to build additional education for the child, is aimed at the common work of several institutions on an ongoing basis.  The school works closely with various sections and jointly develops <span>additional educational programs.</span>  The main result of such cooperation is a conscious choice of profession by graduates and easy entry to universities in the corresponding profile. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Difficulties of continuing education </h2><p>  Despite the adopted concept of continuing education, there are some problems in its implementation, among which are the following: </p><ul><li>  insufficient provision of the material base of the educational institution; </li><li>  general unpreparedness of the teaching staff in matters of the general standard of education; </li><li>  lack of decent pay for teachers. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, to receive additional education for children, parents turn their attention to private centers or organizations.  But this factor may not give the desired result due to the fact that teachers still receive education in structures that have the same educational standards. </p>
