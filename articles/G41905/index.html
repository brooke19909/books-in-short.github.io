    <p>  The device operates on an ELM327 microprocessor with Bluetooth version 1.5 or Wi-Fi.  It works without failures and errors, even on foreign cars.  The software has special sound support, advanced functionality.  As a rule, applications from third-party developers have more features and options than in official programs.  After customers check many utilities that come both for free and for a fee, it can be distinguished that it is convenient to work with the scanner via a smartphone on Android and IOS, or on a computer running Windows.  There are, of course, programs on Mac OS, as well as on Linux.  For this type of controller there is a huge amount of software.  Both ordinary programmers and official manufacturers are engaged in their development. </p><h2>  Application examples for the adapter </h2><p>  In order to check and diagnose a car, you need to download the application.  You can choose any program from those presented on the Internet for your operating system, but it is better to use a free and proven option.  Utilities such as DashCommand, Scantool, Scanmaster and so on can be noted.  They have similar functionality, but have a nuance.  It lies in the interface, so each person will have to choose the program that he likes. </p><h2>  What to do after installing the program? </h2><p>  After installing the software, you must run the wireless protocol on the device (on a smartphone, tablet or computer), and the adapter itself must be included in the diagnostic connector.  After it is connected, it is necessary to activate the device via Bluetooth or WiFi.  The first time, unfortunately, the analysis takes quite a while.  Autoscanner Scan Tool Pro (positive feedback from the owners about the work) is trying to get information about the technical characteristics and full condition of the car.  The following downloads will occur in just a few seconds.  Most of the parameters are updated in real time, as thanks to streaming, all information is synchronized instantly. </p>

    <p>  In order to download this function, you must click on the special button in the housing, which will enable this device to be activated.  In addition to the above operations, the described device is used to diagnose a car with the following malfunctions: </p><ul><li>  gearbox breakdown; </li><li>  poor engine performance; </li><li>  the appearance of signals from sensors, which indicates a disadvantage; </li><li>  during maintenance work. </li></ul><p>  Many car enthusiasts advise using this particular scanner for car diagnostics when buying used cars. </p><h2>  Car Brand Compatibility List </h2><p>  It is necessary to buy this device for independent verification, since it can work with several protocols at once.  We are talking about encryption ISO 9142. It is used in European and Japanese machines.  Another protocol (ISO 1430) is used in Hyundai and Gazelle freight and passenger vehicles.  This is confirmed by real reviews about Scan Tool Pro. </p><p>  A similar protocol is often used on cars from VAZ.  Encryption Can is considered the most common option that is found in cars from Ford, Volkswagen, Peugeot, Nissan and so on.  American cars and Mazda use protocols such as VIW. </p><p>  In general, this device will work with the machine if it was manufactured in the USA after 1996, and in the Russian Federation from 2003-2005.  If we are talking about a European car with a gasoline engine, then support for this device will be possible on vehicles that are produced after 2001, and on a diesel engine - after 2004. </p><h2>  The popularity of such devices </h2><p>  If we talk about the popularity of all universal scanners, then this device was not in special demand until 2015.  Since <span>budget cars</span> at that time were not supported by programs, drivers simply did not know that there was a cheap way to diagnose their car.  Serviceability scanners have become popular since 2016, and in 2017, these devices became leaders in the sales market. </p><h2>  Owner reviews about the Smart Scan Tool adapter </h2><p>  In positive reviews, people note that with an excellent set of programs, the Smart Scan Tool has an excellent ability to scan the machine for a low cost.  This device received a multifunctional interface, like any other multi-brand scanners.  It outperforms the rest in that it is compact in size and as easy to use as possible. </p>

    <p>  You can also find negative reviews.  As a rule, buyers fall for fakes, respectively, this device has much less functionality, as well as a short life.  That is why there can be negative reviews. </p><p>  The Scan Tool Pro scanner, whose average price is 3500 rubles, is best purchased only at official points of sale.  When buying, you need to pay attention to the price tag.  The real amount for the chip on which this device works is 2 thousand rubles, so all devices sold at a lower cost can be considered fake. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What can be said in conclusion?  This device is advised by most car owners.  It is as simple and convenient to use as possible.  Serves more than five years.  His work is really surprising - not a single mistake in several years of operation.  It should be recalled once again that fakes should be avoided as much as possible, which will spoil the whole impression of this car scanner.  Separately praised and the manufacturer for such an amazing device. </p>
