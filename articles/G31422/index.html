Intermediaries work with property owners, as well as those wishing to get it for rent.  However, not everyone knows how to rent an apartment.  This is exactly what is described in the article. </p><h2>  Through an agency </h2><p>  When the first time you have to deal with obtaining real estate for rent, people usually turn to special companies.  It is best to choose an organization on the recommendation of relatives or friends.  How to rent an apartment through an agency?  Professionals must find suitable housing, so it is important to state your requirements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="erasmusu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment" class="if uuid-2275541" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2275541.jpg"></div><p>  Then, suitable options are selected and appointments are made to view housing.  Agency specialists must accompany the client in these cases.  And during the execution of the contract they conduct all negotiations.  Agency staff advises on issues of interest. </p><p>  A specialist checks the property documents.  If everything is correct, then a lease is concluded, an acceptance certificate is drawn up, which contains an inventory of the housing property.  Specialist services usually cost 50-100% of the price of housing per month. </p><h2>  Types of Fraud </h2><p>  How to rent an apartment so that the transaction was completed by law?  Familiarize yourself with common fraudulent activities that should be avoided: </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Photos are not real.  Particular attention should be paid to cases of discrepancy between the price of rental housing and its repair.  If the pictures show elite interiors, and the cost is average or below market, then it is likely that they are scammers.  They can say that this apartment is rented out and recommend another.  To check if photos have been taken from other sites, then matches can be determined using the Google Images service.  False ads are created to form a customer base. </li><li>  The apartment is fictitious.  Care must be taken when filling out contracts.  It is important to check all the information, even if the transaction is made with the help of a realtor.  Often there are times when the addresses recorded in the contract do not exist, and people have to pay rent without housing.  In this case, there is the right to terminate the lease unilaterally by sending a letter to the landlord.  There are such cases that for a fee customers are provided with landlord numbers, but they do not negotiate and do not accompany. </li><li>  Paid inspection.  No one can demand money for viewing housing.  If this is offered by a realtor, then he makes money like that, but he is not interested in deals.  Often on these tricks, people from small towns and villages get to. </li><li>  Resale of housing.  Tenants may not settle or temporarily settle other persons, as well as take a deposit, fee, commission.  How to rent an apartment with the owner?  It is necessary to check the documents on the right to housing. </li><li>  Offer to purchase a customer base.  Those wishing to rent a property are offered access to the online database of owners.  The realtor can convince that the database is updated every day, but after gaining access to it, it will be found that the information is outdated. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.interrelo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment for a long time" class="if uuid-2275549" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2275549.jpg"></div><h2>  Independently </h2><p>  How to rent an apartment without intermediaries?  To do this, you need to look for ads from the owners, and not from real estate companies.  If you liked the offer, you need to make an appointment and inspect the property. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Ads can be searched on newspapers, on the Internet.  They are also hung at stops.  Although in this case, too, there are many dangers, but still many people do not want to turn to realtors. </p><h2>  Pros and cons of hiring without intermediaries </h2><p>  Renting real estate without the involvement of intermediaries has advantages and disadvantages.  To determine how to act, you need to study all sides of the issue.  Self-eating has the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  Savings due to the lack of additional costs for mediation. </li><li>  Joint hiring with friends and sharing the size of the payment. </li><li>  Bargaining with the owner and reducing payment. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.arlettipartners.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment so as not to be deceived" class="if uuid-2275550" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2275550.jpg"></div><p>  All these points will help to save a large sum on getting a rented apartment.

Verification of payment receipts and electricity and water meters is carried out before the conclusion of the contract. </p><h2>  Owner Permission </h2><p>  If the property has several owners, then the consent of all is required (upon reaching 14 years).  The contract of employment must be the signature of the owners or the signature of an authorized person who has a special power of attorney. </p><p>  When renting a room in a communal apartment, permission from the neighbors is required.  This is the landlord's concern.  He must provide a document confirming the right to use this apartment.  This will eliminate potential conflicts. </p><h2>  Contract </h2><p>  How to rent an apartment in order not to be deceived?  It is necessary to carefully check the documentation.  The lease must include the following information: </p><ol><li>  F. I. O. and passport details of the owner, tenant. </li><li>  Rental fee. </li><li>  Terms of payment changes. </li><li>  The number of visits by the owner to check. </li><li>  Persons who can stay with the tenant. </li><li>  Deadline. </li><li>  Terms of termination of the contract. </li><li>  Description of housing: address, area, number of rooms. </li></ol><p>  In each case, the contract is individual, there is no standard form.  It is important that it contains the rights and obligations of the parties. </p><h2>  Property Description </h2><p>  It indicates the property transferred to the lessee for temporary use.  The inventory is an annex to the contract.  It needs to include furniture, appliances, linens, kitchen utensils, dishes, carpets and more.  In the event of loss or damage to items that are not listed in the inventory, the owner will not be able to return them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.short-term-renting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment through an agency" class="if uuid-2275557" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2275557.jpg"></div><h2>  Meet the neighbors </h2><p>  How to rent an apartment so that no unforeseen situations arise in the future?  Meet your neighbors.  So it turns out to establish whether the housing belongs to a particular person.  Neighbors can tell who lived before, how often tenants change.  If the house is new, you can visit the local housing office and find out the name of the owner, as well as other information of interest. </p><h2>  Rights and obligations of the parties </h2><p>  According to Russian laws, in-line repair of a room, for example, leaking taps, peeling off wallpaper or cracked plumbing, is being repaired by the landlord.  Therefore, you need to indicate that the elimination of defects in the premises should be carried out at the expense of the owner of the real estate, for example, due to a monthly payment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vipwarhammergold.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="apartment rental how to rent" class="if uuid-2275561" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2275561.jpg"></div><p>  If this is not fixed in the contract, then the tenant will have to independently eliminate the shortcomings.  The owner can check the condition of the house, but this does not mean that he can come at any time - you need to agree on when and how contact will take place. </p><h2>  Rental rules </h2><p>  How to rent an apartment if several suitable options are found?  It is important to check the documents, the availability of contact information.  The apartment must have an Internet connection: you should find out the rules for paying for this service. </p><p>  During the inspection of the room, you need to check the condition of the plumbing, electrical wiring.  The main thing is that the plugs should not be knocked out with a minimum set of devices connected.  Cockroaches, bugs and other insects should not be found in the room. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to rent an apartment without intermediaries" class="if uuid-2275565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44565/2275565.jpg"></div><p>  How to rent an apartment for a long time?  When planning a long stay, you need to clarify all the details.  Do not rush.  If any shortcomings have been identified, you should find out at whose expense the repair and elimination will be carried out.  It is important that you write down the emergency numbers for various issues.  The issue of furniture should be resolved.  Since the cost of renting in the market is unstable, it is undesirable to draw up a contract for a long period at a fixed cost. </p><p>  At the time of signing the document, the owner of the premises transfers the set of keys that needs to be checked.  Typically, the contract is valid for 1 year without 1 day.  This is a short-term lease and reduces the likelihood of shared tenants.  To extend the contract, you must sign an agreement one month before the expiration date. </p>
