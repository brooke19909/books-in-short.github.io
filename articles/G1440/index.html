Tourists from Russia often prefer other exotic places in the Mediterranean.  Most likely, this is due to the lack of domestic charter flights to this part of the world.  You can get there by ferry. </p><p>  From a long distance, this island is no different from others, dozens of which are in the <span>Ionian Sea.</span>  It has a relatively small mountainous territory, which is inhabited by several thousand inhabitants.  The capital and port of the island is the city of Wafi, the appearance of which indicates that the epic Odysseus once ruled on this modest piece of land. </p><h2>  The origin of the name of the island </h2><p>  The name of the island has existed since ancient times.  His celebrity is associated with the work of Homer "Odyssey."  Almost all experts and researchers agree that the modern and Homeric Ithaca is one and the same.  And different definitions of geographical location are connected with the poet‚Äôs ignorance of anything about the features of the island‚Äôs printing house.  Or this is his "poetic fantasy" </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ithaca Island" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/862187.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  There are several versions of the origin of its name in history.  According to one of them, it was named after the first native inhabitant - Ithaki.  Other versions speak of its Phoenician origin. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Greek period of existence of Ithaki </h2><p>  Archaeologists have discovered the oldest finds on the north side of the island.  They date from the early Greek period.  The highest flowering of the island was observed during the Mycenaean era, when Odysseus was the elder of Ithaca.  The kingdom in those days consisted of the islands lying around it and part of mainland Hellas.  Therefore, this small piece of land in the middle of the water has many stories and legends.  According to one of them, Penelope was once here - this is the queen on the island of Ithaca, who had been waiting there for her husband for 20 years.  The inhabitants of this piece of land surrounded by sea waters were sailors.  They swam far beyond the Mediterranean. </p><p>  Over time, the island begins a period of decline.  Ithaca (island) becomes uninteresting for the Dorians. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Queen of Ithaca" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/862195.jpg" width="284"></div>  The main reason for this is the infertility of the local soil.  But the population of the island did not leave anywhere, and began to engage in the cultivation of its northern part.  It becomes a very important center where many trade routes intersect.  There is an economic and cultural upsurge in Ithaca.

    <h2>  Island during the years of Roman rule </h2><p>  Ithaca from 180 BC to 394 AD is the diocese of Illyria.  Christianity was established here in the time of Byzantium.  Then, the construction of Jerusalem was carried out on the island, which is referred to in the work ‚ÄúAlexiada‚Äù by A. Komnina. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since 1086, Vandal, Gothic, Visigothic and Saracen military groups have been raiding.  In 1185, it was captured by Norman representatives.  The Orsini family, which has maintained personal anarchy for 150 years, receives this island from the Normans in 1200.  After that, he becomes the possession of the Venetians. </p><h2>  Venetian rulers on the island </h2><p>  The capture of Ithaca by the Venetians occurred in 1499 after the Turkish-Venetian military events.  According to the 1503 treaty, Ithaca is an island in the possession of Venice. </p><p>  The rulers of the country put a huge amount of effort to revive it.  The land was transferred to the use of local and visiting residents.  New settlers are massively sent here due to the fact that an absolute exemption from all taxes was introduced lasting 5 years.  Since 1697, the island has been ruled by elders.  There is a steady increase in the population of Ithaca, which is becoming quite substantial and important maritime force. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The elder of Ithaca was" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/862196.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <p>  Ithaca - an island with semi-independent Venetians - was the only place where there were no aristocracy and class differences. </p><h2>  French period of existence of Ithaca </h2><p>  After the victory of the French Revolution, all the islands in the Ionian Sea pass into the power of the French.  By the end of 1798 there was an intensive displacement of them by the Russians and Turks.  The creation of the Ionian Republic, which included Ithaca, is taking place.  Its capital was located on the island of Corfu.  From 1807 to 1809  these islands again become subject to the French. </p><h2>  Relations with Greece </h2><p>  Even after the island entered in 1815 into the Ionian Republic, which was under the protection of England, its ties with Greece did not break.  In the Greek uprising of 1821, many islanders became heroes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ithaca Island Greece" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35049/862188.jpg" width="416"></div>

    <p>  More than once they opposed the presence of power in England.  These events became especially active and numerous after Greece freed itself from the Turkish yoke.  And only in 1864 did the English government accept the demand of the islanders.  As a result, they were annexed to Greece. </p><p>  For everyone who arrives, the island of Ithaca (Greece) opens with its own unique and unforgettable side.  And those tourists or ordinary people who have been here at least once in their life come back again and again. </p>
