It allows people to get to their destination without traffic jams and stress without breathing in the exhaust fumes from numerous cars and buses on the streets. </p><p>  Underground construction projects were proposed back in the days when there weren’t even electric trams in the country, and today St. Petersburg metro is a huge network of railways that spans almost the entire city. </p><h2>  History of the Leningrad Metro </h2><p>  Since Moscow became the capital of Russia after the 1917 revolution, the first subway appeared here - in 1935, the opening of the first line took place.  The decision to build a subway in Leningrad was made in 1941, soil samples were taken, the first mines were planned and dug, but the outbreak of war postponed this project for a long time. </p><p>  Only in 1946 was the design of the first lines re-carried out, which they began to lay in 1947. </p>

    <p>  Only 8 years later, in November 1955, the Kirov-Vyborg branch was inaugurated.  It included 7 stations, originating from <span>Vosstaniya Square,</span> Vladimirskaya, Baltic and Narva Streets, to the Kirov Plant and Avtovo.  And when the Pushkin branch was built, the residents and guests of Leningrad got the opportunity to quickly get to such stations as Moscow, Baltic, Warsaw and Vitebsk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since that time, the construction of new metro lines continued as the city grew, new neighborhoods appeared, and on the roads more and more vehicles became available every year.  To date, the length of <span>St. Petersburg metro</span> lines is more than 112 km, united by 65 stations. </p><p>  All lines are numbered and have their own names: </p><ul><li>  1 - Kirovsk-Vyborg - red; </li><li>  2 - the longest Moscow-Petrograd - blue; </li><li>  3 - line Nevsko-Vasileostrovskaya - green; </li><li>  4 - Right-bank - orange; </li><li>  5 - line Frunzensko-Primorskaya - purple. </li></ul><p>  In St. Petersburg there are 10 closed stations in the metro, Zvezdnaya, for example.  They are safe, but their maintenance is more expensive than their single-vault counterparts, which have replaced them since 1975. </p><h2>  Description of the Zvezdnaya station </h2><p>  The theme of space in the USSR was one of the most beloved, therefore, not only films, paintings, books and songs were dedicated to it, but also metro stations.  Zvezdnaya was opened in Leningrad on 12.12.1972 on a blue branch, with access to a nearby street of the same name. </p>

    <p>  This station belongs to the category of deep embedded closed type.  The automation here is configured to simultaneously open the doors on the platform and in the train that arrived.  This makes the platform as safe as possible, since the paths are closed from visitors to the arrival of the train, but, on the other hand, this somewhat delays its sending.  Maintenance of such a station is somewhat more expensive, since automation requires constant attention and system updates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The lobby and walls are decorated with space-related bas-reliefs, one of which is dedicated to Yuri Gagarin. </p><h2>  Residential complex "Salute" </h2><p>  St. Petersburg is in constant development and growth, which is reflected in its new buildings.  The greatest demand is for houses built in the immediate vicinity of the subway.  Modern architects, focusing on multi-story buildings, try to bring the spirit of the historical part of the city into them, so all houses are designed in complementary styles. </p><p>  For example, the residential complex near the Zvezdnaya metro station consists of numerous new buildings and finished houses of a constantly expanding microdistrict.  Buying a home here is an investment in the future, since the entire eastern part of the <span>Moscow district of</span> St. Petersburg is a continuous <span>green zone,</span> inside which houses are located. </p>
