    <h2>  Reviews about staying at the Parus Hotel are negative </h2><p>  Against the backdrop of the excellent reviews of guests, satisfied with the organization of leisure at the Parus Hotel on Stanislavsky Street in Adler, there are, unfortunately, the reviews are not very good, but there are very few of them. </p><ul><li>  There was a precedent when in a hotel with a category of three stars for two people they gave out only two towels, although three should be put.  And despite the fact that the room was cleaned and carried out garbage daily, towels and bed linen were not changed even once. </li><li>  Sometimes there are problems with WIFI. </li><li>  Some consider the lack of electric kettles in the room a drawback. </li><li>  There were cases of check-in not in the rooms that visitors had previously booked.  However, given that all the apartments in the hotel are good, hotel guests did not make any complaints about this. </li><li>  Some guests complained that during the 12 days of rest the floors in the room were washed only three times, the plumbing was never cleaned, and the liquid soap was refilled only after a personal request. </li><li>  Some vacationers find the inconvenience of entering the hotel separate from the reception. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  <span>The Parus Hotel (Adler)</span> has the best price-quality ratio of the services provided among similar Adler hotels.  If you compare with other similar options, then vacationers here for the same money get much more.  Also a great combination of location near the center and at the same time completely noisy.  And one more tip for city guests who like to relax on the beach with educational excursions.  If someone goes on an excursion to Sochi, save all the tickets of their aquariums, museums, parks.  Although tourists are not always warned about this, it often happens that if you, for example, have visited one museum, you will be given a discount in another.  And it is pleasant to end any eventful day in a comfortable room of the Parus Hotel, which many have loved. </p>
