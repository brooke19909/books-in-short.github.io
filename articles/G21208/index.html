    <p>  A brand new phablet Grace S7 appeared on the market a few months ago and has already found its consumer.  In short, the device boasts an intelligent matrix with HD-scans on a 5.5-inch display, a good "stuffing" in the face of the four-core "Media Library" MT6737 series, 2 GB of RAM on board, interesting cameras at 13 and 8 megapixels, as well as support for high-speed LTE protocols. </p><p>  Reviews on <span>the Prestigio</span> Grace S7 LTE <span>phone</span> at large trading floors are mostly positive, so you should take a closer look at the gadget.  Moreover, the price of the device does not exceed 9 thousand rubles, which is a clear plus for the domestic consumer. </p><p>  So, we present to your attention a review of the <span>Prestigio</span> Grace S7 <span>smartphone</span> .  Consider the main characteristics of the device, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as the appropriateness of the purchase.  We take into account the feedback from the owners of the gadget and the opinions of experts in this field. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The device is packed in a brand-recognized box with red and white styling.  The front part is occupied by the image of the phone itself and its name, and the rear is quite a detailed specification along with reviews on the Prestigio Grace S7 LTE.

    <p>  Icons on the side faces reflecting the main features of the gadget and some kind of "chips".  Actually, this is the same specification, only in graphical form.  Stickers, barcodes and other dealer surroundings are glued on the ends. </p><p>  Contents of delivery: </p><ul><li>  Grace S7 phone itself; </li><li>  Charger; </li><li>  micro-USB cable for connecting to a PC and recharging; </li><li>  screen protector; </li><li>  manual and warranty card. </li></ul><p>  The package is modest, but acceptable for its price.  The absence of other accessories such as covers and a headset made it possible to keep the price, and the cost of the device did not exceed the mark of 10 thousand rubles.  Judging by the reviews on the Prestigio Grace S7 Duo LTE, many users complained about the weakness of the charger: loopholes on the plug, loose cable clamp, so it‚Äôs better to buy an intelligent network adapter from the same Samsung or Sony that the demolition doesn‚Äôt know . </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The device turned out to be classic without any bright or remarkable design elements.  But this does not prevent him from looking beautiful and stylish.  Holding the model in hand, it can not be called another Chinese consumer goods. </p>

    <p>  The gadget comes in two variable colors - golden and black.  Reviews of the Prestigio Grace S7 Duo LTE Black are unambiguous: a classic and universal gamut that will suit everyone and everyone.  The dirt on it is not as visible as on light options, and it suits any style and clothes.  Reviews for the Prestigio Grace S7 Duo LTE Gold aren't that flattering.  The color, as they say, is not for everybody, besides, the definition of Gold is not quite suitable here, because the gamma rolls into some kind of creamy shade, and it gives little to natural, namely, golden yellowness. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The case of the device is combined, and the symbiosis of metal and plastic turned out to be very successful.  The device looks a little unusual and at the same time interesting, and covering the front of the glass with 2.5D class glass gives it a share of charm. </p><h2>  Design features </h2><p>  As for the build quality, judging by the reviews on the Prestigio Grace S7 Duo LTE smartphone, consumers have no complaints about it.  There are no squeaks, backlashes, crunches or crushing parts of the case.  Separately, it is worth mentioning the back cover, which is entirely made of metal, but covered with matt plastic around the perimeter.  This solution looks very fresh and adds originality to the gadget. </p>

    <p>  There are no special coatings on the case, but even without them, the phone lies perfectly in the palm of your hand and does not strive to slip out, and metal cools pleasantly in your hands.  By the way, the back cover is monolithic and is removed along with the side faces of the device.  For many users, this moment is at first confusing, because visually it seems that only the central part, and not the entire rear, should depart. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  Under the cover, you can see three familiar interfaces for SIM cards and an external SD drive.  The manufacturer did not become wise and made SIM card slots in one form factor.  Users on this occasion left only positive reviews on the Prestigio Grace S7 LTE.  Not many people appreciated the combined versions of past generations when they had to ‚Äúturn‚Äù a SIM card into either a mini or a micro. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the upper left corner of the rear part there is a peephole of the main camera and an LED flash of the quad format.  The power key and the volume rocker are on the right side.  Users in their reviews of the Prestigio Grace S7 LTE smartphone have repeatedly thanked the designers for the classic arrangement of these elements.  Both left-handed and right-handed people usually hold the phone with their left hand, so this solution looks much more comfortable than other mirror options like Sony or Nokia models. </p><h2>  Interface Features </h2><p>  At the top there is a classic 3.5 mm audio port (‚Äúmini-jack‚Äù) and a micro-USB interface for recharging and / or synchronizing with a personal computer.  On the bottom there is a microphone hole and a perforated speaker grill. </p><p>  The latter, by the way, was not entirely successful.  Users in their reviews of the Prestigio Grace S7 LTE have repeatedly noted that the grate is often clogged with small ‚Äúpocket‚Äù debris, and simple blowing does not help here, you have to take small tweezers, a needle or other device for removing foreign elements. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The device received a pretty good IPS-matrix with an HD-resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  This resolution is quite suitable for the 5.5-inch diagonal of the screen, and the average grain size (267 ppi) does not hurt the eyes at all. </p>

    <p>  The output image is good: the colors are natural and saturated, the margin of contrast and brightness is at a high level, and the viewing angles are maximum for the IPS matrix.  The image is not distorted even at a significant change in angle and does not fade under the rays of light, as well as in well-lit rooms. </p><p>  The only thing users sometimes complained about in their reviews of the Prestigio Grace S7 LTE was the color temperature.  The figures are slightly higher than normal, which makes the colors appear cold.  The factory calibration has let us down to a greater degree, so all those who need a really high-quality picture will need to install a special utility for adjusting color channels.  But for the rest we have a nice image without any criticisms. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  A good set of chipsets is responsible for performance: the Mediatek MT6737 series processor with four cores and the Mali graphics accelerator T720 MP2 series.  Two gigabytes of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory are more than enough for normal and trouble-free operation of the interface.  The latter, by the way, can be significantly expanded after installing external SD-carriers (up to 64 GB). </p>

    <p>  As for games, the smartphone stumbles only on the most ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications.  Most modern toys go without problems, and only some need to be reset graphically to a medium or even minimal level.  There are no problems with multimedia, navigation, surfing and other ordinary functionality: everything works, sounds and plays with bright colors without any lags with friezes.  Users in their reviews on the performance of the smartphone do not complain at all, especially since the price does not allow him to demand something transcendental. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The device received excellent matrices for both cameras.  The main one has a resolution of 13 megapixels and an aperture of F / 2.0, and a selfie tool - 8 megapixels.  Both cameras showed themselves in the best way: autofocus works as it should, the flash is bright and to the point, and the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù interface understands what is happening at once. </p><p>  Detailing the output pictures is quite acceptable.  We can say that the manufacturer squeezed out of the cameras everything that is possible in this price segment.  Also, many users in their reviews note the excellent quality of night photos.  The prefix quad on the flash here is clearly not for the red word, so it works out its name in full. </p><h2>  Standalone time </h2><p>  This indicator can be called one of the clear advantages of the device.  The device received a rechargeable battery with a capacity of 5000 mAh, which is quite enough even for the gluttonous Android platform.  Forums and sites of online stores are full of praises from users about this. </p>

    <p>  If you use the gadget only as a phone and messenger, then it will last a whole week.  Watching videos in high resolution will drain the battery in 10 hours, and on music and radio the battery will last more than two days.  Lovers of serious toys were also lucky: competing analogues will not last more than three hours, and our respondent showed excellent results - 7 hours on the most ‚Äúheavy‚Äù applications.  In a mixed cycle, the phone lasts about a day with a little. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  The Prestigio Grace S7 model turned out to be interesting and, judging by user reviews, successful.  Phablet has a lot of advantages.  Here, there is a good matrix on the screen, and acceptable image quality, and work with LTE networks, as well as autonomy enviable for the Android platform along with an attractive appearance. </p><p>  The performance of the gadget also did not disappoint: it is quite capable of "digesting" all modern applications, albeit taking into account the reset of graphic settings to average values.  There are simply no critical flaws here, and you can close your eyes to all the minor flaws by looking at the cost of the smartphone.  Among other things, the Chinese and one-sided pile of devices, this model is particularly distinguished by high-quality components.  So in its segment this is one of the best options. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  nice and stylish design; </li><li>  excellent build quality and materials used; </li><li>  good performance for its price category; </li><li>  high-quality IPS-matrix; </li><li>  excellent battery life; </li><li>  good cameras and decent shots. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  some users complain about the non-standard arrangement of touch buttons; </li><li>  the speaker grill is clogged with debris. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 9000 rubles. </p>
