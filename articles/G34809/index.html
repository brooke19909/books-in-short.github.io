    <p>  The roundabout guards were only in large cities such as Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod, etc. They reported directly to the district police officer, while they also had city subordinates. </p><h2>  Requirements for candidates </h2><p>  People in the age of 21-40 years were accepted to the public service in the position of a near-guard.  Applicants were required to previously serve in the army or have experience in civil work. </p><p>  The future near-wing should have a good education, be physically developed and, in addition to everything, have a good appearance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="police station" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46025/1551764.jpg" width="309"></div>

    <p>  Suitable candidates in all respects were enrolled in the super reserve, where they underwent training and held an exam at the end.  After successful completion of the commission, the near-circuit warders were transferred to the main staff and received supervised territory (the okolotok). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Salary </h2><p>  The metropolitan police custodian, being in reserve, received a salary of 20 rubles.  When he switched to a vacancy in a police station, the annual income was calculated in three categories and amounted, respectively, to 600, 660 and 720 rubles. </p><p>  For a better understanding of the salary level of this official, one can convert the tsar‚Äôs rubles into the equivalent of the modern Russian currency.  So, the near-constant constant composition of the lowest discharge received 59,431 rubles.  monthly. </p><h2>  Responsibilities of the near-warden </h2><p>  A petty city police officer, who was considered a policeman, performed a whole range of different duties.  He had to go around the site entrusted to him, within which 3000-4000 citizens lived and monitor compliance with the rules of public behavior.  The detailed instructions developed by the city authorities totaled more than 300 pages. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãpolice officer" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46025/1551776.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The roundabout had to know everything about his site.  His job was to identify ‚Äúforeign‚Äù citizens on the territory, draw up protocols in the event of various kinds of offenses. </p><p>  As well as to the modern district police officer, everyone was loyal to the roundabout.  The janitor cleans the snow poorly - the warden is to blame (he did not overlook).  Someone was bitten by a dog - a fellow should find out whose dog it is and take measures to its owners. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The ring guard did not have the right to call the population to his place or apartment.  All inquiries, the preparation of the necessary papers, the delivery of summons, took place, as they say, "in the fields." </p><h2>  The form of the near-guard in tsarist Russia </h2><p>  The roundabout guard relied on a uniform worn by cool ranks.  If he had an officer rank, then his uniform was appropriate.  However, usually he had the rank of sergeant major or senior non-commissioned officer, in this case his uniform was different. </p><p>  The police of the Russian Empire, represented by a near-guard, wore black harem pants with a red edging and the same color double-breasted uniform, fastened with hooks.  The gate, cuff and side were also decorated with red trim. </p><p>  The ceremonial version was completely similar to everyday, except for the columns of silver galun on cuffs. </p><p>  Shoes were <span>lacquered boots,</span> but it was also near-circled that they were allowed to wear galoshes, on the backs of which there were holes for spurs, lined with plates of copper. </p><p>  The fencing warder of the epaulette wore green, decorated in the center with a wide silver stripe. </p><h2>  Weapons and other attributes </h2><p>  As a servant of the law, the Tsarist police officer was supposed to carry weapons.  They wore an officer saber with a silver bandage, a revolver in black lacquer holster or a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metropolitan police guard" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46025/1555496.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is impossible to imagine a booster without his famous whistle.  It was attached to the right side of the uniform and had a long metal chain.  With the help of a prolonged whistle, the guardian of order could call for reinforcements and call for calm the scared citizens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="near-warder epaulettes" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46025/1552740.jpg" width="220"></div>

    <p>  The portfolio is also an integral part of the image of this official.  All kinds of summons and protocols that were written with or without it, implied the constant wearing of this accessory.  Sometimes he lacked a working day to deliver all these papers to the addressees. </p><h2>  Interesting facts from life </h2><p>  The ring guard did not have the right to attend public festivals and festivities as a private person.  He was forbidden to go to taverns and restaurants in his free time and to relax at the tables of drinking establishments in the circle of acquaintances. </p><p>  He could even marry only with the permission of the mayor, this rule extended, by the way, to the city ones. </p><p>  Each time, when leaving the police station, the roundabout guard had to tell his superiors where he was going and where he could be quickly found if necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian Empire Police" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1555665.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Until 1907, the policeman only walked on foot, and after the highest decree of the mayor, the near-circuits could use bicycles, which greatly facilitated their difficult office life. </p><p>  Police officials, among other things, had to attend the theater and understand fiction.  Since 1876, a police officer was present at each performance without fail, sitting in a chair specially reserved for him.  He not only looked after the order during the performance, but also acted as a censor. </p><h2>  Image of a sales official </h2><p>  Being the link between the population and the state machine, the near-circuit one was highly respected.  Before him were traders and traders from numerous shops, and holders of state-owned houses, and ordinary citizens. </p><p>  Such an attitude is provoked by bribery on the part of these representatives of the authorities.  When conducting inquiries, many near-police officers gently hinted that in the case of material gratitude from the suspect, the policeman can close his eyes to many undesirable facts and details. </p><p>  The introduction of prohibition during the First World War was another reason for receiving bribes.  Covering the underground activities of the shinkars, the near-tax had a stable additional source of income, albeit not very legal. </p><p>  In fiction, this petty official is often represented by the narrow-minded, lazy, and biased.  This stereotype regarding the <span>police officer is</span> still alive today.  Although, if you think about it, working in law enforcement agencies both under the tsar and today is a colossal work that is rarely appreciated. </p>
