It turns out they can!  And not only with the well-groomed territory, comfortable rooms and the courtesy of service, we can catch up and overtake the ‚ÄúTurkish coast and Africa‚Äù, but also with the quality of food.  The level of travel services is especially high in the southernmost Black Sea resorts of Russia - in Sochi and Adler.  These places attract vacationers all year round.  There is a ski resort in Sochi Olympic, and winter in the southernmost resort of Russia, Adler, is so mild that it looks more like spring.  The subtropical climate causes the opening of the beach season earlier - from May.  And it continues until the beginning of November.  Are there any boarding houses on the seashore in <span>the Adler resort</span> with meals and, if possible, with a pool?  The answer to this question will be devoted to our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler pensions by the sea with meals" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297647.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The nuances of food in the Black Sea resorts of Russia </h2><p>  Sochi and Adler are not considered budget vacation spots.  And high prices are requested not only for accommodation of visitors.  The average bill at catering establishments in these resorts will also be higher than in the country.  You could even say this: eating in fast food in Sochi for the money is like going to a decent cafe in your hometown.  That's why tourists who come to Adler choose boarding houses on the seashore with meals.  The table and shelter are already paid, and all other money can be spent on entertainment.  In addition, from the case of unforeseen health complications from poor-quality food, you are also insured.  Street shawarma and churchkhela chips are not the kind of food a child needs in the south.  The full-board hotel provides balanced and healthy meals.  For which, we note, you have already paid, and therefore saved from the hassle of finding a decent cafe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler pensions by the sea with food reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297649.jpg" width="600"></div>

Here everyone will find apartments to their liking.  The range of housing prices is also very wide.  But in terms of nutrition, there is one feature.  Small private hotels often do not have their own kitchen.  Guests are invited to seek food in the resort's public areas.  Other hotels operate according to the BB - "bad and blackfest" system.  This means that the price includes breakfast.  Usually this is a rather meager meal, consisting of scrambled eggs and toast with coffee.  Larger holiday homes provide their guests with a choice: stay without meals or order breakfast, half or full board.  Meals can be served as a buffet, on the general or custom menu.  What is more preferable for tourists arriving in Adler?  Pensions on the seafront with food and a swimming pool are an ideal option for relaxing without any problems. </p><h2>  Fiesta Gold </h2><p>  This is a small private guest house.  But why not first consider mini-hotels (Adler) as an option for accommodation.  Pensions on the seafront with meals have a vast territory for which they pay rent.  And this, in turn, affects the cost of living.  If you are not interested in a beautiful park, but simply a comfortable room near the beach and three meals a day, then mini-hotels are the best option.  This cozy, family-run hotel consists of only twenty-eight rooms.  Therefore, each guest is given special attention.  Fiesta Gold is only seventy meters from the sea.  It is located next to the amusement park "Resort Town".  Guests of the mini-hotel are accommodated in comfortable rooms with air conditioning, a refrigerator, a TV and a private bathroom with towels and hygiene items.  The price of accommodation in Fiesta Gold includes three meals a day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler pensions by the sea with food and pool" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297648.jpg" width="600"></div>

Therefore, it is worth considering it to everyone to come to Adler.  Boarding at the seaside with meals do not deserve as many praises as Villa Valentina.  It is interesting that guests are not limited in their choice of room category, from ‚Äúhousekeepers‚Äù to suites, and dining mode.  You can pay only for breakfast, half board or all inclusive.  The hotel has two swimming pools, one of which is heated.  Valentina is a three-minute walk from the sea, on Urozhayna Street.  In walking distance are all the key places of Adler (market, resort town, park "Southern Culture", the railway station).  The rooms of this villa have, in addition to basic services, a hairdryer, air conditioning, satellite TV. </p><h2>  "Dolphin" </h2><p>  If you have a dream to live not just near the beach, but right on the seashore, then <span>this pension</span> is exactly what you need.  "Dolphin" is located on the first line, on Alleynaya street.  It consists of four modern buildings in three floors.  It is located very conveniently, almost in the center of the resort of Adler.  Pensions on the seafront with food can not boast of the fact that they provide their guests with a wellness vacation.  But Dolphin has the necessary medical equipment and specialists to treat its customers.  At the boarding house there is a playground, an outdoor heated pool, equipped with all necessary conference rooms.  Guests are accommodated in clean bright rooms of different price categories.  This boarding house practices three meals a day on the general menu.  Wi-Fi is also available in all rooms. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler pensions by the sea with all-inclusive meals" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Adler, boarding houses by the sea with food.  Buffet or menu? </h2><p>  For many tourists, the words ‚Äúall inclusive‚Äù are associated with meals served in buffet style.  And it is right.  Often, boarding houses that describe their facilities and services on sites are called the words "all inclusive" full board, or three meals a day.  In order for you not to be disappointed, you need to clarify what hoteliers mean by the abbreviation AI.  At the same time, many tourists are looking for pensions on the seafront in the Adler resort with meals a la carte (by individual order).  Of course, if you want to try all the dishes offered by the restaurant, then it is better to choose the all-inclusive system.  But if you want to enjoy exquisite cuisine with quality products, then it is better to stay on a half or full board system with custom-made menu service.  This becomes a necessity if you are allergic to any products, or if you follow a medical or religious diet. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler pensions by the sea with catering table" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297654.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúSpring (spa hotel)‚Äù </h2><p>  This elegant inn is located just fifty meters from the beaches of Adler.  Pensions on the seafront with buffet meals offer their customers an upscale vacation.  In the restaurant of the Vesna Hotel, cooks treat guests with dishes of Russian, Caucasian, European and Japanese cuisine.  But not only with all-inclusive meals, Spring attracts vacationers.  The boarding house has a medical base and qualified medical staff.  Therefore, staying in a boarding house can be compared to relaxing in a sanatorium.  But that is not all.  The price includes use of the pool and treatments in the spa, fitness equipment in the fitness club and much more.  Near the "Spring" is an entertainment complex with an water park "Amphibius".  True, rest in such a boarding house can not be called budget.  Room rates at the height of the season starts with three and a half thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler hotels by the sea with meals" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297655.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sanatorium ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù </h2><p>  If you arrive at the Adler resort in the summer or September, boarding houses on the beach with all-inclusive meals may be crowded.  And the prices for accommodation in them are very dependent on the season.  And some of the guesthouses are closed for the winter.  Sanatorium ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù works year-round.  It stands on the front page of beaches, surrounded by a luxurious subtropical park.  Nearby is a cheerful ‚ÄúResort Town‚Äù with an aqua park, an aquarium, a dolphinarium and various attractions.  The resort attracts an excellent medical base.  There is a pump room with mineral water.  The resort specializes in diseases of the musculoskeletal system, nervous system and circulatory system.  The buildings are located just ten meters from the institution's own beach.  The price includes three meals a day in Swedish format, treatment as prescribed by a doctor, use of swimming pools. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adler pensions by the sea with catering buffet" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1297658.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  The Hunter (Adler) </h2><p>  Pensions by the sea with food reviews of tourists are called the best accommodation option.  In Adler, such housing can be found in any price segment.  You can rent a chic room at the Radisson Blue for four and a half thousand rubles per person per night.  Or be satisfied with a room in a private villa for a thousand and a half.  Optimal in terms of price and quality, the reviews of tourists are called the Okhotnik boarding house.  It stands at the embankment, surrounded by slender cypress trees.  The four-story building has a beautiful winter garden. </p>
