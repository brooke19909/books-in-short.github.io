    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The beach resort Shell Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 4 * is not without its drawbacks.  The reviews contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  the hotel area is poorly lit at night; </li><li>  in the corridors it is very dark, which is why it is difficult to find your number, as well as there is a risk of falling and getting injured; </li><li>  on the balcony - old furniture, which in some places rusted or covered with mold; </li><li>  despite the fact that the presence of a playground is declared, in fact the rides are in a disassembled state; </li><li>  the pool is very slippery; </li><li>  the bathroom does not work well; </li><li>  although a hairdryer is stated in the bathroom, some were missing; </li><li>  from hygiene items, only soap and toilet paper are provided (no shampoo, no shower gels); </li><li>  beach towels are available at an additional cost; </li><li>  there are too many algae on the beach; </li><li>  they don’t take care of the pool (there is a lot of sand in the water, as well as leaves that have flown from the trees) </li><li>  music by the pool until late at night, which interferes with sleep; </li><li>  the entire animation is represented only by morning exercises, and then the guys just flirt with the guests, but do nothing; </li><li>  the tennis court is in poor condition; </li><li>  the restaurant serves poor-quality sausage; </li><li>  during low season the pool bar and the Moorish cafe are closed; </li><li>  the beach bar does not belong to the hotel, and therefore you have to buy drinks; </li><li>  on weekends, the hotel has a lot of local tourists who are too noisy; </li><li>  during a disco, the administration constantly checks the observance of the order and makes comments to tourists on trifles (although an exception is made for locals). </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  The most different opinions can be heard about the Shell Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 4 * hotel <span>(Tunisia).</span>  <span>Reviews</span> focus on the fact that the decor of the hotel is quite old.  This is also exacerbated by the fact that employees make little effort to care for her.  True, a large amount of greenery brightens up the situation, which creates a life-giving shadow.  Therefore, this hotel is chosen by active tourists who spend little time on the territory and in the room. </p><p>  A fundamentally different attitude towards local and foreign tourists is one of the key problems of the Shell Beach Hotel &amp; Spa 4 * hotel (Hammamet).  Reviews indicate that quite strict orders are established for travelers.  But local tourists behave noisily, leave trash everywhere, and no one makes any comments about this.  This is another reason why the hotel is not suitable for lovers of spending time in the room or by the pool. </p>
