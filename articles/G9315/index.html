Many of them are already outside the city.  The metro has a long and rich history of various events.  Each year, the underground transport network expands, covering new areas and creating an accessible urban environment. </p><p>  Many stations are unique cultural monuments.  Today we will talk about the metro station ‚ÄúAviamotornaya‚Äù.  It was opened for mass use on December 30, 1979.  In 2019, the station will celebrate its 40th anniversary.  It belongs to the Kalinin-Solntsevskaya line <span>(the yellow</span> subway <span>line</span> ) and has its own code - 082. </p><p>  "Aviamotornaya" is located far underground.  Its depth is about 53 meters.  It has a design with three arches and columns (in total there are 30 columns - 2 rows of 15 pieces).  Each of them is located at a distance of 5.25 m from the previous one. </p>

    <h2>  Lefortovo district </h2><p>  Metro Aviamotornaya is located in the Lefortovo district.  This is one of the oldest and historically significant areas of the capital.  Now it is part of the <span>Southeast Administrative District.</span>  Its area is about 900 hectares.  In 2017, the population of the district totals more than 93 thousand people.  This region plays an important role in the industry of Moscow, since more than 60% of its territory is occupied by large enterprises. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The main highway of the region is the Enthusiasts highway.

    <h2>  The appearance and decoration of the station </h2><p>  The design of most Moscow metro stations has a certain idea.  At metro station ‚ÄúAviamotornaya‚Äù, the design was intended to perpetuate the builders of aircraft engines.  Many elements of the decor are dedicated to this very idea.  The design was done mainly in bright colors.  For example, the walls are decorated with light marble.  The same material was used for facing columns.  Granite slabs of light gray color were used to finish the floor. </p><p>  The wall at the end of the station is lined with white marble.  There is a sculptural composition made of metal on it.  She depicts vertical air currents, and the hero of ancient Greek myths - Icarus flies in them.  Around it are various models of aircraft and propellers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  However, these are far from all decoration elements.  Another one of them can be seen, going out into the city.  Here are the aircraft propeller blades and the ‚Äúair‚Äù, which seems to flow around them. </p><h2>  What is nearby </h2><p>  It is worth noting the wonderful location of the station.  As mentioned above, it is located in the Lefortovo area.  From the platform you can exit in two directions - on Aviamotornaya Street and on the Enthusiasts highway.  M. Aviamotornaya is located near the Novaya railway platform.  The distance between them is only 400 meters, which makes this place a convenient interchange hub. </p><p>  Near the metro station ‚ÄúAviamotornaya‚Äù there are shops, cafes, as well as several small office centers.  Here you can also get acquainted with the sights of the capital.  For example, the Lefortovo Museum Reserve is nearby.  This is one of the oldest park complexes in Moscow.  It was built in the 18th century.  The park adjoins the Catherine Palace, erected here in the 70s of the XVIII century.  It is made in the style of Russian classicism and is well preserved, despite a long history.  It was repeatedly restored and expanded.  Here you can have a nice weekend or just take a walk on a warm day. </p>

    <p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãArt.  m. Aviamotornaya there are many residential buildings.  Some of them were built back in Soviet times, but new residential complexes are gradually growing here, due to which the population of the region is constantly growing. </p><h2>  Station Mode </h2><p>  Like all metro stations in Moscow, Aviamotornaya metro station operates on a strict schedule.  Daily it opens at 5:30 a.m. and closes at 1:00 a.m.  The first train from the station towards Novokosino leaves at 5:41, towards the Tretyakovskaya at 5:49.  The last train from the Aviamotornaya metro station towards Novokosino leaves at 1:16, towards the Tretyakovskaya at 1:11. </p><h2>  New ‚ÄúAviamotornaya‚Äù </h2><p>  Soon it is planned to open another station.  It will have to become part of the new, so-called Third Interchange Circuit.  According to the plan, it was supposed to open in 2016, but the construction was delayed.  Now it is planned to be commissioned in 2018. </p><p>  According to the project, it will be a shallow station.  There will be 2 rows of columns.  Exit and entrance to the platform will be through 2 vestibules.  One of them has access to the intersection of Krasnokazarmennaya and Aviamotornaya streets, the second - to the tram terminus "Enthusiasts Drive".  The height of the escalator is about 12 meters.  In the center of the station will be located the transition to the Kalinin line. </p>
