People who are used to controlling the costs of sending SMS and making calls simply do not understand why their balance is decreasing day by day.  It's all about paid subscriptions.  Perhaps they were connected by you accidentally or imposed by the operator.  Want to get rid of spam and advertising messages?  Then we recommend that you read this article.  It describes in detail how to disable paid subscriptions to Megafon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone about disconnect subscription" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/478273.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  general information </h2><p>  First you need to find out which mailings the Megafon-PRO subscriber subscribed to.  Disabling a subscription that is unnecessary and uninteresting will not be difficult at all.  But we will talk about this later.  In the meantime, let‚Äôs dwell on the methods of obtaining information about connected services.  You can choose the option that will be convenient for you: </p><p>  <em>1. Sending a USSD code.</em>  On the telephone keypad, dial * 505 # and the call button.  After a couple of seconds, a message should come up with a list of services that you have previously connected.  Set aside only interesting and useful Megafon-PRO options.  Disabling a subscription that is not needed is simple enough.  You just need to click on the "Delete" button. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <em>2. Sending SMS.</em>  The text of the message consists of one word - "INFO".  We send it to number 5051. The response SMS will contain information about your subscriptions. </p><p>  <em>3. Use of the Service Guide system</em> .  This option is suitable only for those subscribers who have registered on the mobile operator‚Äôs website.  If you are one of them, then you need to do the following: </p><p>  - Visit the "My Account" on this site. </p><p>  - Go to the section "Changing the set of services."  At the same second, a tab will open containing a list of connected services with an indication of their cost. </p><p>  - Carefully read the list of options "Megaphone-PRO."  You can disconnect a subscription that is not of interest to you in just two mouse clicks.  Most likely, this list will contain several mailings mercilessly eating money from your mobile account. </p>

    <p>  4. <em>Call the operator.</em>  Failed to get information about connected subscriptions on your own?  Do not despair.  In this situation, you should count on the help of the operator.  Just dial 0500 and press the call button.  A specialist will solve your problem in a matter of minutes.  However, you must understand that in order to receive such information, you must provide the operator with some information about yourself - provide passport data and name the code word. </p><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dangerous connection </h2><p>  There are more and more cases of mobile fraud every year.  Unsuspecting subscribers fall into traps.  How does this happen?  There may be several options.  For example, a person without his consent was signed up for paid newsletters.  Also, funds are debited from the mobile account for the downloaded content.  Many subscribers receive messages with links to various sites.  Someone immediately removes them or puts them in the spam category.  However, there are people who follow these links, and then they are surprised that money is missing from their Megafon accounts.  Not all subscribers can turn off the subscription to the site.  Some of them find it easier to put up with a loss of money. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Megaphone disconnect site subscription" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/478833.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Megafon PRO: disable subscription <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Are you tired of empty and uninteresting mailings, as well as advertising messages?  It's time to get rid of all this.  Suppose you no longer need the Mobile Subscriptions service (Megaphone).  You can disable it in one of the following ways: </p><ul><li>  "Personal Area".  This option is suitable for those subscribers who are registered on the official website of the operator.  In the "personal account" you can connect / disconnect various services.  This also applies to paid newsletters.  Go to the "My Subscriptions" section, select the unnecessary newsletters and click on the "Unsubscribe" button. </li><li>  SMS sending.  In order to prevent ads and spam from coming to your phone, you need to type a message with the text: ‚ÄúStop X‚Äù.  It is worth noting that instead of X, the service number is indicated.  ‚ÄúStop‚Äù can be replaced with other words, for example, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, ‚ÄúStop‚Äù.  We send SMS to number 5051. In response, a notification about the disconnection of the service should come. </li><li>  USSD team.  On the telephone keypad, dial * 505 # 0 # 5051 # and press the call button.  As in the previous version, a message about disabling the service will come. </li><li>  Call to the operator.  Dial 0500 and listen to the instructions from the answering machine.  After a few minutes, a connection with the operator will occur.  To deactivate the service, you will need to inform the specialist about the passport data, as well as name the code word. </li><li>  Visit to the office of the company.  This method is suitable for those subscribers who have enough free time. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to disable paid megaphone subscriptions" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/9143/478834.jpg" width="207"></div></li></ul><h2>  Blocking paid services and subscriptions </h2><p>  You have disabled unnecessary mailings, but this does not guarantee a complete elimination of advertising and spam.  However, do not be upset and worry ahead of time.  You have the option to block paid services and subscriptions.  To do this, follow these steps: </p><p>  Step number 1.  Send an SMS with the word ‚ÄúOff‚Äù to number 5051 or dial * 505 * 000 # by making a call. </p><p>  Step number 2.  Send a message to 5051, indicating in the text ‚ÄúUstzapresh1‚Äù (without quotes). </p><p>  Step number 3. Call the number 8 800 550 0500 (free of charge for all residents of the Russian Federation). </p><h2>  Service "Stop Content" </h2><p>  The Megafon company always cares about its customers, offering them profitable tariff plans and interesting options.  Recently, much has been done in the field of security.  The Stop-Content service will help subscribers protect themselves from unforeseen expenses arising when they turn to paid ‚Äúshort‚Äù numbers. </p><p>  To enable this option, dial * 105 * 801 #.  After a couple of seconds, an SMS should arrive with a notification of the actions taken.  Now you can not worry about paid messages, USSD-requests and subscriptions of content providers.  They will no longer come to your phone.  The service is provided for free, which is good news. </p>

    <h2>  Is it possible to return the money written off by scammers </h2><p>  The answer to this question interests all people who fall for the tricks of intruders.  It will be difficult to return the funds, but still possible.  To get started, try to collect as much information as possible about the incident that happened to you.  What might be needed?  The time of sending the message, the website address or short number and, of course, the exact amount (up to a penny) debited from the account.  We also recommend taking a screenshot. </p><p>  Where to provide the collected information?  You can contact the nearest Megafon office.  In addition to evidence, a statement is required from you.  In most cases, Internet providers are responsible for illegally debiting funds.  Therefore, you can be sent to the office of the company renting a short number.  If there you are refused, feel free to contact the police. </p>
