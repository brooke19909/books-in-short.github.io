    <p>  As we noted above, the village of Ortakent, in which the hotel complex is located, predisposes to a calm measured rest.  If a person wants to have fun in a bar or in a disco, you will need to go to Bodrum or another city.

    <p>  The quality of the rooms is estimated by tourists as quite consistent with the four-star level, even if it is the most common in the structure of the Petunya Beach Resort 4 * Standard hotel.  Bodrum, its attractions and beaches for many guests who left reviews, were targets for a must visit, and therefore travelers often did not pay due attention to assessing the quality of the infrastructure of the hotel complex.  However, in the spectrum of opinions of those tourists who undertook to evaluate the corresponding aspect of the rest, mostly positive assessments are found.  Some of the complaints were caused by the relatively low noise isolation in the rooms, but this aspect is perceived very subjectively.  The guests do not fix problems with cleaning, as well as with the replacement of towels and linen. </p><p>  Many tourists are impressed by the level of service and qualifications of the hotel staff.  The staff is characterized as responsive, ready to help on all matters of rest.  Competent employees work at the reception, in restaurants, at the hotel infrastructure facilities.  You can communicate with them in Russian. </p><p>  Regarding infrastructure - tourists evaluate its <span>quality positively.</span>  For example, many praise the pool for the purity of the water, which is monitored by specialists who periodically collect samples from there.  Slides installed on water bodies operate in full accordance with the schedule.  Spending time on them, as guests note, is very pleasing to children. </p><p>  Regarding the catering - some complaints were caused by the spaciousness of the main restaurant.  Despite the fact that it is designed, as we noted above, for 450 people, sometimes there are difficulties in order to find a free table during the periods when breakfast, lunch and dinner are organized.  Queues are possible.  But some tourists, observing how the restaurant works, came to the conclusion that you can simply come a little later: there are enough products for everyone.  The quality of the food is not satisfactory for hotel guests.  Travelers also observe a variety of culinary masterpieces.  There are traditional Turkish dishes, and there are treats prepared according to foreign recipes.  The quality of both is appreciated by tourists as excellent. </p>

    <p>  The entertainment infrastructure of the hotel is also appreciated by the guests positively.  This can be seen both in the field of assessing the qualifications of employees of local bars and restaurants, and in terms of the culinary component, filling the menu with drinks.  Animator programs, as guests note, are adapted for people of all ages and the most diverse cultural preferences. </p><p>  Tourists like the beach.  The complaints, as in the case with the main restaurant, relate to insufficient, according to the guests, hotel resources.  As for the beach - this is the number of free sun loungers: they, as some travelers note, are not enough during the peak hours of tourists visiting the beach.  However, the landscape of the beach itself, the purity of the water are evaluated by the guests of the hotel complex in the most positive colors. </p><h2>  A place for measured relaxation </h2><p>  Many travelers who came to Turkey with the goal of a quiet measured pastime were especially pleased.  A city where guests of the Petunya Beach Resort 4 * - Bodrum can have fun in a noisy party mode.  Ortakent (reviews by guests of the hotel complex confirm this) is a quiet village with an atmosphere that contributes to a leisurely measured pastime.  And therefore, the experience of living in a hotel complex from lovers of this type of vacation received an extremely positive assessment. </p>
