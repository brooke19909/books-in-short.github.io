The leisure option proposed in the article is suitable for creative and active people who are accustomed to independently and in advance draw up their plan for outdoor activities and shopping.  The Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel, a compact, well located and providing good basic services of a spa holiday, recommended itself well.  Reviews of people who rested in it, indicate their confidence in the correctness of such a choice. </p><h2>  Solid economist </h2><p>  So, a rather remote and in its own way exotic country of rest - Thailand, the place of rest - the island of Phuket, the resort city of Patong.  And a budget that does not exceed the economy vacation in Turkey or Egypt.  The task is not easy.  However, the former guests of the hotel in question consider their choice of hotel successful.  The price of the tour in it is 172,709 rubles.  from two adults in seven nights.  Currently (for the stock) it can be purchased on the same conditions for 158 355 rubles. </p>

    <p>  It is important that, along with the cost-effectiveness of the tour being bought, the deal should not be overshadowed by two standard and very common options for the tourism industry to cheat in relation to vacationers.  The hotel of the second line Red Planet Patong 3 * in this respect is clean and honest.  Firstly, it really looks exactly on the sites of tour operators exactly as we can see in the illustrations presented.  Secondly, its location - on the second line near the northern (most comfortable part) of Patong beach - also corresponds to reality.  Seven minutes walk - and you find yourself on a huge beach, enjoy the smallest velvet white sand and gentle sea. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Who does not suit this tour </h2><p>  What is the generalized portrait of a tourist living in this hotel?  He prefers a bright, dynamic beach and sightseeing vacation without children to passive "soaking with beer" in the area by the hotel pool. </p><p>  Indeed, the Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel is initially devoid of this temptation: with it there are no passive recreation areas - outdoor pools, neither adult nor children's.  There is no buffet.  The tourist plans his vacation completely, having only basic accommodation and breakfast at the hotel.  It should be noted that the visionary managers of the hotel reduced the price of the tour in proportion to the lack of so-called excess services.  This is the right marketing move!  The vacationer can save money saved when buying a tour, for example, in excursions, in visiting restaurants, in diving lessons. </p><p>  The supposed typical hotel guest flew in to Thailand with a couple, but without children, and found a place to live in it with good basic spa services (bed and breakfast).  He devotes his day to beach vacations and excursions, and evenings to restaurants and discos.  The absence of a mini-club and playground, special children's animators narrows the contingent of potential customers, reducing interest in this hotel complex of families with small children. </p><h2>  About hotel </h2><p>  The trademark facade of a six-story noticeable modern snow-white building with a bright red modern installation is remembered.  It inside looks modern and well-groomed.  Elevators are always in good condition and operate silently.  The hotel complex is constantly cleaned and tidy by the efforts of the staff, neat and tidy and provides a decent budget vacation. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  According to the generally accepted "star" classification of hotels in the world, the hotel of the middle (economy) class is Red Planet Patong 3 *.  Its services are typical of ‚Äúthree stars‚Äù: several types of rooms, their cleaning and change of towels are made daily, and bed linen is changed twice a week.  Each room has a private bathroom.  The room is equipped with household appliances (air conditioning, TV, minibar, safe).  Drinking bottled water is delivered free of charge daily.  The hotel has a laundry, parking, hairdresser.  Opposite the hotel building is a currency exchange.  Upon request, guests can use an iron and ironing board. </p><p>  In the fairly spacious lobby of the hotel is the reception, which is open around the clock.  Reception staff and administrators are always ready to help with household issues and advise on the characteristics of the rest, they are English-speaking.  So if your vocabulary of the British language is not rich, then communication will be reduced to alternately reviewing Google translator entries on the tablet. </p><h2>  Red Planet Patong 3 *: hotel location </h2><p>  The chosen hotel was built in a noisy resort party place, and rest in it is best suited for young people.  Just opposite, there is a popular sports bar where a really pleasant and comfortable environment is created for companies to watch matches and fights. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  From the three-star Red Planet Hotel, it‚Äôs only a fifteen minute walk to the heart of the resort ‚Äî Patong Beach, the bargain Ocean Plaza clothing and souvenir shop, Robinson‚Äôs best women's and children's clothing store in Phuket, and Bangla Road, a famous street of restaurants, massage parlors, and red lights.  From here it is also not far to the local Makro hypermarket (it is similar to the well-known Metro) where you can buy food at sparing prices.  However, we will talk about shopping at Patong Resort separately. </p><h2>  About Patong Climate </h2><p>  Some emotional tourists tend to panic and put off buying a tour, having barely heard the usual phrase ‚Äúrainy season‚Äù in the context of ‚Äúweather in Phuket in September‚Äù.  An experienced tourist will only grin, knowing full well that the duration of the average rain in the Land of Smiles is only an hour and a half.  Moreover, most often such rain passes at night.  Rather, it is more likely not rain, but a real warm tropical rainfall lasting a couple of hours, and immediately after it the sun will shine brightly and very tropically. </p>

    <p>  The weather in <span>Phuket in September</span> is not at all like the velvet season of temperate latitudes.  Solar radiation causes health-resort visitors who are afraid to ‚Äúburn out‚Äù to ignore beach vacations from 12-00 to 15-00, and the rest of the time to be under the shadow of a protective umbrella or tree. </p><p>  It is recommended that tourists arriving in Patong get the sunblock here.  After all, it is local products that have the desired SFF level: from 50 to 70. Moreover, while staying outdoors all day, this cream should be used 3-4 times. </p><p>  In addition, it is advisable to buy here the local Aloe Vera moisturizing gel, which is preferably used as a night cream.  If you still burn this gel, it will give you tangible relief if experienced Thai massage therapists rub it. </p><h2>  Description of the hotel rooms.  Functionality and compactness </h2><p>  The compact, but bright, well-renovated and ergonomic rooms accommodate guests of the small Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel.  The number of rooms in it is 144. The style of interior design is minimalism.  According to its classical canons, the walls are white and the floor is lined with a laminate imitating light wood.  The number of specially selected hotel designers according to the size of the furniture rooms is minimized, and household appliances are positioned so as not to ‚Äústeal‚Äù a place.  All these simple tricks visually increase the compact rooms of Red Planet Patong 3 * guests.  Its double rooms (others are not here) are divided into double room (rooms with two single beds) and twin room (with a large double bed). </p>

    <p>  There is one double or two single beds.  Due to the compactness of the room, beds occupy most of it.  For the convenience of using a PC, the beds are equipped with small bedside tables.  Between them there is a nightstand, under which there is a minibar.  On the wall is a mirror to the height of a person.  Room at Red Planet Patong 3 * is equipped with good air conditioning, plasma TV, safe and ceiling fan.  Instead of the closet, the guests are served by a simple crossbar with shoulders. </p><p>  A clear bonus for hotel guests is the presence in the bathroom of a good, expensive, functional shower. </p><p>  Cleaning is daily and thorough; guests always speak about cleanliness in their rooms and public areas of the hotel.  By the way, Wi-Fi at the Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel is not bad. </p><h2>  Features of catering </h2><p>  The gastronomic theme is not the most urgent in the resort of Patong.  It is not for nothing that they call it a gastronomic paradise.  Indeed, in the center of the resort, where people of various nations and religions are resting, different cuisines do not compete, but complement each other.  European cuisine is complemented by Thai, Turkish - Mediterranean. </p><p>  Tourists most often buy a tour with limited food - breakfast.  This is understandable: just having slept enough, a hotel guest wants <span>to kill a worm,</span> then to go to the beach or on an excursion.  That breakfast is included in the price of the tour with guests of Red Planet Patong 3 *.  The hotel restaurant prepares them in two versions: American (scrambled eggs, ham, sausages, toasts) and Thai (chicken, pork, rice or noodles).  For breakfast, the hotel restaurant also serves tea, coffee, pastries, fruits, juices, phantom, cola, sprite. </p>

    <p>  Tourists have lunch and dinner in the nearby coffin shops (cafes), where they have the opportunity to order fish and seafood dishes: red perch, tuna, tiger and king prawns, spiny lobsters, lobsters, scallops, squid, oysters at an economical price. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Thai hotel complexes most often do not have their own beaches.  Their guests use the services of urban beaches.  Most often, the guests of the hotel we are looking at are resting on Patong Beach, a 5-minute walk away.  The favorable location of the Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel (Phuket) allows its customers to use the services of another beach - Kata Beach. <br>  What makes Thai beaches different?  Their calling card is fine white sand and a turquoise sea.  ‚ÄúAnd the deserted shore, as in the Bounty!‚Äù Ad, ‚Äùthe reader will add.  And he will be right, but in part.  It is naive to expect deserts on a city beach. </p><p>  However, the most persistent and curious tourists will plunge into the Bounty beach world in Thailand, having bought a sea excursion to the Coral island, located 10 kilometers from the coast. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Hotel Red Planet Patong 3 * cooperates with tour operators not only in the implementation of tours, but also selling tours.  One of them will introduce the hotel guests to the unique large freshwater lake Cheo Lan, surrounded by the jungle.  Near it there are mountains of karst origin, inside of which natural karst caves are refitted in view of the attractiveness for tourists. </p>

    <p>  The most popular excursion to the islands in Thailand is a boat trip to the islands of Phi Phi (the latter became very popular after shooting the film "Beach", where DiCaprio played a major role. And the <span>Similan</span> coral <span>islands</span> (there are 9 in total) will really appear in kind sightseers "Bounty World". </p><p>  Tourists in their reviews also mention an excursion to the temple complex of Wat Yang.  The sculptures of the gods they saw are impressive, the wax figures of Buddhist monks, saints and gods of the Buddhist and Taoist pantheons. </p><h2>  Shopping at the resort </h2><p>  Guests at Patong Resort have every opportunity to carry out an exciting shopping experience, especially since most of the retail outlets are within walking distance for hotel guests.  All Patong is buried in shops selling poor quality handicrafts. </p><p>  More civilized trade in chain stores.  Probably the most popular is the huge Jung Ceylon Shopping Center hypermarket, which consists of two four-story buildings.  Immediately behind it is a fruit market, where exotic fruits are bought for a ridiculous price.  However, attention!  By the rules of Red Planet Hotel Patong 3 * it is forbidden to bring delicious, but odorous durian to the hotel! </p><p>  Ocean Plaza Shopping Center is located at the intersection <span>of</span> Bang La Road <span>Red Light</span> District and Line 2.  Here you can buy leather goods, while bargaining, really reduce the price by 10 - 30%.  However, for most tourists, an attempt to buy good branded items in Patong ended in disappointment, they realized: shopping in their own country is more effective. </p><h2>  Things to Do in Patong </h2><p>  What do the guests of the Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel find for themselves during the tour?  Obviously different.  Gourmets will indulge in seafood and exotic fruits.  Admirers of an active lifestyle will experience the healing power of Thai massage and join in water sports, riding a wave or having mastered the intricacies of scuba diving.  And in the evening, visiting discos and bars with a small company of the same tourists living in the Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel, they will experience a drive. </p>

    <p>  Party and strawberry lovers will not be disappointed by the specific Bang La Road.  A lot of them come here, where the atmosphere of venal love is hovering.  Patong is not in vain considered an Asian center for sex tourism. </p><h2>  Diving, Thai massage </h2><p>  The results of the study of reviews of guests of the Red Planet Patong 3 * hotel allow recommending individual objects of the resort infrastructure of Patong resort. </p>

    <p>  Alternatively, massage salons at the lower level of the Jung Ceylon Shopping Center and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Poppa Palace Hotel deserve praise.  However, still the best massage at the resort offers a five-story specialized salon Let's Relax.  The Thai Herbal Massage option deserves the highest ratings. </p><p>  For diving on the criterion of purity of water, the southwestern beaches are more suitable: Kata, Karon, Kata Noi.  A Russian diving center works here, preparing followers to receive an international diver certificate CMAS or PADI, NDL. </p><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  It is not in vain that the Red Planet Patong 3 * economy hotel is considered to be the best hotel complex in Patong according to the ‚Äúprice / quality‚Äù criterion.  Indeed, despite the attractive price of the economy tour, its spa services are sound, and the staff works in good faith and with dedication.  Of course, the range of services of a three-star hotel is smaller than that of a similar institution with four and five ‚Äústars‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  But, it should be noted, to the honor of the managers of the Red Planet hotel complex, if this hotel provides the service, then it is always of high quality.  In particular, not even all five-star hotels have good free Wi-Fi throughout, as is the case with the hotel complex we are considering.  And not all of them have a client room bathroom equipped with an ergonomic shower, as is implemented in the Red Planet Hotel Patong 3 *.  As they say, like little things, but nice. </p>
