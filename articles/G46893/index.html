  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sociology of the family: basic concepts</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sociology of the family is a branch of sociological knowledge.  He studies the family as an integral social system based on consanguinity, marriage or adoption, which unites people with a common life, mutual responsibility, and mutual assistance. </p><p>  The concept of family in sociology has a distinctive feature, since sociology studies it both as a <span>social institution</span> and as a small social group.  It is the family that makes it possible to learn such forms of human relations as marriage, parenthood, and kinship. </p><p>  The sociology of the family identifies the structure and functions of the family, which has a complex multi-level structure, including not only the number and composition of generations, but also <span>social roles, the</span> positions of each member. </p><p>  The nuclear family consists of a married couple of parents and children who are dependent on them.  An extended family includes in addition to the nuclear family and other relatives (grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc.). </p><p>  The sociology of the family thus separates the concepts of family and marriage.  Marriage is the legal relationship between a man and a woman in relation to each other and to children.  Historically, the following <span>forms of marriage have been</span> distinguished: </p><p>  a) monogamy - one man and one woman; </p><p>  b) polygamy - one man and several women (or one woman - several men) </p><p>  c) group marriage - several men and several women. </p><p>  In modern society, the most developed monogamous marriage of man and woman, based on love and personal choice.  The role of intra-family relations as a factor in strengthening the family group and social institution is growing. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sociology connects the functions of the family with the interests of society, the needs of the individual. </p><p>  The economic function is to provide family members with livelihoods, including disabled and minor family members (children, the elderly, disabled) </p><p>  The household function is related to the provision of household services by family members to each other.  Joint management ensures the strengthening of family relations. </p><p>  The reproductive function is the most important in social terms, as it consists in the reproduction of the population, in satisfying the natural need for children. </p><p>  The educational function is aimed at educating and socializing the younger generation. </p><p>  The family also performs the function of primary social control, which consists in the knowledge of <span>social norms,</span> sanctions, and regulation of behavior. </p><p>  The function of spiritual communication ensures the satisfaction of a <span>person</span> ‚Äôs natural <span>needs</span> and includes spiritual enrichment, moral responsibility, and friendly relations. </p><p>  The social status function is that the family provides its members with a certain position in the structure of society, starting opportunities. </p><p>  The leisure function consists in organizing and spending free time of all members, developing abilities. </p><p>  Emotional function also plays a large role in meeting the natural needs of family members, providing psychological assistance and support. </p><p>  Family functions are interconnected, represent a holistic structure, complementing and enriching each element of the system. </p><p>  The sociology of the family and its research are currently the most relevant, since in Russia there is a crisis of the social institution of the family.  The number of families with a clear intra-family dysfunction, with a violation of the most important functions, has sharply increased.  Many families are not only functionally insolvent, but also have a clear antisocial orientation.  A sharp increase in the number of children left without parental care, divorces, alcoholization and anesthesia of parents leads to disappointing statistics. </p>
