This is one of the companies that imperceptibly (in comparison with such giants as Sony and Samsung), but surely do their job, consistently releasing competitive products.  It is so solid, professional, traditional and sophisticated, so in Japanese.  Yamaha has a lot of things to enjoy from a purely professional point of view.  Founded in 1887, the company produces consumer electronics, musical instruments (its drums have been the subject of desire for drummers around the world for many years), snowmobiles, motorcycles, golf carts, sporting goods, household appliances and industrial robots.  Most well-known brands cannot even remotely provide such diversity. </p><h2>  Model history </h2><p>  As for audio and video, Yamaha has deservedly settled in the upper mid-fi world, leaving a mark on history with its powerful receivers of the 80s and 90s.  of the last century with non-standard forced digital signal processing systems and powerful amplifiers. </p><p>  The Japanese company also produces elegant PC accessories, subwoofers and speakers.  Yamaha offers both fairly expensive and budget speakers.  Release NS-333 began in 2005, but the model was so successful that it remained relevant for modern buyers of shelf speakers.  Although the manufacturer claims that this system was developed for use in home theaters, many music lovers praise it for its high performance, size and appearance, as well as for the ability to use it exclusively for listening to music. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  Yamaha NS-333 costs $ 199 (this is the recommended price for a pair of speakers).  An aluminum tweeter dome diameter of 25 mm is installed in the waveguide connected to the 5-inch (130 mm) fiber-polymer diaphragm of the low-frequency diffuser.  The cone is made from a 30 percent white Indian pearl mica, selected for its excellent acoustic properties.  The manufacturer does not stain the material, leaving it with a natural shade.  In addition, the cone is characterized in that its shape is created due to its natural weight. </p><p>  Yamaha uses this technology for standard reasons, preferring the increased efficiency of conical emitters, as well as the absence of interference due to their directional effect.  These phenomena have generated a lot of controversy over the years, but the right solution does not exist, because their disadvantages or advantages are usually subjective.  In addition, Yamaha pays great attention to preliminary and post-testing. </p><p>  The company claims that each part of the speaker system is manually selected, wood is approved from 60 variants, the speakers are tested for several months by computer simulation and testing real prototypes in an anechoic chamber and 5 listening rooms, the finish is checked for sound quality, and the speakers are even placed in the camera. recreating the tropical climate of the Amazon jungle. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The model is 200 mm wide, 320 mm high, 213 mm deep and weighs 5.5 kg.  The Yamaha NS-333 Black has an elliptical shape, the purpose of which is to minimize internal standing waves, and the internal connections are made with a Monster Cable.  The glossy finish in black piano provides a luxurious shine, forcing the wearer to buy weekly care products for such surfaces. </p><p>  The rear panel has input connectors and built-in brackets for wall mounting.  In general, acoustics offers a very good level of assembly and finish for their price.  The sexy glossy elliptical black case and angular patch panel radiate elitism, and with the patch panel removed, silver speakers provide a striking appearance.  Yamaha did a wonderful job.  The appearance of the speakers far exceeds the average level of their price category. </p>

    <h2>  Yamaha NS-333: sound characteristics </h2><p>  In a <span>speaker system</span> with a bass reflex, speakers with a sensitivity of 87 dB, a nominal impedance of 6 Ohms and a frequency range of 65 Hz ‚Äì 35 kHz are used.  The input power is 60 watts, and the maximum is 150 watts.  Crossover frequency - 3 kHz.  To reach their potential, speakers need high-quality input, and the result is very affected by the use of an average level of receivers and power supplies.  This can be a problem for thrifty buyers who are likely to want to purchase this speaker system. </p><p>  The Yamaha NS-333 provides a moderately deep and wide soundstage and demonstrates slightly above average spatial imagery of musical instruments.  The speakers seem to lack some zest in the lower middle and upper bass, which slightly erodes it.  The speaker diffuser does not show the same direction as other designs, offering an increased zone of comfortable listening. </p>

    <h2>  Sound rating </h2><p>  High frequencies provide amazing detail with a noticeable liveliness and give a pleasant feeling of airiness and speed, which is truly manifested in rock and electronic music.  The midrange range has an even, flowing quality that adapts to various instruments, especially vocals and pianos.  The lower middle and bass sounds a little flabby, which compresses the soundstage and harms the imagery, but in general they provide a good extension.  The lower frequencies simply lack the final clarity and clarity that could properly complement the excellent midrange and crystal treble. </p><p>  Placing speakers against a wall low frequencies expands and provides better balance, but still lacks ultimate clarity.  <span>The speaker system is</span> loud with a very small gap requiring more power.  In general, the sound of the Yamaha NS-333 user reviews called harmonious and not ceasing to please them.  The disadvantages of the device do not reach a level that could affect the degree of listening pleasure.  Considering the cost, acoustics perfectly copes with its task and represents a bargain for the economical buyer. </p>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  Yamaha NS-333 clearly and in detail reproduces sound with good expansion and dynamics of bass.  The speakers look amazing, because in their design applied a lot of high technology.  The model allows installation and is compact enough, which provides it with many different applications.  At the same time, the NS-333 lacks effectiveness and clarity in the lower midrange and bass.  The speaker system requires a high-quality signal source and power supply.  Black glossy finish is difficult to care for. </p><h2>  Verdict </h2><p>  Acoustics Yamaha NS-333 clearly demonstrates why it occupies such an influential position in the market.  The speakers offer clear detailed reproduction and, despite the absence of some nuances in the lower part of the frequency range, they always remain musical and pleasant. </p><p>  The appearance is amazing, the model is high-tech, compact and has a very affordable price.  This is an amazingly profitable and high-quality acquisition - the Yamaha NS-333 speakers certainly will not need any alteration.  This is another convincing product from the legendary Japanese manufacturer and, of course, not the last. </p>
