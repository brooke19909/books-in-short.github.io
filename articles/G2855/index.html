This lesson calms the nervous system and becomes so fascinating that, having tried once, stopping is already lacking strength.  Needlework is a useful activity not only for a good leisure time.  Connected things are always distinguished by touchingness and originality, since the love and soul of a woman is embedded in them. </p><h2>  The benefits of knitwear </h2><p>  If you want to make the most beautiful clothes in the world for your baby, we knit a newborn with knitting needles.  These things will have a lot of advantages that will please both the mother and the baby.  These include: </p><ul><li>  original appearance; </li><li>  can be knitted of the best quality yarn; </li><li>  there will be an opportunity to design clothes according to the individual size; </li><li>  after the child grows up, you can dissolve the product and tie a new one out of it; </li><li>  during knitting, the mother calms her nervous system; </li><li>  mother enjoys dressing her baby in clothes made by her own hands; </li><li>  knitted clothes are much cheaper; </li><li>  by learning to knit, you can earn some money during maternity leave. <div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted suits for newborns knitting" class="if uuid-3088818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088818.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  There is one unshakable rule: we knit a newborn with knitting needles from the best quality yarn.  To do this, pay attention to its composition.  The priority will be threads made of natural wool, linen or cotton with a small addition of synthetics.  Such things will keep in shape and will not cause an allergic reaction after touching the baby‚Äôs delicate skin.  The yarn should not be very fluffy, because the villi can accidentally get the child on the mucous membrane.  It is necessary that the threads are soft and pleasant to the touch, do not prick, do not steam, do not become electrified when exposed to them. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparing yarn for knitting </h2><p>  The following rule: we knit a newborn with knitting needles from the purest yarn.  After buying the thread in the store, you should not immediately rewind it into balls.  You need to collect warm water, add a little baby soap or washing powder for newborns to it.  Dip skeins with yarn and gently wash them with your hands.  Then squeeze and hang to dry.  When the threads are dry, of them it is necessary to wind the balls and start knitting.  After finishing work, it is recommended to wash the product again slightly and rinse thoroughly in running water. </p><h2>  Envelope for the baby </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ebay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Envelope for newborns" class="if uuid-3088813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088813.jpg"></div><p>  A knitted envelope for a newborn will be an excellent solution to many problems.  It will become the original first clothes of the baby at discharge from the maternity hospital.  In the envelope you can also walk in cool weather.  And when the child grows up, the envelope can simply be used as a plaid.  There are several ways to link it. </p><ul><li>  In the form of a sleeping bag with a hood.  To do this, you need to decide on the size of the child (make him a little bigger, but not so that the baby "fell through" in his first clothes).  In the usual way, tie the back and two shelves in the form of rectangles.  Insert a zipper between the shelves or sew buttons.  Tie a hood in the form of a rectangle folded in half, stitched on one side and sewn to the neck. </li><li>  In the form of a cocoon with sleeves and a hood.  To do this, you need to tie the back, two shelves, two sleeves and a hood.  It is necessary to correctly calculate the size of the armhole so that the handles are not crowded (you need to remember that extra clothes are always worn under the envelope). </li><li>  In the form of raglan.  We knit it with a newborn with knitting needles (preferably round on a fishing line), like a blouse with sleeves from top to bottom.  The back and shelves must be made longer, then knit the hood and insert the zipper. </li><li>  In the form of a plaid.  A simple rectangle or square from a knitted fabric can be folded in the form of an envelope in which the baby will be.  And during the hours of sleep or when the child grows up, he will have a cozy blanket that keeps the warmth of his mother‚Äôs hands. </li></ul><p>  The envelope can be decorated with various decorative elements in the form of brushes, pompoms, ribbons, original buttons.  The lower part can be made in the form of a rhombus with an angle in the center or two rhombuses on the sides of the product. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bonnet </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.giftsucanmake.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted bonnet" class="if uuid-3088802" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088802.jpg"></div><p>  A bonnet knitted with knitting needles for newborns will be an excellent outfit solution for a baby.  It must be remembered that the threads should not be too fluffy, special attention should be paid to ensure that they do not prick and soar.  In any case, the bonnet is worn on another cotton bonnet, since touching the child‚Äôs head with wool or wool will be unsafe. </p><p>  The cap should be knitted starting from the face.  To do this, dial the desired number of loops, knit to the crown, then close the left and right side, leaving only the loops for the back of the head.  Having knitted an occipital part, to connect a cloth for receiving "nest". </p><p>  The cap can be decorated with all kinds of patterns, ribbons, beads, etc. It should be remembered that only the bezel of the face will be visible, so the emphasis must be placed on this detail.  The ruffle that frames the face of a child looks very original. </p><h2>  Beanie </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.babyknittingpatternsblog.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hat for newborn" class="if uuid-3088801" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088801.jpg"></div><p>  Knitted cap for a newborn with knitting needles for job descriptions is useful for beginner needlewomen who want to original dress their baby.  To do this, you need to select the necessary threads and decide on the pattern.  When choosing a pattern, it should be remembered that the baby most of the time lies on his back.  That is why for the occipital part of the cap should not choose an overly embossed pattern. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Start knitting with the right eye.  Then knit the left ear, connect the knitting into a common fabric and continue working in a circle.  At the crown, remove the loops on the thread and fasten. </p><p>  A hat can be made without ears by tying it with circular knitting needles or by making it with a seam (it is better if it will not be on the back of the head).  The product can be decorated with brushes, pompons, ribbons, ‚Äúears‚Äù and other original patterns. </p><p>  How to knit a hat for a newborn with knitting needles - with a description of the work - in more detail you can see the video. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="Xb9zl6L97kw" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb9zl6L97kw" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/4/5/9/2/14592.jpg"></div><h2>  Blouse </h2><p>  The blouse for the baby will be a useful part of the wardrobe in cool weather.  It can be knitted in two main ways: </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newbornbabystuff.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitted sweater" class="if uuid-3088804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088804.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Blouse with set-in sleeves.  To do this, you need to separately tie the back, two shelves and sleeves.  Then connect all the details, do not forget to make holes for the loops and knit the collar (optional). </li><li>  Blouse with raglan sleeve.  This model is knitted from the neck in the following sequence: button placket, front shelf, raglan, back, raglan, front shelf, plank.  Sleeves are tied from raglan. </li></ol><p>  The blouse can be made with a zipper or buttons, a very original solution will be to fasten in the form of ribbons or knitted ties.  If desired, you can add a hood, which will be made in the form of a square or bonnet. </p><h2>  Panties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.knittingmatters.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pants for newborns" class="if uuid-3088806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088806.jpg"></div><p>  We knit a set for a newborn with knitting needles, which consists of a blouse, panties, sliders, hats, booties.  You can do everything completely in one style, including the envelope (at the discretion of the needlewoman).  This proposal will look very original, because the same patterns on things will create a complete image.  Children's pants can be connected in several ways. </p><ul><li>  The simplest is the way in which two rectangles are knitted, which are then sewn in the form of panties. </li><li>  You can knit with two circular knitting needles to two legs, which are then joined together. </li><li>  Pants can also be knitted with fully circular knitting needles.  Work should begin with a belt, knit to the base of the legs, then knit each leg separately. </li></ul><p>  When knitting pants, it is recommended to remember that their upper part will almost always be covered.  Therefore, you should make a decorative emphasis on the cuffs or areas to the knees. </p><h2>  Sliders </h2><p>  A suit for a newborn boy, knitted, can be supplemented with sliders.  When working on panties or sliders, you must rely on the presence of diapers.  That is why it is recommended to make larger items so that the baby is comfortable.  The sliders can be knitted according to the principle of panties (at least in three ways).  Stops are made open (they finish work with cuffs) or closed so that the sliders are combined with booties.  The upper part in place of the shoulder can be fixed with buttons or made with stitches. </p><p>  For knitting sliders, you can use any model.  You can focus on the breast pocket, highlight the shoulder line, or simply draw an original pattern that will harmoniously connect with other elements of the clothing in the suit. </p><h2>  Booties </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nacd.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Booties for newborns" class="if uuid-3088812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/110398/3088812.jpg"></div><p>  Knitted <span>suits for newborns with knitting needles</span> can be complemented with booties in the same style.  They can be made in the form of shoes, sandals, slippers, boots, etc. Choosing the right option, you must remember that the baby will have to step on them with his tender legs.  That is why there should not be extra seams on the sole, and the pattern itself should be chosen even and without extra reliefs. </p><p>  Booties can be used not only in the first three months of life, but also much longer.  They can also be worn outdoors.  To do this, it is necessary to make the sole more dense by inserting a leather insole inside or making an additional double volume of the sole. </p><p>  Decorate booties should also be very careful, using only ribbons or soft threads, making them brushes or pompons.  Do not use buttons, beads and other objects that the baby can tear off and cripple (put in your mouth, nose, ear, etc.). </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Clothing for a newborn is the cutest and most touching part of a person‚Äôs wardrobe.  You can not overestimate the degree of pleasure mom during the performance of this pleasant job.  But not only young parents can enjoy needlework of this kind.  Grandmothers and all other relatives and friends of the family can join the work.  This gift will be pleasant, appropriate and practical, as it will always remind you that the baby was eagerly awaited and rejoiced at its birth. </p>
