In the era of early Rome, the city was built randomly and randomly, did not have a general plan.  Primitive dwellings scattered along the narrow, curved streets of the city were characteristic of the appearance of the great city.  The large, monumental buildings with which we are so accustomed to associate the city were only temples and houses of nobility. </p><p>  When Rome began to build its magnificent history, the beauty of the ‚Äúeternal city‚Äù also increased.  By the time of the reign of Octavian Augustus, the city was plunged into numerous problems, the inhabitants were exhausted for many years of unrest and the struggle for power.  Taking this fact into account, <span>Octavian Augustus</span> took up the construction of a new look of Rome, which was supposed to include not only monumental temple complexes, but also numerous entertainment venues, places for citizens to relax.  The <span>Roman emperor</span> entrusted this matter to his closest comrade-in-arms, Mark Vipsanius Agrippa.  Indeed, the fruits of his work became <span>a byword:</span> this is the updated water supply system of the city, and numerous fountains, and grandiose arches.  However, the main brainchild of Agrippa was a bath in ancient Rome. </p><p>  Having laid the traditions of bathing culture in the city, Agrippa must have been unaware of how popular they would become among the nobility and in Roman society.  Evidence of this is the construction of many new similar objects in subsequent periods of history.  Soon, Roman baths (therms) began to arise here and there, like mushrooms after the rain.  They were built during the period of Titus, Nero, Trajan, Caracalla, Diocletian and other emperors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Very soon, the bath in ancient Rome gained high popularity.  Baths began to grow throughout the city, existed at gymnasiums, in rich houses.  A good half of Rome was washed in them.  Baths were not only a place for swimming, they became the center of public life of the city.  Some of them accommodated more than 2,000 people, and it was here that after bathing people sat down to talk, someone preferred walking in the park, some immersed themselves in reading in the libraries equipped here.  In short, the baths began to serve as a place not only for hygiene, but also turned into recreation centers for citizens. </p>

    <p>  Some scholars express the view that the bathhouse in ancient Rome was the best good that the emperors were able to do for their people.  But we should not forget that they <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  were not only a place of rest, but also beautiful works of art.  As a rule, there were either recreational parks or sports grounds near the bathhouses.  From the dressing room, decorated with magnificent decoration, visitors entered the room with a domed ceiling and brightly painted walls.  From the locker room you could also get into another room - a kind of prototype of our steam room.  However, caldarias served as a real steam room - rooms with wet steam and heated walls and floors, there were fountains and utensils for washing right there. </p><p>  Bath in Ancient Rome <strong>&nbsp;</strong>  became the focus of luxury and grandeur.  Marble, silver, gold, precious stones - all this was her indispensable attribute. </p>
