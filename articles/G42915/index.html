Many rave reviews about the bread that this hotel bakes.  Many people call food "home", evaluating it for the highest score. </p><p>  Most tourists rated it ‚Äúgood‚Äù by the pool.  There are always a lot of free sunbeds around, although some Russians express dissatisfaction with its size. </p><p>  You can reach the sea in just three minutes directly, not for long, however, to find a beach with only sand, you have to walk a little two kilometers to the right.  The road is good, along it are many small shops and taverns. </p><p>  By the way, the beach is the only, perhaps, a serious cause of discontent for those who did not bring special shoes with them for the convenience of entering the water.  However, there are many stalls near the hotel where you can buy it.  Summing up, we can say that the vast majority of our compatriots were satisfied with their stay at the Blue Island 3 * hotel and left with the best impressions from the island in the hope of returning here more than once. </p>
