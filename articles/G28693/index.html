Bear: description, features, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Is it worth going to Israel if the "Dead Sea" is also in Russia?  In the Kurgan region there is a reservoir that heals in the same way as its counterpart in the State of Jerusalem.  True, if many have heard about the Dead Sea, then <span>Lake Medvezhye</span> is heard by a few. </p><h2>  The uniqueness of the lake </h2><p>  All the <span>lakes of the Kurgan region</span> (Medvezhye is no exception) are not just beautiful places, but also healing.  The secret is simple - at the bottom are salt and healing mud.  The salinity of the water is so great (360 g / l) that it is difficult to drown in the lake.  The body is pushed up.  But to feel like a float is quite real.  Many vacationers are lying on the water and at the same time reading books.  And the maximum depth in it is a little more than a meter.  On average - 50-60 cm. Although the lake itself is large - 61 square meters.  km  After bathing, streaks of salt remain on the skin, which gives a not very pleasant sensation, tightening it.  Therefore, experienced holidaymakers stock up on fresh water and wash away its remnants.  In summer, the water temperature reaches 20 ¬∞ C, in winter it does not freeze.  The lake feeds on meltwater. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lakes of the Kurgan region are bearish" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155295.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where is? </h2><p>  Many travelers constantly come to the lakes of the Kurgan region.  Bear is in demand the most: tourists come here from all over the Russian Federation.  The reservoir is located 180 km from the city of Kurgan and 30 km from Petukhov - the district center of the Kurgan region.  460 km will have to go from Chelyabinsk, all 600 km from Yekaterinburg. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Undoubtedly, the best way to get there is by personal transport.  From Kurgan to Petukhovo, then in the direction of the sanatorium "Bear Lake" to the north.  You can come by train to the Petukhovo station and take regular buses, minibuses or taxis.  You can get from Kurgan to Omsk by bus, leaving at the Petukhovskaya Customs stop. </p><p>  On the shore of this lake of the Kurgan region - Medvezhye - there is a village of the rural type Resort and the village of New Ilinskoye.  Nearby (2 km) is the village of Troitskoye. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bear fishing lake" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155294.jpg" width="524"></div>

    <h2>  Animal world </h2><p>  There are no plants or fish in Lake Medvezhye.  The reason for this is the high salt content.  However, many vacationers meet small red crustaceans.  Salt brine shrimp breed in large numbers, giving the water a brown color.  They have a calming effect.  That is why rarely anyone comes for food purposes to a reservoir such as Lake Bear.  Fishing in this place is pointless. </p><h2>  Title legends </h2><p>  Locals call Lake Medvezhka.  In official sources, it is called the Bear.  They say that from above the lake resembles the shape of a bear.  However, people prefer the beautiful legend of local residents of the nearest settlements.  As if in ancient times, a sick bear came to treat his paw here.  He will lower her into the lake and wait.  A miracle happened.  Water has done its job.  Healed.  Now, of course, there are no bears in this district. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bear Lake Kurgan region how to get there" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155358.jpg"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Magic mud </h2><p>  There are no longer such unique reservoirs in Russia as the lakes of the Kurgan region.  Bear, due to its salt water (brine), has a lot of properties.  Relieves inflammation, quenches pain in bones, muscles, etc., has a therapeutic effect on the nervous system.  Rapa improves metabolic processes in the body.  No less rich in the lake is silt mud.  It is effective in the treatment of diseases of the nervous and musculoskeletal systems, female diseases.  Mud improves blood circulation, cures allergies, has cosmetic properties (removes stretch marks, cleanses the skin).  The only negative is the indescribable smell.  But you can get used to it.  It is believed that you need to stay on the lake for at least a week to be healed.  Better yet, take dirt with you as a souvenir from Kurgan "Israel".  Many vacationers do just that, collecting ‚Äúmagic medicine‚Äù in various containers.  And prolong the treatment at home. </p><h2>  To a sanatorium or a savage? </h2><p>  Fans of a comfortable stay can stay in a sanatorium near such a stunning body of water as Lake Medvezhye (Kurgan region).  Savage is better not to stop, because to get all the necessary services will not work.  The complex has the same name.  Here you can go through the entire course of treatment.  Different profiles - musculoskeletal system, diseases of the nervous system and skin, gynecology, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, neurology, immune and endocrine systems.  The sanatorium is open all year.  Capacity - up to 500 people.  The resort has its own beach with a sandy beach, on the catamaran pier.  Local mineral water is especially popular.  It is mined in the territory of the sanatorium "Medvezhye-11". </p><p>  It is convenient to stay in guest complexes and in private houses.  Right on the shore of the lake is the guest house "Catherine" with a cafe, a bathhouse and parking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lake Bear Kurgan region Savage" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1155288.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Those who do not have the money can just relax in tents.  A full course of treatment will not be carried out, but the romantics will be extremely satisfied - fresh, clean air, forest, lake.  That is why you should choose Lake Medvezhye (Kurgan region) for relaxation.  How to get to it, we described above. </p><p>  An interesting fact is that, thanks to six small islands, the inland reservoir is conditionally divided into two parts: Bolshaya and Malaya. </p>
