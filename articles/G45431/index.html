    <p>  You can sit with a fishing rod, spinning rod not only in the territory of the recreation center.  Free fishing is available to everyone.  In order to catch a pike in autumn, spring, and carp, crucian carp, tench in spring and summer, you can come to the Schelkovo district of the Moscow region and sit with a fishing rod on the shore of the Big Bear Lake. </p><p>  It has the correct rectangular shape.  Not without reason in the pre-war years, on this reservoir, tests of new developments were often carried out - seaplane models, combat boats. </p><p>  Big Bear Lake has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã0.4 square meters.  km, the depth reaches 6 meters.  It connects to <span>the Pekhorka River</span> channel.  In the east, the shore of the lake is covered with forest, and in the west of the reservoir there is a highway. </p><p>  You can fish not only on the Big, but also on the Small Bear Lake.  Its deepest place is 14 meters, and the area is 0.07 square meters.  km </p><p>  Those who have already been here leave reviews about Bear Lakes.  Fishermen say it‚Äôs better to take a boat with you, as the coast is not equipped.  They also advise you to come here in the early morning and on weekdays in the summer, as on weekends lovers come to swim and relax in nature. </p><p>  Fishermen share the secrets of the catch.  They say that occasionally at night fishing you can catch eel on the bottom fishing rod.  On bait fish in the fall quite often catch perch on a fishing rod. </p><h2>  Bear-water aquatic monster </h2><p>  There is one more reason to visit this place.  They say that Bear Lakes (Shchelkovo District) are fraught with mystery and there is something much larger than fish. </p><p>  Old-timers say that there used to be a barn on the shore of the reservoir.  Animals went here to a watering place, but suddenly they began to disappear.  At first, people thought that some thief was taking them away.  But he worked silently and left no trace. </p><p>  I managed to see the culprit of the events to one milkmaid.  When she washed herself near the water, she heard a cow roar at the watering hole and saw something big and black come out of the water, grabbed the unfortunate animal and carried him into the abyss. </p><p>  After several more cases of disappearance of animals, it was decided to move the barn away from this place.  But rumors about an incomprehensible underwater monster did not spread beyond this place until in 1999, tourists from Japan arrived on Bear Lakes (Schelkovo District).  It is said that one of them saw Nessie and reported this to Russian ichthyologists. </p><p>  They examined the muddy bottom and came to the conclusion that it can be double and that under the visible lake the underwater can hide, where Nessie lives. </p><p>  Whether this is true or not is not known for certain.  In the meantime, people come to these places to relax, breathe fresh air and go fishing.  In any case, you need to be extremely careful on the water, then you will return home happy, rested and with a catch! </p>
