    <h2>  History of alcohol norm </h2><p>  It is known that Emperor <span>Peter I</span> ordered the first soldiers to drink alcohol in Russia <span>.</span> Then it was called <span>‚Äúbread wine‚Äù.</span>  The bottom line was that during the campaign, the soldiers periodically drank wine, while officers, if desired, could replace it with cognac.  Depending on the severity of the trip, this rate could be increased or decreased.  With this, everything was pretty strict.  So, the quartermaster, who did not take care of supplying part of the alcohol with time, could even be deprived of his head.  It was believed that this undermines the morale of the troops. </p><p>  The tradition was picked up by many Russian tsars and emperors, while it was changed and supplemented many times.  Under <span>Nicholas I,</span> for example, wine was given to guard units in fortresses and cities.  At the same time, drill ranks received three servings per week, non-combat ranks - two.  On campaigns, they drank vodka, which was previously diluted with water and jammed with breadcrumbs.  It was customary for officers to issue tea with rum.  In winter, sbiten and wine were more relevant. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The fleet was a little different - here the sailor was necessarily given a glass, that is, 125 grams of vodka per day, but the sailor lost this opportunity for misconduct.  For merits, on the contrary, they issued a double or triple dose. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Soviet troops" class="if" height="321" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/829663.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  How did the "people's commissar grams" </h2><p>  The history of the emergence of the alcohol norm in the Soviet Army, which was called the "People‚Äôs Commissar 100 grams", originates from the People‚Äôs Commissar (People‚Äôs Commissar) of the USSR military and naval affairs - <span>Kliment Voroshilov.</span>  During the Finnish War, he asked Stalin to allow the distribution of alcohol to the troops in order to warm personnel in severe frosts.  Indeed, then the temperatures on the Karelian Isthmus reached 40 degrees below zero.  The People's Commissar also claimed that this could raise the morale of the army.  And Stalin agreed.  Since 1940, alcohol began to enter the troops.  Before the battle, the soldier drank 100 grams of vodka and seized it with 50 grams of fat.  Tankers then relied on double the norm, and pilots were generally given cognac.  Since this caused approval among the soldiers, they began to call the norm "Voroshilov".  From the time of introduction (January 10) to March 1940, soldiers drank about 10 tons of vodka and about 8 tons of cognac. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="war 1941 1945" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/829666.jpg" width="600"></div>

Then the terrible war of 1941-1945 - the Great Patriotic War - came to our land.  It was on its first day that Stalin signed an order under number 562, which allowed the soldiers to give out alcohol before the battle - half a glass of vodka per person (fortress - 40 degrees).  This concerned those who were directly at the front line.  The same was assumed for pilots performing combat missions, as well as for flight support personnel of airfields and engineers with technicians.  Responsible for the implementation of the order of the Supreme was the People's Commissar of the Food Industry A. I. Mikoyan.  It was then that the name ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Commissar 100 grams‚Äù sounded for the first time.  Among the prerequisites was the distribution of the drink by the front commanders.  The regulation provided for the supply of alcohol in tanks, after which the vodka was poured into cans or barrels and transported to the troops.  There was, of course, a limitation: it was allowed to transport no more than 46 tanks per month.  Naturally, in summer such a need fell away, and in winter, spring and autumn, the norm was relevant. </p><p>  It is possible that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgiving vodka to the retreating units was prompted by the psychological attacks of the Germans: drunken soldiers went to the machine guns at full height, not hiding.  This had a strong effect on the Soviet troops, which were already at a disadvantage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="why did they give alcohol in war" class="if" height="466" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/829669.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Further application of the norm in the troops </h2><p>  In connection with the defeat of the Red Army near Kharkov, adjustments were made to the order of the <span>Supreme Commander.</span>  Now it was decided to differentiate the issuance of vodka.  Since June 1942, it was planned to give alcohol only in those parts that were successful in battles with the Nazi invaders.  At the same time, the ‚Äúpeople's commissar‚Äù norm should have been increased to 200 grams.  But Stalin decided that vodka could only be dispensed to offensive units.  The rest could only see her on holidays. </p><p>  In connection with the battles near Stalingrad, the GKO decided to restore the old norm - from now on, 100 grams were given to everyone who went on the attack at the forefront.  But there were innovations: the dose was also received by gunners with mortars, who provided support for the infantry during the offensive.  A little less - 50 grams - was poured into the rear services, namely the reservists, construction troops and the wounded.  The Transcaucasian Front, for example, used, by virtue of its location, wine or port (200 and 300 grams, respectively).  Over the last month of fighting in 1942, a lot was drunk.  The Western Front, for example, "destroyed" about a million liters of vodka, Transcaucasian - 1.2 million liters of wine, Stalingrad - 407 thousand liters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="alcohol in war" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/829667.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Since 1943 </h2><p>  Already in 1943 (April), the standards for the distribution of alcohol again changed.  GKO Decree No. 3272 stated that the mass dispensing of vodka in units would be stopped, and the norm would be set only to those units that conduct offensive operations on the front lines.  All the rest received "people's commissar grams" only on holidays.  The dispensing of alcohol was now on the conscience of councils of fronts or armies.  By the way, such troops as the NKVD and the railroad fell under the limit, since their alcohol consumption was very high. </p><p>  Many veterans, indulging in memories, said that this norm did not exist everywhere.  In some parts, for example, it was issued only on paper, but in reality - there was no distribution of alcohol.  Others, on the contrary, testify that this was practiced, and on a massive scale.  So the true state of things is not known for certain. </p><p>  The final issuance of the norm was abolished in connection with the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.  However, the Soviet troops fell in love with such norms so much that the tradition remained until the collapse of the USSR.  In particular, the Afghan contingent did so.  Of course, such things were done secretly, since the command would not have stroked the head of a soldier for drinking alcohol during the hostilities. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="soldiers before the battle" class="if" height="423" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33786/829376.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Similar cases in the world </h2><p>  Mentioning a similar norm of alcohol in the Red Army, it should also be said that the Wehrmacht, against which she fought, was also not sober.  The soldiers had the most popular liquor schnapps, and the officers drank champagne, which was delivered from France.  And, if you do not take into account alcohol, other substances were also not disdained.  So, in order to maintain vigor during the fighting, the soldiers took medications - ‚ÄúPervitin‚Äù, for example, or ‚ÄúIsofan‚Äù.  The first was called "penzer chocolate" - "tank chocolate".  It was sold openly, while soldiers often asked their parents to send them Pervitin. </p><h2>  Results and consequences of application </h2><p>  Why did they give alcohol in the war?  On this question, with careful consideration, you can give dozens of different answers.  Which of them will be closest to the truth? </p><p>  As stated in the decree, alcohol was given out in the winter in order to warm the frozen fighters.  However, any doctor will confirm that alcohol only creates the appearance of warming, in fact, the situation does not change. </p><p>  Also, knowing what effect alcohol has on the human brain, it can be argued that it was taken to raise morale.  Indeed, in many situations when the initiative or recklessness of the soldiers was necessary, they were suppressed by the instinct of self-preservation.  Narkomovskaya vodka effectively suppressed <span>this feeling,</span> along with basic fears.  But she also blunted reflexes, perceptions, and participating drunk in battle is not a good idea.  That is why many experienced fighters before the fight intentionally refused to drink.  And, as it turned out later, they did the right thing. </p><h2>  The effect of alcohol on the psyche and physical condition </h2><p>  Among other things, vodka had an effective effect if the human psyche was subjected to heavy loads, as is often the case in war.  Alcohol saved many fighters from severe nervous shocks or even madness.  However, one cannot confidently say whether alcohol in a war has a positive or negative effect on the army. </p><p>  Yes, vodka, even if it has all the positive qualities described above, was still harmful.  One can only imagine the scale of the army‚Äôs losses, because alcohol intoxication in battle almost always meant a certain death.  In addition, one must not lose sight of the fact of the constant use of alcohol, which can cause alcoholism, and in some cases death.  <span>Disciplinary misconduct is</span> also not worth writing off.  So the "People‚Äôs Commissar 100 grams" have both positive and negative sides. </p><p>  The USSR never supported drunkenness.  It is all the more surprising that, albeit in a limited way, he was practiced in the army.  After all, since 1938, several times there were large campaigns against drunkenness in the army.  Many of the highest command or party ranks underwent investigative investigations precisely on the fact of excessive drinking.  Accordingly, both the distribution and consumption of booze were kept under strict control.  For drunkenness at the wrong time, they could easily be sent to a penal battalion, or even completely shot without trial, especially at a time such as the war of 1941-1945. </p><h2>  Post-war use in the army </h2><p>  In addition to illegal cases, there was still an official alcohol norm - in the Navy.  The combat crews of nuclear submarines relied on the daily rate of dry wine (also 100 grams).  But, as under Stalin, they gave him out only during a military campaign. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Commissar grams" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/829662.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reflection of the term in art </h2><p>  For some reason, the "people's commissar 100 grams" is very firmly entrenched in art.  Already at that time one could hear songs mentioning the alcohol norm.  And the cinema did not bypass this phenomenon - in many films you can see how the soldiers overturn the glass before the battle and shouting "For the Motherland! For Stalin!"  go on the offensive. </p>
