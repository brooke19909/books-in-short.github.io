Guests are offered a wide selection of cuts and sandwiches, scrambled eggs and omelettes, fruits and fresh pastries.  Many tourists say that such a breakfast successfully replaces lunch and even lunch.  The traditional restaurant serves European dishes.  At the wine bar you can always order wine.  However, despite the positive reviews, tourists emphasize that the service still does not attract five stars. </p><p>  It is proposed to visit the Portofino restaurant.  This is a stunning corner of Mediterranean cuisine.  The chef also offers guests to taste original dishes.

    <h2>  For business people </h2><p>  Very often for holding various thematic seminars, as well as trainings designed for a small team, it is Art Hotel (Voronezh) that is chosen.  Feedback from participants in such events suggests that the cost of renting a room is quite high, because the hotel is very convenient for such events.  The ideal location in the center of business and cultural life makes it so attractive for tourists.  The business elite is attracted by the coziness and sophistication of the interior of meeting rooms and training rooms, and the technical equipment will make it possible to realize the most daring ideas.  Please note that the maximum capacity of the halls is 10 people. </p><h2>  Sports recreation </h2><p>  The hotel management advocates a healthy lifestyle and prohibits smoking on its territory.  In addition, it creates all conditions for active training and deep relaxation.  Hotel guests can use the gym and visit the Finnish sauna, relax in the SPA pool and spend the evening in the cozy relaxation area.  We strongly recommend exploring the surroundings of the hotel and attending the cultural events of the Opera and Ballet Theater, Philharmonic Hall and exhibition halls. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Many city guests have already visited the Art Hotel (Voronezh).  Photos of this institution are very impressive, but we are interested in reliable reviews.  First of all, everyone emphasizes a convenient location.  The rooms are very comfortable and clean, comfortable furniture is located.  Of the minuses, the absence of cosmetic accessories in the bathroom is noted, but at the same time, they are provided at the request of tourists.  Breakfast is included in the price, judging by the reviews, very high quality, but the choice of dishes is not too large.  In general, all the guests were satisfied, but the price seemed a bit overpriced, like starry. </p>
