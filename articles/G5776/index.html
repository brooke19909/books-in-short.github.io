Such a relief contributed to the formation of a unique climate - in the summer there is no sweltering heat in the village, the air is dry but fresh, and there is no rain for months.  In winter, the air temperature is higher than in Yalta, which attracts a lot of tourists here in the off-season. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simeiz water park prices" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/847885.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <h2>  The history of the village </h2><p>  On the slopes of Mount Koshka, archaeologists have discovered artifacts indicating that the land on which the village is currently located was inhabited many millennia ago.  But for unknown reasons, by the 18th century there was no trace of the settlement. </p><p>  The arrangement of Simeiz began in 1873, when the tsarist minister of war acquired an oak grove and an abandoned vineyard in these parts.  The construction of the estate was completed in record time, but at the beginning of the 20th century it was sold to the brothers of the Minister Maltsev.  They decided to turn the village into a fashionable resort.  Many beautiful villas and estates were built on the coast, which instantly attracted aristocrats. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Simeiz today is considered a place of elite relaxation.  The village offers tourists comfortable houses and villas, excellent cafes and restaurants.  And in order to make the leisure of the guests of Simeiz and Crimea even more eventful, in 2001 the construction of a modern water park was completed. </p><h2>  Blue bay </h2><p>  Every day, dozens of buses bring tourists to Simeiz.  The water park readily accepts everyone from 9:30 in the morning until 18:30.  "Blue Bay" is the only institution in the Crimea, in all pools and attractions of which exclusively sea water is used, the level of which is replenished daily.  The water park, in fact, is a separate self-sufficient city.  In addition to all kinds of slides and pools, on its territory there are cafes, pizzerias, hotels and cottages for relaxation.  In the “Blue Bay” 6 swimming pools are open for visits, 8 steep slides guarantee an adrenaline rush, and young visitors enjoy spending time in a children's complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park simeiz reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/847891.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <h2>  Water attractions </h2><p>  This wonderful place on the seashore called Simeiz gives tourists an abyss of thrills and positive emotions.  The water park not only keeps the rides in good condition, but also takes care to make the stay of visitors even more interesting and varied. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, in 2014, a new slide was installed in the “Blue Bay”, allowing all family members to enjoy at the same time.  Family constrictor is a 137-meter gutter, which is descended from the inflatable tubing from a height of 16 meters.  This attraction is one of the most beloved in the water park. </p><p>  No less fun is felt during the rapid descent from a 15-meter height along the breathtaking "serpentine".  From the highest point of the attraction you can see Simeiz at a glance.  The water park does not allow children to ride on this hill, because the angle of incidence is 10 degrees, and the average person makes a 154-meter path in 40 seconds. </p><p>  The abyss of thrills will give a descent from the hill "Kamikaze", fully justifying its name.  Its length is only 40 meters, the angle is 42 degrees.  And the fall rate reaches 5 meters per second. </p><p>  At "Multipist" adults and children spend their time with pleasure.  5 bands allow you to arrange real competitions in which everyone who came to the water park (Simeiz) can take part.  The photos successfully give an idea of ​​the speed with which the descent takes place and is from 7 to 9 meters per second. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="simeiz water park" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/847892.jpg" width="533"></div>

    <p>  "Virage" is perfect for families.  Its height is 10.7 meters, and its length is just over a hundred, the turns are smooth, and the entire descent is rather leisurely and lasts about 30 seconds. </p><p>  But from tourists coming to the water park (Simeiz), the reviews about the Tobogan attraction are simply overwhelmed with delight.  Steep turns, cold sprays and crazy speed provide an incredible boost of vigor. </p><p>  Only having driven enough on a roller coaster and getting an idea of ​​what awaits at the end of the tunnel, you can decide to try these attractions.  The Black Hole and Tsunami are the most extreme that the water park offers to try.  Simeiz (Crimea) is the unique owner of the Tsunami ride, in which the guest will have to fight with seven rows of waves, while the number of ups and downs reaches sixteen. </p><h2>  Pools </h2><p>  On the territory of the "Blue Bay" there are 6 pools, including children's ones and a unique wave pool.  It provides an unforgettable opportunity to enjoy swimming in the stormy sea, fighting high waves, but without risking anything. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park simeiz crimea" class="if" height="354" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34006/847893.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Children's area </h2><p>  For children who have not yet reached school age, a children's complex is equipped on the territory of the water park.  Around the spacious pool there are four slides, which are exact, but very reduced copies of adult rides "Virage" and "Serpentine".  Their heights range from 1.9 to 2.4 meters. </p><p>  You can satisfy your hunger by having a quick and tasty lunch at one of four excellent cafes or pizzerias.  And the Pirate bar with cocktails and cold drinks is located right in the pool! </p>
