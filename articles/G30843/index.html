    <h2>  Historical information </h2><p>  The modern name of the village in translation means "the village of Tsandov."  It was formed around the VI century.  At that time, in the territory occupied by Tsandripsh, the private sector was inhabited by representatives of one of the ancient tribes.  There was also a port.  The story of Tsandripsha is very eventful.  In the XIX century, he was annexed to the Russian village.  After that, Tsandripsh, the private sector in which over time began to occupy a fairly large area, was called Pilenkovo.  Later in the surrounding areas there were many military clashes.  As a result, the village became part of Abkhazia.  In the period of the USSR, the resort area developed and flourished.  Then the village was called Gantiadi.  Currently, many locals still call it that.  The population of the village gradually increased due to the organization of industrial enterprises. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Resort functioning </h2><p>  The village of <span>Tsandripsh (Abkhazia)</span> first met tourists in 1955.
