Thanks to this trend, it is now possible to find reviews on the Internet not only about overseas resorts and hotels, but also about our hotel complexes.  It should be noted that they do not always receive positive ratings.  However, over time, the level of service and the range of services rendered allowed the hotels of the Black Sea coast to boldly compete with Turkey, Europe and other countries.  It is known that many Russians from a trip to Sochi, for example, were constrained by prices.  Indeed, the cost of tours to decent hotel complexes of the resort "bit" for most of our compatriots.  Especially often this was noted by tourists from remote corners of Russia.  They have to lay out a significant amount of money in order to fly to the Black Sea.  Therefore, there was not so much to stay.  How to be in such a situation?  This season, this problem was solved in the best way.  Most travelers have chosen the Sochi Park Hotel (Biblio Globus).  If you want to know what is the popularity of this hotel complex, then you should definitely read our article.  We will give a full description of ‚ÄúSochi Park Hotel 3 *‚Äù (‚ÄúBiblio Globus‚Äù) and tell you about the features of its reservation. </p>

    <h2>  Quick reference </h2><p>  Sochi Park Hotel (Biblio Globus) has three stars and is fully consistent with the declared status.  Many of its guests claim that the hotel complex is so good that in Turkey they would have added two more stars.  This indicates that this hotel will be uniquely comfortable for guests of any age. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Not so long ago, the hotel complex changed its name, so many of its guests in the reviews confuse Sochi Park Hotel (Biblio Globus) and Azimuth, as it was called earlier.  If in search of comments about this complex you will meet its old name, then most likely the guests were in it a couple of years ago, which, however, did not spoil the impression of a holiday.  This is proved by positive reviews about the hotel, in large numbers posted on the Internet. </p><p>  Every potential tourist should know that along with the name the hotel has changed its owner.  Now the Sochi Park Hotel is managed by the Biblio Globus tour operator.  Do not be surprised, tourists claim that it benefited the complex and breathed new life into it.  In addition, it is very convenient that you can live in one place and, if necessary, choose an excursion program for yourself here.  It is noteworthy that every year it expands.  For example, this season the tour operator Biblio Globus from Sochi Park Hotel organized a direct transfer to Krasnaya Polyana.  It is worth noting that in any season this is a very popular route.  Therefore, you can be sure that in the winter there will be no end to the hotel guests. </p><h2>  How to book Sochi Park Hotel (Biblio Globus)? </h2><p>  Many Russians are faced with the fact that they cannot find offers on the Internet for the hotel we are describing.  A few years ago they were in the public domain, but now they have almost disappeared from all sites.  This may well confuse and upset an inexperienced traveler, but there is one secret that will help you quickly and easily book a room for yourself and, if necessary, for friends. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Just check out the official Biblio Globe website.  Sochi Park Club Hotel Hotel can now be booked only with this tour operator.  Since he is the owner of the hotel complex, he has a monopoly on the sale of tickets to the hotel. </p><p>  Many of our compatriots book through the Biblio Globus in Sochi and the Marins Park Hotel, which can also be included in the category of affordable and decent services. </p><h2>  Cost of living </h2><p>  We already wrote that many Russians are embarrassed by the overpriced cost of living in hotels in Sochi.  Often, a decent option starts from several thousand rubles, while the hotel complex is not always located near the beach.  However, this is a feature of the resort - it is difficult to find a hotel located on the first coastline here.  But Sochi Park Hotel has a great location.  However, we will discuss this point a bit later, but for now let's get back to the cost of living. </p><p>  Surprisingly, booking a room at the Sochi Park Hotel (Biblio Globus) is only possible for three hundred rubles.  You heard right - three hundred rubles!  For this amount, you will be provided with magnificent apartments for two with sea views and everything necessary for living.  Naturally, such prices are set in the offseason.  However, in the summer period, when demand for permits increases, their cost remains below the average for the resort. </p>

    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Sochi Park Hotel (Biblio Globus) is a huge complex consisting of twelve buildings.  Each has eight floors, in which there are five categories of rooms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Almost all vacationers noted the vast and well-groomed territory of the Sochi Park Hotel.  Biblio Globus tried to make the twenty-four hectares that housed the hotel turned into a garden of paradise.  There are numerous cafes, restaurants, playgrounds for games and recreation.  Guests enjoy strolling along the shady alleys and are happy to take photos on the pretty bridges thrown over artificial ponds. </p><p>  All the surrounding beauty really suggests that the complex may well receive five stars, but for some reason this does not happen. </p><h2>  A few words about the location of the hotel </h2><p>  Guests of the Sochi Park Hotel have repeatedly mentioned in reviews that it has a very convenient location.  First of all, many say that by Sochi standards the hotel complex is located near the resort center and the beach.  Keep in mind that you must go to the sea at least eight hundred meters.  This distance is considered to be small, especially since the road runs through a very beautiful area.  Vacationers usually get to the center of Sochi by taxi, because an ordinary person can‚Äôt walk thirty kilometers on foot.  However, very close to the hotel complex are numerous shops and cafes. </p><p>  It is very convenient that tourists do not have to travel to the hotel for several hours after a tiring flight or train trip.  This is its significant advantage, because the distance to the international airport in Adler does not exceed ten kilometers, and to the station - nine.  Almost five hundred meters from the Sochi Park Hotel there is a station where high-speed trains stop. </p><p>  In addition, the most interesting sights and infrastructure facilities of the resort are located almost within walking distance from the hotel.  For example, the hotel and the famous <span>Olympic Park</span> are only eight hundred meters away.  The same distance between the hotel and the Sochi Park amusement park.  The Formula 1 track is even closer; you need to drive less than five hundred meters to it. </p><h2>  A few words about the beach </h2><p>  Hotel guests usually go to the municipal beach.  It's nice that in the current summer season he was awarded the first category of quality.  Therefore, be sure that you will rest in a clean and well-equipped place.  The beach is pebble, you have to pay extra for sun loungers and umbrellas.  On average, they cost three hundred rubles per day of use.  Small buses depart from the hotel to the sea, they start moving at eight in the morning and end at six in the evening.  The fare in one direction does not exceed fifty rubles. </p>
