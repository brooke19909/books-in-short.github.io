With this name, warm memories of previously spent vacations immediately emerge.  I want to drop everything and leave for this beautiful city, where the warm Black Sea, beautiful mountains and clean air.  Spend in Sochi just a couple of weeks, wandering along its narrow streets, which suddenly rise up, then rapidly fall.  You breathe this mountain air and by the end of the rest you are charged with positive energy for the whole year. </p><div class="photo" data-original="2gis.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Microdistrict &quot;Bald Mountain&quot;" class="if uuid-2969675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969675.jpg"></div><h2>  Sochi city and its districts </h2><p>  The city is located near the mountains.  On the one hand, they help protect Sochi from cold winds, and on the other, they create difficulties in the form of mountainous terrain.  The city is divided into four districts, these are Lazarevsky, Khostinsky, Central and Adler.  In the Khostinsky district on the border with the Central is Lysaya Gora, whose height is 140 meters.  She received this name thanks to industrialization.  Once upon a time, a forest covered the top of the mountain, and during the construction of Vereshchaginsky dachas it was completely cut down.  In Sochi, Lysaya Gora is famous for the Arboretum, it is one of the most beautiful places, and the Svetlana microdistrict and the Sobolevka village are located on the mountain. </p><h2>  Mountain history </h2><p>  During the Caucasus War, the mountain was the property of the Ubykh feudal lords.  In 1870, the territory was divided between Khudyakov Sergey Nikolaevich and the Vereshchagin brothers.  Vereshchagins bought the north-western slope, and the south-eastern one, respectively, went to Khudyakov, who in 1889 founded the Arboretum park.  The brothers sold their land, they later divided it into pieces and sold it again.  So in Sochi, the upper Bald Mountain began to gradually take on its current form.  Today this place attracts a large number of tourists and vacationers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Park Arboretum </h2><div class="photo" data-original="sochipoplanu.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Arboretum in Sochi" class="if uuid-2969676" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969676.jpg"></div><p>  In Sochi, Bald Mountain on its slope sheltered <span>the Arboretum Park,</span> it covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã49 hectares.  The park is divided into two parts: "Upper" and "Lower".  On the territory of the Upper Park, cypress trees, about 2,000 pines, palm trees and even rare subtropical plants grow.  Even on the central avenue a luxurious villa is built, which is called "Hope" in honor of the wife of the former owner.  Around the villa are various sculptures, fountains and gazebos.  The "lower" park boasts a large aquarium with outlandish fish, cascading ponds, beautiful rosals.  You can climb the ‚ÄúUpper‚Äù park by cable car, at the top there is a 30-meter tower and stunning views of the mountains and the sea.  You won‚Äôt be able to see all the sights in one day, it‚Äôs better to plan a couple of days for a walk in this wonderful place. </p><h2>  The village of Sobolevka </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The village of Sobolevka" class="if uuid-2969678" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969678.jpg"></div><p>  Most of the village is located in a cozy evergreen valley, near the Vereshchaginka River.

For vacationers, Sobolevka is unpopular, since it is far from the beach, but this place is ideal for permanent residence. </p><h2>  Comfortable housing </h2><div class="photo" data-original="krasnodar-region.afy.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Svetlana microdistrict in Sochi" class="if uuid-2969679" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/96474/2969679.jpg"></div><p>  On Lysaya Gora there is a microdistrict - "Svetlana".
