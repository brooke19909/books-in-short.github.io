The average rating is 4th place, which is good results, given the great competition. </p><p>  There are claims to the bank and dissatisfaction with the fact that card transactions are not carried out immediately, but within 1-3 days.

    <p>  It is easy enough to find reviews about Tinkoff debit cards that leave a positive impression about the bank.  For example, many thank the bank for their operational work, which even the largest banks that work in the Russian Federation cannot compare with, as well as for withdrawing money without commissions in any banks in the world. </p><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, Tinkoff debit cards, the reviews of which were described above, are affordable and do not go beyond the terms of the Russian banking services market.  On the contrary, on some points even better conditions are observed than in some well-known and popular banks. </p><p>  The main feature is that you do not need to leave your own house to get a new card or open a card account.  All that is needed is access to the Internet, a little free time and the desire to become a client of a bank, which annually receives awards as the best bank created on the network. </p><p>  The presence of a very large line of debit cards allows you to reach and interest with your services a fairly wide audience of people.  Even the owners of Mitsubishi cars, this bank was not spared. </p><p>  Of course, there are those people who have a need to chat with a person live.  Unfortunately, Tinkoff Bank does not provide such an opportunity to its customers. </p>
