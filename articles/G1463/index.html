The reviews of its guests indicate that there is a developed tourist infrastructure.  Proof of the recognition of the level of development of the southern capital (the unofficial name of Rostov-on-Don) is that a number of matches of the football world championship were held here this year. </p><p>  However, the topic of this article is only one single element of the tourist infrastructure of the city, the Hermitage Hotel (Rostov-on-Don).  Photos of this four-star hotel flaunt in many booklets of various tour operators.  The characteristic moldings and pilasters of its facade make it recognizable and characteristic, in harmony with a pleasant color scheme, made in a combination of white and green. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, the four-star Hermitage Hotel has a strong reputation in the tourism business of the region.  Rostov-on-Don, we note, is a fairly competitive market, which has in its tourist infrastructure comfortable five-star Radisson hotels, Petrovsky Prichal, Residence, Aero Hotel, as well as four-star Attache, Ramada, Don-Plaza , Bellagio and others, all in all, in the South Capital there are almost 2000 hotels, </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The cozy small hotel, considered by us, is located on a fairly quiet street of Ulyanovskaya, house 52. It is convenient for business people who want to relax in a calm comfortable environment after the vicissitudes of business. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="47.2169031" data-lng="39.71965019999993" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/3/1/0/8310.png"></div><p>  Going on a business trip, city guests can not worry about housing, pre-booked a room on the hotel‚Äôs website.  Payment is quick and convenient; it can be made by electronic money, payment card or cash. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is convenient to get to it.  Platov Airport is 10 kilometers from the hotel (buses 285 and 286 run to it), 5 kilometers - Rostov - the main railway station. </p><p>  In addition, the hotel is an ideal launching pad for exploring the city, walking tours to the center, the city beach, the promenade, local history and art museums, music and puppet theaters.  Wonderful for leisurely walks equipped with cafes and shops the embankment of the Don River, the longest in Europe. </p><p>  For guests of the hotel, rest on the sea is available, for this you can order a transfer.  40 kilometers away by car, and the tourist is on the beach of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAzov. </p><p>  Judging by the reviews, many customers choose the Hermitage Hotel precisely by the location criterion.  Rostov-on-Don is attractive for visitors as a city favorable for business life.  Developed transport infrastructure, urban environment, concentrated offices of major Russian companies and banks, sports infrastructure, including a spectacular sports hall for 8 thousand spectators, a developed catering system, museums, a zoo. </p><p>  What is not good for business travelers who are within walking distance of all these facilities?  The center of Rostov for those staying in it is as close as possible, and this is appreciated by people who went on business trips. </p><p>  A simple analysis of reviews on the sites indicates that most of the guests of this hotel belong to this category of visitors.  For the most part, they remain here at a stand for 1-2 days.  The four-star status of the hotel, confirmed by real service, judging by the reviews of residents, they are more than happy with it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel management </h2><p>  The hotel, judging by the official and publicly available information on the Internet, belongs to Tatyana Vladimirovna Nechepaeva, Alexander Vladimirovich Spirin, Vadim Yuryevich Mukoed.  The owner of the Hermitage Hotel (Rostov-on-Don) Nechepaeva T.V. is also its General Director.  Based on the reviews of vacationers, one can note: the guests, speaking about their stay, indirectly positively evaluate the level of hotel management. </p><p>  Mentioned is good catering, friendliness and helpfulness of staff, stylish furniture, selected "antique", serviceability of household appliances in the rooms.  The good quality of performance of official duties is striking: daily cleaning, change and quality of linen and towels.  A positive factor is the presence of bathrobes and slippers in the rooms, the bathrooms are equipped with shampoo, soap, toothpaste, stable free Wi-Fi.  In the summer, guests who check in find two bottles of mineral water in the refrigerator. </p><p>  However, the Hermitage Hotel, and this is also contained in the reviews, is associated with individual travelers with fairly low ratings.  We make the appropriate emphasis: at present, the hotel meets the four-star level, and this suits most customers.  However, good management should always look at the prospects.  Indeed, with a motivated accelerated development of the tourism business in Russia, for four-star <span>hotels,</span> compliance <span>standards will</span> , of course, increase. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, the unofficial status of the city - the Southern capital - you must agree, obliges the owners to invest in their business. </p><p>  In connection with the foregoing, it is appropriate to prompt delicately the hotel owners: among the reviews of the guests there are hints of useful directions for further improving the business.  Here are some of them: </p><ul><li>  to redesign the design of the narrow main entrance and, accordingly, expand the stairs; </li><li>  modify heat supply; </li><li>  at the request of a considerable part of customers, replace carpet that has served its purpose; </li><li>  Do not periodically, but immediately replace furniture with moderate signs of wear. </li></ul><h2>  Building </h2><p>  The Hermitage Hotel (Rostov-on-Don) is an ideal place for guests of the city who want to plunge into the cultural and business life of the southern capital.  It is as accessible as possible, easy and inexpensive to get to it, as there are public transport stops around the hotel.  Just a few minutes walk from the busy city center to the hotel, and the traveler finds himself in a surprisingly calm "sleeping" area. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.booking.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hermitage Hotel" class="if uuid-2778277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/57442/2778277.jpg"></div><p>  The Hermitage Hotel is not lost among competitors and looks spectacular, thanks to sophisticated symmetry, the appropriate design contrast of its pleasant color scheme and stylization of a building from the end of the 19th century.  Against the background of the surrounding standard box houses, a visual impression of the hotel's lightness and its harmony is created. </p><p>  Indeed, judging by the reviews, the Hermitage Hotel looks attractive to visitors to the southern capital.  Rostov-on-Don, a city with historical traditions, of course, will demand such hotel enterprises.  Despite following the antiquity, the hotel is very modern and dynamic in interior interiors and in its technical equipment.  It has good lighting, very spacious.  The interiors are dominated by light and warm colors.  The guest rooms are a comfortable, clean and tidy environment for living. </p><h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The Hermitage Hotel (Rostov-on-Don) offers its guests 6 types of rooms.

It contains two rooms, the bathroom includes a toilet and a bathroom with bathtub and shower.  Installed air conditioning, LCD TV, mini-safe, minibar, telephone, Wi-Fi. </p><p>  The economy room has an area of ‚Äã‚Äã15.6 m2, its furnishings are simpler, although household appliances are similar to those listed above for the deluxe room.

They highly appreciated the skill of his chef.

Restaurant Don Quixote is open from 11.00 to 23.00.  In advance, having called by phone (the last one will be prompted at the reception), guests can reserve a table at a convenient time for them. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hermitage of Rostov" class="if uuid-2776017" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2776017.jpg"></div><p>  The range of dishes is quite wide.  In the current menu on the day of writing the article - 54 items.

The use of such a source of information is justified, since it is in it that the Hermitage Hotel (Rostov-on-Don) is presented in detail in all aspects.  Customer reviews, classified by a five-point system, harmoniously complement the characteristics of the hotel. </p><p>  Let's move on to the numbers.  There are 118 reviews for the current date. If you calculate arithmetically, the average score is 3.93 (‚Äú5‚Äù -34 reviews, ‚Äú4‚Äù - 57, ‚Äú3‚Äù - 17, ‚Äú2‚Äù - 7, ‚Äú1‚Äù - 4) .  Given that most of the guests satisfied with the service of the guests do not leave any reviews, this is a perfectly acceptable indicator. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.101hotels.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.101hotels.ru/main/cities/rostov-na-don"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel owner Hermitage Rostov" class="if uuid-2776020" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2776020.jpg"></div><p>  Qualification of English-speaking staff can successfully serve guests from the United States.  It is characteristic that in the reviews of foreign tourists the Hermitage Hotel (Rostov-on-Don) is positively evaluated.  Employee reviews are another factor by which one can judge a company.  It is no secret that on a number of Russian sites, those offended by the leadership who dismissed them, thoroughly tell about the shortcomings of their employers.  So: at the Hermitage Hotel there are no such revelations.  And this is a plus for her managers. </p><p>  Summarizing the above estimates, the key positive aspects of the organization are reviewed: the coherence of the staff, attentiveness and helpfulness.  It is characteristic that in the reviews of a considerable part of people who arrived in the Southern capital on official need, it is mentioned that they book rooms in this particular hotel. </p><h2>  About business services and excursions </h2><p>  Three modern conference rooms equipped with special communication and communication systems are offered to representatives of the business by the Hermitage Hotel LLC (Rostov-on-Don).  Photos of the Red and Blue Halls, with a capacity of 80 people each, and the Green Hall, designed for 40 participants, are presented on the hotel‚Äôs website.  There is also a meeting room guaranteeing an appropriate level of confidentiality. </p><p>  Small and medium-sized companies on the basis of the hotel regularly conduct their business events.  From here, a businessman from here can get in touch with contractors, make online payments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.otels.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Rostov Center" class="if uuid-2776012" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2776012.jpg"></div><p>  Tourists who come to the Southern Capital for the purpose of cultural relaxation have all the opportunities to have a cognitive and interesting time.  The hotel offers exciting local history excursions: </p><ul><li>  three-hour sightseeing in the city of Rostov-on-Don; </li><li>  seven-hour on the historical sites of Taganrog (70 km from the southern capital); </li><li>  five hours to the capital of the Don Cossacks (Novocherkassk); </li><li>  five-hour to the historical sites of Peter's time in the city of Azov. </li></ul><p>  In total, the list of 10 excursions.  If you wish, going on a remote excursion, you can take lunch prepared and packed in the Don Quixote restaurant with you. </p><h2>  Shopping </h2><p>  Most of the city‚Äôs residents make grocery and household purchases in its largest shopping centers ‚ÄúBabylon‚Äù, ‚ÄúAstor Plaza‚Äù, ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù, ‚ÄúXXI Century‚Äù, ‚ÄúGolden Babylon‚Äù, ‚ÄúTaller‚Äù, TSUM, ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù and so on.  Of course, we visit them and the central city market.  Hotel guests, judging by the reviews, most often buy food in the shopping center. </p><p>  However, as a souvenir purchase, city guests use the services of more compact specialized stores.  In truth, there are quite a lot of the latter in Rostov-on-Don, but we will name only three of them, since they are repeatedly recommended by the sites of tour operators: </p><ul><li>  Semikarakorsk ceramics shop (associated with the Cossacks); </li><li>  Gift shop ‚ÄúI want‚Äù; </li><li>  Vlasenko cheese factory. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The owner of the Hermitage Hotel in Rostov-on-Don maintains his hotel company in a competitive, attractive condition for guests.  The staff is trained, responsible in their duties.  The work is established, current issues are resolved promptly and invisibly for residents. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Hermitage Rostov-on-Don photo" class="if uuid-2776014" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15074/2776014.jpg"></div><p>  The rooms of the Hermitage are cozy, clean, soundly furnished and adequately equipped with household appliances.  The hotel is very comfortable on a business trip for business people who can conduct their business events right here. </p><p>  Extremely good words deserve food. </p><p>  At the same time, the high competition of hotels in the southern capital actualizes the task for the manager to bring the level of service as close as possible to the five-star one. </p>
