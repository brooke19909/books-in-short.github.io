The shape of the product does not matter.  It can be square, round, and cylindrical.  It is best to stick the grains not with glue, as it will release toxic fumes when heated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mydailymagazine.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee bean candle holders" class="if uuid-2344133" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2344133.jpg"></div><p>  It will be most convenient to fuse small details into the paraffin of candles.  How to do this, we will consider further. </p><h2>  Grain fusion </h2><p>  You need to prepare an additional candle in order to get paraffin.  It is rubbed into a separate enameled bowl and melted over low heat.  Then a candle is lowered into the hot liquid and its side part is enveloped.  Until the paraffin has hardened, they attach the coffee beans, pushing them inward. </p><p>  If once is not enough, then you can repeat the procedure again.  Gluing can be done in stages, dipping a candle in a layer of molten paraffin or smearing a separate part of it. </p><h2>  DIY vase made from coffee beans </h2><p>  The craft is made in two stages.  The first step for the foundation is to pick up a cup.  It can be with or without a pen.  In order for the vase to be voluminous, it is necessary to make a soft litter.  To do this, attach sponjiks on the entire base to the PVA glue.  Then the soft pillow is tightly tied with a hemp rope, the surface of the winding is again lubricated with thick PVA glue. </p><div class="photo" data-original="diy-enthusiasts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vase decorated with coffee beans" class="if uuid-2344277" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2344277.jpg"></div><p>  Only then grains of coffee are attached on the entire surface.  You can have them in two layers, laying on the second any patterns or ornament.  Additionally, the surface of the vase is covered with acrylic varnish.  It dries quickly, does not have an unpleasant odor, work can be done in the room or in the kitchen.  After opening with varnish, the surface becomes bright and shiny. </p><p>  If the craft has a handle, then you can attach a flower made of satin ribbons to it, or simply tie a lush bow.  You can decorate a vase by laying hemp rope in layers or by making a strip of natural fabrics or threads.  Burlap or linen will look beautiful. </p><h2>  Coffee Bean Topiary </h2><p>  With your own hands you can make a beautiful and spectacular craft.  This is a decorative tree that can serve as an interior item in an office room or in the living room of an apartment.  The "trunk" of the tree may be flat, but may have a tortuous shape.  The upper part of the crown is most often round in shape, but there are exceptions.  For example, on Valentine's Day, you can create such a beautiful heart-shaped craft for your soulmate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="madeheart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coffee bean topiary" class="if uuid-2344251" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2344251.jpg"></div><p>  The basis for gluing coffee beans is represented by a foam ball, from which a heart shape was chiselled.  For work, you need hemp thread, PVA glue, a curved stick, a flower pot, coffee grains, lace, a satin ribbon of brown and beige colors.  For decoration, the star anise star is useful.  You can use other materials of natural origin. </p><h2>  Completing of the work </h2><p>  To make coffee bean topiary with your own hands, you first need to take a foam base and wrap it tightly with a rope or thick thread, spreading the surface with PVA glue.  Its ends at the beginning and at the end of the winding can be fastened with a glue gun for reliability. </p><p>  Then a stick is wrapped in a similar way, acting as a trunk.  Having spread the threads at the base of the heart, you need to firmly insert the rod into the hole formed.  You can squeeze a little glue from the gun onto the edge of the stick.  Then work continues on decorating the flower pot.  It is wrapped around the outside with a rope over the entire surface.  It is attached in a similar way. </p><p>  In order for the stick to hold firmly in the pot, you need to pour in the gypsum solution inside and, until it hardens, insert the stick by sticking it deeply.  When the mixture has frozen, you need to fill the top of the pot with coffee grains.  You can add more additional details.  Then the pot is decorated with lace from natural threads.  A bow made of satin ribbons is tied at the base of the stick. </p><p>  The article describes in detail several options for making crafts using coffee beans, master classes with step-by-step instructions for execution.  After reading the article, think about what to make from coffee beans with your own hands, be sure to try creating something from what you saw yourself.
