Instead of a booth, ordinary watering cans are provided here (even without pallets).  But, at least, hot water in this recreation center, judging by the reviews, is always there.  For a budget Turkish hotel, this is even a rarity.  This convenience is provided in this complex according to a rather simple and at the same time original scheme.  The hotel administration simply installed tanks for heating water directly on the roof, under the sun.  The only thing - in the evenings, from taps in the showers of the hotel, for obvious reasons, warm water can flow not hot. </p><h2>  Room flaws </h2><p>  <span><span><span>Accommodation, thus, according to vacationers, in the</span></span></span> <span><span><span>Ozer Park Hotel Beldibi 3 *</span></span></span> <span><span><span>hotel</span></span></span> <span><span><span>is rented quite convenient.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Some of the disadvantages of the rooms are mainly associated only with the "age" of the hotel.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>For example, on the floor here you can see a slightly tiled tile, and in showers - rust on the walls or floor.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>But in most cases such shortcomings do not deliver any particular inconvenience to hotel residents.</span></span></span> </p>
