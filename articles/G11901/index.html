It is installed in porches, private houses or apartments.  There are also street sensor models.  You can install any kind of such equipment yourself.  To do this, you need to familiarize yourself with the advice of experienced electricians.  How to install a motion sensor will be discussed later. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  Before you consider how and where to install the motion sensor, you need to understand the principle of its operation, the rules for choosing the appropriate model.  Previously, the equipment presented was used exclusively in security systems.  Such sensors reacted to the appearance in the protected area of ‚Äã‚Äãan object that moves around the territory.  They transmitted an alarm to the security panel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lawyer-cars.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install a motion sensor on the street?" class="if uuid-3149900" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149900.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, the same principle was borrowed by manufacturers of lighting equipment.  They developed sensor models that included a floodlight, street or porch lighting, as well as sirens, signaling equipment, or power equipment. </p><p>  How to install the motion sensor?  To cope with the task, you need to consider the varieties of such devices.  They can be mounted on a wall or ceiling.  The principle of their installation is not noticeably different, but you need to decide in advance where the sensor will be installed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The principle of operation of the motion sensor is simple.  The device has a controlled area.  As soon as a moving object appears in this area, the sensor is brought into operation.  The contact closes, the load is connected to the circuit.  Electric current is supplied to the lamp.  As soon as movement in the coverage area stops, after a set period of time the circuit opens, the lamp goes out.  The sensor enters standby mode again.  This simple principle should know the wizard who will perform the installation of the device. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  When considering how to install a motion sensor on the street or at home, you should pay attention to the features of each model.  Presented equipment can be ceiling or wall.  The choice depends on the features of operation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lampy.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install an infrared motion sensor?" class="if uuid-3149895" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149895.jpg"></div><p>  Ceiling sensors have a 360 ¬∞ circular detection zone.  It has the shape of a cone.  The beam divergence angle is 120 ¬∞.  This type of equipment creates a multipath coverage area.  When it crosses, the sensor will detect a deviation.  Because of this, it will be brought into working condition.  Depending on the model, the ceiling sensor is installed at a height of 2.5-3 m from the floor. The protected area can vary from 10 to 20 m. Ceiling models are most often installed in rooms with small dimensions.  Here it turns out to control simultaneously all 4 sides.  Under such conditions, a wall mounted sensor may not be effective. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Considering how to correctly install the light-on motion sensor, you need to consider the features of the model.  So, wall-mounted types of devices are characterized by a wider scope.  They can be installed both inside and outside the building.  This type of sensor also creates a multipath barrier.  But in this case, the angle of the rays is only 90 ¬∞.  The installation height of the device varies from 2 to 2.5 m. The protected area when using wall-mounted equipment is 10-15 m. </p><h2>  Motion Response </h2><p>  How to install home motion sensors?  Before buying a model of equipment, you need to find out by what principle a reaction to movement in a controlled area occurs.  By the method of determining the appearance of a person in the zone of action of rays, active and passive sensors are distinguished.  The choice must be made in accordance with the scope of the equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="support.dlink.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install a motion sensor in the light?" class="if uuid-3149893" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149893.jpg"></div><p>  Passive models react to the heat that a person radiates.  Active models are similar in principle to an echo sounder or radar.  They send a signal into space, and then analyze its reflection.  If the distance from the start to end point of the beam has changed, the sensor is triggered.  It is worth considering that the combined models are also on sale, in which both reaction principles are provided. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Active sensors operate in the high radio frequency or ultrasound range.  The human ear does not pick up this signal.  Ultrasound is within the range of 20,000 Hz.  But here dogs, cats and some other types of animals hear him.  Moreover, pets begin to behave because of this very restlessly.  If there are animals in the apartment or house, the installation of an active sensor is not allowed. </p><p>  It is worth noting that active varieties of equipment do not ‚Äúnotice‚Äù walls, furniture, etc. They can only ‚Äúsee‚Äù moving objects.  If the installation of such equipment is not carried out correctly, it can even respond to the swaying of tree branches outside the window.  Therefore, in this case, the risk of false positives is great.  You need to choose the right place to install such a sensor.  Active type models are more expensive than passive devices. </p><p>  Passive sensors operate in the infrared range.  If you want to connect a lighting control system in the apartment, this option will be preferable.  Having studied the recommendations on how to install an infrared motion sensor, the novice master will be able to perform the installation independently.  To make a mistake in this case will be much more difficult. </p><p>  Infrared sensors respond to the heat radiated by the human body.  For this reason, the presented variety of devices is the most common for indoor installation. </p><h2>  Choosing an installation location </h2><p>  There are several options for connecting motion sensors.  They can be mounted at the entrance of an apartment building, in the utility room or on the street. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hyperikon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install motion sensors at home?" class="if uuid-3149896" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149896.jpg"></div><p>  You can make lighting for the entire stairwell or just the door of your own apartment.  The choice of option depends on the reaction of neighbors to the proposal to install special equipment.  To do this, adjust the sensitivity of the sensor accordingly.  To create lighting exclusively before entering your apartment, the coverage area should be minimal. </p><p>  How to install a motion sensor to turn on staircase lighting in a country house?  You can mount several consecutive lighting devices that will be turned on using the presented equipment as a person moves.  In the simplest version, only 2 sensors can be installed.  They will be mounted below and at the top of the stairs. </p><p>  In the utility room, in the garage or pantry, other rooms, the sensor is installed opposite the front door.  It will fire when the sash is opened.  The light in this case will turn on for a while.  During this period, a person entering inside will be able to switch the switch to normal mode. </p><p>  Some owners of private homes are interested in how to install a flashlight with a motion sensor.  This is a fairly simple technique.  You can mount a separate sensor for each lamp in the garden or along the path.  Often, such systems are mounted above the gate, entrance to the garage or house, etc. </p><p>  To use sensors for street lighting, you need to choose models with a brightness analyzer.  In this case, the system will only work in the dark.  It is also recommended to choose varieties on batteries.  In this case, you do not need to stretch the wire lines. </p><h2>  Recommendations of specialists </h2><p>  Experienced electricians give tips on how to properly install a motion sensor on the street or indoors.  There are a few general guidelines to consider.  The sensors have a plastic housing.  Therefore, they must be protected from shock.  It is especially important to protect the plastic Fresnel lens.  This is one of the most important elements of the system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wikihow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="motion sensor where to install" class="if uuid-3149898" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149898.jpg"></div><p>  If the sensor will be mounted outside the room, it should not be exposed to direct sunlight, rainfall.  Therefore, the sensor must be covered with a protective visor.  In windy weather, the device may be triggered due to the movement of tree branches.  Therefore, do not install such equipment in close proximity to them. </p><p>  When studying how to install <span>a motion sensor to light</span> in a room, it is worth considering that it cannot be mounted near the heating system.  Hot batteries, the stove should not fall into the field of view of the device.  To do this, you need to adjust the angle of inclination of the rays in a vertical plane, as well as the height of the device. </p><p>  It is also worth considering that an incandescent lamp should not fall into the field of view of the sensor.  This can cause a backlash.  Due to the heated filament, the sensor will trigger again and again. </p><p>  If the device has a triac or thyristor switching element at the output, it may not work correctly in conjunction with an LED and fluorescent lamp.  If the system has a conventional electromechanical relay, such problems do not arise. </p><p>  Also, experienced electricians argue that it is extremely important to adhere to safety during the work.  It is necessary to disconnect the network so as not to get an electric shock when connecting the equipment.  A special tool designed to work with electricity should be used. </p><h2>  Infrared Sensor Installation </h2><p>  You need to consider how to properly install the infrared type motion sensor.  First you need to choose the right place for installation, from where the best viewing angle will open both horizontally and vertically.  Most of these devices have a dead zone, the location of which must be taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="oubiu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install the light-on movement sensor?" class="if uuid-3149897" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149897.jpg"></div><p>  The fixture must be secure.  In this case, it is necessary to take into account its correct orientation in space.  Also, before installation, you should read the manufacturer's instructions, study the connection diagram.  It is necessary to think over the wiring diagram, connecting the light bulb.  If the model has a terminal for connecting the ground, it must be provided. </p><h2>  Wiring diagram </h2><p>  How to install a motion sensor in the light?  During installation, the standard scheme is used.  It is presented by the manufacturer of the equipment in the instructions.  There is a terminal block inside the sensor.  The contacts marked in a standard way are displayed on it: </p><ul><li>  Brown or black (L) - phase wire. </li><li>  Red (A, L ', Ls) - return contact for lamps. </li><li>  Blue (N) - neutral wire. </li><li>  Yellow green - grounding. </li></ul><p>  The power supply is connected via terminals L and N. Lighting fixtures are connected to the contacts Ls and N. The connection phase must be clearly observed. </p><h2>  Mounting Features </h2><p>  You should consider step by step how to install a motion sensor.  The most common option is to mount the wall sensor.  It is almost always fixed in the corner of the room.  The lamp is best installed above the door.  Experienced electricians advise a separate line for the sensor and the lamp associated with it.  The main lighting should be switched on as usual, using the switch.  This will disable the sensor at any time, if there is no need for it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install a motion sensor on the street?" class="if uuid-3149894" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149894.jpg"></div><p>  Before starting the installation, you need to create a drawing on which all elements of the system will be indicated.  The switch must have one button more than previously provided.  If a single lever switch was installed here, you need to replace it with a device with two keys.  A loose contact must be connected to the mains. </p><p>  When the equipment will be connected in accordance with the existing scheme, you need to check its performance. </p><h2>  System check </h2><p>  Considering the method of how to install a motion sensor, it is worth paying attention to the correct installation of the system.  It is advisable to check the health of all elements of the equipment before they are installed.  To do this, they are connected in a temporary manner.  This is especially important for simple models that do not have adjustments. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lampenwelt.ch" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to install a flashlight with a motion sensor?" class="if uuid-3149899" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/3149899.jpg"></div><p>  If the system worked properly before installation, but difficulties arose after installation, it means that the wizard did the wrong thing. </p><p>  If you want to install a system with adjustable light threshold, it also needs to be checked.  The timer is set to the minimum position.  The threshold of illumination should be set to maximum. </p><p>  On sale are models in which the manufacturer provides for a special LED indicator.  If the sensor detects movements, the system will trigger.  This indicates the operability of the device. </p><p>  Also, the performance of the system can be easily checked if an electromagnetic relay is installed in it.  His clicking indicates the health of the equipment.  Further, all elements of the system are mounted in accordance with the scheme provided by the manufacturer.  After connecting the equipment, you need to correctly adjust the motion sensor. </p><h2>  Adjustment </h2><p>  Having considered how to install the motion sensor, you need to study the procedure for its adjustment.  For each room you need to configure strictly individually.  After the system is mounted, it needs to be configured.  It should be more accurate, which corresponds to the operating conditions.  It is necessary to determine the most optimal value. </p><p>  Most sensors provide a timer for a certain period of time, which can be set independently.  This value varies from a few seconds to 10 minutes. </p><p>  Photosensitivity can also be adjusted, but this feature is not available on all devices.  This can be done if the system has a light sensor.  It responds to the intensity of daylight.  Due to the presence of such a system, an electric current is continuously ceased to be supplied to the sensor during the day.  Only after dark does the system enter standby mode. </p>
