Everyone has jeans that have been very fashionable for some length of time, and possibly just comfortable.  But over time, they wear out.  Such jeans could simply be thrown away by buying new ones, but you can give them a new life, which is what designers who offer new and original solutions do.  These are bags, shorts, breeches, backpacks.  A small master class on how to sew a backpack with your own hands will probably help some of you to create such an original little thing for yourself. </p><h2>  What are denim backpacks? </h2><p>  An important role in popularizing the backpack was played by: a fashion for a sports lifestyle, a sporty style of clothing, outdoor activities, a desire to enjoy comfortable things.  You can purchase a ready-made accessory for any area of ‚Äã‚Äãleisure or activity.  But knowing how to sew a backpack, and knowing how to do it well, it‚Äôs worth taking and making this thing yourself.  This will be the only and original instance. </p><p>  To do this, choose which style you will sew.  The pattern of each backpack is different.  It can be in the form of a bag with an extended cord, tightening the top.  In such a backpack, the bottom is not done.  Or sew a roomy product for hiking.  How to sew a backpack more spacious?  It should have a volume that creates the bottom and sides.  The shape can be oval and rectangular, and to maintain the shape, you need to insert a sealant between the lining and the denim. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amazon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rhinestone Backpack" class="if uuid-2419626" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2419626.jpg"></div><p>  For a small backpack, the trouser leg of old denim pants is enough.  Such an accessory can be made in the form of a small shoulder bag for sportswear.  He is comfortable and cute, and he likes the kids.  There is no need to buy a new fabric for a backpack, if among the things in the wardrobe there are old jeans that are very suitable for creating an exclusive product.  Before you start sewing, you must prepare the material: remove all seams, if necessary;  wash the prepared material and iron. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you plan to decorate the backpack with embroidery or applique, all this must be prepared in advance.  It is worth considering that you might want to combine your product with another fabric or leather.  In this case, you should choose the appropriate color and texture of the partner's material. </p><h2>  We make a pattern </h2><p>  The first thing to do before you start making a backpack out of jeans is a pattern.  The product can be very simple, without any exact calculations, but the pattern greatly facilitates the workflow. </p><p>  According to the chosen model, the paper size of the future backpack must indicate the desired size.  This is the height of the back and the width of the front and rear parts at three points (bottom, top and middle). </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern of details of a backpack from jeans trousers" class="if uuid-2419696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2419696.jpg"></div><p>  If it is a volume backpack, then the dimensions of the sides of the backpack and the bottom are necessary.  The sidewalls have a height equal to the height of the main product, and the lower part - the bottom - should have dimensions equal to the width of the main product and the width of the sidewalls.  Sewing a backpack with your own hands on a pattern will be much easier. </p><p>  Valves, pockets, belts must be modeled, taking into account the dimensions of the product.  When the pattern is ready, it is cut according to the seam allowances.  Denim products are dense, so you need sharp scissors and thicker threads.  As accessories, you can use carabiners, clips, leather belts, buttons and rivets. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Turning jeans into a backpack </h2><p>  So, you have found jeans in your wardrobe that you don‚Äôt already wear, and your imagination is swallowed by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a backpack, which is now in fashion.  Now this practical item can be found not only among the things of a student or traveler, it hangs casually on the shoulder of a fashionista or fashionista in a club.  How to sew a backpack from old jeans quickly and without patterns?  This can be done by sewing it from the top of the trousers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.missrosi.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Shoulder Backpack" class="if uuid-2417009" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2417009.jpg"></div><p>  From the jeans prepared for the alteration, we cut off the legs.  If the upper part in depth is not enough for the backpack, and in your opinion it will seem small, we make the necessary lengthening from the legs.  This is approximately 15-20 centimeters in height, and the width is taken along the width of the top of the backpack.  The straps are cut out, sewn and sewn to its back, and a cord is pulled into the harness of the belt, which tightens the top of the product. </p><h2>  Decor for backpacks </h2><p>  Handwork always looks stylish and original, especially when it comes to decor.  Fashionistas give vent to their imagination, decorating their new thing with terry, cords, rhinestones, beads, rivets, satin inserts, turning this wardrobe item into a real masterpiece. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  By the way, designers recommend hiding any deformation, scuffs or holes on denim behind accessories. </p><p>  Those who love variety make temporary decor on their exclusive backpacks.  It includes all kinds of badges made on a metal basis with various drawings, inscriptions, and figures.  Glamorous look brooches on the backpacks of little ladies.  It can be a cute brooch with a bow or flower. </p><p>  The irreplaceable detail in the decor that can be changed every day is key rings.  They are currently very popular with young girls.  These are pompons hanging on a chain or fur toys.  If there are zippers on the backpack, then there is such an ornament that is attached to the slider of the clasp - these are brushes. </p><h2>  A small backpack in an hour </h2><p>  Old unnecessary jeans, as we already understood, can be easily turned into a classy and stylish accessory.  It can be worn with sportswear and a light romantic dress, it all depends on what kind it will be given.  You can sew a backpack from jeans manually, without a sewing machine. </p><div class="photo" data-original="maobi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DIY backpack" class="if uuid-2419364" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2419364.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, you will need: </p><ul><li>  old denim pants; </li><li>  fabric materials if lined; </li><li>  lace for decoration; </li><li>  tape or cord. </li></ul><p>  If jeans have many pockets, they can be used simultaneously as decor - a place for different things.  Sewing a small backpack according to the pattern, which is shown in the photo below, is quite easy.  The main part has dimensions 38 x 40 centimeters.  This is the top of the trousers.  The flap and pocket can be sewn from denim of thinner trousers or from the same trousers.  They can either be trimmed with thin lace, as an option for girls, or leave an unprocessed edge, which can be a little "loosened."  Do not throw labels away.  They will come in handy as a decor for a backpack. </p><h2>  Pattern for a small backpack </h2><div class="photo" data-original="maobi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pattern for a backpack model" class="if uuid-2419372" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2419372.jpg"></div><p>  The shoulder straps are made of denim pants of the desired width and are sewn to the back of the backpack or fastened with small carabiners. </p><h2>  Backpack for girls </h2><p>  Children at any age love original backpacks.  Grandmothers and mothers could well satisfy the needs of their little princesses by creating the necessary and quite mobile accessory from old jeans trousers.  To make a backpack you will need old jeans, some dense jacquard fabric for decoration and sewing accessories.  In the video "Jeans Backpack" a master class on how to sew a rucksack from jeans with your own hands is wonderful and lucid. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="rvEetk60sNk" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=77&amp;v=rvEetk60sNk" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/2/5/7/6/2576.jpg"></div><p>  Sewing such an accessory will take no more than two hours, taking into account the fact that in old jeans it is necessary to rip seams. </p><p>  I would like to add some decor options to such a pretty backpack.  These can be rhinestones along the lines of the joining of different tissues.  And on the denim itself, you can put up vertical patterns if your machine embroiders them.  It will look very nice on such an accessory. </p><h2>  Backpack for boy </h2><p>  Now consider how to sew a backpack for a boy.  The first requirement is that he should look more strictly than a girl.  On it, patch pockets on the back of jeans trousers or welt pockets with a zipper will be actual. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thehandmadecrafts.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Backpack for girls and boys" class="if uuid-2419805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2419805.jpg"></div><p>  For sewing such an accessory it is better to take not the trouser legs, but the upper part of the trousers.  A backpack for a boy made of jeans and decorating fabric placed on top will look beautiful.  It should be in tone with the color of jeans or have discreet patterns, for example, in the form of stars.  There is no bottom for such a backpack, just stitched panels of the front and back of the backpack.  At the bottom, harnesses are sewn from the cut belt into which the cord is threaded.  The best option would be blue or black.  As you can see, in order to sew a backpack from jeans, a pattern in this case is not needed. </p><p>  The boy‚Äôs backpack can be decorated with thermal stickers that are attached with an iron.  It can be logos, animals, cartoon characters.  The most interesting option is a sticker in the form of letters of the name of the child.  The backpack in this case becomes unique, personalized. </p><h2>  Patchwork Style Accessory </h2><p>  It is not necessary to have such old jeans that make up a full-fledged backpack from trousers or the upper part.  You can make an original model from pieces of denim cut from pants.  It can be strips 30 cm long, 5 cm wide. These strips are sewn with a zigzag seam to the fabric, which serves as the lining of the backpack. </p><div class="photo" data-original="melinoliesl.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Detachable harness backpack" class="if uuid-2417083" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2417083.jpg"></div><p>  You can arrange the stripes vertically and horizontally, as you like.  In our photo they are located horizontally. </p><p>  This backpack can be sewn in the form of a bag with strap fastenings in the lower part and in the middle of the upper.  The straps can be made removable on small carbines.  It is possible to provide decorative pockets torn from the back of old jeans trousers. </p><p>  Having become acquainted with this article, you can create a lot of useful and original things from old jeans, including backpacks, the most important thing is the availability of time and a flight of imagination.  Good luck in your work. </p>
