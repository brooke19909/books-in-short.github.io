    <h2>  The appearance of the city </h2><p>  Where the city of Khiva (Uzbekistan) is located today, the first settlement, according to archaeological excavations, appeared as early as 4-3 millennia BC, there was a camp for hunters and fishermen of the Kaltaminar culture.  In the 2nd millennium, stationary housing of nomads and farmers was already housed here.  The culture of farmers was mixed with the traditions of pastoralists who came from the Southern Urals, as a result, an early Amirabad culture of early bronze was formed.  Since that time, the settlers succeeded each other, but the Amu Darya delta has never been empty.  This territory was very well located on the trade routes, and also had enormous opportunities for cattle breeding and agriculture. </p>

    <h2>  Khiva History </h2><p>  Later legends say that the city of Khiva grew up in the center of the oasis, where a well with surprisingly tasty water was located.  This well was supposedly dug by the <span>son of Noah</span> Sim.  The first city, which is recorded in written sources, was called Heyvak, then there were Khorasmiya, Hvarezm and, finally, Khorezm.  He experienced periods of prosperity and conquest, was the capital of the vast Khorezm state. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The city was first owned by the Afrigid dynasty, then the Arabs conquered the city and it became part of the Muslim state.  Then the rulers succeeded one another: the dynasty of the Mamunids, Gaznevids, Seljuks, Anushteginids.  The city has too many virtues not to fight for it, so different rulers constantly sought to conquer it. </p><p>  In 1220, the city was destroyed by the army of Genghis Khan.  But he very quickly reborn and again became a tidbit.  So, Tamerlan five times tries to take the city by attack, and in 1388 he finally succeeds.  Later, the city continues to change hands.  At the beginning of the 17th century, Khiva became the spiritual center of the Muslim world, madrasahs are being built here.  But the real heyday of the city falls on the reign of the Uzbek Kungrat dynasty. </p><p>  The 18-19 centuries became a time of construction and accumulation of wealth for the city.  In 1873, as a result of a military operation, Khiva became part of the Russian Empire.  Since that time, the city is part of the Turkmen region.  The rapid development of the city begins, schools, hospitals are being built here.  In 1919, the Red Army overthrows the existing khanate and establishes a new order, the city is part of the Soviet Union.  Since 1924, Khiva has been part of the Uzbek SSR. </p>
