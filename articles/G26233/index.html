Here hotels of various levels are built.  The infrastructure is developed exactly as much as necessary for a comfortable stay.  And at the same time, there are no noisy establishments in the village that interfere with a relaxing holiday.  There are no entertainments in the village itself.

But still they are quite suitable for relaxation.  A gentle entrance to the sea makes the beach very comfortable for swimming.  The rugged coastline has numerous bays.  The coast is quite convenient for families. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.calypsotour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Outdoor area" class="if uuid-2290411" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2290411.jpg"></div><p>  It is worth noting that Okurcalar is a resort village.

The hottest period is August and July. </p><h2>  Hotel reviews </h2><p>  If you are choosing a place to stay for yourself, then you will probably try to analyze the reviews.  Justiniano Deluxe Resort 5 * is a modern new hotel offering a good rest.  According to numerous health resort visitors, the hotel complex can be safely attributed to those institutions about which very conflicting reviews are left.  Despite the full potential of the hotel, there are many such points that offset many of the positive characteristics.  And now let's look at everything in more detail.  According to reviews, Justiniano Deluxe Resort 5 * is a place for relaxing unpretentious tourists.  The Okurcalar resort itself is still very young and at the present time only the process of its formation is taking place.  There are no attractions and attractions in the village.  Therefore, if you are counting on any entertainment or sightseeing programs, then you definitely need to find another resort.  The largest amusement is the water park in the territory of one of the hotels.  As for the attractions, then they will have to go at least to Alanya. </p><p>  Justiniano Deluxe Resort 5 * (Alanya) has a small and compact territory.  She is well-groomed and very green.  There are playgrounds.  But there is not much space for walking. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.calypsotour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Restaurant" class="if uuid-2290412" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2290412.jpg"></div><p>  The hotel consists of two buildings.  Which one is better is a moot point.  Many people think that the main body is better.  It is located right on the beach.  And the main restaurant is located in this building.  The road to the sea from the second building passes through the underpass in order to avoid crossing the road. </p><h2>  Reviews about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The rooms of the hotel complex are distinguished by fresh repairs and new furniture.  They are all good enough.  However, there are also disadvantages.  The fact is that in both buildings absolutely terrible soundproofing.  The rooms have a strong audibility.  Tourists are well aware of what is happening in the neighboring rooms.  Unfortunately, during construction they did not at all take care of good sound insulation.  The rest of the rooms are good for relaxing.  Some of them overlook the sea.  Apartments are cleaned regularly; there are no problems with this.  In general, the number of rooms is good and new. </p><h2>  Nutrition Reviews </h2><p>  Tourists have a lot of complaints about food.  Of course, you can‚Äôt call him bad, but there are some points that spoil the positive impression of rest.  Many tourists note the scarcity and monotony of breakfast.  On tables throughout the day there is a very meager selection of meat and fish dishes.  Even those that are available are completely tasteless.  Buffet dishes are more varied during the high season.  In winter, when the influx of guests drops significantly, there is a decrease in the range of dishes.  Thanks to the all-inclusive concept, guests are offered local drinks.  Some vacationers believe that they are absolutely not tasty.  In addition, the local chef does not have very good desserts.  But there are always a lot of fruits and vegetables on the tables.  It is very convenient that there is a late dinner.  You can always order it in your room. </p><h2>  Beach Vacation Reviews </h2><p>  The beautiful coast is one of the main advantages of the hotel.  Incredibly comfortable approach with small pebbles and clear water - all this makes the rest unforgettable.  The hotel is located on the coast of the bay, which is why there are practically no waves.  On the coldest days, guests of the establishment can enjoy the heated indoor pool, which is very convenient. </p><p>  For swimming on the beach, it is recommended to have special shoes in which it is convenient to enter the water along a pebble bottom.  But this is not necessary.  In addition, for tourists, a pontoon is installed on the coast, which allows you to lower it directly into the water.  The equipped beach is very clean and beautiful.  The local coast is beautiful and well-groomed.  Justiniano Deluxe Resort 5 * beach is incredibly convenient and good for relaxation. </p><h2>  General impression of the hotel ... </h2><p>  In general, according to spa guests, you can have a good time at the hotel, especially if you are an admirer of a lazy beach holiday.  The main building has a free sauna and hammam.  It uses natural oils that make the procedures even more enjoyable.  For lovers of sports training, the hotel has a gym.  Unfortunately, part of the simulators in it does not work, but it is still possible to conduct a training.  In the hotel wireless internet is available only for a fee, and you must pay for the use of each gadget.  Tourists note that Wi-Fi is so weak that even at the reception it is not always possible to use it, and there‚Äôs no need to talk about the quality of the signal in the rooms. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.calypsotour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel animation" class="if uuid-2290413" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2290413.jpg"></div><p>  Near the hotel there is a market where you can buy not only fruits, but also all traditional Turkish products.  It sells not only souvenirs, but also high-quality bedding, shoes, leather items and much more. </p><p>  The animation at the hotel is completely unobtrusive.  In high season there is a kids club and entertainment programs for adults and children.  If you plan to go on vacation in the winter, then you need to be prepared for the fact that the choice of events will be minimal. </p><h2>  Resort Attractions </h2><p>  Okurcalar is a good place for a lazy vacation.  If you want to do absolutely nothing, but just bask on the beach, then you should definitely visit the resort.  But the nightlife in the village is a problem.  More precisely, she is not here.  If you want entertainment, you will have to go to Alanya.  The infrastructure of the resort is just beginning to develop, so there are no night clubs here yet.  But the resort can please silence and tranquility. </p><p>  In fairness, it is worth saying that in the village there are absolutely no interesting sights.  If you want to see something interesting, then you need to go to Alanya or Side.  There you can admire the ruins of pagan temples, an ancient amphitheater, a beautiful fortress, a phosphoric cave, the Red Tower and other attractions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.calypsotour.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel spa" class="if uuid-2290415" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2290415.jpg"></div><p>  Of the possible entertainment in the village, you should pay attention to rafting, tennis, horseback riding, volleyball, soccer, bowling and billiards.  You can also visit the baths, saunas and spa centers. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Hotel "Justiniano" can please its guests with a beautiful beach and the possibility of a good holiday.  The hotel complex has its advantages and disadvantages.  According to tourists, the hotel is suitable for relaxing unpretentious holidaymakers who are able to close their eyes to some nuances.  The modest diet is offset by the beautiful nature of the bay and the beautiful sea.  But if you want to get active animation and entertainment, then you should choose a more developed resort.  Since Okurcalar is a place for a relaxing holiday.  By the way, the local bay is good for children.  The unique microclimate makes the resort convenient for families.  A warm sea is almost always calm and quiet. </p><p>  In general, the resort is of interest to a certain category of tourists.  Not all vacationers are attracted to noisy places to relax.  Therefore, Okurcalar is good for couples or older people.  While the village is still being rebuilt, it cannot offer vibrant nightlife.  But this is its appeal. </p>
