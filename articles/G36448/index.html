    <h2>  Hotel Maistrali Hotel Apts Class A 4 *: service rating </h2><p>  It is worth noting that when checking into any hotel, an important role is played not only by the list of services provided, but also by their quality.  The Maistrali Hotel Apts Class A offers you many opportunities for relaxation, and based on guest reviews, you can give them an appropriate rating on a five-point scale: </p><ul><li>  A solid four can be put in the infrastructure of this hotel.  Here is a very beautiful landscaped area, and also pleases the presence of a fairly large parking zone.  But the work of restaurants and bars is poor.  There are incredibly high prices, as well as an uncomfortable schedule. </li><li>  Service can be rated at 3.5.  Basically, such a low score is due to the lack of animation.  Rather, it is, but no recreational activities are held.  But the rest of the staff shows a high level of professionalism and a courteous attitude towards the guests. </li><li>  Hotel apartments also deserve a four.  It is worth noting the excellent quality of cleaning, but the furniture is slightly outdated.  In addition, the sound insulation is unsatisfactory. </li><li>  Perhaps the highest rating - 4.5 - was put on the beach.  It is very close (leaving the hotel, you once find yourself by the sea).  There is never a crowding on it, and the entrance to the sea is cleared of sharp stones and shells. </li><li>  The hotel is very conveniently located, therefore, the item was rated 4.3.  There are a lot of resort infrastructure around, but the main attractions are somewhat removed. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, relaxation is rarely completely perfect.  This can be said about the hotel Maistrali Hotel Apts Class A 4 * (Cyprus).  The reviews left by tourists are accompanied by the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  if you find yourself in a room, next to the windows of which there is a ventilation pipe from the restaurant, then immediately ask for a replacement, since from the early morning you will be awakened by a terrible noise and buzz; </li><li>  the apartments are just terrible soundproofing - you will hear everything that happens on the street, in the corridor and in neighboring rooms; </li><li>  very old furniture, and especially sagging sofas are striking; </li><li>  despite the fact that many resources indicate that wireless Internet is free, in fact you have to pay quite expensive for this service (it is better to order coffee in a nearby cafe and use a free network there with excellent speed); </li><li>  the rooms do not have signs that say "do not disturb", and therefore you are not safe from the fact that when you lie down to rest, the maid will not come to the room; </li><li>  Despite the well-kept and clean pool, a lot of flies fly next to it, which also bite. </li></ul><h2>  General impression of the hotel </h2><p>  If you want to have a quality and inexpensive vacation in Cyprus, then the Maistrali Hotel Apts Class A 4 * (Protaras) is just perfect for you.  This establishment boasts an incredibly advantageous location, because the beach is located almost at the exit of the main building.  In addition, the remoteness of the roadway can be considered a positive point, which protects you from excess noise, dust and exhaust gases.  Near a huge number of shops and cafes, as well as interesting places for walking. </p><p>  Due to the slightly outdated situation, the prices for accommodation at the Maistrali Hotel Apts Class A 4 * (Protaras) are quite low for the first coastline.  But the food in the restaurant is unreasonably expensive.  But this is fully offset by the presence in the room of its own full kitchen.  In addition, there are a lot of cafes and restaurants in the neighborhood with delicious food and affordable prices.  A huge advantage can be considered the presence of a Russian-speaking staff who will always come to your aid in resolving organizational issues. </p><p>  Have a good rest! </p>
