And here we are talking not only about snow-white beaches with azure surf, but also about city-museums, places with unprecedented architecture and history.  In this regard, many do not know where this time to go on vacation, so we give a little hint.  Cities of Canada - this is exactly what not everyone saw.  Therefore, everyone will be interested in being in this region, regardless of tastes and preferences. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cities of canada" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271033.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This northern country has a very interesting feature, which basically characterizes it.  It combines natural heritage and modern progress, which is manifested in architecture.  You can admire the extraordinary pink sunset, the endless lakes and light frost and at the same time see the skyscrapers and towers erected today, only here.  Cities of Canada are large and not densely populated, which is ideal for any traveler.  Therefore, we will begin a tour of this northern paradise, and Toronto will be the starting point. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="major cities of canada" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271032.jpg" width="600"></div>

On its territory there is exotic nature, and beautiful parks, and picturesque alleys.  That is why many couples prefer to spend part of their <span>honeymoon</span> here.  It is also worth noting that in this metropolis there are many cozy cafes and restaurants where you can eat at very reasonable prices. </p><p>  Many cities in Canada were founded at a time when Columbus only swam to the shores of America.  Among these ancient centers, one cannot forget about Vancouver - a metropolis located on the shores of the <span>Pacific Ocean.</span>  It is here that you can, having risen on the roof of one of the tall houses, enjoy the sunset that comes here later than everyone else in the world.  Fogs are not uncommon here, for this reason it is believed that in Vancouver the ocean merges with the sky. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of canada with cities" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/271034.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Most often, tourists are attracted by the large cities of Canada, and this is not surprising.  Indeed, it is in such centers that you can simultaneously relax and recharge with energy, which then lasts for a long time.  One of these places is Montreal, located on the border with the United States.  This city is considered a place of assimilation of ancient American traditions and modern trends, which mainly arise in the States.  There is vanity and quiet places where you can always retire and spend time calmly. </p><p>  The local province of Ontario, on the territory of which the famous <span>Niagara Falls</span> is located, enjoys incredible fame and popularity <span>.</span>  Many locals claim that the cities of Canada, which are near this place, have a special aura and magic.  Everyone who visits this northern country is sure to see how giant water flows flow over rocks and cliffs.  Also, while in Ontario, be sure to try the local wine, which is offered both in restaurants and at public tastings. </p><p>  Very interesting and exciting can be a tour of the country, which you can organize yourself.  The most important thing you will need is a map of Canada with cities, as well as a GPS navigator.  It is he who will help you by car in the shortest possible time to get from one metropolis to another. </p>
