    <h2>  Selection of organizations by rating </h2><p>  One of the most common methods for choosing a suitable financial institution is to study its rating.  Moreover, the top commercial organizations can be compiled according to various criteria, for example, by the size of assets, the amount of profit, the level of public trust, etc. Let us consider the most common of them. </p><h2>  Rating by income (for the II quarter of this year) </h2><p>  According to the data received, many Belarusian banks suffered losses in the II quarter of this year.  According to analysts, their profit margin decreased by about 22.8% (excluding tax expenses).  And only 2/3 of financial institutions received additional income, several times higher than the previous quarter.  Based on these data, a rating was compiled of commercial and government institutions acting as flagships in the domestic banking market. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  For example, the notorious Belarusbank became one of the leaders in this rating.  The size of his profit increased by 3.3 times and amounted to 467.7 billion <span>Belarusian rubles (BYR).</span>  The central office of this organization, founded as a result of the merger of several small companies in 1995, is located in Minsk, on Dzerzhinsky Avenue, 18. </p><p>  Other banks of Belarus also fought to get into the top three.  However, in terms of profit, they lost to the ‚ÄúDevelopment Bank of the Republic of Belarus‚Äù.  The size of its profit for the II quarter amounted to 414.4 billion BYR, which is 11.7% more than the previous reporting period.  This organization began operations in mid-June 2011.  Its head office is located on Masherova Avenue, 35, in Minsk. </p><p>  Priorbank was in third place with its income of 237.2 billion Belarusian rubles.  However, if we compare these figures with the size of profit for the I quarter, then his income significantly decreased - by 42.2%.  But this did not stop him from entering the top three.  Recall that Priorbank was founded in early 1989.  Its central office is located on the street Vera Khoruzhey, 31-A, in Minsk. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Such banks of Belarus as Belgazprombank and TK Bank actively competed for fourth place.  But in this unequal struggle, the first credit institution won, having received profit for the second quarter in the range of 156.8 billion bel.  rubles.  And this is despite the fact that the income of Belgazprombank, founded in 1990, also halved (if we compare it with the previous reporting period).  The office of this institution is located on Pritytskogo Street, 60/2. </p><p>  Unlike its rival, TK Bank did not show the best results, therefore it did not even reach the fifth, but the twelfth place.  As it turned out, this financial institution, which was created in 2008, earned only 57.6 billion BYR during the reporting period.  The company office can be found on Timiryazev Street, 65 / A. </p><p>  Among the other participating organizations were the following Belarusian banks: </p><ul><li>  BPS-Sberbank. </li><li>  Home Credit Bank. </li><li>  "Delta Bank". </li><li>  "Idea Bank" and others. </li></ul><h2>  Asset Rating </h2><p>  Another important rating that you should pay attention to is the top 20.  It lists the most popular Belarusian banks with the largest assets.  For example, Belarusbank was on the first rung.  The size of its assets amounted to 262 million bel.  rub.  The position below was placed Belagroprombank with its 98 million bel.  rub. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>
