Indeed, in RuNet offers a huge selection of ways to earn money.  However, do not forget about one important circumstance: in trying to improve your financial situation, you can stumble upon online scammers who can not only not pay for labor, but also lure the "last" money. </p><p>  Today, questionnaire activities are gaining popularity, but for many, the question remains open: is earnings from polls really not a hoax?  Well, there is no consensus.  Constantly flickering before your eyes advertising reports that earning money from surveys is an easy and quick way to enrich yourself: they say that in a couple of months of your work you can get a tidy sum that is enough for a trip to the "azure" shores.  Is this really so?  Will polling earnings improve their financial situation?  Reviews of pessimistic people, of whom there are many, indicate the opposite.  Consider this issue in more detail. </p><h2>  What is an online survey </h2><p>  Conducting surveys is the receipt of answers from the respondent in order to find out: how does he relate to the quality of certain goods (services). </p>

On the Internet, this work is carried out online. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Who initiates the questionnaire survey of respondents in RuNet?  First of all, <span>these are intermediary companies</span> between the manufacturer of the product and its consumer.  The fact is that large suppliers are not interested in knowing what opinion the buyer has on the quality of their products: perhaps there is a need to use additional reserves to increase demand.  In this case, the consumer also benefits: polling earnings bring him a certain income.  To put all this into practice, the manufacturer enters into an appropriate contract with an intermediary agency. </p><h2>  What do we have to do </h2><p>  Are you counting on making money on the Internet from polls?  Then you should create an email in your name and register on special resources that will send you questions for questioning. </p>

    <p>  You must also create a wallet for yourself in the electronic money system - you will receive a salary for it. </p><p>  Remember that in the first months, earnings on the Internet from surveys will be small.  In addition, you will not always be among the right respondents.  For example, you received a task, and suddenly at some stage of the questionnaire they inform you that you cannot take further part in this survey because you are not suitable for age.  Naturally, you will not receive money for it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The registration process on questionnaire sites takes a huge amount of time.  You will need to communicate a significant amount of contact information about yourself, starting from your profession and ending with hobbies. </p><h2>  Work specifics </h2><p>  After going through the registration procedure, do not think that you will be overwhelmed with work on the same day: at the first stage a week you will receive about 3-4 surveys.  You will only have to choose one of the suggested answers. </p>

    <p>  All profiles will be sent to your email address. </p><h2>  Work advantages </h2><p>  Of course, earning money from completing surveys, along with the above disadvantages, has an advantage: you can fill out questionnaires at any time and in any place where there is Internet access.  Also, this <span>type of activity</span> is noteworthy in that everyone can do it, regardless of level of education, gender, age. </p><h2>  Things to remember </h2><p>  Keep in mind that earning money from social surveys does not imply easy work.  Assiduity, hard work and responsibility will help in this matter.  If you think that in just a few hours of such work you can earn 4-5 thousand rubles, then you are mistaken.  To get the above amount for a month, a beginner will have to ‚Äúshovel‚Äù about a hundred questionnaires, registration on which takes a lot of time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Statistics show that only one user in twenty achieves serious results in the field of questioning.  In any case, making money in polls is characterized by painstaking and focused work, which takes a lot of time.  Perhaps, with a responsible approach to business, one will be able to earn 40-45 thousand rubles in a year. </p><h2>  Beware of ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù employers </h2><p>  Looking on the Internet for earnings on polls, you can easily run into scammers who scam money by cheating.  As a rule, gullible and naive people become their victims.  However, individuals who are overly greedy and wanting easy money fall into their networks.  All scammers know that a person loves to get money for nothing, and they manipulate this by advertising ads with this content: ‚ÄúIn an hour and a half I got 6,000 rubles.‚Äù  But, as you know, free cheese happens only in a mousetrap.  And that is not always the case. </p><h2>  Don't fall for lies </h2><p>  Some dishonest dealers, offering earnings on paid surveys, promise fabulous profits.  However, in order to receive it, you need to pay an entrance fee in the amount of 1000 - 1500 rubles. </p>

    <p>  According to the fraudster, this amount is required, since the questionnaire is considered to be elite, and access to it is limited.  Of course, ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù people will immediately suspect that something is amiss.  Naturally, <span>this is a deception of</span> pure water.  After you succumb to the tricks of the attacker and lay out your ‚Äúhard-earned money‚Äù to him, the principle of your work will remain the same: you will be even more persistent in answering questions in the hope of making ‚Äúbig money‚Äù, but after you reach the minimum amount for withdrawal , the application will be ignored. </p><p>  Surely there are newcomers who think that in a couple of days they will be able to gain financial independence. </p><p>  They see an advertisement that says that they will pay 50 rubles for one <span>sociological survey</span> , and if you register on 30-40 questionnaire sites, you can count on a big profit.  However, this view is erroneous.  Firstly, there is a high probability that you will come across scammers, and secondly, there are not so many honest Internet portals in the survey environment. </p>

    <p>  And it should be registered on such sites. </p><h2>  How much money can actually be obtained </h2><p>  If it is advertised on a verified Internet resource that for one questionnaire you will receive from 300 to 3000 rubles, then it is not a fact that in reality you can count on this money.  Why?  The fact is that questionnaires, the price of which is 3,000 rubles, are usually offered by foreign portals, and their share in the total mass of polls is quite small.  The situation is complicated by the fact that the participants in such questionnaires are mainly residents of the USA and Europe, and among them the selection is very strict.  That is why it is practically impossible for a Russian to become one of the respondents to the polls offered by foreign companies. </p><p>  There is another unpleasant incident, which should be remembered by a person who earns on polls.  The vast majority of sites adhere to the rule: one respondent cannot take part in surveys on the same topics too often. </p>

    <p>  To summarize the above, we can state the fact that in a month of ‚Äúsociological‚Äù work you can earn at best 4‚Äì5 thousand rubles, given that large and popular online questionnaires will send you questions. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  To increase your earnings in surveys, you should follow a few recommendations.  First, register exclusively in reliable companies with positive reviews.  Secondly, pay nothing to anyone (for a list of survey sites, registration, and so on).  Remember that all survey sites are available at no cost - they pay you money for the time spent and the work done, and not vice versa. </p>
