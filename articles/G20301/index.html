The functionality of these electrical assistants is constantly growing, as their developers come up with more and more nozzles and capabilities.  In addition, the filtration systems of the air driven by the engine through the apparatus are improved.  One of the models that have received such improvements to the filter system is the Electrolux Z7870 vacuum cleaner.  Reviews about him will help you figure out how good he is, and whether to purchase it for domestic use in your apartment. </p><h2>  Main characteristics </h2><p>  The model under consideration belongs to the category of vacuum cleaners having a bagless type of air filtration.  All garbage accumulates in a specially designed container.  Its internal shape is made in such a way that air turbulets compress debris in the designated recesses without using bags that constantly clog, allow fine dust to pass through and impair suction. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner electrolux z7870 specifications" class="if uuid-2779603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779603.jpg"></div><p>  As a power unit, an engine with a power of 1800 watts is used, which is a fairly high indicator for household vacuum cleaners.  This power is enough to remove dust from hard-to-reach places, as well as to clean any types of carpets in a quality manner.  A regulator is provided on the body, which can reduce the suction power when working with delicate types of rugs or fabrics.  It is designed for dry cleaning, so you cannot collect water or work with wet surfaces with it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are vacuum cleaners of this model on sale in two color options - with a predominant red or blue color.  Both are quite bright and can stand out against the background of the surrounding interior.  The case is made of fairly durable plastic, which ensures a long service life and resistance to shocks and even falls. </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In addition to the vacuum cleaner itself, the factory delivery set contains a flexible hose about 2 meters long, as well as a convenient telescopic metal tube, the height of which can be adjusted for comfortable operation.  In order to fully reveal the capabilities of the characteristics of the Electrolux Z7870 vacuum cleaner, the standard ‚Äúhalf-carpet‚Äù with a mode switch, as well as a special nozzle for parquet, laminate or linoleum, are used as the main nozzles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="prom.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner electrolux z7870 price" class="if uuid-2779605" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779605.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the manufacturer equipped the vacuum cleaner with a slotted nozzle, the functionality of which can be expanded with a fine brush tip, designed to work on hard surfaces. </p><h2>  Filter system </h2><p>  The main cyclone is an innovative cyclone for a vacuum cleaner.  It is a round container, in the center of which is a perforated tube that forms the desired direction of air movement.  Thanks to this design, most of the fine dust and all the large debris are deposited inside the container, from which it is then enough to simply shake them out into the bin. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the air passes through the cyclone filter, it is additionally cleaned from accidentally passing large fragments with a sponge filter located in front of the engine compartment.  According to reviews on the Electrolux Z7870 vacuum cleaner, this filter can be washed in water, since it, in fact, is an ordinary sponge with a certain diameter of holes.  If you do not clean it regularly, then the suction power may decrease markedly, which will negatively affect the quality of cleaning. </p><div class="photo" data-original="irecommend.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="vacuum cleaner electrolux z7870" class="if uuid-2779606" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779606.jpg"></div><p>  After the engine, air enters the last stage of cleaning, namely, in a Hygiene filter specially developed for this model.  It is multi-layered, capable of qualitatively retaining the smallest particles of dust invisible to the naked eye.  It is occasionally easy enough to knock it out for complete cleaning; this filter cannot be washed. </p><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  In order to understand how successful or unsuccessful this or that model is, it is not enough to get acquainted only with the characteristics from the manufacturer.  Only real user reviews can show its strengths and weaknesses.  Among the reviews on the Electrolux Z7870 vacuum cleaner, the following positive points most often stand out: </p><ul><li>  High suction power.  Installing an engine with a consumption of 1800 watts was the right decision, since such a move allowed us to make the vacuum cleaner as efficient and able to collect garbage from hard-to-reach places. </li><li>  Nice design.  This model looks quite futuristic and stands out from the competition.  The special shape of the cyclone for the vacuum cleaner made it possible to give the appearance its zest, due to which it immediately catches the eye.  And the bright colors well complemented this unusual image. </li><li>  Comfortable, soft hose.  During operation, it does not spin and allows you to easily get to any place. </li><li>  Reasonable cost.  Compared with other models, the Electrolux Z7870 vacuum cleaner, whose price is about 8 thousand rubles, stands out both in performance and design. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="price.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cyclone for vacuum cleaner" class="if uuid-2779602" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779602.jpg"></div><p>  However, despite this list of advantages, the model has a number of significant drawbacks.  It is worth familiarizing yourself with them before the decision to purchase is made, so that later there is no disappointment. </p><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  The main disadvantage, many users call rather expensive consumables.  The same Hygiene filter is quite easily damaged during cleaning, and some have to change it once every six months, which leads to additional costs. </p><p>  Some users in their reviews of the Electrolux Z7870 vacuum cleaner also note a not very convenient system for cleaning the container from debris, which requires both hands to be free.  This is not always convenient, especially if you have to shake out the trash on the street near the tanks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="allo.ua" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="designed for dry cleaning" class="if uuid-2779604" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2779604.jpg"></div><p>  Another unpleasant feature is a rather high noise level.  But this, in fact, is a consequence of increased power, since the motor has higher speeds than less powerful options.  The result is a rumble at high frequencies, which is not very pleasant for the ears of both the cleaning person and his neighbors. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The model in question has an interesting, catchy design and good power.  In its price category, it offers the opportunity to produce high-quality cleaning without unnecessary trouble.  However, the filter system requires constant maintenance and replacement, which translates into additional expenses that you need to be prepared for before purchasing this vacuum cleaner. </p>
