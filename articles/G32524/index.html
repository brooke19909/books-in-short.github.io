  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A tablet for working with documents and the Internet: an overview, selection tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Now the market has a huge variety of devices that are designed for specific tasks.  Tablets for working with documents and the Internet are not found on the market so often.  And in principle, such a category as such does not exist. </p><p>  In general, tablets are now losing popularity.  Someone replaces them with a smartphone, someone with a laptop.  Therefore, the niche is no longer needed.  Nevertheless, there are still consumers who need such a device. </p><h2>  Tablets </h2><p>  These devices have long been known to the user.  We learned about them back in 2002.  Then it was decided to produce laptops without a mouse and keyboard.  A stylus was needed for the job.  Over time, the touch screen was invented.  So we got the option of a classic tablet. </p><p>  For a long time, almost all devices were released for working with documents and the Internet.  Tablets poorly cope with multimedia and games.  But users needed not only social networks, but also toys.  As a result, manufacturers had to focus on such an audience. </p><p>  Gradually they began to forget about working tablets.  Many in need began to acquire netbooks and ultrabooks.  Although these options were more expensive, they were worthy of attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wired.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Internet tablet" class="if uuid-2985792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985792.jpg"></div><h2>  Changing trends </h2><p>  But time goes on, as always, everything changes.  Smartphones began to produce more and more, their diagonal is growing exponentially.  Even the iPhone, which was devoted to compactness, got a 6.5-inch model this year. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many users began to purchase <span>gaming computers</span> and laptops, so the gaming industry on tablets has suffered.  And all modern smartphones easily support gaming innovations. </p><p>  In order to somehow catch up with the desires of the consumer, the manufacturers decided to rework the tablets.  So there were docking stations and many accessories.  Tablets have become trendy and stylish. </p><p>  Despite the fact that many users do not see the point in purchasing a tablet with a laptop and a smartphone, some are looking for tablets for working with documents and the Internet. </p><h2>  How to choose? </h2><p>  If you still decided in 2018 to look after a working tablet, do not panic, several successful new products appeared this year.  What should I look for when choosing a device? </p><p>  First of all, you need to understand the functionality of the gadget.  Many options may not be needed at all, and some will become indispensable. </p><p>  Next, you have to decide on a budget.  A good tablet for working with documents and the Internet can be expensive.  Therefore, you will have to decide immediately on the permissible cost.  Either you get an auxiliary device for 10-15 thousand rubles, or buy a full-fledged assistant for 90 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="news4c.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Work with a tablet" class="if uuid-2985795" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985795.jpg"></div><p>  After that, you can pay attention to the appearance: screen size, the presence of additional parts, etc. The main thing is also to study the technical characteristics of the device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Tablet functionality </h2><p>  Which tablet is suitable for work?  At least one that can: </p><ul><li>  play text content; </li><li>  work with the Internet; </li><li>  run email monitoring programs; </li><li>  run social networking programs; </li><li>  work with office programs; </li><li>  support graphic and text editors; </li><li>  Maintain good quality video conferencing </li><li>  play video and audio files. </li></ul><p>  Of course, this list can be updated, depending on the individual requirements of the user.  Someone cares about the quick work of text editors, someone is going to run image editors.  Correct functionality directly depends on technical characteristics. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Which tablet to choose for work?  There is always a matter of taste.  Someone wants to stand out, so he gets bright gadgets from brands.  Another important "filling" of the device, and the appearance is absolutely unimportant. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it will be necessary to determine at least the screen size.  On the market, most often you can find devices with a screen diagonal from 7 to 10 inches.  For work, of course, it is better to choose a 10-inch device. </p><p>  Firstly, the larger the screen, the more information is placed on it, the easier it is to work with it.  Secondly, often large screens get good resolution, which means that the picture will always be high-quality.  Thirdly, the display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãalso important.  In compact models, it is budgetary, and in more expensive options it has a good viewing angle, contrast and brightness. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  A tablet capable of replacing a laptop must have powerful hardware.  Therefore, when choosing, you will have to deal with the processor and RAM.  It is better to pay attention to 8-core chips, since they can perform more tasks and easily cope with resource-intensive programs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For example, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 has an eight-core Samsung Exynos 5433 inside. This is the company's proprietary processor.  Inside it is integrated graphics accelerator, which is responsible for playing video. </p><p>  A good model for work should have a lot of RAM and internal memory.  RAM needs more than 3 GB.  Now this indicator is optimal for working with documents and programs.  Internal memory can usually be expanded, so 8 GB is enough for the base.  If it is not enough, you can buy a memory card. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.iffelinternational.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The best tablets" class="if uuid-2985799" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985799.jpg"></div><p>  Well, finally, the availability of a capacitive battery is crucial.  The tablet should work for a long time, because it is always at hand.  The time of its activity should play a significant role in the selection.  It is best to choose a tablet with a battery of 5-6 thousand mAh. </p><h2>  Tablet system </h2><p>  You can find a good inexpensive tablet to work among models with Windows, Android and iOS.  The choice here is not easy.  It all depends on what the user is used to.  Someone has been using Apple technology all their lives, so they will feel uncomfortable using another OS. </p><p>  But there are some negative factors in each of these systems.  For example, Android tablets consume more energy.  Many updates cause applications to stop working due to incompatibilities. </p><p>  iOS can also cause discomfort in use if the user has never used Apple devices before.  In addition, such models lack the necessary ports, including USB.  Also, data transfer does not occur through a regular explorer.  To do this, use iTunes. </p><p>  The disadvantages of Windows are that the tablet requires a lot of resources.  Therefore, he needs a powerful hardware. </p><h2>  Tablets for work </h2><p>  Many do not know what to choose for work: laptop or tablet.  The question is rather complicated, since it largely depends on each customer.  But if you decided for yourself that a tablet is still the best option, then you will have to consider several popular models: </p><ul><li>  Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a standalone model. </li><li>  Asus Transformer 3 Pro - a huge amount of RAM. </li><li>  Lenovo THINKPAD X1 Yoga - with a modular design. </li><li>  Apple iPad Pro (2018) - convenient and powerful. </li><li>  Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 - premium design and stylus. </li></ul><p>  This five models deserves attention. </p><h2>  Microsoft Surface Pro 4 </h2><p>  This tablet model looks very expensive.  It costs about 50 thousand rubles.  The kit comes with a device, charging and stylus.  The design of the device is very discreet.  The retractable stand was a great solution. </p><p>  Separately, you can purchase a corporate cover, which not only protects the device, but also is a keyboard.  It does not require separate power and is attached with magnets. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 4" class="if uuid-2985819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985819.jpg"></div><p>  This model is equipped with a screen of 12.3 inches with a resolution of 2736 √ó 1824 pixels.  In this model, an infrared front camera was installed, which helps to scan the face of the owner.  There are several modifications with different "fillings". </p><p>  One of the most popular models was the version with the Intel Core i5-6300U processor.  Frequency 2.4 GHz.  Inside installed 8 GB of RAM.  A tablet works with Intel graphics and 1 GB memory. </p><p>  A feature of this model is the availability of 256 GB SSD.  SSD speeds up the gadget.  Inside installed a battery of 5 thousand mAh.  In general, this is enough for 9 hours.  With active use, the tablet‚Äôs charge is enough for 4-5 hours. </p><h2>  Asus Transformer 3 Pro </h2><p>  Beautiful laconic model.  There is nothing superfluous in it, this is its main advantage.  Built-in stand allows you to conveniently install the model.  Almost all the best tablets for work have a docking station. </p><p>  This tablet is also equipped with an accessory.  The docking station is a protective screen cover, as well as a useful tool for work.  There are several color options, among which you can find yourself the most suitable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techinstyle.asus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Asus Transformer 3 Pro" class="if uuid-2985808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985808.jpg"></div><p>  The tablet is equipped with a 12.6-inch screen with a resolution of 2880 x 1920 pixels.  There are options with different technical parameters.  The most powerful has a Core i7 6600U.  RAM is already 16 GB.  Inside installed 512 GB SSD. </p><p>  A battery with a capacity of 39 Wh is not always enough for long-term operation of the device.  Due to the powerful ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, the tablet requires more energy.  The model costs about 85 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Lenovo THINKPAD X1 Yoga </h2><p>  The device is called a "business laptop."  Some do not even call this model a tablet.  It has a diagonal of 14 inches and a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels.  The appearance of the tablet is discreet.  The case received a classic black color. </p><p>  Inside is an 8th generation Intel Core processor.  They also equipped the model with 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB solid-state drive. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenovo THINKPAD X1 Yoga" class="if uuid-2985810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985810.jpg"></div><p>  A 52 Wh battery lasts for 12 hours.  With active use, time is reduced by 3 times.  Due to the fact that the device has a keyboard and a large screen, it can definitely be attributed to netbooks.  Its negative quality is value.  The buyer will have to pay about 140 thousand rubles.  In fact, for the money you can buy a good full-fledged laptop. </p><h2>  Apple iPad Pro (2018) </h2><p>  One of the latest devices from Apple.  Works with a screen of 12.9 inches and a resolution of 2732 √ó 2048 pixels.  There is also a version with a display of 11 inches and a resolution of 2388 √ó 1668 pixels. </p><p>  The model runs on the A12X Bionic processor, in which a seven-core video accelerator is built-in.  The manufacturer, as always, offers several models with different amounts of memory: from 62 GB to 1 TB. </p><div class="photo" data-original="9to5mac.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple iPad Pro (2018)" class="if uuid-2985813" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985813.jpg"></div><p>  Most of those who work with tablets are avid fans of Apple products.  This is because the quality of the devices is top notch.  Despite the fact that the manufacturer does not disclose the capacity of the tablet, it still promises good autonomy.  There is a novelty from 50 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 </h2><p>  Speaking about working tablets, you can not get past Samsung products.  The manufacturer always adapts to its customers.  He is trying to release devices in every segment.  Therefore, a couple of versions for work are also available. </p><p>  One of the latest was the Samsung Galaxy Tab S4.  The back of the case is made of glass.  Around the perimeter is an aluminum frame.  Such beauty, most likely, will have to be protected with a cover, since the dust collects dust and scratches quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.engadget.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S4" class="if uuid-2985816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/2985816.jpg"></div><p>  The 10.5-inch screen is covered with AMOLED.  This is the main advantage of this model.  The matrix gives a beautiful, bright and contrasting picture.  Resolution 2560 √ó 1600 pixels. </p><p>  You can work with the device using the S Pen.  Unfortunately, the pen does not fit into the case, so you need to buy a case for it or find a specific place so as not to lose.  But the stylus is made in the form of a pen, so it‚Äôs easy to work with it. </p><p>  Inside, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and Adreno 540 work. Installed 4 GB of RAM, as well as 64 GB of internal.  The manufacturer has prepared the owner a lot of useful "chips", so everyone will be satisfied.  The cost of the tablet is 70 thousand rubles. </p>
