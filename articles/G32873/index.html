  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of basketball in the world</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A basketball basketball game was born <span>in the</span> <span>United States of America.</span>  It was invented in 1891 in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, at the training center of the Christian Youth Association.  A young teacher, <span>James Naismith, a</span> native of Canada, came up with a completely new game in order to revitalize gymnastics lessons.  He took two fruit baskets without a bottom and attached them to the railing of the balcony.  It was necessary to throw a soccer ball into the baskets.  Hence this game takes its name: ball - ball, basket - basket. </p><p>  From that moment, the story of the development of basketball began.  A year later, Naismith proposed the rules by which the game of basketball was to take place.  These rules contained 13 points.  However, the very first matches showed that the rules needed to be finalized and changed.  There were many points that prevented the further development of the game.  For example, fans on the balconies could catch a flying ball and tried to throw it into the opponent‚Äôs basket.  Therefore, baskets began to be closed with shields.  And in 1893, a grid appeared, hung on an iron ring.  Nevertheless, the history of the creation of basketball led to the fact that the first official rules were approved in the USA in 1894, and the game itself was so dynamic and interesting that the whole world is playing it now. </p><p>  From the USA, basketball first penetrated into the eastern countries - China, Japan and the Philippines, and after them into South America and Europe.  After 10 years in St. Louis during the Olympic Games, athletes from the United States, with the help of teams from several cities, organized a demonstration tournament.  Subsequently, at the Olympic Games until 1928, basketball was also only indicative.  Then the history of the development of basketball continued with the support of its national federations, which were created in different countries, and especially in the USA.  It is the national federations that begin to organize international tournaments.  Back in 1919, the first international basketball tournament was held between army teams from the USA, France and Italy. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since 1923, the history of the development of basketball among women begins.  This year the first international women's tournament was held, in which teams from the USA, England and Italy participated.  As the game began to gain increasing recognition and popularity in the world, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) was formed in 1932.  Its first structure included only 8 countries - Argentina, Italy, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, Latvia, Czechoslovakia, Romania.  And in 1935, the International Olympic Committee recognized basketball as an <span>Olympic sport,</span> and the next year in Berlin this game was included in the program of the Olympic Games.  The guest of honor of the Olympic basketball tournament was its creator, James Naismith.  Teams from 21 countries took part in this tournament. </p><p>  The matches of the tournament were held in open areas for tennis.  During the Olympics, the first FIBA ‚Äã‚ÄãCongress took place, at which the first international rules of the game were approved.  In the future, the history of the development of basketball again drew attention to the importance of the rules.  Since in the early 50s the game began to lose such an interesting acuteness of the struggle, a number of important changes had to be introduced into the rules to make the game more active. </p><p>  The history of basketball in Russia begins in 1906, when in St. Petersburg gymnasts of the Mayak Sports Society created the first teams to play basketball.  And almost before the revolution of 1917, this game was cultivated only in St. Petersburg.  Basketball was widely developed in Russia only at the beginning of the 1920s, and the first major tournament is considered to be the country's championship held in 1923.  In the same year, the first official rules were approved. </p><p>  Sports experts believe that dynamic, complex and beautiful games will have an undoubted priority in the sports future.  Undoubtedly, basketball also belongs to such games, where the main thing is unpredictability, productivity and entertainment. </p>
