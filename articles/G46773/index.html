  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why the phone does not see the headphones: reasons, solutions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Very often, smartphone users encounter a problem when the phone does not see the headphones, regardless of whether they are wired or not.  Why is this happening?  It is impossible to say unequivocally, since there are various reasons, ranging from a malfunction of the system to a hardware failure.  In this article, we will try to talk about all the most common problems, because of which the headphones are not detected.  In addition, troubleshooting tips will be given, so it will be interesting! </p><h2>  OS crash </h2><p>  The first problem due to which the phone does not see the headphones is a malfunction in the operating system.  No one is safe from this, and failures themselves can occur at an absolutely inopportune moment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="techcrunch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the headphones due to a system failure" class="if uuid-2529779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529779.jpg"></div><p>  This problem is fixed in two ways.  First, it is the simplest - the device needs to be rebooted.  As practice shows, in most cases, a reboot solves the malfunction and the headphones again begin to be detected by the device. </p><p>  The second method of solving the problem is more radical - resetting all phone settings to factory settings.  If the reboot does not help, then resetting to the factory settings should help 100%.  You can perform the procedure through the phone‚Äôs settings in the ‚ÄúBackup and memory‚Äù section. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dust and dirt </h2><p>  The second reason why the phone does not see the headphones is the ingress of dust and dirt into the headset jack.  At first glance, it might seem that the connector cannot clog, but this is not at all.  Dust particles and small particles of dirt are collected in it, which, over time, are compressed and clog some of the contacts.  As a result, the phone cannot detect the headphones. </p><div class="photo" data-original="motorola-enterprise.custhelp.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the headphones due to dirt and dust in the connector" class="if uuid-2529765" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529765.jpg"></div><p>  There are several ways to fix this problem.  The first is to blow out the connector.  You can do this either on your own, or use a can of compressed air. </p><p>  The second option is more effective - use a toothpick with cotton wool or a cotton swab.  Cotton should be dipped in alcohol, but not very much, after which you can proceed to cleaning. </p><h2>  Contact oxidation </h2><p>  Another reason why the phone does not see the headphones is the oxidation of the contacts in the connector.  This problem is also quite common and is not so easy to fix.  The oxidation of the contacts occurs as a result of moisture entering the connector, which is why the phone stops detecting headphones. </p><p>  You can fix the problem in the same way as described above, only this time a cotton swab will need to be dipped in baking soda, not alcohol. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bad connector </h2><div class="photo" data-original="smartphonefixcenter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the headphones due to a faulty jack" class="if uuid-2529767" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529767.jpg"></div><p>  The next reason why the phone does not see the headphones is a broken connector.  If the headphones are absolutely working and working on a computer or other device, and rebooting, resetting the settings and cleaning the connector from dust and oxidation do not help, then the input for connection is faulty. </p><p>  In this case, the device repair will help to solve the problem. </p><h2>  Headphone breakdown </h2><div class="photo" data-original="forum.xda-developers.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see the headphones due to a broken headphone" class="if uuid-2529766" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529766.jpg"></div><p>  Another rather popular problem, why the phone does not see the headphones, is a malfunction of the ‚Äúears‚Äù themselves.  Making sure the headset is working or not is easy enough.  To do this, you need to connect the headphones to another smartphone, tablet, laptop or computer.  If they do not work, then the diagnosis is obvious - under the replacement. </p><h2>  Bluetooth headphone issues </h2><p>  The last item will touch the wireless <span>headset: why the phone does not see the bluetooth headphones?</span>  There are several reasons for this, fortunately, they are all simple: </p><ol><li>  First of all, you need to make sure that both devices have Bluetooth turned on. </li><li>  If the wireless connection is active, then the next step is to make sure that the synchronization function with the phone works.  To do this, press the appropriate button on the headphones. </li><li>  If the headset does not show any signs of "life", then with a probability of 99%, the battery has run out and needs to be charged. </li><li>  Bluetooth headphones may not be detected due to the banal lack of phone support for the A2DP function, which is necessary for working with wireless headsets. </li><li>  Well and the last - earphones can appear malfunctioning or just break. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="dgit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the phone does not see bluetooth headphones" class="if uuid-2529768" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/60598/2529768.jpg"></div><p>  That's all, actually! </p>
