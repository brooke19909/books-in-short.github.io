    <h2>  Who did Ulyanov-Lenin feel? </h2><p>  Considering this issue, you can look at his profiles, which he filled out at all kinds of official events.  Everywhere it says: Great Russian or Russian, as they began to call nationality under Soviet rule.  Other Bolsheviks also indicated true nationalities, for example, Trotsky noted that he was a Jew. </p><p>  Lenin's nationality did not bother him at all; he treated her as a given, as an inborn eye color.  He considered himself Russian, like Pushkin and Vladimir Dal, who was the son of a Danish and French woman.  The creator of the Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language argued that the one who lives, speaks and thinks like Russian is considered to be a Russian person.  That was Lenin.  His parents simply perceived his nationality, because everyone spoke and thought in Russian. </p><h2>  Order of the Central Committee </h2><p>  After the departure of Vladimir Ilyich (Ulyanov-Lenin), his nationality became interesting to the ruling circles, so the Central Committee gave the task to Anna Ilyinichna - his elder sister - to carefully study materials relating to the family tree.  Having received the data, she finds among the ancestors of the Jew.  Judging by her reaction, this fact struck her very much, which means that the whole family, when Lenin was still living, did not know about the presence of Jewish blood in the genes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nationality of Lenin" class="if" height="377" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/850904.jpg" width="600"></div>

The answer to the first question is clear: the leader of the world proletariat sincerely believed that he was Russian.  Did he have a right to this? </p><h2>  Father line </h2><p>  Consider the father line.  To whom did Lenin belong to her?  Nationality in the Russian Empire was not indicated in passports, but religion was introduced.  In the police cases that were brought against the defendant Ulyanov, the nationality was featured as follows: Great Russian.  This state of affairs was determined by the fact that in the official documents of the Republic of Ingushetia the nationality of the citizen was determined by the nationality of his father.  Trace the line of the mother. </p><h2>  Mother line </h2><p>  Who was Lenin by mother?  The nationality of her family has been well researched by scientists, her line can be traced far.  The ethnic composition of the ancestors on the female line is mottled and represents a Russified mixture of Europeans, for example, there are Germans and Swedes in the family.  It dispensed with Russians and Jews, this world with its customs and traditions was closed to strangers.  We will not linger here, but move on.  So, whose features does Lenin take?  Nationality from my mother‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs side can be defined as follows: European. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ulyanov Lenin nationality" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/850907.jpg" width="600"></div>

Before baptism, his name was sonorous - Israel Moishevich Blank.  According to the latest scientific research, it is known that several Alexandrov Blanks appear in the archival documents of the Russian Empire.  Among them were Germans and Jews, suitable by age and <span>profession (doctors)</span> .  The information about them is very confusing, and it is very difficult for modern scientists to separate them from each other. </p><p>  Suppose that the grandfather of Ulyanov-Lenin was a German.  At that time, this situation is quite typical.  Since many Europeans came to RI to make a career and achieve wealth and honors.  Not without reason, when Emperor <span>Alexander 1</span> asked General Yermolov how he could reward him for his services, he replied that he would make him a German.  Therefore, we won‚Äôt get anything interesting in this situation. </p><h2>  Jewish version </h2><p>  If we accept this version, then such a pedigree is full of extraordinary facts.  Consider the <span>life path of</span> grandfather Ulyanov-Lenin as a whole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lenin who by nationality" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30746/850905.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  The elder brother Dmitry (Abel) and Alexander (then Israel) were born into the family of a Jew who lived in the outback.  He was not poor, but he did not disdain neighbors to steal hay.  Relations between the brothers and his father did not work out, and they came to the conclusion that it would be better to adopt Orthodoxy.  And so it began!  They became godfathers: senator, state adviser D.O.  Baranov and State Councilor, Count A.I.  Apraxin.  Where did they get such influential patrons from?  This question remains a mystery. </p><p>  The brothers who arrived from the hinterland do not stop there.  Both graduate and begin to build a career and start families.  The elder brother subsequently dies from the outbreak of the cholera epidemic, and Alexander marries for love.  His wife belonged to a noble, well-to-do, cultured family, the family tree of the groom was assigned important importance.  But still, the Jewish Romeo was not rejected, moreover, after the death of the spouse, a second sister from the same family was given for him.  Career is also developing successfully: he became a state adviser, a hereditary nobleman, the owner of the estate with serfs. </p><p>  The Jewish version is similar to an adventurous novel and much more interesting, so it will be very unfortunate if it is finally expelled.  Lenin‚Äôs niece, the daughter of his brother Dmitry, categorically denied this option of origin, her family believed that Alexander Dmitrievich was from a merchant Orthodox family. </p>
