    <p>  It is often integrated into a common security system, and it interacts with video surveillance or burglar alarms.  Also, an advanced ACS carries a system for recording working hours.  This allows you to control the time of arrival of workers and their departure.  What can not but increase discipline in the enterprise. </p><h2>  Key elements of an access control system </h2><p>  There are a great many manufacturers of ACS equipment.  However, its main elements are unchanged: a control controller, an identifier reader, and personal identifiers themselves, a locking device and a matching device. </p><h2>  Personal identifier (card, various tokens, key rings) </h2>

Each such card contains a unique code that is retrieved by contact with a reader.  Then the personal code is analyzed by the ACS controller.  And if it meets the admission criteria, an automatic signal arrives at the blocking device, the door opens, the barrier rises, the turnstile unlocks.  The communication protocols for the personal identifier and reader may vary, and the design organization should take this into account.  In Russia, the Mifare, Em-marine protocols are widely used.

They are not connected to a computer, and control is carried out using master cards or jumpers on the controller itself.  At large and medium-sized guarded facilities, this type of access control system is rarely used.  The exception is control over remote rooms, or as a backup system.  An autonomous access control system is installed on the central doors and / or on the emergency exits. </p><p>  When implementing such a system, doors with a throughput of about a thousand people are equipped with a <span>combination lock</span> or reader, maybe a turnstile or a barrier.  In a modest office with a single door, everything can be limited to an autonomous controller connected to an electromechanical (electromagnetic) lock and combined with a reader </p><p>  Network Access Control Systems <strong> </strong>  ACSs incorporate one or several computers as control elements.  It is the PC that monitors what is happening at the facility and controls their parameters.  Such a construction is much more flexible and functional.  It is network ACSs that are especially popular at facilities of any complexity.  And integration with security and video systems allows comprehensive protection at no additional cost. </p><p>  The connection of several computers at large facilities is due to the fact that one of them may fail.

    <p>  The security officer, thanks to access control systems, can, without leaving the workplace, manage turnstiles and doors, give alarms.  It is enough to place floor plans of the building and the layout of control points in his computer. </p><h2>  Management via the Internet or from a mobile phone </h2><p>  When connecting the ACS to the worldwide network, the administration can remotely control the system and monitor its operation. </p><h2>  Integration with other systems </h2><p>  Fire, burglar alarms, video surveillance perfectly integrate with ACS.  Integration with video surveillance provides visual control over the protected area.  And it allows as soon as possible to identify, if possible, identify and block the offender. </p><p>  Combination with a burglar alarm allows you to configure a joint response to unauthorized entry.  So you can make the siren work in the security room in the office, light an alarm lamp or simply lock the doors in the right part of the enterprise. </p><p>  Integration with fire alarms is vital.  This will automatically unlock all control points in case of fire.  That will greatly simplify the evacuation of workers in a critical period. </p><h2>  A few words about design </h2><p>  When developing an ACS project, first of all, one should take into account the imposed restrictions on the number of card passes.  The number of the latter must be calculated taking into account the growth of the company, otherwise you may find yourself in a situation where the number of employees reaches the maximum value for the system and you have to change it to a more capacious one.  The best design solution is to install a modular system that can be upgraded or expanded.  With a limited budget, it will be useful to take into account the possibility of integrating ACS with other systems responsible for security.  The advantages of such a combination were described above.  Clear tech.  the task will help designers to create exactly the system that the customer needs.  A clearly drafted project, in turn, will greatly facilitate the work of the installation organization.  And it is better when one company is engaged in design and installation.  She can also take service in the future. </p>
