If it is tough, scum will appear.  Such water has a bad effect on the state of the heating element.  If urgent measures are not taken, then it will break down quickly enough.  In order to get rid of hard water, you need to use some means. </p><p>  Popular remedies are various manufacturing additives.  However, some of them are not cheap.  If you consider that you need to use them constantly, then it is better to use simpler methods.  One such remedy is citric acid.  She can clean not only the drum, but also to descale.  Pour it into the dispenser and start washing at maximum temperature. </p><p>  There are also additional softeners.  These filters can be bought at specialized stores.  They are expensive, but they purify the water not only for the washing machine, but also for the entire apartment. </p><h2>  Additional tips </h2><p>  So that there is no unpleasant odor from the machine, you should put dirty laundry in it only immediately before washing.  Putting it there on an ongoing basis is not recommended.  To maximize the quality of washing, you need to separate colored items from white.  Wash them separately separately.  Use only special powders.  There are many of these in stores.  If the owner leaves for a long time, then the washing machine must be de-energized and shut off the water.  So you can avoid unpleasant situations until a person is at home. </p>
