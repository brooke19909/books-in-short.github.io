How to choose a suitable model, connect it, and also make the correct settings?  Answers to these questions, as well as many other useful information about these devices can be found in the article that is brought to your attention. </p><h2>  Features of the new format </h2><p>  Digital television, which Russia plans to fully switch to by the end of the current year, 2019, is broadcast on decimeter waves.  So, in order to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù channels in this format, no other antenna will be needed if the house has one that is designed to receive broadcasts at these frequencies. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.search.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="TV antenna" class="if uuid-3157940" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3157940.jpg"></div><p>  If you do not have such a device, then you should purchase it, since a digital set-top box to a TV, even the best one, is not able to receive a TV signal without connecting to an antenna, which means it can also show broadcasts.  Some tuner models come with an antenna of the same manufacturer. </p><p>  This indoor television wave receiver usually works great when combined with the receiver that comes with it.  For people who are faced with such a technique for the first time, it is necessary to clarify that the tuner, receiver, receiver, digital set-top box for TV, as well as some other names are used to refer to the same device.  The format in which broadcasting is conducted in Russia is called Dvb t2.  That it should be indicated in the instructions for the purchased device.  Otherwise, the prefix may be unsuitable in order to provide viewing of channels broadcasting on the territory of the Russian Federation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Why else do you need a receiver? </h2><p>  Many models of digital set-top boxes for TVs have an extensive set of functions that can brighten up their user's leisure time, as well as greatly facilitate their life.  What else can these small, but very useful devices? </p><p>  Digital set-top boxes for the TV of most famous models are able to perform the function of a player.  They can play both audio and video files.  If you are a music lover and the quality of the music played is of great importance to you, you must carefully study the instructions before buying a receiver in order to find out the list of formats that the device can read.  For example, tracks in the Wav format will not cut the ear due to the strong compression of the compositions.  But do not forget that the main function of such devices is to ensure a stable, uninterrupted display of television programs.  Therefore, the quality of this task should be paid attention first of all. </p><h2>  Record </h2><p>  In addition to the usual viewing, many samples of this technique have the function "Time Shift".  This means that now the viewer has the opportunity to unexpectedly make a phone call or any other circumstance to boldly break away from the ‚Äúblue screen‚Äù in order to watch his favorite show after.  How it works?  During a pause, the device starts recording air.  The viewer who returns to the TV continues to watch the broadcast saved as a video file on an external storage device.  It should be remembered that the flash card used for this purpose should be quite roomy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Flash card" class="if uuid-3157943" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3157943.jpg"></div><p>  A medium-length telecast recorded in high resolution takes about one and a half gigabytes of memory. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  For those who plan to often use the described function, it may be useful to use the set-top box for the TV when recording digital television independently of the TV.  This is necessary when the desired gear goes late at night.  Viewers recording the program during their absence from the screen can also not turn on the TV and thereby save energy. </p><h2>  Model selection </h2><p>  Reviews of digital set-top boxes for the TV, left on various sites devoted to the choice of technology, as well as in online stores, allow you to identify the most popular models of tuners. </p><p>  Lumax products are in great demand.  All models of receivers of this manufacturer provide high-quality television signal, and are also equipped with such important functions as time shift and recording.  Tuners produced under the brand name "Remo" have also received many positive reviews.  Digital set-top boxes for some models manufactured by this manufacturer are sold with the antenna. </p><h2>  Connection </h2><p>  <span>How to connect the tuner to the TV</span> is one of the most important issues related to this topic. </p><p>  Connecting a digital set-top box to the TV is as follows. </p><ol><li>  Insert the batteries into the remote control. </li><li>  Connect the antenna to the console. </li><li>  Connect the receiver to the TV using a cable with HDMI, RCA or other plugs. <div class="photo" data-original="www.monoprice.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="HDMI plug" class="if uuid-3157946" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3157946.jpg"></div></li><li>  If necessary, connect a stereo system to the set-top box through a two-component RCA connector (other options are possible). <div class="photo" data-original="www.zoobashop.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tuner rear panel" class="if uuid-3157938" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58679/3157938.jpg"></div></li><li>  Configure the reception of channels in automatic mode or by prescribing the frequencies at which the broadcast is being conducted. </li></ol><p>  After completing the above items, you can nicely settle in front of the screen and start browsing. </p>
