It is necessary to approach her choice consciously, because the matter is not only in the capacity of the drum, but also in quality.  Most domestic buyers trust the German manufacturer.  Their products are, of course, not cheap.  But keep in mind that for a long time it works without breakdowns, it justifies the declared price.  For example, for about 45 thousand rubles, you can buy a washing machine AEG L 56126 TL, reviews about this model will be considered in the article.  It is a freestanding device.  Loading is carried out through a hatch located vertically, so that it can be installed even in the corner of a small bathroom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="freenode.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews on the washing machine AEG L 56126 TL" class="if uuid-2232735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2232735.jpg"></div><p>  The equipment of this manufacturer belongs to the premium class, therefore it is not available to every domestic buyer.  But those who still purchased the AEG L 56126 TL model did not regret their choice.  Of course, as in other washing machines, this appliance has advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore, let's understand together whether the price tag of 45 thousand rubles is justified. </p><h2>  Appearance Features </h2><p>  You need to start the <span>review of the AEG</span> L 56126 TL <span>washing machine</span> with the presentation of its appearance.  The case of the device has a standard shape, as for a device with a vertical type of loading.  On the front side there is a handle that is used to lift the lid.  She is fit.  In order to gain access to the drum, efforts are not necessary.  The control panel is in the usual place.  It is equipped with a digital display.  The rotary lever for selecting programs is on the left side.  Buttons that are used to activate additional options are also displayed here.  The panel is informative.  All elements are marked, so dealing with controls will be easy enough. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, one of the significant advantages, according to users, are compact dimensions.  The height of the device is 89 cm. Cars vertically type differ from the frontal depth.  In recent manufacturers try to minimize this parameter.  But in verticals the opposite is true - compactness is achieved due to the width (in AEG L 56126 TL - 40 cm), while the depth remains standard - 60 cm. With these <span>dimensions, the washing machine</span> weighs about 65 kg. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.electroluxhome.se" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Review of the washing machine AEG L 56126 TL" class="if uuid-2232736" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2232736.jpg"></div><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  Now let's look at the characteristics of the AEG L 56126 TL washing machine: </p><ul><li>  The country of origin is Germany, assembly is carried out in France. </li><li>  Management is intellectual. </li><li>  Case color - white. </li><li>  Washing Effectiveness - Class A. </li><li>  The number of rotations of the drum per minute is 1200. </li><li>  The level of protection against leaks is the housing. </li><li>  Energy Efficiency - Class A ++. </li><li>  6 kg washing machine drum. </li><li>  Sensors of control - imbalance and foam. </li><li>  Protection against disabled people and children. </li><li>  There is a special compartment for liquid detergent. </li><li>  Additional loading of linen without resetting the operating parameters. </li></ul><h2>  Talk about the possibilities </h2><p>  The reviews of the AEG L 56126 TL washing machine pay a lot of attention to programs.
