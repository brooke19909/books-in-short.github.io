Here you can relax quietly and enjoy the beautiful scenery.  The recreation center "South Coast" (Shelomentsevo) offers its services so that guests can comfortably stay and fully plunge into the long-awaited summer vacation. </p><h2>  Description of the lake </h2><p>  The reservoir is located in the Etkul region.  The village of Shelomentsevo is located on the eastern shore, it was in honor of him that Peschanoe was given the second name.  The lake has an almost regular, rounded shape.  It is small in size, only one and a half kilometers in diameter.  The maximum depth can reach five meters, but mostly offshore it is shallow.  The bottom is mostly sandy, but silted in some places.  About half of the coast is overgrown with reeds, which is very popular with fishermen.  On the west and south coast you can see a beautiful forest. </p><p>  The lake itself is surrounded by wild beaches, there is also not one recreation center here.  Shelomentsevo sheltered swans, ducks and cranes in their waters and this makes him even more attractive.  But many visitors to these shores are interested in the South Coast camp site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="recreation center shelomentsevo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1238482.jpg" width="600"></div>

The forest is divided into two parts by the road.  On the one hand there is a place for tourists with tents, in the other part there are cozy, new houses for a more comfortable stay.  But no matter in which part the guests stay, everyone likes this recreation center.  Shelomintsevo lake also pleases with its cleanliness, since both the reservoir and the territory are regularly cleared. </p><h2>  Accommodation at the base </h2><p>  On the territory, two-story houses for several guests and one-story houses were built, in which two adults with a child (up to adolescence) can live.  There are also clamshells.  Vacationers can use refrigerators.  Many people like to relax on the veranda, where there are chairs and a table. </p><p>  If guests arrive by car, they are allowed to park at their houses. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the recreation center (Shelomentsevo) does not allow pets to be brought into the territory. </p><p>  You can also stay in a tent camp and enjoy the benefits of civilization, which offers a camp site. </p><h2>  Entertainment and service </h2>
