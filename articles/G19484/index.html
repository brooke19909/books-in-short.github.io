Step-by-step instruction for weaving an elastic bracelet</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Stylish multi-colored rubber bands "Fanny Lum" (Funny Loom) have gained popularity around the globe.  It would seem that what can be done from an elastic band so that it would not be embarrassing to wear in a company and show off to friends?  Meanwhile, they create real works of art - fashionable rings, amazing bracelets, original figures and even functional, practical accessories. </p><h2>  The easiest bracelet </h2><p>  If you just picked up a set for weaving today and have a poor idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat can be made of small rubber bands, try first to create an unusual, but very simple bracelet yourself.  It is called "Rings." </p>

    <p>  For weaving you will need black and colored ‚ÄúFanny Lum‚Äù, a hook, a clip and, of course, a slingshot machine.  If you have collected everything you need, you can go directly to the action. </p><h2>  How to weave "Rings" </h2><ul><li>  Throw a black rubber band on both columns of the slingshot machine and use the hook to twist it in the middle with an eight. </li><li>  Throw three ‚ÄúFanny Lum‚Äù of any other contrasting color (for example, yellow) on the left column of the slingshot. </li><li>  On top of the yellow rubber bands, scribble the black, but do not twist it. </li><li>  Now you need to carefully throw the bottom black loop into the center of the machine alternately from both columns.  Get the first fragment of the bracelet. </li><li>  For further weaving, repeat the steps, starting with throwing new rubber bands of different colors and ending with the formation of a black loop.  Each time, drop the colored loops in the center so that they do not remain on the slingshot (they still do not have enough space) and do not interfere with the creative process. </li><li>  Bracelet "Rings" is a good demonstration of what can be made from elastic bands.  When you reach the desired length, finish the chain by moving the last three contrasting loops to the center, and then the black loop from the left slingshot column.  Now, to finish the work, it remains only to fix the new decoration with a clip. </li></ul><h2>  Stylish and unusual bracelet </h2><p>  Variations of the so-called "baubles" from the multi-colored "Fanny Lum" there are a great many.  In the likeness of many bracelets, you can weave necklaces or rings, braids for chargers or sports skipping ropes.  An interesting example of what can be made of rubber bands is a bracelet called "Scales".  It is completely unlike ordinary jewelry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  To create a unique decoration you will need red, black, white and green Fanny Lum, a convenient hook, a clip and a small Finger Lum machine. </p><h2>  How to weave "Scale" </h2><p>  This bracelet is already unusual in that it needs auxiliary red rubber bands to create it.  At the end of weaving, they will need to be cut and removed.  Although a lot of things can be made from gum without special damage to the material, here you will have to sacrifice silicone rings for the beauty of the future creation. </p><h2>  First stage </h2><ul><li>  Weaving begins with the use of auxiliary red eyelets.  Throw them in pairs on the adjacent columns of the square machine, twisting each eight. </li><li>  Then, throw one black rubber band at once on all the posts and discard the auxiliary loops in the center. </li><li>  On top of all four columns of the ‚ÄúFinger Luma‚Äù, scribble alternately white and green gum. </li><li>  Drop the lowest black loop in the center. </li><li>  Continue to weave, scattering one elastic band and alternating the main colors of the ‚Äúscales‚Äù: black, white, green, black again.  Each time, lower the lower eyelet with the hook into the center. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be made of small gum" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32697/1229110.jpg" width="490"></div></h2><h2>  Second phase </h2><ul><li>  It is incredible, but already at the beginning of weaving this bracelet, you will find that a lot of things can be made from elastic, without any practical experience in this type of needlework.  As soon as you throw a few rows of contrasting rubber bands, pull the product up, hooking it onto the auxiliary loops.  They, by the way, can be conveniently thrown from below by the ‚ÄúFinger Lum‚Äù and gradually moved upward so that they are above the others already thrown over. </li><li>  When you see for yourself that a lot of things can be made from elastic, and you want to finish the bracelet, remove the black loops from each column of the machine to the clip. </li><li>  At the other end of the bracelet, gently hook the red auxiliary loops and pull them up. </li><li>  Cut the red Fanny Lum with sharp scissors and remove them from the product.  Now you can fix the decoration with a clip. </li></ul><h2>  Case for phone </h2><p>  What can be done with <span>hair bands</span> similar to Fanny Lum?  You can try to copy models designed for weaving from real rubber bands for children and youth creativity.  But it‚Äôs better to take into account the shortcomings of hair accessories (they are usually thinner and more fragile than Fanny Lum).  You can create from them not jewelry, but practical things based on a solid canvas.  For example, a convenient case for a modern phone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  To weave a cover you will need plain rubber bands (for example, pink), a hook, a large machine called the Rainbow Lum and any decorative elements to your taste: roses from satin braid, flowers from Fanny Lum or simply beautiful large beads. </p><p>  Of course, the case is included in the list of what can be made from rubber bands for bracelets.  And it‚Äôs not at all necessary to use fragile Chinese copies of Fanny Lum intended not for needlework, but for children's hairstyles. </p><h2>  How to weave a fashion accessory </h2><ul><li>  Remove the middle row of posts from the machine.  Turn the extreme rows of columns with open fragments in opposite directions.  Throw eight erasers from the second column of the left row to the first - right.  Continue to loop the same way until the end of the machine. </li><li>  Sketch two loops, twisted eight, from the first column of the left row to the second - right.  Continue to the end of the machine. </li><li>  Then sketch double stitches around the perimeter in the usual way. </li><li>  Using a hook, hook the four bottom loops and discard them in the center from each column. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what can be made from rubber bands for hair" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32697/1229113.jpg" width="600"></div></li><li>  Spread double rubber bands around the perimeter in the usual way and drop them in the center in pairs, until the cover is the right length. </li><li>  To complete the product, throw on the first column of the left row rubber band in three turns.  Insert a hook under it, pick up the two lower loops and sketch on the next column.  So you need to weave all the loops on the machine.  Then insert the hook inside the rubber bands on the last column, pick up the latest one and pull it through all the loops.  The cover is ready.  You can decorate it to your taste. </li></ul><p>  Of course, a phone case is not the only thing that can be made from rubber bands for bracelets.  Try to invent and implement your own accessories.  With a bit of patience and interest, you will surely succeed. </p>
