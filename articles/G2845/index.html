    <h2>  Are there clear boundaries for age groups? </h2><p>  Periodization of different age groups is not uniquely defined in psychological science.  But even if it existed, one can never say how environmental factors will affect a person.  For example, <span>adolescence,</span> according to some scientists, ends at 18-20 years.  However, in countries that are in difficult economic or social conditions, it can last a maximum of three to four years from its inception.  After that, almost the child will be forced to enter adulthood. </p><p>  This may also be the case with the late adulthood.  It is traditionally believed that this stage occurs no earlier than 60-65 years.  However, if a person is forced to perform hard physical work for a long time, undernourish or undergo other unfavorable factors, it is quite possible that he will reach the age of late adulthood at 45 years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Childhood period </h2><p>  Early age is a time of rapid development of speech function.  It occurs in parallel with cognitive and social development.  Physical capabilities are also increasing.  A chubby two-year-old child by the age of six turns into a slender little man who has coordination and dexterity.  The following age groups of children are distinguished: infancy (up to a year), early childhood (1-3 years), childhood (up to seven years), younger schoolchildren (up to 10 years). </p><p>  Early age is a time of development of intelligence.  Up to five years of age, children's thinking is characterized by the qualities of animism (endowing objects with the properties of living creatures), materialization (they consider their fantasy objects real), self-centeredness (they understand the world only from their point of view). </p>

    <h2>  Teenage years </h2><p>  Many scientists classified it as a period of dependence on parents, which lies between childhood and adulthood.  <span>The interests of adolescents</span> relate to the planning of their professional life, the sphere of love and friendship, social interaction.  For them, economic and political issues become important.  As indicated, prolonged prolongation of adolescence is more common in industrialized countries.  In the 18-19 centuries, as well as in the 20th century, as a result of adverse economic conditions or wars, adolescents, becoming a labor force, quickly turned into adults. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Old age - late adulthood </h2><p>  A distinctive feature (the so-called neoplasm of the psyche) of this age is such a quality as wisdom.  This is personal experience, a person has gained practical knowledge for a long time, the information that has been acquired by him throughout his life. </p><p>  But, despite the presence of wisdom, the brain of many <span>older people</span> is prone to cognitive impairment.  The decline of cognitive activity can occur for various reasons: Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, lack of cerebral blood supply.  However, it must be understood that aging of the body is a process that begins long before old age.  For example, a woman after 30 may already notice age signs: small wrinkles, decreased vitality, graying of hair. </p><p>  In old age, significant changes occur both at the physiological level and in the social life of the individual.  First of all, retirement has a big impact.  This is a change in status, and changes in the routine.  Through work, a person’s time is always structured.  A pensioner often feels as if he is “offside”. </p>

    <h2>  Erickson classification: early childhood </h2><p>  The famous psychologist E. Erickson identified the following age groups and their corresponding developmental stages.  The first stage is infancy.  At this time, the main issue that is being decided by a small person relates to trust or distrust of the outside world.  The baby determines for himself whether the world is a safe place, or whether it is still a threat.  The result of successfully passing this stage is a high level of vitality, joy. </p><p>  The second stage covers the age of one to three years.  At this time, the child gains more and more independence.  Children under 3 years old increasingly feel their independence, as they learn to walk.  At the same time, it appears necessary for them to maintain basic trust.  The main role in this is played by the parents.  With their requirements, they, on the one hand, help to do this.  When destructive impulses overcome the child, parental restrictions take effect.  On the other hand, he has a feeling of shame.  Indeed, even if judgmental adults do not watch him, he perfectly feels at what moment he is doing wrong.  The surrounding world, as it were, begins to observe it from within. </p><p>  At the stage from 4 to 6 years, the child must choose between two alternatives - initiative and guilt.  He develops imagination, he actively invents games for himself, speech becomes more and more rich. </p>

    <h2>  Erickson school and adolescence </h2><p>  From 6 to 11 years old, the child should have a sense of competence.  If this does not happen, then this feeling is replaced by inferiority.  Such a process is connected with the fact that during this period of time the child masters cultural values.  Children are increasingly beginning to identify with adults who represent a particular profession. </p><p>  The stage from 11 to 20 years, according to Erickson, is the main one for the successful development of personality.  At this stage, a child or teenager collects maximum information about himself.  He looks at himself as a student, friend, child of his parents, athlete and so on.  If this stage is successful, in the future a person has a stable life position, the ability to cope with difficulties is formed. </p><h2>  Erickson Adult </h2><p>  From 21 to 25 years old young people begin to solve more and more adult tasks.  They marry, plan the birth of a child, and make important choices. </p><p>  The listed age groups relate to those segments of the life path on which personality development takes place.  Next comes the longest stage, lasting, according to Erickson, from 25 to 60 years.  At this time, the main problem of man is stagnation of life, the impossibility of development in everyday life.  But if he still succeeds, then he receives a high reward - a persistent sense of self-identity. </p><p>  At this age, there are changes that are associated with self-determination, and with personal life.  In men and women, this stage has a <span>midlife crisis.</span>  A woman after 30 reaches the peak of her sexuality. </p><p>  Age from 60 years largely depends on how previous years were lived.  Old age will be peaceful, if in his life a person has achieved the desired, lived it with dignity.  Otherwise, he will be overcome by torment. </p>
