It often happens that, having tried to make several crosses on the canvas, you cannot deny yourself the pleasure to continue embroidering. </p><h2>  What is embroidery for? </h2><p>  Embroidery itself is of great therapeutic value.  She calms, arranges the running of restless thoughts, masterly helps to move away from the hustle and bustle.  Sewing cute and vibrant stories can train your eyesight.  It is only necessary that the lighting still be very good.  Multi-colored juicy threads, a kreinik and other interesting and bright elements that are used in this type of needlework, act on the embroiderer, (or embroiderer), as they became popular today - antistress coloring pages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Gzhel dishes" class="if uuid-2312877" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2312877.jpg"></div><h2>  Who likes to embroider? </h2><p>  Mostly women and girls like to embroider.  But a decent percentage of the male population has already appeared in cross-stitch.  It is noticed: men are able to embroider much more accurately and faster than some women.  And if the female half of embroiderers do not hesitate to admit that they possess such a delicate and painstaking art, then men, for the most part, are silent about such a hobby. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Embroidery can decorate many things.  And today we will consider kitchen embroidery. </p><h2>  Where to begin? </h2><p>  Cross stitch patterns for the kitchen are easy to find in stores with a handmade bias.  And if you have never previously touched a canvas and a special needle for embroidery, then it is better to start with the smallest scheme.  Look for yourself a printed canvas that depicts a kitchen motif.  Usually, a memo is attached to such a canvas, and it will tell you which thread to buy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tattinginaustralia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Embroidery kitchen" class="if uuid-2312903" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2312903.jpg"></div><p>  When that small design is ready for you and it becomes clear that you love and know how to embroider, then it's time to go to the embroidery department of the needlework store again and buy this time a cross-stitch pattern for the kitchen is more complicated, and possibly more. </p><h2>  What subjects are suitable for applied embroidery in the kitchen? </h2><p>  Embroidery in the kitchen is used in the form of: potholders, coasters for glasses, for heating pads on a kettle, for decorating a kitchen apron and towels, and much more for what, it all depends on the embroiderer's imagination.  Someone sews textile bags and decorates them with hand-embroidered plots, someone reaches the heights of excellence and is able to embroider drawings of amazing beauty and accuracy directly on kitchen tablecloths and curtains.  And all sorts of napkins for the kitchen, probably, were not embroidered only by very lazy embroiderers.  By the way, small plots, or rather cross stitch patterns for the kitchen, can be downloaded free of charge on the Internet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To decorate a kitchen with embroidery, plots with the image: dishes, vegetables and fruits, kitchen utensils are most often taken. </p><p>  Want to embroider a cute napkin for a breadbox?  Look for openwork patterns and cross stitch patterns for the kitchen.  Such ornaments are not difficult to complete for a novice embroiderer.  Just remember, please, about the amount of work - do not download huge schemes, it is very likely that from a long ‚Äúpicking‚Äù with a needle you simply get tired and abandon the whole process. </p><p>  If you have decorative pillows in the kitchen, then you can also embroider something very beautiful on them.  By the way, floral ornaments are also appropriate in the kitchen design. </p><p>  Over time, when you get involved in cross-stitching well (most likely, it will), buy yourself a kit with a cross-stitch pattern of a still life for the kitchen.  Still lifes are also very popular in the design of the kitchen and not only.  Still lifes will be very appropriate in any other room in your home. </p><p>  After you embroider a real, full-fledged picture with a cross, please do not push your work into the far corner of the cabinet so that it does not disappear without a trace.  Make your picture in a baguette workshop, do not spare some amount of your finances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mykitchenzone.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Towel embroidery" class="if uuid-2312885" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/75534/2312885.jpg"></div><p>  Decent design will add charm to your kitchen still life. </p><p>  Now any patterns, including cross-stitch patterns for the kitchen, can be bought in a ready-made kit, along with the right colors and the required number of threads.  Such sets also include ready-made canvas, and even a needle! </p><p>  Want something out of the ordinary?  Then look for the masters involved in the development of schemes, and buy from them a design scheme.  By the way, some designers began to send their schemes along with the materials selected for them. </p>
