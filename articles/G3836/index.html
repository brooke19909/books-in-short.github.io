  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lime water in a medicine cabinet, cosmetology and cooking</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A solution of calcium oxide hydrate is simply lime water, the formula of which is Ca (OH), obtained by adding lime to the water.  But to get a solution that is transparent as a tear without taste and smell, it will not be enough just to throw slaked or <span>quicklime</span> into a jar of water <span>.</span>  In addition to the danger of such an experiment in a simple kitchen (after all, adding this substance to the water entails an exothermic reaction), you will end up with a turbid toxic liquid.  It is better to buy a solution in a pharmacy.  More precisely, to order, because it is prepared specially, due to the short shelf life.  But it will take several days to prepare this liquid - it is repeatedly sedimented and filtered. </p><p>  Lime water, due to its alkaline reaction, is widely used in medicine.  Where it is necessary to neutralize the effect of acid - with increased acidity of the stomach, in the treatment of the bladder - it is indispensable.  It is added to milk if the baby has diarrhea, slowly healing wounds are washed with it, abscesses, acne, some <span>types of lichen,</span> fungi and eczema are treated with it.  In the form of baths, this fluid is used to treat hemorrhoids, in the form of enemas - for ulcerative colitis, with a catheter is administered to irrigate the bladder.  Inside, the solution is prescribed for pregnant women, since it has a beneficial effect on the formation of the skeleton of the fetus. </p><p>  If desired, a solution of lime of a weak consistency can be prepared at home.  Take 20 eggs, gently wash them with laundry soap, cook hard boiled.  Drain the eggs in a separate container.  Use the eggs themselves for food, and the shell for the preparation of the desired liquid.  First, if possible, remove the inner film.  Then crush the shell in a mortar, put it in a 3-liter jar.  Boil water from beneath the eggs, fill the shell with boiling water, tightly close the capron lid, let it brew for a day.  Such a solution can be washed with youthful acne, and with high acidity, food is prepared on it. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Lime water is most widely used in cosmetology, especially when caring for the delicate skin of infants and problematic youthful skin.  If you can’t afford the Liniment cosmetic cosmetic milk, we’ll try to cook it yourself.  The name of the drug itself - Liniment Oleocalcaire - indicates that it contains vegetable oil (oleo) and lime (-kalkar).  So, we just need two ingredients: lime water (you can buy it at the pharmacy or cook it yourself) and olive oil (preferably of the highest quality, first extraction).  It is necessary to take equal parts of water and oil, mix, close the container and shake thoroughly until a homogeneous mass of a yellowish tint is obtained. </p><p>  In combination with oil, lime water is used not only to eliminate acne, but also as <span>massage oil,</span> in the treatment of eczema, as a makeup remover.  Applied on a cotton pad, it can serve as an excellent means for caring for the skin of the baby, it perfectly treats diaper rash and redness.  Store the product in a cool place - on the refrigerator door - for no more than six months, and at room temperature it remains suitable for a month. </p><p>  Another area where lime water is used is cooking.  For example, in making jam from green walnuts, you can not do without it.  After all, it is necessary to soften the shell that has begun to form.  To do this, a simple decoction with eggs can not do.  It is necessary to use <span>slaked lime:</span> put 500 grams in ceramic dishes and carefully pour in five liters of cold water.  Stir, leave alone and dark for 3-4 hours, then cover the jar with several layers of gauze and pour the solution into it.  Unripe nuts are firstly soaked for two days in the usual way to remove bitterness, and on the third day they are placed in lime water, stirring occasionally.  Then each nut is pierced with a fork in several places, again soaked in plain water for 2 days.  Then they are dipped in boiling water for 10 minutes, allowed to dry on a sieve, and only then cooked until ready in sugar syrup with cloves and lemon juice.  The effort is worth it! </p>
