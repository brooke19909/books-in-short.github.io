Reviews about it are almost all recent, because the hotel is new.  But this is enough to make an impression of the resort complex, as well as analyze the recommendations of tourists about the rest.  The hotel is very stylish, original, consistent with its name.  The hotel really is a "cave resort".  This is how the buildings and rooms are decorated.  The style of the mountain cave is dominant in the design of the hotel.  But not only this attracts tourists here on vacation.  Let's try to figure out how this hotel looks in the eyes of travelers, and what exactly they say about it. </p>

    <h2>  Near El Gouna </h2><p>  For our tourists, vacation in Egypt is far from a novelty.  The Kavez Beach Resort Hotel, however, differs from the others not only in its original construction.  As a rule, when arriving in Hurghada, tourists are accommodated in hotels located in the New City and further south to the most remote areas of Marsa Alam.  But this hotel is located north of the center of Hurghada, almost in the El-Gouna, which indicates its respectability.  After all, the village of El-Gouna (administratively owned by Hurghada) is famous for its fashionable vacation, channels, for which he received the nickname "Egyptian Venice."  Such places attract people who are looking for peace and authenticity and are ready to pay a little more money for it.  But since the hotel is located not in El Gouna itself, but near it, it provides its guests with the opportunity to use their own beach, rather than go to the public Zeytun coast.  Although it‚Äôs worth a ride, it‚Äôs one of the ‚Äúchips‚Äù of El Gouna. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  How to get to the hotel "Caves Beach Resort" (Hurghada)?  The reviews assure us that for this you should first get to the city airport.

From there you can get to the place where the hotel is located, by taxi (it takes about fifteen to twenty minutes), transfer (this is longer, depending on how many hotels the bus serves), as well as by minibus to El Gouna.

    <h2>  Hotel concept </h2><p>  We have already mentioned that the unusual design of buildings and rooms reviews of the hotel ‚ÄúCaves Beach Resort‚Äù (Hurghada) are called very original.  People write that when you arrive at a hotel, it‚Äôs as if you fall into the Stone Age, only with all modern conveniences.  Many experienced tourists even say that they have never seen anything like this - neither in Thailand nor in Turkey.  The hotel has its own concept not only in the field of design, but also in the policy of receiving guests.  For example, this hotel positions itself as a resort for adults.  Settled there only after sixteen years.  For some vacationers, tired of screaming and fussing children, this aspect becomes very attractive. </p>

    <h2>  Sea and pool vacations </h2><p>  Hotel "Caves Beach Resort" (Hurghada) has its own beach with a length of one hundred meters.  Its coating is sand and pebbles.  As in El Gouna, the sea near the hotel is quite shallow, and this must be taken into account.  The hotel does not have a pontoon, and a couple of hundred meters have to go to the depths.  In addition, you should know that dead corals can be at the bottom, and in order to swim safely, you need special ‚Äúcoral slippers‚Äù.  You can use the pontoon of a neighboring hotel, but sometimes you have to pay security guards for this. </p><p>  The beach is equipped, there are sun loungers, deck chairs, umbrellas.  Very clean.  Solid sunbeds, enough for everyone.  The hotel also has three beautiful swimming pools with hydromassage.  One of them stretched along almost the entire territory of the hotel.  The water in the pools is fresh.  One of them is heated in the winter.  You can swim there day and night, which, from the point of view of vacationers, distinguishes Caves Beach from other hotels.  They say that such a hotel is the only one in all of Egypt.  Caves Beach Resort combines the delights of a vacation in Hurghada and El Gouna at the same time.  But even excellent service and excellent food can not drown a real traveler's desire for a change of place. </p><h2>  Where to go </h2><p>  Not only the "seal" pastime and sea baths attract tourists to Egypt.  The Caves Beach Resort Hotel offers tourists the opportunity to visit various excursions.  The most popular are trips to Utopia Island and desert safaris on ATVs or jeeps.  But, of course, the most interesting and budget trip to the "Egyptian Venice".  After all, this man-made archipelago, consisting of many islands interconnected by openwork bridges, is closer to our hotel than the center of Hurghada!  And you can get there not only with a guide, but also on a regular minibus.  The places to visit in El Gouna are just darkness.  This is the beach on the island of Zeytun Beach, and El Kafr, the heart of the resort with party clubs, restaurants and bars, and the largest disco Arena in the vicinity, and a free aquarium. </p>

There are not so many vacationers, so there are no crowds or queues, and the absence of children allows people who are looking for comfort and tranquility to find their oasis of happiness here.  Vacationers begin to be friends with each other, and tourists feel almost at home.  Beautiful area, delicious food.  Very calm, not crowded, plays good unobtrusive music.  Some guests even foretell that when this hotel is fully completed, then the prices will rise, and getting here, it may become difficult.  Therefore, many people recommend visiting their friends with the resort, while this is still more or less budgetary.  It can be argued that the hotel "Caves Beach Resort" (Hurghada), a photo of which tourists who visited there, are happy to post on social networks, is becoming increasingly successful.  After all, this is the only hotel not only in Egypt, but throughout the Middle East, built in this style. </p>
