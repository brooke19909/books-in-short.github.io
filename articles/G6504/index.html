The best representatives</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  With the advent of a variety of sports, people argue about which team will win in a particular competition.  To maintain excitement and greater attractiveness, specialized institutions were invented that accept bets in the form of cash with the possibility of increasing the nominal value several times.  Any <span>bookmaker</span> type <span>office</span> , opened as a real institution or online organization, must be licensed, only then it is considered official and has the ability to pay winnings or use at its discretion not played bets.  Currently, a huge number of representative offices of such offices are known, and who are the bookmakers, what they do and which company is best to contact, will be described in detail in the article. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The first independent ancestors of modern institutions appeared in ancient Rome.  They were individuals or a group of like-minded people who accepted money from local residents for the outcome of races or cockfights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bookmaker forecasts" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/36446/879788.jpg" width="600"></div>  With the advent of sporting events, characterized by strict rules and a specific organization (date and venue, name of teams and types of confrontations), betting odds have become more understandable.  Starting from the nineteenth century, this type of activity received the status of a separate profession, and institutions began to open everywhere, gradually covering the whole world.  The first "specialized debaters" appeared in the UK, thanks to the development of football in this country.  In Russia, their mass distribution began in recent history - since 1992, since the Soviet leaders did not approve of the activities of such institutions.

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Variety of opportunities </h2><p>  It is much easier to hit the jackpot now than it was several decades ago.  This is primarily due to the advent of the Internet and the increased number of various events.  In addition, many forecasts of bookmakers have become much more diverse and affordable: </p><ul><li>  <em>Traditional rates.</em>  Accepted at the outcome of the match, regardless of sport.  This also includes guessing the confrontation account. </li><li>  <em>Express</em>  In this case, the amount is paid immediately to several events or achievements, and the coefficients related to each event are multiplied.  It is important to remember that even with one wrong result, a loss is counted. </li><li>  <em>Live</em>  <span>Bookmakers' bets</span> are accepted in real time (mostly available only in the online version).  For example, if one of the teams loses and there are a few more minutes left until the end of the game, you can deposit money for a draw or victory.  The more difficult it is to achieve a final outcome, the higher the coefficient will be. </li><li>  <em>Miscellaneous</em> .  This section includes Total (you need to guess the number of goals scored - less or more than the established value of the office), Handicap (the difference between goals scored and goals conceded) and much more. </li></ul>

    <p>  It is worth noting that the rating of bookmakers is a conditional value, made up of several nuances and important details. </p><h2>  What to choose: office or online? </h2><p>  With the ubiquity of the Internet, many sports betting agencies have moved their activities to the web.  Therefore, today, when asked about who are the bookmakers, one can often hear the answer - online companies.  In fact, real offices have not gone away, as before, taking funds on the ground.  It‚Äôs up to you to decide which proposal to choose, but in fact both options are equivalent, they have both pros and cons. </p><h2>  Domestic organizations </h2><p>  Since 1992, Russian bookmakers regularly offer their services both as real establishments and in RuNet.  Here are the most successful and attractive offices: </p><ul><li>  Betsiti </li><li>  "Zenith"; </li><li>  "Europe"; </li><li>  "Marathon"; </li><li>  "Chance"; </li><li>  Betting League. </li></ul>
