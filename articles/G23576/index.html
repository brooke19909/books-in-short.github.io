  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Punic Wars</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The Punic <span>Wars of Rome</span> were waged with a North African power, the <span>Phoenician city of</span> Carthage for the existence of Rome itself, as well as for supremacy in the western Mediterranean.  The first trade agreement between the Romans and the Carthaginians was concluded in 509 BC.  On the division of spheres of influence, contracts were renewed in 348, 305 and 281 <span>BC.</span> </p><p>  For centuries, there was a struggle of Carthage for Sicilian domination with the Greeks.  At the same time, the southwestern part of Sicily was a sphere of influence of the Punians (Carthaginians).  Sicilian Greeks at the beginning of the 3rd century  BC  e.  were not able to cope on their own with the growing onslaught.  As a result, they were forced to seek external help, in particular, to Tsar Pyrrhus, and later (after the capture of the south of Italy by the Romans) - to the Roman government. </p><p>  The wars of ancient Rome were the consequences of certain events.  In 282 BC  Italian mercenaries entered into Messana (the Greek city) (according to some sources they were called Mamertins) and captured it.  However, Syracuse Hieron (the ruler of the city) began to push back the invaders.  The Mamertins split up, asking for external support: some asked the Romans for help, and others asked the Carthaginians.  The discontent of the Romans was caused by the invasion of the Carthaginians into Messana. </p><p>  The Punic Wars began in 264 BC.  e.  from the landing of the Romans in Sicily and the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Messana.  The consul Appius Claudius led the Roman army.  The ruler of Messana made an alliance with Rome.  Together, they ousted the Carthaginians from the city of Agrigent.  Despite the fact that the Romans did not have their fleet before, they quickly built it and won several victories over the Punians, known for their power at sea.  Duilius won his first naval victory on the northern Sicilian coast.  The battle used boarding bridges invented by the Romans.  In 256 BC  Consul Regulus won the next victory at Eknom.  With his army, he landed in Africa.  In 255, the Romans were defeated by the mercenary commander Xanthippus, while Duilius was captured.  However, despite the misfortunes of the Romans, exacerbated by the loss of several fleets during the storm, they win on land near the Phoenician city in western Sicily Panorma.  Between 248 and 242, the Romans were driven out of the Sicilian cities by the Carthaginian army under the command of Hamilcar Barca.  This talented commander wins both naval and land victories.  However, the situation changes in 242 after the defeat of the Carthaginian fleet near the Egat Islands.  As a result of the fact that the Romans dominated the sea, and Hamilcar was cut off from Carthage, the Punians were forced to conclude a very unprofitable world for themselves.  By agreement, they had to abandon Sicily completely.  Internal strife in the Carthaginian state suspended the Punic wars for a while.  Thanks to the exclusion of the Carthaginians from the struggle, the Romans managed to capture Sardinia. </p><p>  Punic wars resumed as a result of the expansion of Carthage in Spain.  Since 237, the Carthaginian commanders (Hasdrubal, Hamilcar, Hannibal) conquered various Spanish tribes.  In 218, the Romans declared war on Carthage.  The reason for this was the capture of the city of Sagunta, allied to the Romans.  The commander Hannibal outwitted the Romans, who were waiting for his invasion from the sea, crossing the Pyrenees and Gaul, as well as the practically inaccessible Alps, went down to the north of Italy.  Due to his suddenness and swiftness, he won several brilliant victories.  In 216, in the battle of Cannes, Hannibal defeats the Roman 80 thousandth army.  However, he fails to enter Rome.  Despite this, Hannibal directs its eyes towards the rich Italian cities.  However, in 214, the victories of the Carthaginians ended.  Until 202, the Carthaginian generals were defeated.  In the end, they made peace. </p><p>  Military operations resumed in 149 by the Romans.  Fearing the revival of Carthage, the <span>Roman army</span> besieges the city.  Local residents defended for three years.  However, in 146, Carthage was captured and destroyed. </p><p>  The Punic Wars ravaged the south of Italy so much that the once prosperous land lost all economic importance. </p>
