    <p>  Serfdom is a form of peasant dependence, consisting in the attachment of peasants to the land and the subordination of their judicial and administrative power to the feudal landowner.  It formed for a long time. </p><p>  Serfdom (serfdom) was born in a <span>feudal system.</span>  During the fragmentation in the Russian state there was no single law that would determine the duties and rights of the peasant. </p><p>  In the 15th century, people could freely leave the land and move to the territory of another landowner after paying the debts and duties to the previous owner.  But even then, the princes began to issue special letters restricting the movement of peasants.  As a result, <span>rural residents</span> could move from one landowner to another only during the week to St. George's Day. </p><p>  Serfdom legally began to take shape in the era of the reign of Ivan the Third.  During his reign, a unified code of laws of the Law Code of 1497 was adopted.  His 57th article officially limited the right of the peasants to transfer the week before and the week after St. George's Day.  Upon leaving, the landowner must be paid compensation. </p><p>  Mikhail Romanov, who began to reign in 1613, contributed to the further enslavement of the rural population.  He extended the search for runaway peasants, along with this began to practice the sale or assignment of peasants without land allotment. </p><p>  Alexei Romanov, who became king in 1645, carried out several transformations.  First of all, the autocrat changed the order of duties and collection of fees.  It was also planned to increase replenishment of the treasury due to indirect taxes.  As a result, in 1648, at the beginning of June, the <span>‚ÄúSalt Riot‚Äù</span> took place in Moscow <span>, the</span> reason for which was precisely the increase in the salt tax.  After this uprising took place in some other cities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In such circumstances, Alexei Mikhailovich makes the transformation in the administrative apparatus.  In 1649, one of the most important documents in Russian criminal, civil and state law - the Cathedral Code was developed and approved.  In accordance with the content of his special chapter, ‚ÄúThe Court of the Peasants,‚Äù serfdom became hereditary, and the landowner received the right to dispose of all the property of the peasant. </p><p>  Subsequently, the rural population contributed to the development of <span>productive forces</span> within the country, providing a solution to a number of foreign policy problems.  Thus, some prerequisites for reforms were formed during the subsequent reign of Peter the Great. </p><p>  Changes in the situation of peasants occurred during the reign of <span>Elizabeth Petrovna.</span>  The empress strengthened the power of the landowners.  At the same time, she reduced the size of the <span>poll tax</span> and forgave arrears to the peasantry. </p><p>  In 1767, Catherine II convened the Stated Commission.  Its goal was to eliminate the shortcomings of the law and identify the moods and needs of Russian society.  In the 1760s - 70s, a wave of uprisings swept through the country.  The largest event was the performance of Emelyan Pugachev. </p><p>  In the 18th century, serfdom began to experience a crisis of the system.  However, the Russian economy developed quite well, adapting to new conditions. </p><p>  At the same time, within the peasant class itself, a certain stratification began.  Gradually, the rural bourgeoisie began to stand out, representing the peasant owners (state-owned, to a greater extent).  In 1801, they were given the opportunity to redeem empty land and rent land from landowners. </p><p>  During the reign of Alexander the First, the law "On Free Tillage" was adopted (in 1803).  The decree provided for the release of the ransom and by mutual agreement of the landowners and peasants. </p><p>  In 1818, Alexander the First tried to carry out peasant reform.  As a result, of the several prepared projects, the emperor approved the project of Guryev (Minister of Finance) and Arakcheev, according to which the gradual elimination of serfdom through the redemption of peasants was supposed. </p><p>  The manifesto on the abolition of serfdom was adopted by Alexander the Second in 1861, February 19.  In addition, all the reform provisions were signed by the emperor.  From this moment, serfdom officially ceased to exist. </p>
