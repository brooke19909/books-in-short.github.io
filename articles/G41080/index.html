  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Headphones Beats: reviews, descriptions, specifications, instructions, repair</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finding the perfect headphone is never easy.  Of course, someone may advise you to purchase a certain model, but after the purchase you will notice that it does not suit you at all.  So what to do?  Most often you have to rely on your own experience.  Although, if you decide to purchase Beats headphones, reviews will help you make your choice. </p><h2>  Headphones </h2><p>  Buying such accessories often causes frustration.  Someone decides not to spend a lot of money and buys headphones from an unknown manufacturer.  These usually do not survive for a long time, so you have to look for new ones in a couple of months.  And, as a rule, there is no guarantee for them. </p><p>  Others prefer to purchase an expensive headset.  But this option may also be unsuccessful.  It is unlikely that this will be due to the poor quality of the product.  Rather, it is an inconvenience. </p><p>  Well, you see, far from all the headphones that you used at least once have sat perfectly on you.  Of course, this is not surprising, since everyone has a different size of head and ears.  Therefore, often some are devoted only to vacuum models, while others, on the contrary, prefer only overheads. </p><h2>  Manufacturer </h2><p>  Headphones Beats reviews almost always get positive.  What's the secret?  It is rather a matter of a complex of reasons why the company's devices are to the taste of customers. </p><p>  Firstly, the manufacturer does not skimp on good advertising.  It, as they say, does not happen much, especially if it is made with high quality.  It is unlikely that there will be a person who at least once would not hear about Beats or, at least, did not see the company logo. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Secondly, the company really makes a quality product.  The user usually gets a reliable device: with durable materials and a truly beautiful design. </p><p>  Thirdly, it will be difficult to find a person who at least once would use Beats headphones, and left bad reviews.  The sound quality even in the cheapest model is decent.  It is difficult to blame for the absence of any frequencies.  You can not talk about the artificial sound.  Favorite songs really get a new sound. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rtings.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats headphone reviews" class="if uuid-3130842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130842.jpg"></div><p>  But of course, not everything is so smooth.  Even the best and best product on the market sometimes gets negative reviews.  Sometimes they are associated with a marriage, which, fortunately, Beats is extremely rare.  Sometimes the negative can be caused by high cost - but here it is difficult to deny that the company's headphones are far from the budget segment. </p><p>  The sound, even if it seems ideal for someone, can cause indignation among the deaf-ears: there are a lot of basses in some models, so it becomes hard to listen to some more classical tracks. </p><h2>  Beats Products </h2><p>  Beats headphones received positive reviews due to their diversity.  The company's products can satisfy any customer who, of course, is ready to pay a tidy sum for an accessory.  Yes and it cannot be denied that having Beats is still prestigious and fashionable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What does the manufacturer offer?  You can find headphones for every taste.  You can get the usual vacuum models, although you have to pre-test them in the store.  Good are considered sports models, which, in fact, are the same vacuum, but with a more convenient mount. </p><p>  Perhaps the most popular are overhead models.  And among them there are both wired and those that work via Bluetooth.  Gaming models specifically aimed at the corresponding segment cannot be found. </p><h2>  The best models </h2><p>  Of course, doing some kind of rating is a thankless task.  In addition, someone prefers overhead models more, and someone with pleasure would have bought a good vacuum.  Nevertheless, buyers themselves sometimes, without knowing it, create a top.  It can be recognized by sales and positive reviews. </p><p>  So, the most popular over the past year include: </p><ul><li>  Solo 3 Wireless. </li><li>  Studio 3 Wireless. </li><li>  BeatsX Wireless. </li><li>  Pro. </li><li>  Powerbeats 3. </li><li>  EP. </li><li>  urBeats. </li></ul><p>  These are the most ‚Äúfresh‚Äù models that have either recently been released or are still popular with users.  Among them there are wireless and wireless models, as well as overhead, vacuum and sports headphones. </p><h2>  Solo 3 wireless </h2><p>  This is an overhead wireless headphone model.  Beats Solo 3 Wireless is considered the best choice among the options in the series.  Buying such a model will cost you 12-15 thousand rubles.  Much depends on the appearance.  It's no secret that Dr.  Dre is working to produce exclusive models with elaborate prints. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.bestbuy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats Solo 3 Wireless" class="if uuid-3130843" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130843.jpg"></div><p>  This model has recently become mainstream.  Many critics believe that this is due to its quality marketing.  One way or another, but the model was swept off the shelves with incredible speed. </p><h2>  Solo 3 Wireless Reviews </h2><p>  Headphones Beats Solo 3 Wireless, of course, should be considered a good option for everyday use.  But there are of course some disadvantages.  Many people think that for such a price you can buy headphones with better sound.  This is not a professional sound. </p><p>  The disadvantages of users also attributed their noise to others.  There are questions for comfort with prolonged wearing.  Finally, some came across a fake.  Therefore, buyers recommend contacting authorized dealers. </p><h2>  Studio 3 Wireless </h2><p>  This model is one level higher than the previous one.  This is evidenced by the increase in value by 5-7 thousand rubles, and the improvement of quality.  Here the user can really hear professional sound.  Although, again, this issue remains very controversial and can cause completely different opinions. </p><p>  The Beats Studio 3 Wireless looks good.  In the collection you can find colors to your liking, although some did not have more catchy and bright options.  They presented the model at Apple in 2018 and this is no accident. </p><p>  The users, as always, have access to a very comfortable collaboration with the iPhone.  Many, even if they wanted to, could choose a different model for themselves, but refuse, because there is an Apple W1 processor inside, which means a lot of cool ‚Äúbuns‚Äù for the owners of the company's products. </p><h2>  Studio 3 Wireless reviews </h2><p>  Users have left mixed reviews about Beats Studio 3 Wireless.  On the one hand, everyone got what they wanted: a wireless model, with a good design and high-quality assembly, however, as always.  On the other hand, it seemed to some that they had been fooled somewhere. </p><p>  Here the situation is similar to the previous one.  A lot of money was thrown away for marketing, but whether buying such a model is worth 26 thousand rubles is a big question.  Some still believe that they can easily find an alternative with better sound for the money. </p><h2>  BeatsX Wireless </h2><p>  Another Beats bluetooth headphone model, but of a different type.  By the way, this option is just quite experienced in the market - more than 4 years.  However, it remains relevant for many.  You can buy it for 8-9 thousand rubles. </p><p>  They look like classic wireless vacuums.  The wire is made of rubber, therefore flexible and thin.  At first glance, it will not be easy to distinguish them from the usual ‚Äúplugs‚Äù for 100 rubles, but picking it up, you immediately see a different quality of materials and a familiar logo. </p><p>  It turned out to be simple and connect the device to Apple.  On the smartphone, just hold down the power key, as the corresponding notification appears on the screen.  In general, the user will not need any instruction, but just in case, it is included. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cnet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats BeatsX Wireless" class="if uuid-3130846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130846.jpg"></div><h2>  BeatsX Wireless Reviews </h2><p>  These are Beats bluetooth-earphones which were praised for high-quality sound and good materials for production.  The user received reliable sports headphones for 9 thousand rubles, which were also convenient during activities. </p><p>  The owners praised the manufacturer for the autonomy of the model - 8 hours and only an hour charge.  The kit also caused positive feedback for the presence of a cover, spare ear pads, a charging cable and two sets of hooks. </p><p>  Negative feedback about the low level of maximum volume.  To some, they seemed quiet.  A microphone picks up a voice poorly if you do not bring it closer to your mouth. </p><h2>  Pro </h2><p>  These are expensive professional headphones.  The manufacturer positions this device as a premium class.  This, by the way, is noticeable at a cost of 25 thousand rubles.  The design of Beats Pro turned out to be very good.  Many compare it with the interior of an expensive car. </p><p>  The ergonomics of the device are also top notch.  The user can twist the ear pads around the axis, and also fold them inward.  At the same time, you can not be afraid that some parts will wear out and burst in a couple of years.  In fact, the materials are very high quality, so even in order to break the headphones, you need to try. </p><p>  This option is definitely not suitable for a smartphone or tablet.  Gadgets just can't handle it, and you won't be able to appreciate the sound quality.  Yes, and it is unlikely that someone would come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying monitor headphones for the player. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats pro" class="if uuid-3130847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130847.jpg"></div><h2>  Beats Pro reviews </h2><p>  Users had something to praise in this model.  They noted the excellent design of the device and the excellent quality of the materials from which it is made: everything is made of aluminum and leatherette.  You will not find any plastic here. </p><p>  Also, users noted a convenient design that allows you to transport headphones even in a small bag.  And, of course, the sound quality is in no way inferior to the top studio models. </p><p>  But here buyers react negatively on the ratio of price and quality.  Despite the fact that the sound is really good, there are models on the market for the same cost, but with more interesting parameters. </p><h2>  Powerbeats 3 </h2><p>  The latest Beats bluetooth headphone in this line.  This is the most popular sports headset model.  Since the task of the model is to save the user from discomfort during sports, it was endowed with moisture protection, a convenient design and light weight. </p><p>  The sound of the model seems to be excellent, considering that we have vacuum headphones.  You will hear a lot of bass, and therefore more motivation during sports exercises.  Of course, everything will depend on the tracks that you listen to during your workout. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.techradar.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats Powerbeats 3" class="if uuid-3130849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130849.jpg"></div><h2>  Powerbeats 3 reviews </h2><p>  Users were pleased with the design of the model: the headphones are really light and comfortable, even during prolonged workouts.  Also noted are many easy connections.  The wireless model remembers the last 8 devices that it was connected to, so the further connection does not require configuration. </p><p>  Users responded negatively about the cost.  Here, the matter is somewhat different than in the previous versions.  The fact is that because of their purpose, the price tag has increased, but the sound quality has remained at the level of cheaper models. </p><p>  It was also an unpleasant surprise for many that the headset could not completely isolate from the outside world because of its open type.  But, you see, it‚Äôll be somehow safer. </p><h2>  EP </h2><p>  Although this is not the most popular and popular product, this is one of the most budget models from the manufacturer.  But this point cannot but attract attention, since the price tags of other products are much higher.  Headphones cost about 4-5 thousand rubles. </p><p>  It is worth saying that the outwardly low cost did not affect the product in any way.  The accessory looks good and does not raise any doubts about its quality.  The ear pads turned out to be large, so they may seem very convenient to many. </p><p>  They do not have a flexible design, they can not be folded or even removed the cable.  The headband is made of plastic, so you should still be careful when using it. </p><h2>  Beats EP Reviews </h2><p>  Users were satisfied with the purchase.  Of course, those who are already familiar with the company's products will immediately see the difference in the quality of materials of this model and more expensive.  Over time, the plastic becomes worn and scratches can collect.  Leatherette is not so high quality, so it is covered with sweat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats Studio 3 Wireless" class="if uuid-3130844" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130844.jpg"></div><p>  Users did not talk much about sound.  Some felt that there was virtually no difference in the sound of this model and more expensive.  Here you can argue for a long time, in addition, much depends on the playback device. </p><h2>  urBeats </h2><p>  These are perhaps the brightest vacuum headphones from the company.  They can be traced to the design of Monster, so they can quickly assemble their fan base.  This model can rightly be considered everyday.  They will not be convenient to use during sports or in working with sound.  But for everyday listening to your favorite songs on your smartphone, they are perfect. </p><p>  You can buy them for 7-8 thousand rubles.  For this money, you get durable and stylish headphones with good isolation from the world.  The headset produces good bass, in some cases it seems even too much.  Many believe that the model is an ideal replacement for those who for some reason do not want to buy EarPods.  The buyer has the opportunity to purchase a version that matches his iPhone in color. </p><h2>  Beats urBeats reviews </h2><p>  The price of Beats urBeats headphones seems justified, because the user gets an excellent product with good quality materials and good sound.  Owners praised the equipment and convenient durable cable.  Also, many were pleased with the appearance of the device. </p><p>  Despite all its advantages, it turned out that Beats urBeats headphones get into repairs very often.  Many attribute this to the sad build quality: the weak point is the connection of the cable to the ‚Äújack‚Äù. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bydeals.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats urbeats" class="if uuid-3130853" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130853.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection Instructions </h2><p>  Since there were many wireless models in the review, it‚Äôs worth separately to tell how to connect Beats headphones. </p><p>  In general, the connection itself follows the same scenario.  Often the difference can be precisely in the devices to which the headset is connected.  For example, for the Beats Studio headphone model to work, you need to disconnect the audio cable from the gadget, if it is connected. </p><p>  Next, turn on the headphones, after which the wireless indicator will blink.  Now you need to open your smartphone and go to the Bluetooth menu.  Here all connected devices will be highlighted, just select the headphones.  Confirmation of connection is carried out by flashing the indicator (4 times). </p><p>  Beats headphones are connected a little differently.  The instruction is included, but you can describe it in several steps: </p><ul><li>  turn on the headphones; </li><li>  open a smartphone, tablet or other device; </li><li>  find the Bluetooth menu; </li><li>  in the list we are looking for a model of headphones; </li><li>  we are connected. </li></ul><p>  If you have an iPhone, you need to unlock it and put the device next to it.  Next, click on the power button of the headphones to turn them on.  A notification about connecting to the headset will automatically appear on the smartphone screen.  Next, follow the instructions on the phone screen. </p><h2>  Repairs </h2><p>  Unfortunately, breakdowns happen even with very expensive headphones.  Repair may be required for various reasons.  Well, if the device still has a warranty and you can repair or replace them for free.  But what if there is no guarantee anymore? </p><p>  There are not many options.  You can take them to the store where you bought.  And for the money you will try to repair them.  You can also just throw them out and purchase new ones.  Alternatively, you can also repair the device yourself. </p><p>  Of course, do-it-yourself repairs need to be done only by understanding this issue.  The easiest option is to replace the jack plug.  You can also try cleaning ear pads.  If the design of the headphones is overhead, it is better not to deal with such things yourself. </p><h2>  Fake </h2><p>  There are many fakes on the market for popular products.  For example, many people often look for Beats STN 13 headphones. Some major online retailers may sell this model.  But you will be surprised when you find out that they are asking for about 1,500 rubles.  Of course, for such a price, Beats does not sell any of its products. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lelong.com.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beats Studio STN 13" class="if uuid-3130854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40011/3130854.jpg"></div><p>  The Beats Studio STN 13 headphones really look like the original.  But if you look closely, you can notice low-quality materials and cheap plastic.  If you take them to listen, so in general everything falls into place. </p><p>  You can distinguish fake by packaging.  The manufacturer is responsible for the filling and quality of the box.  Originals are always neatly packed, and there are various "buns" in the kit.  You can‚Äôt find anything like this in a fake.  Usually the box is made of the cheapest cardboard, and you will never see its graphic design in the original. </p><p>  By the way, there are a lot of fakes on the market.  And if the original model is visible immediately, and online stores in the description indicate that it is a copy, then on Chinese sites you can find many cheap Beats headphones with very good quality and identical packaging.  Therefore, it is very difficult to distinguish between them. </p><p>  What to look for?  First of all, on the serial number, which should be on the bottom of the box, on the sticker.  Printing packaging at the highest quality.  You should carefully read the descriptions.  You can consider the details of the box that give the fake: the absence of straps, the presence of a glossy tray, neat packaging, etc. </p>
