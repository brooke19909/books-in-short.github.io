    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  The phone lies in a white box - wide, but low.  Next to it in separate compartments are located: a charger, a cable for connecting peripheral devices, a headset, a bag of bolts and a screwdriver to them, a warranty card, instructions for sealing and documentation.  There is also a <span>protective film,</span> however, it is already glued to the screen.  The interior of the packaging is black, not very well painted.  Therefore, white objects in contact with it may turn black. </p>

Its connector is slightly longer than usual.  Here it is necessary, since the connector for it is slightly recessed into the device.  Only with the cable you need to be careful, because in any store you can not buy it.

Similar models are very similar to each other.  First of all, they are united by thick, massive and heavy cases.  The same features apply to the above device, which comes in three colors: black, orange and green.  Moreover, on some elements of the case there are drawings that perfectly hide various unwanted traces. </p><p>  The entire front of the device is covered with glass.  Below are touch buttons and a microphone, and above is an auditory speaker and a front camera, which is located under the glass.  There are also proximity and light sensors. </p><p>  The connector for charging and the hole for the headset is located on the upper end.  They are securely covered by a plug.  But at the bottom end, except for the recess for removing the cover, there is nothing more. </p><p>  There is a small gap between the screen and the housing.  Reading the reviews left about the Blackview BV5000 smartphone, we can conclude that many people have it.  They say that there is a silicone gasket, so the smartphone does not seem to be sealed. </p>

    <p>  Metal plates are fastened to the side faces, which most likely perform an anti-shock function.  On the right side is the power button, on the left is the volume key. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The back cover has four holes at the edges, it can be additionally fixed with the bolts that are included in the package.  Also on it there are openings for the camera, flash and speaker.  Under the cover lies a rubber gasket that can be easily removed.  Under it is a battery, a slot for a memory card and two more slots - SIM and Micro-SIM. </p><h2>  Display specifications </h2><p>  The device has a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280 √ó 720, which is covered with a <span>protective glass.</span>  If you read the <span>reviews</span> about the <span>Blackview BV5000,</span> you can conclude that the coverage is reliable, since there are no scratches over the long period of using the smartphone.  The sensor is quite sensitive, and multi-touch supports up to five touches.  Moreover, you can work with it even with wet hands.  Gestures are supported in sleep mode and when the screen is off.  Only characters need to be drawn very clearly.  It is interesting to realize the unlocking of the smartphone, for this you need to "tap" on the display twice. </p>

    <p>  In general, the screen turned out to be quite good.  At least, so many users leave reviews about the Blackview BV5000 smartphone.  There is a large margin of brightness, saturated image colors, excellent viewing angles and a fairly high-quality <span>oleophobic coating.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  For the performance of the smartphone meets the 4-core MediaTek processor with a small frequency of 1 GHz.  And even if this is one of the most budgetary systems, the device running under its control works quickly enough.  The processor is assisted by a Mali-720 graphics chip and 2 GB of RAM.  In general, the characteristics are not bad, but are they enough for games? </p><p>  In fact, such characteristics are enough to run any modern program or game.  Take at least demanding applications, such as Asphalt 8 and Dead Trigger 2. For the entire time of the game after their launch brakes and freezes were not noticed.  The device can also easily cope with other games, as evidenced by the reviews written on the Blackview BV5000 phone.  It is not clear why in the test programs the device scores only 21,000 points.  However, what's the difference?  The main thing is that everything works smoothly. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  But the smartphone‚Äôs camera does not make much impression.  At first there was information that the developers would give the device 13 and 5 megapixel modules, but in the end the cameras were much weaker.  The main 8-megapixel module with autofocus and flash makes photos of medium quality.  The thing is that the flash is weak, the colors are unnatural, and the detail is lame.  In general, not for professional photographers. </p><p>  Of course, in the settings you can increase the resolution of the cameras to 13 and 5 megapixels, and then the photos turn out a little better.  But still this is not enough, not for nothing that in most reviews, users of the camera are classified as flaws.  True, low-quality images developers can be forgiven, given the price of the Blackview BV5000. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  As already mentioned, under the back cover of the smartphone there are two slots for SIM cards.  Also, the device was awarded all the necessary wireless modules, such as Bluetooth, GPS and Wi-Fi.  Does the Blackview BV5000 mobile device support 4G connection?  Of course it does.  And everything works fine. </p>

    <p>  The phone has only one microphone, but the other person hears during the conversation.  The speaker is quite loud, perfectly audible even in noisy places.  There are no complaints about the external speaker either, because the volume amplification function is provided for it.  Well, maybe a vibrating alert might not be pleasant?  About the phone application, we can only say that it is the most ordinary.  In it, you can switch SIM cards or control the recorder. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The Blackview BV5000 4G smartphone runs on OS Android 5.1, which visually looks unusual - it's all about the proprietary shell.  It is worth noting the lack of an application menu in the device, all the shortcuts are placed on the desktops, two of which are multimedia, as they provide quick access to the gallery, videos, music and camera.  Non-standard look and application icons.  They seem to be framed by thick-walled frames.  Whoever doesn‚Äôt like this solution will have to go to the free themes store. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  To charge the Blackview BV5000 LTE smartphone, a proprietary 2 A charger with a 7 mm connector is provided.  In 20 minutes, the device charges about 20%, for 40% it will take at least an hour.  Well, to fully charge the device, you have to wait 3-4 hours.  The adapter does not get very hot during charging. </p><p>  And now, how quickly the Blackview BV5000 loses its charge.  The results should be impressive, as its battery capacity is 5000 mAh. </p>

    <p>  So, if you do web browsing with an average brightness value, then the battery will run out after about 12-13 hours.  When watching a video, less resources are spent, so 15-16 hours will pass before a full discharge.  It affects the vitality of the smartphone during games.  Hardly anyone can lose 9 hours in a row! </p><h2>  Protective properties </h2><p>  And finally, I want to recall the protective qualities of the Blackview BV5000 smartphone.  There is no point in reviewing the mockery of the unfortunate device, since there is already a lot of similar material.  It will be enough just to take stock.  And this is what came of it. </p><p>  There is nothing to talk about dust protection.  This is not hard to believe.  Of greater interest is the veracity of high-profile statements about shock resistance and water resistance.  Of course, this smartphone is stronger than many other mobile devices.  And his body is a direct confirmation of this.  Nevertheless, there are conflicting reviews - for some, it crashed after a small blow, while for others it experienced a serious fall. </p>

    <p>  As for water procedures, the tests show that the phone is able to withstand them.  Just bathing it for a long time is not worth it, and it is advisable not to leave it under running water. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  It is difficult to say whether the Blackview BV5000 smartphone is worth its money (and the price for it can reach 12 500 rubles).  After all, there are a number of significant shortcomings.  The device is heavy, has a non-standard connector, without a gyroscope, and it has a bad camera. </p><p>  On the other side of the balance there are several positive aspects: a capacious battery, a good screen, and also some kind of no, but protection.  Probably, a mobile device will appeal to fans of extreme relaxation.  True, some complications are caused by the availability of the phone, because without Chinese online stores it is quite difficult to purchase it.  So in a month, maybe the package will come. </p>
