  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of the formation of the United States. First 13 states</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The first 13 US states are former British colonies that declared independence in 1776.  They were located along the Atlantic coast of North America, where there were ports through which there was communication with the mainland.  They signed the Declaration of Independence, not recognizing the power of Britain, which contributed to the creation of the United States of America and the outbreak of the war for independence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first 13 states of the usa" class="if uuid-3087499" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3087499.jpg"></div><h2>  Composition of the population </h2><p>  In the first 13 states of the United States, the vast majority were from Britain and Ireland.  They amounted to 85% of the total number of residents and were subjects of the British crown.  About 10% were Germans and 4% Dutch and small Sephardic Jewish communities.  The population increased due to the high birth rate and new immigrants.  These were economically and politically the most developed territories. </p><h2>  Union of Provinces and Colonies </h2><p>  Until 1774, the colonies were independent and independent of each other.  But thanks to the efforts of the outstanding public figure B. Franklin, an alliance was formed, which included the future first 13 US states.  Their list consisted of 9 provinces: </p><ol><li>  New Hampshire. </li><li>  Massachusetts Bay </li><li>  New Jersey. </li><li>  New York. </li><li>  Pennsylvania. </li><li>  Maryland </li><li>  South Carolina </li><li>  North Carolina. </li><li>  Georgia. </li></ol><p>  In addition to the provinces, the Union included 4 colonies: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  Rhode Island and Providence Plantation. </li><li>  Connecticut. </li><li>  Delaware. </li><li>  Virginia. </li></ol><p>  Provinces are administrative units of the state, in America they were part of the territory of England.  They had their own administration, as a governing body, and an election system based on English law.  At the head was the governor, in whose submission were parts of the English army.  It was approved by the English parliament, that is, London had supreme power.  Provinces most likely designated a form of government.  The colonies differed from the provinces in that they did not have self-governing bodies; a colonial regime was operating on their territory. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first 13 states usa list" class="if uuid-3081579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3081579.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons for separation </h2><p>  These are, first of all, the economic and political differences between England and the territories that became the first 13 states of the USA.  The intervention of the metropolis in the administration of the provinces provoked protests by local authorities and residents.  The adoption by the English government of the "Act on stamp duty" in 1765, provoked widespread discontent and protests.  According to this document, all trade transactions, including the sale of newspapers, brochures, books, including playing cards, as well as notarization and signing of civil documents, were subject to a stamp duty in favor of the English Crown. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The outrage of the Americans was well-founded.  Most of the citizens were citizens of England, and the new territories where they lived were under its supreme control, but they did not have a representative in the English parliament who would express their interests.  They considered their civil rights infringed and stated that ‚Äútaxes without representative offices are tyranny.‚Äù </p><p>  In 1766, the <span>stamp duty</span> was canceled.  This inspired the Americans in the first 13 states that formed the United States.  But in 1767, trade duties were introduced on a number of imported goods.  The confrontation grew. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pixels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="first 13 states of the usa" class="if uuid-3081580" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49191/3081580.jpg"></div><h2>  Declaration of independence </h2><p>  The battle for representation lasted nine years.  During this time, the power of the elected bodies of administrative self-government has strengthened enough, the ‚ÄúSons of Freedom‚Äù movement has appeared, leaders such as B. Franklin, J. Adams, J. Washington, T. Jefferson, J. Otisu have been determined. </p><p>  In response to this, the English parliament in 1774 curtailed the administrative rights of the Massachusetts Bay province and categorically rejected the requirements for representative offices.  In addition, taxes have been increased. </p><p>  The colonies responded by holding unintended elections to Provincial Congresses, which adopted their constitutions.  This was the beginning of the first 13 US states.  The 1st Continental Congress was held in Philadelphia, in which 12 colonies took part - it was not Georgia.  Following him, the 2nd Continental Congress was convened, in which she took part. </p><p>  In 1775, English officials were removed from power in all 13 colonies, which meant the declaration of independence from England.  The Continental Congress took over the functions of the government that operated during the War of Independence.  In 1776, 13 states signed the Declaration of Independence. </p>
