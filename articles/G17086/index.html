But no one wants to deny themselves the opportunity to swim in the warm and gentle sea, get a beautiful even tan and just escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life.  And then budgetary directions come to the rescue: there are not so many of them, but nevertheless they exist.  Bulgaria is a once popular, but recently forgotten resort.  But all the necessary conditions for an excellent beach holiday are created here: gorgeous sandy beaches, a transparent warm sea and well-developed infrastructure.  Bulgaria is quite suitable for holidays in August - by the end of the month the so-called velvet season begins here. </p>

    <p>  Each room has a small entrance hall and a spacious bedroom.  Double rooms have an extra bedroom.  There is not much furniture, but it‚Äôs enough to relax: beds with bedside tables, an easy chair, a coffee table, a wardrobe. </p><p>  I want to say a few words about the bathroom.  All vacationers who come to a mid-range hotel are struck by the separation of the shower from the toilet and the bidet - this is sometimes not found in the most luxurious European hotels.  Plumbing is working properly, there are no problems and interruptions in the supply of hot water.  Upon arrival, tourists will receive a set of necessary bath accessories. </p><h2>  Room service </h2><p>  The rooms are cleaned daily, the staff is very kind to their duties: they change towels and bed linen, wash the floor and clean the plumbing.  Cleaning is done during the absence of tourists, so nothing violates their peace.  Upon returning to the room, vacationers feel pleasant freshness. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel "Lyulyak" offers all vacationers meals "half board", which includes breakfast and dinner.  They are served in the hotel's buffet restaurant.  The restaurant has a separate non-smoking room, which will delight all guests who prefer a healthy lifestyle. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  For a 3 * hotel, the food is amazing - this is noted by all tourists and vacationers staying at the hotel.  For breakfast you can see scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs, sausages and sausages, cereals, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, fresh pastries, fresh fruits and vegetables.  For dinner, tourists are pampered with chicken, grilled meat, sausages, vegetables, fruits - everything is always fresh and tasty.  The absence of lunch is justified: most tourists spend the light part of the day either on the beach or on excursions, so they would not want to be tied to a schedule.  You can always have a meal on the beach, as well as in local restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  If tourists decide to go on an early excursion, they will be offered to pre-order lunches.  Most often these are <span>sandwiches with cheese, ham and</span> herbs, fresh pastries and juice.  This is enough to eat on the road. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  Hotel Ljuljak 3 * (Golden Sands) is located in the center of the National Park, so it is not surprising that its territory is surrounded by greenery.  Many vacationers prefer to spend evenings in a cozy garden, grill meat on a fire.  The territory is small, but well-groomed and comfortable. </p>

    <p>  The territory has a fairly large outdoor pool, sunbeds and umbrellas near it are provided to vacationers for a fee.  By the way, the pool is cleaned daily.  At the height of the season there are almost no vacationers here - everyone prefers to spend time at sea.  But as soon as the sea becomes cooler, wavy, tourists gradually move to the sunbeds near the pool.  It is great to have such an alternative on site. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Many tourists, especially those who managed to visit different countries, are skeptical of 3 * hotels, not expecting anything special from them.  If you go to Bulgaria by private car or rent a car, you will be pleasantly surprised by the availability of free parking on site. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  All vacationers of the Ljuljak 3 * hotel <span>(Bulgaria, Varna)</span> will be able to use free Wi-Fi, however, not in the room, but in the lobby.  The speed is decent, it is quite enough for communication through social networks. </p>

    <p>  The hotel staff is polite and friendly, the reception is open around the clock.  For all questions you can always contact the friendly staff. </p><p>  At the information desk, tourists and vacationers can get acquainted with a rich excursion program, as well as order a transfer to the airport or train station.  If you believe the reviews of vacationers, it is better to purchase excursions at local travel agencies: they offer interesting and rich programs, affordable prices, as well as insurance for each tourist.  By the way, tourists do not cease to praise the quality of work of local guides, their full dedication and dedication to their favorite business.  The programs are organized in such a way that within one trip tourists visit the most interesting and significant places, they are not taken to souvenir shops and retail outlets, as is the case in most other countries. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Only 7 minutes from the hotel - and you are on a gorgeous sandy beach.  In order to get on it, you need to go down - not the most convenient and safe way.  But he does not bother tourists at all.  The sand is flat, the entry into the water is gentle, the sea is clean and incredibly warm.  If you are interested in what Bulgaria is like in August, don‚Äôt even think about it - feel free to go.  At this time, the temperature is as comfortable as possible. </p>

    <p>  Along the coast there are enough cafes and restaurants where you can always have a bite to eat.  Here, on the beach, you can buy fresh fruits, soft drinks, seafood and ice cream. </p><p>  All outdoor enthusiasts can stroll along the coast and rent equipment for sports and water activities.  In the evening, <span>foamy parties</span> and incendiary discos are held on the beach - so even young people will not be bored here.  Fans of a relaxing and secluded holiday can walk to the left of the hotel: you will come across a calm and secluded cove, surrounded by greenery. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Summing up, I want to say that the hotel Ljuljak 3 * (Bulgaria, Golden Sands) will be an excellent option for a budget holiday.  Reviews of real tourists emphasize that this is a good combination of cost of living and quality of services provided.  The hotel is well located, offers excellent bright and spacious rooms, good service.  Here you can really rent a room with meals - you do not have to spend money in a cafe and restaurant.  In a word, if you are planning a vacation in Bulgaria and chose the Golden Sands resort, pay special attention to this option - it really deserves it. </p>
