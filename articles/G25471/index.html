    <p>  Unfortunately, there is no direct train between these two cities.  You will have to take the connecting route in the city of Kovrov.  The total cost for two tickets will be about 1200 rubles, you can buy them at the local railway station.  The path will not be close, in general it will take more than 17 hours.  But there will be a wonderful opportunity to get acquainted with new places! </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Driving by car </h2><p>  The distance from Ivanovo to Vladimir is about 117 kilometers.  And the whole road is one straight line.  Therefore, it is most reasonable to travel by car.  Less than 10 liters of gasoline will be needed all the way, which will be about 500 rubles.  You can overcome this distance in just an hour and a half. </p><p>  Almost the entire Ivanovo ‚Äì Vladimir highway is new; there should be no problems on the road.  Along its perimeter there are many gas stations, roadside cafes and tire fitting.  However, acceleration is still not worth it, since freight transport is often found along the way. </p><p>  Travelers will pass by one of the most beautiful cities in Russia - Suzdal.  It is famous for ancient temples.  It is mandatory to look into this fabulous corner. </p><h2>  Travel by bus </h2><p>  In the center of Ivanovo and Vladimir there are bus stations.  From these points go both direct and transit buses.  The interval between cities by public transport is easily overcome.  It is worth noting that the first departure is carried out quite early - at 7:00 in the morning, and the last - at 21:00. </p><p>  Total travel time is 1 hour 50 minutes.  A ticket can be bought immediately before boarding for 250 rubles.  Throughout the road, transport makes several stops, which is very convenient, especially for passengers with children. </p>

    <p>  We should also talk about textile tours that are provided by many companies in the city of Vladimir.  Several times a month, collective trips are organized from different points of the city to the largest shopping malls - Rio, Tekstil-Profi or Tekstilshchik.  You can buy such a trip at a bargain price, approximately it will be about 300 rubles in both directions.  However, this tour is not suitable for someone who came to the city of brides not for shopping.  Since it is allotted for shopping all the time, without leaving tourists the opportunity to enjoy the local sights. </p><h2>  Flight by plane </h2><p>  Not far from Vladimir and Ivanovo are airports.  Despite this, there are no direct flights between the two cities.  This is due to the small distance.  If you wish, you can try to overcome the route with transfers on a private flight through the city of St. Petersburg.  But in this way, almost no one uses it.  Firstly, the flight is carried out only several times a month, secondly, it will take you about five hours to spend the whole trip, and thirdly, the whole trip cost will exceed 10 thousand rubles. </p>
