This is a special program implemented by the state.  In the event of an insurance risk event (for example, bankruptcy), the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) will reimburse depositors in the shortest possible time the entire amount they deposit before, and it also creates a list of banks included in the deposit insurance system. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the Russian state CER </h2><p>  The functioning of this structure is carried out in accordance with Federal Law No. 77- of 12.23.03. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of banks included in the deposit insurance system" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32381/1060561.jpg" width="600"></div>  The main task of the entire state system is (in the event of the banking structure ceasing to function) to return to the depositor all his invested money at the expense of a certain source, which is financially completely independent of anyone and nothing.  In addition to this, the depositor does not need to additionally conclude a special deposit insurance contract with the same banking structure.  <span>The list of banks included in the deposit insurance system</span> is made up of all those financial organizations that provide a similar service.

The answer is one: all banks participate exclusively.  No single bank will be able to obtain an appropriate license if it is not a member of the CERs.  As a system of protection of civilian <span>bank deposits</span> in Russia since 2003, there is a system of cash deposit insurance (SSDV).  The purpose of this system is to reimburse civil deposits from a specific financial source if there has been a cessation of activity of any financial organization that is included in the list of banks participating in the <span>mandatory deposit insurance</span> system.  A certain additional financial source is needed - a reserve insurance fund.  He was formed at the insurance Agency.  The basis for the replenishment of the fund (one of some) is provided by the banks of the Russian Federation who wish to work with a civilian. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of banks participating in the deposit insurance system" class="if" height="233" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32381/1060567.jpg" width="310"></div>  And only after making a certain monetary contribution to the reserve fund, banks get the right to be licensed to carry out activities with individuals.  The fund is replenished by banks once a quarter.  The amount of such a contribution is established by the board of directors.  It is the same for all banks, but sometimes it undergoes correction, which, in turn, can be based on the current economic situation, etc.

And the insurance Agency, in turn, has the power to exclude any bank and thus adjust the list of banks included in the deposit insurance system.  Only in two cases can a bank be struck off the list:

    <p>  The main stock characteristic is its independence from any government agencies and banks.  This confirms that his funds cannot be used for other operations, except for the payment of deposit insurance.  An important distinguishing feature of this structure is that its funds do not include penalties for obligations of financial institutions included in the list of banks included in the deposit insurance system and making contributions. </p><h2>  Features of foreign currency deposits </h2><p>  Deposits of Russians in banks in any foreign currency are necessarily insured.  However, you need to know that when an insured event occurs, the amount is reimbursed in the ruble version.  Accordingly, a recalculation is carried out in accordance with the Central Bank exchange rate for the currency that was invested at the time the insurance situation arose.  The amount of insurance compensation is also one hundred percent of the total size of the deposit, but not exceeding 1.4 million rubles.  Interest rates on foreign currency deposits are also taken into account when returning.  The procedure for returning on foreign currency deposits is similar to ruble deposits. </p>
