It should be noted right away that almost 100% of reviews about this hotel complex are not just positive, but even in some cases enthusiastic, which is a rather rare occurrence.  In addition, judging by the comments of tourists, many people come here not the first or even the second time.  Moreover, regular guests are very much appreciated and always presented with some kind of gift (for example, good wine and a basket of fruits).  So the vast majority of guests of this hotel are very pleased with their choice and are ready to come here again, as well as recommend this place to their relatives and friends.  But we will understand everything in detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Impressions of tourists about the location of the hotel </h2><p>  Many guests in their reviews say that the location of Seher Sun Palace Resort Resort 5 * is very good.  So, according to them, the minibus (dolmush) can be reached from the hotel to the old town of Side in just ten minutes.  If you walk, then the walk will take about 45 minutes (the path goes along the promenade that separates the coastline from the hotel strip).  The distance to the beach is about 300 meters.  Moreover, the path runs along a small rivulet, in which fish and turtles live.  Our compatriots note that it was a great pleasure for the children to watch and feed this living creature.  As for the distance from <span>Antalya Airport,</span> tourists spent about 1-1.5 hours on the road from the air harbor. </p><p>  Another great advantage of this hotel is the fact that Sun Palace guests can use the infrastructure of two more hotels of the same Sekher chain located in the neighborhood.  So instead of one water park you get three at once! </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="seher sum palace resort spa 5 standard" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/601304.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Opinion about the hotel itself and its housing stock </h2><p>  Our compatriots found the Seher Sun Palace Resort Spa 5 *, the reviews we are reviewing, modern and stylish.  According to them, fresh repairs have been made here, and the hotel is decorated in pleasant colors.  Also, many liked the large lounge.  For convenience, it is divided into zones, therefore, even when the hotel complex is filled to capacity, there is no feeling of crowds. </p><p>  As for the rooms, they seemed to the guests not just big, but huge.  According to them, there is everything you need for a comfortable stay: slippers, bathrobes, a regularly stocked minibar, safe, hairdryer, modern appliances, a spacious shower room and much more.  Wi-Fi is also available in the rooms, and the connection speed is very high. </p><p>  No complaints from the guests of the Seher Sun Palace Resort Spa <span>5 * (Side)</span> did not arise about the cleaning.  So, they cleaned the apartment every day.  Linen and towels were renewed every two days.  The maids also regularly replenished supplies of bath accessories and filled the minibar. </p><h2>  Reviews of food and hotel staff </h2><p>  As for the food at the San Palace, then, according to travelers, it deserves all praise.  So, the choice of dishes in the main restaurant is very large.  The menu always includes fish, meat, chicken, a variety of salads, snacks, pastries, desserts, fruits.  Also, many in their comments note delicious cakes that are baked during the day at the pool bar and on the beach.  There you can treat yourself to magnificent ice cream.  So, according to Russian travelers, it would be difficult not to get a couple extra pounds for the vacation.  In addition, family tourists note the fact that the restaurant has a children's table (yogurts, soups, cereals, etc.).  You can also always use highchairs. </p><p>  The hotel staff also had an extremely pleasant experience.  According to travelers, all the staff here are very welcoming, pleasant to talk to, attentive and do their job well.
