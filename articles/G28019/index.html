Buksgevden, who arrived from Bremen, agreed with the community elder to build a stone church.  The year before, the pope signed a document according to which only one place was an authorized outlet at the mouth of the Riga River for merchants from Europe.  The history of Riga, its various periods will be described in an essay. </p><h2>  The emergence of the city </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the foundation of Riga falls on 1201.  In the first few decades, it developed quite quickly.  Subsequently, the city became the most important in Livonia. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.9496487" data-lng="24.105186499999945" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/4/7/0/17470.png"></div><p>  The Dome Cathedral, which is a landmark of the city and is currently founded 10 years after the founding of Riga, in 1211. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveexploring.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landscapes of Riga" class="if uuid-3218754" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218754.jpg"></div><p>  Bishop Albert Buxgewden, wanting to attract an even greater number of immigrants from Germany, obtained from the pope a special bull which gave indulgence to the colonists.  Already in 1225, the post of Vogt of the city appeared in Riga, which was elected.  He was vested with judicial, administrative and fiscal authority. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1257, the residence of the archbishops of Riga lands was transferred to the city, and trade was becoming increasingly important.  In 1282, Riga joins the Hanseatic League (Hanseatic League).  It was a large economic and political union, consisting of trading cities in the north-west of Europe.  It included 130 cities, and under its influence there were about 3 thousand settlements. </p><h2>  Warband </h2><p>  The history of Riga is closely connected with the Teutonic Order.  During the expansion of German influence to the east, Riga bishops encouraged the settlement of their lands.  At the same time, the Teutonic Order provided special support to military immigrants.  It was an independent rather powerful church organization with military chivalry support.  After the Teutonic (German) order was expelled from Palestine, it began to strengthen in Eastern Europe, mainly in Livonia and Prussia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="estonianexperience.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://estonianexperience.com/tour/rundale-day-trip-riga-highlights/"><img itemprop="image" alt="Old Riga" class="if uuid-3218750" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218750.jpg"></div><p>  Over time, the order began to compete with Riga archbishops for influence throughout the region.  It was decided to create an entire Livonian branch, which was headed by a landmaster, subordinate only to the great master of the Teutonic Order. </p><p>  As expected, this led to numerous conflicts with the Riga bishops, which were decided during the fighting and with the intervention of the Pope.  As a result, after the defeat at Neuer√ºm√ºlen in 1492, the Teutonic Order was recognized as protector of Livonia by the Archbishop of Riga. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Reformation </h2><p>  In the history of Riga in 1522, a key turning point occurs; it joins the Reformation movement.  After that, the authority of the archbishops significantly weakened, the last of them was Wilhelm of Brandenburg. </p><p>  After the outbreak of the Livonian War in 1558, Riga began to seek special status as a free city of the Holy Roman Empire, refusing to join the Commonwealth.  In 1561, this status was obtained, and Riga was a free city-state until 1582.  However, after the next Russian offensive, it became clear that there was nowhere to get help, and Riga had to swear allegiance to the King of the Commonwealth, Stefan Batory. </p><h2>  The period from the 16th to the 17th century </h2><p>  Riga as part of the Commonwealth was from 1581 to 1621.  At that time, the latter was a rather strong state.  It was a federation, which included the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.  Almost immediately, a protest movement of Riga against this union arose.  It appeared due to acute political, economic, social, ethnic and religious contradictions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wsg2017.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://wsg2017.com/riga/"><img itemprop="image" alt="City on Riga river" class="if uuid-3218774" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218774.jpg"></div><p>  After the counter-reformation, the so-called calendar riots broke out.  They appeared due to the decree of <span>Stephen Batory</span> on the introduction of the Gregorian calendar and the restoration of the former privileges of the Catholic Jesuit Order, which was banned after the Reformation.  The calendar was proposed by Pope Gregory XIII, which was received hostile by Riga Protestant Germans. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Swedish conquest </h2><p>  The main dates of the city of Riga can also be attributed to 1622, when it was conquered by the King of Sweden, Gustav 2 Adolf.  The city was a strategically important site for the observance of the interests of Sweden.  It should be noted that he was the second most important after Stockholm. </p><p>  During the war between the Russian Empire and Sweden in 1656-1658, Riga was under siege, but until the 18th century it was under Swedish influence.  During this period, the city had a fairly wide self-government.  However, in 1710, during the Northern War, another siege began, prolonged, which led to the fall of Swedish rule. </p><h2>  The city in the 18-19 centuries </h2><p>  Riga has been a part of the Russian Empire since 1721, immediately after the Nishtadt Peace was concluded.  After its signing, the Russian-Swedish border was significantly changed, and the city became one of the key in the empire in the Baltic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kinggoya.no" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="View overlooking the town" class="if uuid-3218779" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218779.jpg"></div><p>  The city becomes the main city in the newly formed Riga province, from 1783 to 1796 it was the center of Riga governorship, and from 1796 to 1918 - the Livonia province.  By the end of the 19th century, Riga became one of the important ports of the empire, and from 1850 to 1900, the population of the city increased 10 times. </p><p>  Despite the citizenship of Russia, the Riga culture, factories and large land holdings until the end of the 19th century remained in the sphere of influence of the German upper class.  It should be noted that the Russian language received official status and began to be used in office work only in 1891. </p><h2>  The beginning of the 20th century </h2><p>  The city developed at a rapid pace, but its development was stopped along with the outbreak of the First World War.  Riga was located on the front line.  In this regard, to ensure the military economy, more than 200 thousand residents (workers with families) had to be evacuated to Central Russia along with factories.  Already in September 1917, Riga was captured by the German army. </p><p>  After the war ended in November 1918, the independent Republic of Latvia was proclaimed in the city, which was occupied by German troops.  Throughout 1919, as in the capital of the state, as many as 3 different Latvian governments were located in it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="harboursreview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Port of Riga" class="if uuid-3218797" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218797.jpg"></div><p>  At first it was the leadership of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic.  Then, after his overthrow, the country was ruled by a cabinet led by nationalist prime minister A. Niedra.  In mid-1919, parliamentary power was restored under the leadership of K. Ulmanis. </p><p>  After the signing of the Soviet-Polish peace treaty in 1921, the population of Riga was divided into several communities: German, Latvian, Jewish and Russian.  By 1938, the population numbered 385,000, of which 45,000 were of German descent. </p><h2>  Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic </h2><p>  In 1940, after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Baltic states were recognized by the Soviet Republic.  Thus, the USSR, as the assignee of the Russian Empire, restored its previously lost territories. </p><p>  However, after the outbreak of World War II and the occupation of Soviet territories by fascist Germany from 1941 to 1944, the General Reich Commissariat of Ostland was located in Riga. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.comtourist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Academy of Sciences of the Latvian SSR" class="if uuid-3218792" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218792.jpg"></div><p>  After being liberated from German troops, Latvia again became part of the USSR.  During the battles for Riga, the city was significantly damaged.  Gradually, its restoration and reconstruction began.  Subsequently, Riga was not only recreated, but its industrial and agricultural development took place.  In the period from 70 to 80 years, machine-building, radio-electronic and electrical industries were created. </p><p>  Sea ports were expanded, the share of cargo transportation increased several times.  The city was built and expanded, and products manufactured in the republic were exported to more than 100 countries of the world.  However, in 1991, after the destruction of the Soviet Union, Latvia on the map as one of its republics ceased to exist. </p><h2>  Independent state </h2><p>  After gaining independence, Riga began its independent development.  In 2004, Latvia was admitted to the NATO North Atlantic Military Alliance, and then to the European Union.  Currently it is a unitary state with a capital in Riga. </p><p>  A large number of buildings dating back to the Middle Ages have been preserved in the capital.  These include the famous Dome Cathedral - this is the Catholic Church, which was built in 1277. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveexploring.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Building architecture" class="if uuid-3218759" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/71228/3218759.jpg"></div><p>  Looking at the map of Latvia, you can see that it is a small country, but it has a rich history and architecture.  Especially Riga, which with its extraordinary beauty attracts thousands of tourists from European countries in the summer. </p><p>  This city is unlike any other, it organically combines the ancient architecture of castles and modern buildings built using the latest technology.  Of course, Riga is the object that you must visit if you decide to see real Europe. </p>
