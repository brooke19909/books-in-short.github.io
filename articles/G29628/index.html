    <p>  Previously, it was always one of the central ones, and a monument to the leader was necessarily erected on it, in honor of which, in fact, the geographical object itself was called.  Shops, cafes and restaurants located in the neighborhood have always been considered one of the most respectable, and the metro station, if available, turned into a real architectural monument. </p><h2>  General Description of Ploshchad Lenina Metro Station in St. Petersburg </h2><p>  Not everyone knows that it was originally planned to name this transport junction differently - ‚ÄúFinland Station‚Äù, since it is located in close proximity to the Finland Railway Station.  One of the walls in the box office is decorated with a thematic panel depicting V.I. Lenin, speaking to workers and soldiers in April 1917.  Trains from north-east and north-west depart from the <span>Finland Station in</span> St. Petersburg.  In order to go to Helsinki from St. Petersburg, you also need to arrive at this station. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Lenin Square" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/324571.jpg" width="451"></div>

The round lobby, decorated with a wall of corrugated glass, is precisely such a design solution that was realized when creating this exit.  The escalators with which both directions are equipped were once the highest in the world at that time: the lifting height is 65.8 m, the number of steps is 755, the length of the inclined part is 131.6 m.

    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The metro station Lenin Square was commissioned in 1958.  It is located on the Kirov-Vyborg line. </p><p>  This transport hub, however, like the square itself, received its name in connection with the well-known historical events that took place in Petrograd in June 1917. </p><p>  By its type, the metro is a deep-laid pylon object (the station is located at a depth of 71 m - the St. Petersburg metro is one of the deepest in the level of station occurrence).  At the Lenin Square station, there are three halls separated by rows of pylons.  Such stations were built in those cases when it was necessary to avoid the destructive effect of rock pressure.  Between the pylons there are narrow passages that limit the throughput of the flow of people at the station. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Architectural features </h2><p>  The time of the creation of the Ploshchad Lenina station and its environs was characterized by a struggle with architectural excesses.  Today, of course, it may seem that her appearance is not expressive enough.  Underground halls are visually perceived as equal in width.  Eaves lighting at a height of about 2 m after replacing the <span>mercury lamps</span> with sodium allowed to increase the level of illumination.  The aisles between the pylons are lit with white lamps, and the halls of the station are lit with yellow.  The walls are tiled (black at the bottom and white at the top).  Granite was used for the floor covering of the aprons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Lenin Square" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/324584.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Station "Ploshchad Lenina" for a long time connected the railway stations of the city.  To complete this task, it took more than 10 years, and for the first time such a need arose even before the war.  Another feature of the object under consideration is the fact that the stage connecting it to the Chernyshevskaya station was the first one laid under the Neva.  During the construction of this tunnel, an <span>overpressure</span> casing was used to counteract water leakage under the riverbed. </p>
