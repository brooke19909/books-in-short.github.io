This decor can be done with your own hands.  The easiest option will be a wooden board with a pattern that is applied to the surface in accordance with a specific technique.  To make a product correctly and beautifully, you need to know exactly how to transfer a picture to a tree in several ways. </p><h2>  How can I decorate a tree by drawing? </h2><p>  There are several techniques in which a pattern can be projected onto a wooden surface.  In each situation, it is worth knowing exactly how to transfer the drawing to the tree: </p><ul><li>  Burning using a special device.  The picture is clear and embossed.  The contours are noticeably limited, you can create the effect of a shadow or shadow transition. </li><li>  Decoupage is the most popular and simple technique for creating a picture.  As a result, the image can turn out in color or black and white, the picture can be of any complexity. </li><li>  For woodcarving, you need a sketch that is projected onto the surface in several ways: using a carbon copy, redrawing, embossing using sharp tools. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="translation of the drawing on a ready basis" class="if uuid-2641033" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2641033.jpg"></div><p>  You can partially combine several techniques in one work.  This is possible provided that the person has an artistic talent that will help to abstractly present the result of the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Preparation of a wooden surface </h2><p>  Before you transfer the drawing to a tree at home, it is worth preparing the surface correctly.  Both the process of work and the result depend on the quality of the wooden base.  The service life is also directly determined by the quality of preparation of the tree. </p><div class="photo" data-original="trendhunters.nl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sketch for blank" class="if uuid-2641052" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2641052.jpg"></div><p>  Preparation of a wooden surface: </p><ol><li>  Choose the right tree.  It is best to work with pressed sheets of plywood, chipboard and other analogs, but natural material is quite suitable. </li><li>  Decide on the parameters and shape of the wooden base.  Immediately get rid of excess parts, polish the edges. </li><li>  The surface itself should be smooth and even.  To do this, use a grinder, and treat hard-to-reach spots with sandpaper or a file. </li><li>  Only then is a sketch of the image itself prepared for transfer. </li></ol><p>  Thus, preparation consists of three simple steps that even a child can do. </p><h2>  Wood <span>burning pattern</span> </h2><p>  For the burning procedure to be carried out quickly and efficiently, it is necessary that the pattern on the surface of the tree is as accurate and high-quality as possible.  To transfer the image to the surface using several methods.  Carriage by carbon copy remains the most popular option. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="woodcarving pattern transfer" class="if uuid-2641045" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2641045.jpg"></div><p>  How to transfer a picture to a tree for burning with a carbon paper: </p><ol><li>  You need to take a carbon sheet.  It is advisable to use paper that has been used more than once. </li><li>  Place the carbon copy with the print side to a wooden surface.  Put a sheet with a picture on top and fix the structure with tape or electrical tape. </li><li>  Use a pencil to draw a line around the image.  You need to work carefully, limiting the interaction of hands with paper as much as possible. </li><li>  After finishing the line stroke, peel off the paper layers.  The figure for burning is ready. </li></ol><p>  This method is very reliable, but requires special accuracy in execution.  During the translation process, traces of carbon paper may remain, which are almost impossible to clean from the surface of the tree. </p><h2>  Carbonless drawing </h2><p>  In order to learn how to transfer a picture to a tree without a carbon copy, you can use several methods.  Each differs in a set of tools and materials, but is simple in the sense of embodiment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.hogarmania.com" data-author=": Bricoman√≠a, "><img itemprop="image" alt="white spirit translation" class="if uuid-2640996" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2640996.jpg"></div><p>  Image transfer methods: </p><ol><li>  Graphite impression.  Take a simple pencil with a soft rod and draw around the outline of the drawing on paper.  Rotate the image to the wooden base and quickly squeeze without shifting.  In order for graphite to print qualitatively, it is possible to draw on paper with a hard roller or a plastic strip. </li><li>  Thermal transfer.  First you need to pick up the image made on the correct device.  A thermal copy is used to print a photocopy or printout made on a powder printer.  Attach the back to the wooden base and warm the paper with an iron. </li><li>  Reprint using white spirit.  The image must be printed on a laser printer or copier.  Attach a sheet with a drawing to a tree and wipe it with white spirit.  On a cotton pad, it is worth applying a little means so that the paper does not get wet. </li></ol><p>  There are other options, but the principle of embodiment is much more complicated and requires more time and money. </p><h2>  Preparing wood for carving </h2><p>  To form an image on a board or plywood, you need to know just a few basic rules.  If the work is done incorrectly, the threading process can be much more complicated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="livelovecraft.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="option to translate the image on a wooden base" class="if uuid-2641007" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2641007.jpg"></div><p>  How to transfer a drawing to a tree for carving in order to comply with all the rules: </p><ol><li>  Apply a grid to the surface of the transparent paper.  The size of the cell will depend on the required size of the pattern. </li><li>  If you want to create an ornament, then apply a part of the image to the tracing paper and fold the sheet in half.  Circle the pencil on the second half of the tracing paper. </li><li>  Symmetry of the pattern can be given by using a carbon paper. </li></ol><p>  The method of transferring an ornament or image can be used from the above options.  The main thing is to lay a sheet with an applied ornament so that the direction of the pattern coincides with the arrangement of the fibers. </p><h2>  Decoupage technique - simple image transfer option </h2><p>  Often requires not only the manufacture of interesting decorations for the interior with the image on the tree, but also a more practical application of technology.  Knowing how to transfer a drawing to a tree, you can restore old furniture, make a wooden element design. </p><p>  To implement such ideas use the decoupage technique.  The principle of such work is simple and does not require special skills, the presence of unusual materials or tools. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Decoupage on furniture surface" class="if uuid-2640985" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/2640985.jpg"></div><p>  How to transfer a picture to a tree using PVA glue using the simplest algorithm: </p><ol><li>  The prepared surface must be coated with PVA glue.  The layer should not be too thick.  Brush strokes need to be made equal and uniform. </li><li>  Lay the drawing on the surface of the tree and gently spread the paper web.  It is necessary to expel air and arrange the edges of the cellulose base. </li><li>  Once again, smear the image with a thin layer of PVA.  Wait until everything dries and duplicate the layer again. </li></ol><p>  Further processing is selected in accordance with the preferences of the "creator". </p><h2>  Additional finish </h2><p>  After you have transferred the drawing to a tree and performed a secondary surface treatment, it is worth considering options for further surface treatment. </p><p>  There are several options: </p><ol><li>  To varnish. </li><li>  To paint. </li><li>  Primer. </li><li>  Leave the product untreated. </li><li>  Laminate. </li></ol><p>  Additional decoration includes the manufacture of coasters, frames, pendants for the finished product.  Here you can show your imagination and skills. </p>
