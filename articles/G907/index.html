Tourists also highlight the special coziness and comfort prevailing in the hotel.  According to guests who visited the Union 4 * hotel, you feel at home here.  There is no discomfort or desire to leave here faster.  Another significant advantage of the hotel is the fact that it has the opportunity to accommodate guests who have arrived with the whole family.  If the need arises, staff will provide an extra bed for the child.  Great is the ability to independently control the temperature in the room, since each has air conditioning.

Chefs make every effort to prepare dishes that will appeal to even the most sophisticated gourmets.  True, as mentioned above, there is no separate baby food, but the menu has many dishes that are allowed for use by kids. </p><p>  Many guests like the fact that the Hotel Union offers a wake-up service.

Tourists who have been here recommend the Union to their friends and acquaintances. </p>
