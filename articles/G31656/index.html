    <p>  After much deliberation and discussion, several candidates were put forward, including Vladislav, the heir to the Polish throne, Karl-Philip, the Swedish prince, and Mikhail Fedorovich, the representative of the Romanovs.  <span>The Zemsky Sobor</span> decided that a foreigner should not rule the country, and made a choice in favor of Romanov, sending messengers to him with an invitation, so the accession of the Romanov dynasty happened.  The year the beginning of the reign of the new king was a turning point for the state.  Immediately after the wedding to the kingdom, held in 1613, <span>Mikhail Fedorovich</span> actively took up government affairs. </p><p>  The reign of <span>Mikhail Romanov was</span> marked by positive changes within the state.  The tsar devoted a lot of time to foreign policy, strengthening the authority of the state abroad. </p>

The king‚Äôs father was the monk Filaret.  The events taking place, along with the election of Michael to reign, found him in Poland, where he was a prisoner.  Upon returning to his homeland, Filaret received the rank of patriarch and began to actively intervene in resolving state issues, in fact, having full power.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The accession of the Romanov dynasty led to the activation of the state‚Äôs foreign policy.  This direction has become a priority.  Since 1616, negotiations have been ongoing with Sweden and Poland, ending with the signing of peace between the countries.  Under the terms of the treaties, vast Novgorod lands were withdrawn to Russia and Polish troops were withdrawn.  The Nagai Horde began to pose an increasing threat to the southeastern borders of the state.  Despite the peace concluded, the nagays attacked the frontier lands continually, robbing and devastating them.  The tsar intended to unite all Russian lands under his own hand, having won the Belarusian, West Russian and Ukrainian lands from the Poles.  The beginning of action was an attempt to take Smolensk, undertaken in 1632. </p>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the war was lost, Poland was nevertheless forced to abandon thoughts of the accession of her prince to the Russian throne.  Michael tried to achieve recognition of the state.  To this end, several attempts were made to conclude a dynastic marriage with the royal families of European countries.  They were unsuccessful. </p><p>  The accession of the Romanov dynasty to the Russian throne was the beginning of the restoration of the state‚Äôs economy.  Devastated during the years of interventions and monastic arbitrariness of the city and village began to revive. </p><p>  As a token of gratitude, Mikhail assigned a decree to the noble families of their land.  Since then, they were inherited along with the villages and were considered the property of a noble family. </p><p>  Spontaneous riots erupting throughout the country were brutally suppressed.  The search period for peasants who escaped from bondage has increased. </p><p>  In order to protect the state from invasions, Mikhail tried to create an army like a regular army.  The ranks of officers were received by representatives of the aristocracy, they also underwent military training.  Dragoons as a unit of cavalry appeared at the end of the reign.  Their main task was the protection of <span>state borders.</span> </p>
