The streets are no longer overrun by tourists, most of the hotels are closed, the air is getting cool, summer merchants are dispersing.  But if your vacation fell precisely during this period, you should not be upset, because it is at the end of autumn that you can consider this country and find out what it really is. </p><h2>  Weather </h2><p>  The weather in Turkey in November is still warm, but not hot.  By this time, the beach season is ending.  Rainy days at the beginning of the month are rare.  The first week usually remains warm, but by mid-November the sky is increasingly obsessed with gray clouds, sometimes it rains.  Toward the end of the month, more and more precipitation occurs.  It can average 9 rainy days.  The weather in Turkey in November drives away the beaches of belated resort tourists.  But if you came to rest in this autumn time, do not forget about warm sweaters, which are especially useful in the evening. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Turkey in November" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25517/1001737.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Air temperature </h2><p>  The most welcoming region in this period is Side and Alanya.  On the most successful days, thermometers show 26 degrees.  Water also keeps warm + 23 <sup>0</sup> , but it is worth considering that every day it cools.  <span>The temperature in Turkey</span> in November allows some tourists to swim in the sea, but only if the day is sunny.  The coolest resort place is in Kemer, but here you can relax quite well if you focus on wellness walks.  It is important to note that the temperature in Turkey in November at night can drop to 10 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Late Autumn Tickets </h2>

At this time, air tickets are sold at the lowest price, since few people want to fly to Turkey at the end of November.  However, this can be difficult if you live in a small town.  The fact is that it is quite difficult to find charter flights during this period, because they are canceled.  It is necessary to reserve seats for several weeks on a regular flight.  But such planes are sent only from large cities.  Upon arrival in Turkey, you will have to get to the hotel on your own, because group transfers in November can not be met.

    <h2>  How to dress </h2><p>  Since Turkey has an unstable temperature in November (warm in the afternoon, cool in the evening), you need to think through your wardrobe.  Winds blow from the sea, therefore you should be protected from coolness and drafts.  But at the same time too hot things will cause discomfort, because the sun continues to warm.  Well, if it will be pullovers, jackets, jackets.  Please note that shoes should be suitable for long walks, because you will no longer have the opportunity to spend a lot of time on the beach. </p><h2>  Things to do </h2>

Many say that Turkey in November reminds them of May.  At this time, you can feel the culture of the country, calmly strolling along its streets.  Having devoted the time to a regular city tour, you will definitely notice the way of the local population, which is very different from sluggish tourists in the summer.

Even if you do not have to swim in the sea, there is still the opportunity to get a gentle tan.  You can also enjoy swimming in the pool with warm water.  So, enjoying water procedures and the sun, you can feel how beautiful Turkey is in November. </p><p>  Prices in this period of tourists can only please, because the season is already closed, and things are still there, so massive sales and discounts begin.

    <p>  You can enjoy the rest if you go on excursions and visit the sights.  Turkey is full of historical places.  Be sure to see the ruins left over from the Temple of the famous Artemis.  A visit to the ancient <span>city ‚Äã‚Äãof Ephesus</span> will broaden your horizons and completely immerse yourself in that exciting period.  Holidays in Turkey in November will not be boring if you go on a tour of mosques, fortresses and ancient churches. </p><p>  It is also worth taking time to visit the national parks of the country.  They include protected natural areas and cultural and historical values. </p><h2>  Istanbul Attractions </h2><p>  Turkey in November does not seem boring, if you set aside a couple of days in order to explore the main <span>attractions of Istanbul.</span>  These include: </p><ol><li>  Topkapi Palace.  This impressive place clearly shows what architecture was like during the Ottoman Empire.  There is also a place where clothes, weapons, Ottoman treasures and much more are stored. </li><li>  Saint Sophie Cathedral.  The construction of the cathedral was completed in 537.  For many centuries, its dome remained the largest.  In 1453, a mosque was made from the cathedral.  Today this impressive building can be visited as a museum. </li><li>  <span>Galata Tower.</span>  Climbing this stone tower, which was built during the Middle Ages, you can see the panorama of the city of Istanbul. </li><li>  Istiklal Street.  This street is the most famous in Istanbul, so it‚Äôs worth it to take a walk along it and go to Sampiyon Kokorec to taste a delicious Kokorech sandwich. </li></ol>

    <p>  Of course, in Turkey there are many more things that you can entertain yourself and make your vacation the most impressive of all.  For example, try the famous chestnuts, and generally get acquainted with the local cuisine, visit the Turkish bathhouse, ride the "nostalgia" tram and much more. </p><h2>  Reviews of November tourists </h2><p>  Those who used to visit these places in late autumn have different opinions.  Some are sure that Turkey in November is one of the best adventures, others were disappointed.  But, in order not to waste your vacation in vain, you need to decide in advance what you expect from this trip.  If you want sea, sun and sand, go to Egypt, if you like to walk, roam and explore colorful places, choose Turkey, because this country has something to see.  Those who rode precisely for this purpose claim that one week was not enough for them. </p>
