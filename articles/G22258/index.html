    <h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The luxury tax did not appear out of nowhere.  On the contrary, it arose with specific intentions and a very long time ago.  Since ancient times, the state has put in place one very effective way to replenish its own treasury.  That was the luxury tax.  A certain amount that wealthy people are obliged to (!) Pay to the state that they are ... rich.  And everyone was obligated to this.  People who owned luxurious estates, expensive carriages, thoroughbred dogs ... they had to send a certain sum of money to state rulers every year.  She allegedly left to maintain the life of the family of monarchs at a decent level.  History says that it is England that is the founder of this law. </p><p>  In Russia, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing a luxury tax appeared in 2012.  But only no one could concretize what exactly is needed for the ‚Äúequation" of the rich.  Often it turns out that this idea, in fact, to realize is unrealistic.  But then, nevertheless, the law was approved.  And now wealthy people have to become less wealthy - due to the fact that they can afford a lot.  That‚Äôs the irony. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúGood‚Äù news for motorists </h2><p>  Luxury cars received a tax immediately.  The year before last, in 2014, 187 different models were on the list of such machines.  All are luxury.  But in the past, 2015, the list has become much larger.  The number has increased to an indicator of 279 models!  But this growth is due to the changed ruble exchange rate. </p><p>  The amount ‚Äúfor wealth‚Äù should be paid by those people who spent more than three million rubles on their car.  Last year, the cost of cars has increased very significantly.  Many dealers did not hesitate to increase prices by about a third!  Imagine the corresponding situation.  A person who purchased one or another model for, say, 2,500,000 rubles in 2014, the next year, 2015, would already be subject to a luxury tax.  The list would be replenished with this model, since, given the price that had grown by 30 percent, it would already cost not 3.2 million rubles, but 3.25 million. </p>

    <h2>  Odds and calculation </h2><p>  So, before listing the list of cars (luxury tax, as you could already understand, affected many models), you need to tell something about how the amount is calculated and, in principle, what kind of process it is. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In order for the law to be executed in accordance with all the rules, a clear classification was developed.  She progressively increases the tax.  Less age and more car value - higher tax. </p><p>  The minimum bar was the mark of three million rubles.  From 3 to 5, to be precise.  People who bought a car for this amount in the year when they introduced the tax, began to pay a transport tax increased by one and a half times.  The lucky ones who became owners of this model a year earlier were more fortunate.  Their tax increased only 1.3 times.  Owners of the same car with a 3-year experience (that is, the car was purchased the year before last) were completely lucky.  The amount of tax for them increased by only 10 percent.  And those cars, whose age is more than three years (and if they cost less than 5 million rubles), have ceased to be considered a luxury. </p><p>  So, the first bar is from 3 to 5 million rubles.  The second is higher, from five to ten million.  And in the first five years, cars worth that kind of money will be taxed 2 times.  But the most expensive category are models, for which the owner gave more than 10 million rubles.  Their age can be 10 years or less.  In this case, the transport tax increases three times. </p>

    <h2>  Good example </h2><p>  Now you can actually show what constitutes a tax on luxury.  Cars that are included in the tax list are diverse.  So, for example, a person buys a <span>Bentley Arnage,</span> deciding to be more original than the others, acquiring all sorts of Toyota Camry.  Will this machine be in the so-called ‚Äúrisk zone‚Äù?  After all, when this car was new, huge money was given for it.  But everything is simple here.  This car is not on the list, because, firstly, it is old, and secondly it does not cost as much as it was necessary to give for it earlier. </p><h2>  Cost in rubles </h2><p>  So, it became clear <span>what a</span> luxury <span>tax is</span> .  The calculation is also clear.  And now I would like to talk about how much this will all be in rubles.  Because specific numbers always put everything in its place. </p><p>  Take, for example, Audi with a 3-liter 245-horsepower engine under the hood.  It has a rather modest price, so the <span>road tax</span> will be 18,375 rubles - and this is without various kinds of additives.  And if you buy also Audi, but with a 4.2-liter unit for 340 ‚Äúhorses‚Äù?  Then you have to fork out.  Firstly, the maximum rate for ‚Äúhorses‚Äù is added.  Secondly, the total amount increases by one and a half times.  Because of the very tax for the rich.  So the 50-odd thousand rubles that will need to be paid turn into as much as 76,500 rubles.  Thus, the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù car owner on top reports another 25.5 thousand.  Because this Audi is on the list of cars. </p><p>  The luxury tax also awaits those people who bought the BMW 535d xDrive.  Although no, it is better to cite the Bavarian X5M as an example.  This car, which boasts a 575-horsepower engine, will cost its owner almost 130 thousand rubles a year, along with all the premiums. </p><p>  For the elite Mercedes-Maybach S400 (S-class - exclusive!) You will have to pay almost 100 thousand rubles.  The V6 engine is under the hood, plus the price is appropriate. </p>

    <h2>  ‚ÄúBudget luxury‚Äù models </h2><p>  Now you can list the list of cars.  The luxury tax depends on various criteria, and all of them have been listed above.  So, out of almost 300 cars for which ‚Äúthe rich have to pay,‚Äù 166 models are included in the relatively budget category (that is, those that cost from 3 to 5 million rubles).  Of these, 24 are Audi (there are both diesel and gasoline versions), mostly all quattro;  30 BMW cars (coupes, sedans, Gran Turismo and even convertibles);  one ‚ÄúCadillac‚Äù (naturally, this is the Escalade spanlatinum model).  Four Chevrolet, two Hyundai, three Infinity and as many as 19 Jaguars - these cars are also on the list.  22 Land Rover cars, two Lexus cars, one Maseratti and one Grand Cherokee SRT8‚Ä¶ 23 Mercedes, Porsches, and Volkswagen are about the same amount.  In general, there are a lot of cars on the list.  And for all you need to pay a luxury tax.  Cars, the calculation of which is done on an individual basis, of course, and so are expensive, and there are also additional costs.  The good news is that you pay the entire amount right away, and forget it until the next year. </p>

    <h2>  The most ‚Äúluxurious‚Äù cars </h2><p>  The list of cars is endless.  Almost three hundred models cannot be listed.  One thing can be said - the category from 5 to 10 million rubles also included Audi, Mercedes, Aston Martina, Bentley, BMW, Maseratti, Land Rovers, Porsches, Jaguars ‚ÄùAnd one‚Äú Lexus ‚Äù. </p><p>  In the list of 10 to 15 million, the same brands are observed, but different models.  Plus, one more was added each from ‚ÄúFerrari‚Äù, ‚ÄúRolls-Royce‚Äù and ‚ÄúLamborghini‚Äù. </p><p>  The last, most expensive category included Aston Martin, Bentley, Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamorghini, Rolls-Royce, and Mercedes G 65 AMG models.  Not to go far, the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, which boasts a 1,200-horsepower engine, is a prime example of a fabulous tax.  540 thousand rubles - this is its price. </p>
