Wife of Prince Yusupov Felix Feliksovich</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Belonging to the most influential and wealthy family, Felix Yusupov was a very shocking person.  Loving to dress as a woman and dizzy with young officers, involved in the murder of Rasputin, he was known for centuries as the dark personality of Russian history.  On the other hand, as on the scales, his good deeds are balanced: the creation of a fashion house in Paris, patronage and assistance to emigrants from Russia in France.  How did Yusupov get along with demonic vices and good deeds? </p><h2>  Prince's parents </h2><p>  The parents of the imperial dandy were Zinaida Nikolaevna Yusupova and Count Sumarokov-Elston.  Mother was an enviable bride, the owner of a colossal fortune.  Not only eminent bachelors of the Russian Empire fought for her hand, but also aristocrats of Europe.  Felix Yusupov recalled her as a beautiful, fragile and very smart creature. </p><p>  Zinaida Nikolaevna was not ambitious, therefore, she married not by calculation (and she could even claim a royal throne), but by love.  Officer Felix Sumarokov-Elston became the chosen one.  With the high position of his wife, he easily managed to make a career.  Moreover, Felix the father was presented with the emperor's princely title, he was also allowed to be called the name of his wife. </p><p>  The marriage of such dissimilar people, a refined princess and an officer, was happy, but not easy.  Two children were born: Nikolai, Sr., and Felix.  In 1908, the 25-year-old heir tragically dies during a duel, and Felix Yusupov becomes the successor to this tremendous fortune.  His biography will be described below. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Childhood is the time when a personality is formed, the formation of character takes place.  Yusupov Felix Feliksovich was born in 1887, March 23. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Irina and Felix Yusupov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/959788.jpg" width="383"></div>  His youthful years passed in luxury and festivities.  A favorite of his mother, he was very beautiful: the correct, as if turned features of a face in which aristocracy was traced.  Zinaida Ivanovna passionately wanted a girl, so Felix dressed exclusively in girlish clothes.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Apparently, from a distant childhood the boy remained this habit.  Already a five-year-old child, Yusupov demonstrates his love for dressing in women's dresses.  Not the soldiers and games with the boys, but his mother‚Äôs wardrobe - this is his favorite pastime.  Together with his brother Nikolai, they dress up as women and attend taverns, gatherings of women of easy virtue.  Felix even performs in a cabaret: he sings one of the parts. </p><p>  This occupation infuriates the father, the boy constantly gets slaps.  Felix Feliksovich wanted to see the son of the successor of his military affairs, and women's things on the boy did not fit into this idea.  The relationship of the two Felixes was always distant. </p><p>  The hobby continued until the death of Nicholas, brother of Felix. </p><h2>  The period of life in the Russian Empire </h2><p>  In Russia, the young prince Felix Yusupov was known as an eccentric young man, a rebel.  He loved the ridiculous antics that were extremely surprising to the public.  They talk about him, gossip, give birth to fables.  We should not forget that the society of that time was not so accustomed to shocking as modern, so the shocking actions of young Yusupov stunned many. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="felix yusupov photo" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/959787.jpg" width="363"></div>

    <p>  As for Yusupov, a student, he was not a diligent student.  However, he had an amazing mind and ability to synthesize the necessary information. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At first he studied at a private gymnasium, then he continued to receive education at Oxford University.  There, he united Russian-speaking students into society, and also created a car club. </p><p>  Yusupov had a special relationship with his mother's friend, Grand Duchess Elizabeth.  Empress she was a sister.  Felix considered the woman a saint, her advice, parting words, good attitude helped the young man survive the tragic death of his brother.  In 1914, Yusupov married the representative of the Romanov house, Irina, and thus related to the imperial family. </p><p>  The First World catches the young Yusupovs in Germany.  Having hardly returned to St. Petersburg, Felix begins to help in the treatment of patients at the hospital.  In 1915, the Yusupovs had a daughter, Irina. </p><h2>  The assassination of Rasputin: prerequisites </h2><p>  Zinaida, Yusupov Felix Feliksovich and even Grand Duchess Catherine saw that they suffer because of <span>Grigory Rasputin, who</span> became close to the imperial family, because the attention of the monarchs is riveted only to this dark person. </p><p>  Indeed, Gregory began to occupy a high position at the court of the emperor.  Savior of the heir, he was revered by the Empress as a saint.  All attempts to appeal to common sense were unsuccessful: the empress was adamant, considered everything to be slander.  And the emperor was forced to agree with everything, because in the hands of the old man was the life of a blood heir.  Thus, the plan to kill the objectionable "saint" began to be thought out. </p><h2>  Conspiracy to kill </h2><p>  Involvement in the murder of Felix was the most direct.  However, until the end of his life he will recall this as a nightmare.  Yusupov‚Äôs close friends took part in the plot: MP Purishkevich, Dmitry Pavlovich, a native of the royal family, was also brought in by British intelligence resident O. Reiner. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  To implement the plan, it was necessary to get closer to Gregory.  This role was assigned to Felix.  He asks Rasputin to get rid of the vice, to help. </p><p>  On December 17, 1916, Rasputin was invited to the Yusupovs family mansion, supposedly to meet Irina, Felix‚Äôs wife (she was in Crimea at that time).  There they try to poison him first, and then fatal shots sound. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="yusupov felix feliksovich" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/959792.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This crime hides many mysteries, but one thing is obvious: Felix himself believed that this frees his beloved country from obscurantism.  Indeed, the citizens of the empire breathed a sigh of relief upon learning of the death of Gregory. </p><p>  Suspect Felix Yusupov refers to Rakitino, the estate of his father. </p><h2>  Emigration: Life in London </h2><p>  The family successfully survives the revolution, but emigrates to Europe.  Their path ran first to the Crimea, then to Malta.  Then Prince Felix Yusupov with his family goes to the UK, and his parents go to the capital of Italy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="felix yusupov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/959791.jpg" width="390"></div>  Until recently, they all hoped that they would see their native land, but this was not destined to come true.

    <p>  In London, Felix helps arriving refugee nobles.  The family does not live in luxury, as in their homeland, because they left all the treasures at home.  The jewels that were on women were sold, and they lived on that.  Not without fraudsters who robbed the Yusupovs. </p><h2>  Paris: World War II </h2><p>  Last place of residence is Paris.  There Irina and Felix Yusupov moved in 1920.  Miraculously, original paintings and some jewelry were removed from Russia.  This was enough to buy a small house.  In France, assistance continues to run away from the new realities of the country of the Soviets.  At the same time, the couple Yusupovs opened the fashion house Irf√©, but he did not bring them the desired financial prosperity. </p><p>  Means for life appeared in an unexpected way: in Hollywood, a film was released about Rasputin and his death.  It was reported that the elder had a love affair with Irina, Felix's wife.  It was decided to go to court with a charge of libel.  As a result, the couple received a good compensation. </p><p>  During the war, Yusupov flatly refuses to join the Nazis.  They took possession of the <span>family jewel</span> of the Felix family - a very rare pearl.  They blackmailed her, but the prince was adamant.  As a result, the jewel returned to the family. </p><p>  In 1942, tragic news came: Yusupov‚Äôs best friend, who had participated in a conspiracy against Rasputin, the Grand Duke Dmitry, died.  For a long time, Felix mourns a friend. </p><p>  After the war, the Yusupovs live in Paris, they barely have enough money, but they do not despair: they are always hospitable, joyful and happy, despite the hardships.  Felix Yusupov, whose photo is in the article, is an example of a truly Russian aristocrat.  Unsaleable, with dignity, but at the same time open to help the destitute. </p>

    <h2>  Wife Irina Alexandrovna </h2><p>  A person‚Äôs personality will not be fully revealed unless one delves into his relationship with his spouse.  The wife of Felix Yusupov is nee Romanova, the niece of the emperor Irina Alexandrovna. </p><p>  Since the engagement, the relations of young people have been barred.  It should be said that Felix himself decided to marry, it was his decision, and not pressure from the family.  Young people knew each other since childhood, had tender feelings in their youth, therefore they were not against the wedding at all.  Families also did not mind, the union was completely equal: the Romanovs and the richest family in the country.  However, the engagement nearly broke due to the "well-wishers" who told Irina's father incriminating Felix facts about his sodomy.  The young man convinces the future father-in-law of his innocence, and the wedding takes place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wife of felix yusupov" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/959784.jpg" width="355"></div>

    <p>  Further, throughout life, Felix and <span>Irina Yusupov</span> do not part.  Irina is his best friend, she supported him, gave practical advice.  She never reproached him with the fact that he was different, on the contrary, accepted. </p><p>  Throughout their life in exile, the Yusupovs have been engaged in charity and assistance to other emigrants, although they lived very modestly.  They are an example of like-minded spouses, zealous patriots of their country. </p><p>  Probably, for all the good deeds, they were destined to live for many years: Felix Yusupov died in 1968 at the age of 80, after 2 years his faithful wife Irina died. </p><h2>  Descendants of the Prince </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Yusupovs had only one daughter, Irina.  During emigration, she lives with her grandmother Zinaida for some time, after she marries Count Sheremetyev and moves to Rome. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="felix yusupov biography" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/32935/959805.jpg" width="599"></div>  Ksenia is born from this union.  Thus, she, her daughter Tatyana and two granddaughters are living direct descendants of the Yusupov clan.
