    <h2>  Hotel Complex Overview </h2><p>  If this is your first trip to Phuket and, in principle, to Thailand, Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Phuket, Karon) is an excellent option for you to get acquainted with the country and its cultural traditions.  The hotel is built in traditional Thai style, which, as is known from numerous reviews of tourists, is very conducive to relaxation.  Every detail here refers guests to the time when Thailand was not yet a world famous resort. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The complex cannot be attributed to new ones, it was built thirteen years ago.  However, at first glance it is noticeable that the hotel staff carefully monitor its condition and regularly update the number of rooms.  The last repair was carried out here three years ago, so most of the travelers were satisfied with their location in the apartments. </p><p>  The Rattana Beach Hotel has a small territory, which is very typical for hotel complexes in Thailand.  The total area is approximately two and a half thousand square meters.  This is enough to accommodate a pool with a relaxation area and a compact garden.  However, in the reviews of Rattana Beach Hotel 3 *, which tourists do, it is often noted that most of the time they spend outside the walls of the hotel.  Guests almost every day relax at the sea, go on excursions and shopping, so the modest territory of the hotel does not bother them at all. </p><p>  The hotel belongs to the category of urban and allows guests to explore on foot the most interesting places on the island. </p>

    <h2>  Estimate the location </h2><p>  Many of our compatriots who are not familiar with the features of Phuket are trying to find the hotel, which is located on the beach.  However, there are very few such complexes on the island and living in them is very expensive.  Most hotels are located some distance from the coast, but you can almost always reach the sea in literally five to seven minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The tourist catalogs indicate that the Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Phuket / Karon) is located on the second coastline and at least five hundred meters will be separated from the beach for vacationers.  According to tourists, the journey takes no more than five minutes.  At the same time, along the way, you can always look into a cozy cafe or local market. </p><p>  Our compatriots highly value the location of the hotel.  Within walking distance from the hotel are shopping centers, <span>cafes, restaurants</span> and souvenir shops.  In the evening you can walk along the streets of Phuket, which are always a lot of people walking.  If you want to go to Patong Beach, considered the heart of the island, then in tuk-tuk you will get there in just five minutes. </p>

    <h2>  Beach area </h2><p>  The nearest beach to Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Thailand / Phuket) - Karon Beach.  This place can not be called the center of tourist life, but vacationers consider this beach area one of the cleanest on the island.  Sun beds and umbrellas must be paid separately, but this is a well-known practice in Phuket, so tourists are not too embarrassed. </p><h2>  A brief description of the infrastructure of the complex </h2><p>  Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Phuket, Karon) has a very modest infrastructure, but guests of the hotel have enough facilities.  The center of attraction for holidaymakers is the pool.  Its area is fifty-five square meters, and the depth varies within a meter and a half.  He works from nine in the morning until six in the evening.  Then it is closed for cleaning, and the employees of the complex do it honestly.  Our compatriots note that the bowl of the pool is always clean, and the water in it pleases with transparency. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  At the reception staff speaks Russian and English.  The managing director of Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Phuket, Karon) also speaks quite well in Russian, so you will not have a language barrier. </p><p>  There are safes at the reception, for their rent you need to pay separately.  However, this service is very popular, because in the rooms safes are not installed. </p><p>  If necessary, guests can rent a car or motobike at the rental point, but please note that there is no private parking on site.  Therefore, tourists will have to solve this problem on their own. </p><p>  A conference room is available for vacationers at an additional cost, but it does not accommodate too many guests. </p>

    <h2>  Services </h2><p>  It is difficult to imagine a good rest of a modern person without the ability to access the Internet.  Wi-Fi catches excellent at the hotel, so all guests leave positive feedback about it.  You can use the Internet throughout the hotel, including rooms. </p><p>  If you do not want to get to the airport as part of a tourist group, then order an individual transfer.  In a small minibus it is much more convenient to drive forty-five kilometers that separate the complex and the international airport. </p><p>  The hotel has room service.  Twenty-four hours a day, vacationers can order dishes from the restaurant and even some goods from nearby stores. </p><h2>  Accommodation in a hotel complex with children </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Phuket / Karon), tourists with small children often come to the hotel.  Despite the lack of a special infrastructure for them, the kids are quite fun in the hotel complex.  After all, they can communicate with each other and give their parents time to relax. </p><p>  Children under four years old have the right to stay at the hotel absolutely free.  At the same time they will be placed in a separate berth.  If you want to place a child from four to twelve years old in existing beds, please note that you will have to pay extra three hundred butts.  Those who need an extra bed will have to pay one and a half thousand butts per day. </p><p>  Usually, only one cot can be accommodated in an apartment, however, if necessary, hotel staff can go to meet you and consider the option of accommodating several children. </p><h2>  Infrastructure for the child </h2><p>  It is very difficult to find an extensive infrastructure for children in Thailand (Asia).  Rattana Beach Hotel 3 * (Phuket / Karon) also does not provide you with a choice of entertainment for the child.  Of all the possible services, only a high chair in a restaurant and a berth can offer small guests.  Therefore, keep in mind that a holiday in Phuket with a child implies the need to think through recreational activities for him. </p>

    <h2>  Check-in conditions </h2><p>  Most often, tourists check into their room no earlier than two in the afternoon.  This check-in time is typical of Thai hotels, but if necessary, you can get into the apartment in the morning.  If the room intended for you is available, then the hotel staff will draw up all the documents before the due date. </p><p>  Departure is carried out until twelve in the afternoon.  Some tourists write that with a late departure, it is necessary to extend the use of the room in advance.  Indeed, otherwise your apartment may already be booked by someone. </p><p>  Pets are allowed at an extra charge.  However, when making a reservation, it is necessary to indicate this moment in order not to encounter certain difficulties when checking in. </p><h2>  A few words about the number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel complex consists of one residential building, which is equipped with forty-five apartments.  They are divided into two categories: </p><ul><li>  <em>Standard</em> .  There are thirty-eight such rooms in the hotel, each with an area not exceeding twenty-two square meters.  The apartments are equipped with cable TV, air conditioning and a telephone with international access.  A fridge and minibar are also included.  The bathroom is stocked with toiletries, towels and a hairdryer.  In addition to beds, the rooms are equipped with soft armchairs and a comfortable coffee table.  Daily maids replenish bottled drinking water. </li><li>  <em>Deluxe</em>  Seven rooms of this category do not exceed the previous ones in area, the difference between them is only in improved equipment.  For example, guests of deluxe suites have a bathrobe and slippers, and there is always a tea set at their disposal that allows you to spend time with a cup of coffee on the cozy balcony. </li></ul><p>  In general, Russians rate the number of rooms very high, they are satisfied with the accommodation and do not make complaints about cleaning the apartments. </p>
