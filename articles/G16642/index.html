  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Model tests: examples, model snaps, professional photo shoot</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Getting a job, a person provides a future boss with his resume.  It describes the knowledge of the applicant, which he received in the process of studying at the university, his experience in previous employment places and personal qualities that allow him to perform his work creatively or uniquely.  But model business is a more specific thing.  To be able to appreciate you, it is worth preparing high-quality model tests.  Examples of such can easily be found on the Web, but we decided to consider in detail all the nuances in which they are created.  So, let's begin. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  The main task of any model is the ability to look good in the frame.  This does not mean that day and night you need to "keep the mask" in case they catch the paparazzi.  This means that during the photo shoot she should go as much as possible into the image and at the same time preserve her personal qualities, which are evidence of her beauty.  Therefore, every girl is tested before enrolling in the ranks of models. </p><p>  In practice, everything is simple.  The agency needs to provide photographs showing the natural beauty, but at the same time there is a "tendency" to a similar profession, that is, photogenicity.  This, in fact, is the model tests, examples of which can be found in celebrity archives and other sources. </p><p>  Such photos allow you to see the highlight of the girl, her qualities, her degree of photogenicity, her emancipation, and, of course, the beauty of her face and body.  These pictures show immediately who has a predisposition to a similar kind of activity, and who is simply endowed with a beautiful figure, but not born for the camera. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="threecolumnblogger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portrait shooting" class="if uuid-3157631" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157631.jpg"></div><h2>  Professional slang </h2><p>  If you are already a little familiar with the language of the business of beauty, then you probably heard that each agency requires model snaps when recruiting.  In other words, these are snapshots on which a girl poses in accordance with specific standards.  Such photos allow you to see not only her charisma and photogenicity, but also natural data.  To do this, we created a number of rules by which model tests are shot: </p><ul><li>  Makeup is not allowed.  In practice, make-up artists impose a slightly radiant tone on the face in order to make it more embossed without the use of sculptors and highlighters. </li><li>  Hair should be washed, naturally styled and loose.  But carry an elastic band, sometimes they will need to be collected in a bundle. </li><li>  Stock up on three sets of underwear - white, flesh and black.  They should be as minimalistic as possible and without lace inserts. </li><li>  Simple clothes are needed - jeans, shorts, T-shirts and t-shirts of neutral tones, sneakers, high-heeled shoes. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="danwin.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="standard snaps" class="if uuid-3161015" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3161015.jpg"></div><h2>  Building on natural data </h2><p>  So, the first example of model tests is a demonstration of the figure and condition of the skin as a whole (not only on the face).  Therefore, you put on your underwear (any of the three colors that you prefer) and pose in relatively static poses.  The most important thing is to show your body in front, behind, side and in 3/4 position. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The same thing is done later with the face (with the exception of the rear view).  It is these snaps that will be key, since you are deprived of any image, you are yourself.  In the absence of makeup and clothing, it is necessary to demonstrate your beauty, photogenicity and ability to be relaxed, but at the same time it‚Äôs decent to stand in front of the camera. </p><h2>  Allow yourself a bit of liberty </h2><p>  In fact, we have already done the snaps.  They were those photos that were shot in linen and without make-up.  But they will not be enough to pass model tests.  Examples of further images in which a novice model can prove itself are neutral and calm combinations of clothes and makeup. </p><p>  Well, it is allowed to wear jeans or denim shorts, a T-shirt or T-shirt in gray (best) color.  Feet can remain bare or shoe sneakers can be worn.  The focus will be, of course, on the model itself, as well as its sensation of such an image. </p><p>  She may already allow herself to become not in one of the above dictated poses, since there is no need now to demonstrate her skin and proportions.  It is important to show the plasticity, character, facial expressions, the ability to feel the light and the camera.  Often, such pictures are taken in black and white, so that any shade of clothing, whatever it may be, does not distract attention from the girl and from her position. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.inoubliablemodelarmy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple image" class="if uuid-3157619" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157619.jpg"></div><h2>  Creative </h2><p>  Continuing to fill out your first portfolio, do not forget about brighter and more imaginative images.  This is a full-fledged professional photo shoot, where you can use certain outfits or suits in order to show how much you can correspond to a particular image and enter it in front of the camera.  Here you should adhere to key tips so as not to make one of the most common mistakes: </p><ul><li>  Take your things to the photo shoot.  In them you will feel more comfortable - they will be a priori in size to you, which cannot be said about the studio wardrobe. </li><li>  Choose clothes in a neutral palette and with a calm design.  It can be a business formal suit in gray or brown, a dress with a small and not very bright print, a combination of original, but not vulgar trousers / skirts and shirts, etc. Bright things will draw all attention to themselves, so your talents will simply be "buried" under them. </li><li>  The image you choose should match your character as much as possible.  Since you are a beginner model, getting used to more alien roles will be more difficult, and the result is unlikely to be ideal. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.anneofcarversville.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="complex image" class="if uuid-3157624" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157624.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional recommendations </h2><p>  Preparing for snapshots and other types of model tests is in advance - two weeks.  This means that you need to tidy up mainly the body and skin.  If there are minor flaws in the form of a tummy - pump up and go on a diet. </p><p>  If the skin is not perfect - go to the beautician.  Also drink plenty of water during these two weeks.  You will look much fresher on the most important day. </p><p>  In the case when one of the images of the model test involves wearing heels, try to choose the most comfortable shoes.  If there are none, go constantly for two weeks to those you take on the set to get used to it.  Well, you should not abuse alcohol during this period - it‚Äôs better not to drink it before the photo shoot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="black clothes image" class="if uuid-3157632" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/3157632.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Shooting snaps and images for a model test is a complex matter.  It is important that in the process itself not only participated, but all its members collaborate - a photographer, a model, a makeup artist, and a stylist.  With mutual understanding, the result will be much better than in the absence thereof. </p>
