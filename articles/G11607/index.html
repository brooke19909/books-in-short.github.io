A stubborn desire to get to the front of the First World War, life in the United States since the Great Depression, the <span>civil war</span> in Spain - all this formed a man known today around the world.  In the end, Hemingway’s biography not only reveals the backstage world of creating his novels, but also complements their philosophy.  Moreover, the author was not just a talented writer, but a prominent journalist who thoroughly tasted life in the <span>hot spots of the</span> conflicts of the 20th century. </p><p>  <strong>Hemingway: A Short Biography</strong> </p><p>  The future writer was born in the family of a Chicago doctor in 1899.  The father guided his son from an early age in his own footsteps, teaching him everything related to medicine and science.  However, the young man chose his own path. </p>

    <p>  Already in school years, the first stories came out of Ernest's pen.  In parallel, he goes in for sports: football and boxing.  After graduating from school, the young man becomes a correspondent for one of the Kansas newspapers.  It was in this role that for the first time he had to face a dark, insidious life: street crime, fraud, prostitution, and so on.  Meanwhile, a large-scale war erupts in Europe.  The young man repeatedly tried to get into military formations sent to the continent, but could not go through a medical examination due to vision problems.  Hemingway took a detour and still managed to get to Europe, settling himself from the organization of the Red Cross as a voluntary chauffeur.  Seeing the hostilities and related human suffering, Hemingway will describe them a few years later in his famous book, Farewell to Arms. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>Hemingway's Biography: War Correspondence and Literary Recognition</strong> </p>

    <p>  At the beginning of 1919, the young man returned to America, becoming a local celebrity and the owner of a prestigious award for courage from the hands of the king of Italy.  However, for a long time the writer does not stay at home and after a year and a half, having married, leaves for Paris.  It is here that its most fruitful years pass and worldwide recognition appears.  In the 1920s, Kilamanjaro’s Snow, Farewell to Arms, And the Sun Rises, and a number of other famous works were published.  In 1930, Ernest returned to America for a couple of years, where he continued a very fruitful activity, while doing fishing in Florida, and later repeatedly visiting the African continent for a safari.  Many writers biographers believe that it was at this time that the peak of his fame came.  The stories get fantastic success, instantly scattering in numerous print runs. </p><p>  <strong>Spanish period</strong> </p>

    <p>  In the summer of 1936, the fascist forces of General Francisco Franco unleash a civil war in Spain.  In this clash of republican and reactionary forces, volunteers from around the world participated.  <span>The Third Reich</span> actively helped Franco formations with technology and manpower.  In turn, volunteers from the USSR and Western states fought on the Republican side.  In addition to Hemingway, who appeared there, other famous writers were present on the fields of the civil war.  In particular, Konstantin Simonov, Antoine de Saint-Exupery and George Orwell.  The Republicans lost, Hemingway also lost this war, after which the country plunged into Franco's <span>authoritarian regime</span> for thirty-six years.  Upon his return to the United States, his famous novel, “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, comes out from under the pen of the author, clearly reflecting the trench life and the collapse of the republic. </p><p>  <strong>Torah World War</strong> </p><p>  As a conscious citizen and subtly justice man, Hemingway could not stay away from this war.  On its fronts, he became a military journalist, and later created a counterintelligence structure.  At the final stage of the war, he personally took part in military sorties to France and Germany. </p><p>  <strong>E. Hemingway: a biography.</strong>  <strong>last years of life</strong> </p><p>  After the war, the writer lives in Cuba for a long time, where his story “The Old Man and the Sea”, rewarded with the <span>Pulitzer Prize</span> , is published <span>.</span>  However, the difficult life at the fronts could not but leave an imprint on his psyche.  At sunset, deviations and paranoid tendencies are increasingly manifest.  In 1960, he returned to the United States, where he commits an act of suicide on July 2, 1961. </p>
