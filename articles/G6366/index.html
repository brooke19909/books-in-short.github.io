In 2017, the Chinese company Xiaomi became the undisputed leader.  It produces excellent gadgets that are valued not only in the domestic market, but throughout the world.  Russian buyers were also among the fans of the brand from the Middle Kingdom.  However, we note that not every Xiaomi smartphone falls into the rating.  Features, of course, are a decisive factor that helps determine the best gadget.  However, not all buyers are well versed in hardware.  And if you take into account that there are a lot of different models in the assortment range of the manufacturer, then sometimes it is quite difficult to make the right choice.  This for an unprepared user can be a real problem. </p><p>  So, let's figure out who owns the title of ‚Äúbest‚Äù among all Xiaomi smartphones?  A rating with a description of the characteristics will be presented below.  Given the wide range of gadgets, the list will be divided into categories. </p><h2>  AnTuTu Benchmark - what is it? </h2><p>  When studying information about smartphones, one can often hear that a special test is used to evaluate them.  It is called AnTuTu Benchmark.  The essence of this utility is to analyze the main parameters of the device.  At the end of testing, which can take about 10 minutes, information with scores and a global rating appears in front of the user.  It is on its basis that the rating is compiled.  Xiaomi smartphones in AnTuTu have also been tested.  However, you need to know one caveat - performance results may vary depending on the version of the program, as well as on the specific model of the device.  But they will differ slightly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The rating, which is presented below, will help determine the best phone by technical characteristics.  In this test, of course, such moments as design, dimensions of the smartphone, type of body materials, optimal balance of filling and cost are not taken into account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="c.mi.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Testing Xiaomi smartphones" class="if uuid-2270922" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270922.jpg"></div><h2>  Antutu: Xiaomi smartphones rating </h2><p>  Let's highlight the top ten models that got the highest test results.  In the first place, of course, the flagship <span>Xiaomi Mi</span> 6. He tested knocked out as many as 178 807 points during testing.  Behind him is Mi Note 2. He did not reach almost 20 thousand to the leader of the rating.  The list is in second place, since it issued 160,230 during testing. The Mi Mix 2 model was in third position, showing a result of 159,519 points.  In fourth place was the smartphone Mi 5s Plus with 157,291 points.  Having slightly lost only three thousand and a little (154,400), the Mi Mix was in the top five.  The sixth on the list was <span>Xiaomi Mi 5s</span> (138 990).  In the seventh position is the Mi 5 model (136,500).  The eighth place went to Redmi Pro, which scored 92,200 points.  But Redmi Note 4 took the position at number nine with results of 84,930 points.  Rounds out the Xiaomi Mi Max rating with 84,270 results by AnTuTu Benchmark. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Xiaomi smartphones: rating of the best in the category up to 10 000 rubles </h2><p>  The manufacturer presented the largest assortment of gadgets in the budget segment.  We give credit, the company is trying to adequately present its products and regularly replenishes all categories with new models.  However, most of the devices are in the price segment up to 10,000 rubles.  And he, as you know, is full of different phones.  But in fairness it is worth noting that Xiaomi products do not have serious competitors.  In reviews, buyers often compare it with another Chinese brand Meizu.  The latter also produces good phones, but with a direct comparison, they are still inferior to the Xiomi. </p><p>  In the comments, users pay attention that in almost all devices the balance of the ratio of price and "filling" is optimally maintained.  But today's challenge is to find out which particular gadget deserves the title of "best."  In the material you can not only familiarize yourself with the description of these models, but also see photos of Xiaomi smartphones.  The ranking is headed by the low-cost model Redmi Note 4X.  With its characteristics, let's get started. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X </h2><p>  How did this model attract the attention of users?  Of course, the characteristics.  The smartphone has a chic screen with Full HD resolution.  5.5-inch diagonal allows you to comfortably view videos and photos.  High-quality matrix provides a clear image even in direct sunlight.  But not only because of the screen, this model topped the rating of Xiaomi smartphones.  Hardware is also up to par.  The memory in the gadget is 3 GB (operational) and 32 GB (built-in).  The phone runs on a Snapdragon 625 processor. Decent autonomy is provided by a 4100 mAh battery.  Camera resolution is quite enough for this price segment: the main one is 13 megapixels, the front one is 5 megapixels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now consider what, in the opinion of users, is an advantage, and also find out what is said in the negative reviews.  Deficiencies, as such, were not found.  The only thing is that some owners spoke negatively about the permission of optics.  They would like the manufacturer to install more powerful sensor modules. </p><p>  But this model has a lot of advantages.  The reviews say, first of all, about quality assembly.  Of course, the screen, performance, and a decent battery life on a single charge earned praise. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.11street.my" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Redmi Note 4X" class="if uuid-2270924" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270924.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 4A </h2><p>  The Xiaomi Redmi smartphone rating also included the 4A model.  It has pretty good specifications.  In terms of performance, the gadget is slightly inferior to the above device.  It is based on the Snapdragon 425 chipset. It is equipped with a 5-inch display.  It is capable of displaying a picture in HD resolution.  Standard cameras - 13 and 5 megapixels.  By and large, this unit is able to easily cope with any tasks.  Even with increased load, the back cover does not heat up, which is an indisputable advantage.  The phone, thanks to the 3120 mAh battery, can work all day with active use. </p><p>  In the reviews, users listed the advantages and disadvantages of the device.  The latter include only weak sound in movie recording mode.  There were much more advantages, so Redmi 4A is included in the rating of the best gadgets of the Chinese manufacturer.  What was noted in the positive comments? </p><ul><li>  Stylish design. </li><li>  Slim body. </li><li>  Flawless assembly. </li><li>  Light weight. </li><li>  Powerful performance. </li><li>  Battery life. </li></ul><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime </h2><p>  Making up the rating of Xiaomi smartphones, one can not help but talk about one more model.  Users rated the Redmi 4 Prime phone quite high.  It has a 5-inch display with high resolution (Full HD).  In order to cope with all the tasks, the manufacturer installed the Snapdragon 625 processor. 3 GB of RAM is enough to run even the most "heavy" game.  Files and applications can be stored in 32-gigabyte storage.  The only thing that let us down was camera capabilities.  Although it is based on a 13-megapixel sensor, however, in poor lighting, the pictures are rather dull.  The manufacturer made sure that the smartphone was truly mobile.  Its work is provided by a 4100 mAh battery.  The system is optimized as much as possible, so on a single charge you can use the device for about two days. </p><p>  Now consider the reviews of the owners.  The strengths they attributed to the presence of a fingerprint scanner, a good speaker, decent autonomy.  But the comments were made only to the camera. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.eudirect.shop" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime" class="if uuid-2270927" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270927.jpg"></div><h2>  Rating smartphones in the middle price category </h2><p>  Smartphones of the Chinese manufacturer, which belong to the middle price category, are in high demand among buyers.  Note that these models simply have no equal.  And this is confirmed by numerous reviews of Xiaomi smartphones.  The rating of the best devices will be presented a little later.  Considering the instances of this category, it must be said that it is simply impossible to find a phone with similar characteristics released by other manufacturers.  Devices with such equipment, especially the famous brand, will be much more expensive.  The quality of Xiaomi smartphones is also beyond doubt.  Phones have been working for several years without breakdowns.  But can all the models in this category be called the best?  Definitely not.  The winners by all criteria are Mi 5s Plus and Redmi Note 3 Pro SE.  It is their characteristics that we will consider further. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus </h2><p>  For about 25 thousand rubles, you can buy an excellent model of a smartphone.  Mi 5s Plus runs on a rather powerful Snapdragon 821 chip. Its capabilities are enough to perform all tasks without exception.  Using the phone is very convenient.  A 5.7 ∫ screen displays the picture in Full HD quality.  A lot of enthusiasm sounded at the twin camera.  The capabilities of each module are 13 megapixels.  Compare this model, of course, with the iPhone is incorrect, but still the pictures are obtained on a "solid" five.  The device uses a capacious battery.  Its resource (3800 mAh) lasts up to 2 days of use, and without any battery savings. </p><p>  Users believe that the manufacturer has withstood the optimal ratio of cost and hardware.  But, unfortunately, not without drawbacks.  Owners consider the smartphone a little thick.  And this, in turn, affects usability.  Also, during operation, problems with firmware were detected.  But even despite this, the model can rightfully be called the best, as it has a good screen, an excellent camera with the ability to record video in 4K quality, and powerful performance. </p><div class="photo" data-original="produto.mercadolivre.com.br" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Mi 5s Plus" class="if uuid-2270921" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270921.jpg"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro SE </h2><p>  The mid-range Xiaomi smartphone rating includes the Redmi Note 3 Pro SE.  Its cost varies between 15-16 thousand rubles.  For this money, the manufacturer offers a device with a 5.5-inch display, the resolution of which is Full HD, a Snapdragon 650 processor, three gigabytes of RAM, 4G support and an excellent 16 MP front camera.  The only thing that upset the owners a bit was the resolution of the main optical module.  But given the cost, such a flaw can be forgiven.  Most reviews say that the price tag is fully justified by the equipment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="xiaomiadvices.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro SE" class="if uuid-2270923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270923.jpg"></div><h2>  The best flagships </h2><p>  Now let's talk about the flagships that are included in the rating.  <span>Reviews about Xiaomi smartphones in</span> this category are mostly positive, but some users still have some doubts.  This is explained by the fact that high demands are placed on the flagship segment.  According to the manufacturer, the most equipped in technical terms are two models - Mi Mix and Mi 6. On sale, they appeared with a difference of six months.  Many users believe that they are in no way inferior to the flagships of other brands.  And they even have a significant advantage - the cost, which is much lower than that of competitors. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi Mix </h2><p>  This smartphone model appealed to most users.  She has a lot of fans.  Such popularity is ensured by the fact that the manufacturer tried to optimize the system as much as possible, so that it works smoothly without failures.  All processes are processed quickly.  The powerful Snapdragon 821 chipset is responsible for this. Its characteristics are quite enough for modern applications to work.  Three gigabytes of RAM are implemented in the device.  Even demanding users do not feel problems with a lack of free memory, since the storage capacity is 128 GB. </p><p>  The Mi Mix device is a phablet.  The developers equipped it with a large screen, the diagonal of which is 6.4 ∫.  The quality with which the picture is reproduced is gorgeous.  Owners enjoy a resolution of 2040 √ó 1080 px.  These features are also complemented by a capacious 4400 mAh battery. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.banggood.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix" class="if uuid-2270926" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270926.jpg"></div><p>  In the reviews, users say that the device is equipped with a scanner for reading a fingerprint.  However, its main advantage is a frameless display.  This innovative technology has allowed the Mi Mix model to stand out from the competition.  But not everything is so smooth.  Users felt that the developers did not take the cameras seriously enough.  The smartphone, frankly, received mediocre optics, so you can not count on impeccable quality of the pictures. </p><h2>  Xiaomi Mi 6 </h2><p>  Xiaomi‚Äôs smartphone rating, of course, included the Mi 6 model. This flagship device attracted the attention of customers with the super-powerful performance provided by the Snapdragon 835 processor, as well as 6 GB of RAM.  The glass case looks stylish.  On the front side there is a 5.15-inch display with good resolution (Full HD). </p><p>  But this model is not without flaws.  For some reason, the developers did not provide an audio jack and a slot for an external drive.  And if the absence of the latter can be justified by the capacious storage of internal memory (128 GB), then the first - by nothing.  Note that for most users this is a rather significant drawback. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.getsview.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Xiaomi Mi 6" class="if uuid-2270925" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2270925.jpg"></div><h2>  Smartphone with the best camera </h2><p>  The model that won by the criterion of camera resolution completes the list of the best gadgets.  The rating of Xiaomi smartphones was headed by the Mi Note 2 device. According to users, it has no shortcomings.  But the merits are more than enough.  These include: </p><ul><li>  High level of performance (Snapdragon 821, 4/64 GB). </li><li>  Sony camera modules (22.6 megapixels). </li><li>  High definition and color images in photographs. </li><li>  Good screen (OLED matrix, 5.7 ∫). </li><li>  Great build, quality materials. </li></ul>
