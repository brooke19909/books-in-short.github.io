The devices with LCD screens that saw the light in 1998 were the first to establish mass use.

It could be <noindex>  <strong><span>download e-books</span></strong> </noindex>  and read them in better quality.  The surge in the popularity of e-books came in 2007, this is due to the appearance of products that have screens with electronic paper technology.  This technology allows the device to form an image in reflected light, that is, just like on plain paper.  In addition, the new generation of electronic books has become able to display both text and graphics for quite some time without resorting to the consumption of electrical energy. </p><p>  Convenience and benefits of reading electronic literature not a person: </p><ol><li>  Takes up a little space. </li><li>  Provides the possibility of combining with mobile phones, computers. </li><li>  Ability to search by text, click through hyperlinks, display temporary notes and highlights. </li><li>  Text scoring due to the presence of built-in synthesizer programs. </li><li>  Display animations, multimedia clips. </li><li>  Lower costs for finding electronic versions of books than paper ones. </li><li>  No book dust. </li></ol>

    <p>  Modern e-book devices support quite a few formats: DOC, TXT, PDF, EPUB, DJVU, FB2, RTF, HTML, PRC, CHM, TCR, WOLF, LRF.  Naturally, each device has its own set of available files.  As for functional books, when choosing a model, you should pay attention to such devices that are able to accept a larger number of formats.  Or consider those e-books that support widely used formats on the Internet. </p><p>  In order to start using the e-book reader, you must first prepare it for work.  The book should be charged using a charger or a USB cable connected to a computer.  The very first charge session should last at least 10 hours (more precisely indicated in the instructions), after which the device can be started using the power button.  Also, before using the e-book, it is worthwhile to familiarize yourself with the instructions attached to it, as well as insert the SD card into a special slot. </p><p>  Reading literature of interest through an e-book device is very simple and comfortable.  However, in order for it to serve as much time as possible, during the operation, the recommendations given by its manufacturer should be adhered to. </p></div></article>
