    <h2>  Rivers and their influence </h2><p>  4 large <span>rivers</span> flow into the bay <span>: Don,</span> Mius, Kalmius, Eya.  The largest river.  When flowing into the bay in the northeast, the Don forms a delta with several arms.  Its total area is 540 square meters.  km  <span>The Don River</span> significantly affects the salinity level in the bay.  Due to the large amount of inflowing river water, the water area is mostly fresh.  Only the western part of the Taganrog Bay has sea salinity, since in this part it directly collides with the sea.  The remaining rivers flowing into this water area do not have such an effect on the change in water salinity. </p><h2>  Brief description of the bay </h2><p>  The length of the bay is about 140 km.  The average width is 31 km, the maximum is 52 km, and the smallest is 26 km.  The bottom relief of the Taganrog Bay is smoother than the sea.  Because of this feature, it is much shallow.  The average depth does not exceed the mark of 5 m. Only at the border of the bay with the Sea of ​​Azov is the largest figure of 11 m observed. The total area of ​​the bay is 5600 square meters.  km </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water temperature in the Taganrog Bay" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1300759.jpg" width="600"></div>

Under the accumulation of abrasion material, sand spits and small islands formed.  The largest spit is Belosarayskaya, its length is 15 km.  Spit Curve crashes into the water for 9 km, and Beglitskaya - for almost 3 km.  Not far from the Mariupol coast is a small island.  Lyapina, off the coast of Yeisk are the Sand Islands.  And near Taganrog port there is an artificial island.  Turtle. </p><p>  The bottom of the bay is relatively flat, has a slight slope.  It decreases from the Don River towards the Sea of ​​Azov.  It is represented by deposits in the form of clay silt, silt sand. </p><p>  The ecological situation in the waters of the Taganrog Bay falls to a critical point.  This is due to waste from a large industrial center of the region - Taganrog.  Surface water pollution threatens the bioresources of the bay. </p><h2>  Climatic features </h2><p>  The bay is located in the temperate climatic zone, continental type.  Throughout the year, the temperature here is favorable.  The water area freezes in December, and opens in March.  In cold winters, the ice crust formed in the bay reaches 80 cm. The average is 40-50 cm. But in warm winters, the ice layer does not exceed 20 cm. The ice cover is uneven, hummocks often form along the coast and near river mouths. </p><p>  In summer, the water temperature in the Taganrog Bay reaches + 25 ... + 28 ° .  The hottest month is July.  At this time, the water warms up to almost +30 ° C.  The velvet season lasts until the beginning of October. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Taganrog Bay of the Sea of ​​Azov" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1300760.jpg" width="600"></div>

Recently, there has been a tendency to increase precisely freshwater fish, due to a decrease in the salinity of the reservoir.  The most common here are pike perch, crucian carp and perch.  Often they are crowded along the coasts and estuaries.  In addition, a large number of sturgeon, herring, ram, sabrefish and bream are found in the bay. </p><p>  There are no large mammals living in the waters of the bay.  However, according to archaeological finds that were discovered near Taganrog, these species used to live here.  The remains of large and small mammals of the Pleistocene era were found. </p><h2>  Holidays in the Taganrog Bay </h2><p>  Geographically, the coast of the gulf belongs to two states - Russia and Ukraine.  The largest ports on the coast are Mariupol, Taganrog and Yeysk.  These cities are a resort area.  Every year, a large number of people come to the coast for recreation and relaxation.  Tourists can stay in sanatoriums and recreation centers.  Those who want to save a little on housing are invited to find a room in the private sector.  If we compare prices, then the second option is significantly cheaper, but living conditions will be slightly worse. </p><p>  You can relax on the bay all year round.  Warm temperatures last about 200 days.  Although some environmental degradation has recently been observed, nevertheless the region has favorable climatic conditions, warm water makes this place popular among holidaymakers.  The coast of the Taganrog Bay is a wonderful place for families. </p><p>  In addition, the region also has a conservation area - Beglitskaya Spit.  Some species of local flora are listed in the Red Book.  Recently, the Pavlo-Ochakov spit is gaining popularity.  It is ideal for sports such as surfing.  The shallow depths off the coast are great for beginners in this sport. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in the Taganrog Bay" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1300758.jpg" width="600"></div>
