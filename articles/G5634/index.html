    <h2>  Useful tip number 1 for measuring casual wear </h2><p>  It is best to take measurements together with another person who will provide all possible assistance.  It is necessary to raise the elbow so that the line forming the forearm is parallel to the floor surface.  The arm bends at the elbow joint so that the palm of your hand looks up at the ceiling. </p><p>  The assistant must measure the length from the middle of the back to the wrist, and for this he will need a <span>centimeter tape.</span>  It passes through the middle part of the scapula, the back half of the arm, the elbow bend and reaches the end of the cuff. </p><p>  In order for the pattern to be correct, you need to know how to measure the length of the sleeve, and also some more measurements will be needed.  It is necessary to stand up exactly, as already described earlier, and measure with a centimeter, taking the place where the shoulder ends at the starting point, and stretching the tape through the arm from behind through the elbow bend, and finish near the wrist. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The next step will be to measure the distance from the armpits to the wrist joint at the bottom of the arm.  The upper part of the sleeve is measured as follows.  A centimeter tape is applied to the largest part of the forearm, completely clasping it. </p><h2>  What other measurements may be needed </h2><p>  Quite a lot also depends on the girth of the elbow.  To measure it, you need to lower your hand and use a centimeter to measure the elbow joint.  It is important that the tape is not too tight or loose. </p><p>  At the last stage, to understand how to measure the length of the sleeve, you need to know the parameters of the girth of the wrist in the narrowest place, they are very easy to measure with the same centimeter tape. </p>

    <h2>  Useful tip number 2 - measure ready-made clothes </h2><p>  This moment is already relevant for ready-made clothes, which are sold in stores, and in order not to make mistakes, you need to know some features.  Basically, people with high growth, buying a shirt without trying on, are mistaken with the length of the sleeves.  And as a result, it turns out that the new little thing is completely unsuitable due to the fact that the cuffs are at the level of the elbow bend. </p><p>  So, how to measure the length of the sleeve of a shirt and not be mistaken with the choice of clothes you like?  Ideally, if the elbow is bent and makes a right angle, then the cuff should be located at the starting point of the hand, while covering the carpal bone.  In the event that a watch is an invariable companion of a person, one of the cuffs must close them, that is, have a slightly larger girth.  But this option is possible only if the shirt is sewn specially for the order. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Useful tip number 3 - measuring jackets </h2>

    <p>  Here we will talk about how to choose the right jacket.  So, in the store, if the purchase occurs without trying on, you need to pay attention to the following aspects. </p><p>  First of all, the width in the shoulders is measured.  It is easy to identify from the shoulder seam to where it connects to the sleeve.  A centimeter tape is applied from the left shoulder to the right or vice versa. </p><p>  Then you need to find out the width of the chest line.  The point of application of the centimeter begins at the place of flashing the sleeve with a seam located on the side.  The tape measures the width between the side seams. </p><p>  The width of the jacket on the bottom.  Here, the cuffs are measured - a belt that is sewn at the bottom of the product, or for elongated models, the bottom is simply measured. </p><p>  Jacket Length.  Measurement is carried out from the collar to the bottom.  In order to correctly determine the size of a men's jacket, it is recommended to know the person‚Äôs height so as not to make a mistake with the length of the selected model, as well as with sleeves. </p><p>  How to measure jacket sleeve length?  A centimeter tape is applied to the cuff at one end and is unwound along the length of the sleeve to the shoulder.  Or you can follow these steps in reverse order. </p><p>  Another option for measuring the sleeve on the bottom.  The point is fixed where the sleeve and the side seam are connected, and the tape reaches the lower end of the cuff. </p><p>  A little trick is that the centimeter should not sag during measurements, but be a little taut.  And it is advisable to measure the product on a flat surface in order to get the most correct indicators.  So, now it‚Äôs clear how to correctly measure the length of the sleeve. </p>

    <h2>  Useful tip number 4 - how to try on a jacket </h2><p>  Having figured out how to measure the length of the sleeve of a jacket or shirt, it is worthwhile to touch on the topic of jackets, also very common items of clothing.  After the length of the sleeves of the shirt is obtained, you can decide what the sleeves of the jacket will be.  Yes, they are different, namely of the following types: short, standard, long, super long. </p><p>  Not so long ago, super-long sleeves that covered the bones of the phalanges of the fingers were in fashion, but everything flows and changes, and such clothes can now be seen only at a theme party.  Today, the standard length is in fashion, and here it is slightly smaller than the sleeve of the shirt, so the cuff peeks a little from under the sleeve.  Some people stop at short models so that the cuffs are visible as much as 5 cm, and at the same time you can boast of fashionable cufflinks. </p>
