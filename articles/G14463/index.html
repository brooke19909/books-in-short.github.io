Of course, there are an infinite number of options, and to a large extent it all depends on the preferences and financial capacities of the tourists themselves, but if you are reading this article, then this direction probably attracts you! </p><p>  Tunisia is a great option combining the splendor of spa life and the colors of the African state.  This country has long held a high position in the list of the most visited countries in the world specializing in beach vacations.  In Tunisia, it will be good not only for adults, but also for children.  If you are looking for a country with well-groomed beaches, a clean coast and a lot of attractions, then you are unlikely to find a better vacation destination than the resorts of Tunisia.  The main problem is which cities in Tunisia are worth a visit?  Among all this diversity, it‚Äôs hard to choose the most suitable for a vacation.  To avoid such situations, let's get acquainted with the main cities of Tunisia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="nomadlist.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Everyday life in Tunisia" class="if uuid-2450449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2450449.jpg"></div><h2>  Hammamet </h2><p>  One of the most popular resort areas in North Africa is the city of Hammamet.  Geographically, it is located in the eastern part of Tunisia.  Hammamet became famous thanks to its clean and well-groomed snow-white beach.  Separately, it is worth noting the fact that in addition to the luxurious sandy promenade, where you can sunbathe or enjoy your favorite sports, the city is famous for its attractions.  There really is something to see here.  What is the medina of the city in Tunisia worth?  Medina is the historical part of the Arab settlement, as the "old city" in Europe, only surrounded by the perimeter of the fortress wall.  On the territory of the medina you can see old houses and mosques.  The ribat fortress adjacent to the old part of the city deserves special attention. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.sentidohotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The spa town of Hammamet" class="if uuid-2450451" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2450451.jpg"></div><h2>  Sousse </h2><p>  The resort town of Sousse is most popular mainly among young people.  "Why?"  - you ask.  This is a real paradise for those who come for an active vacation, and not just lie on the beach under the scorching sun.  Most of the attractions of Sousse are concentrated in the central part of the city.  Here, the gaze of a tourist presents the ruins of Carthage, the local zoo, as well as the famous ribat fortress.  If you have time, you can visit the local two-domed Great Mosque and the Dar Essid House Museum, built in 928, in one day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.noonpost.org" data-author=": ŸáŸäÿ´ŸÖ ÿ≥ŸÑŸäŸÖÿßŸÜŸä, "><img itemprop="image" alt="View of the city of Sousse" class="if uuid-2450452" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2450452.jpg"></div><h2>  Monastir </h2><p>  Monastir is the hometown of Tunisia‚Äôs first president, Habib Bourguiba.  Today it is a popular resort city in Tunisia.  If you do not want to overpay round sums for fashionable places, then Monastir will help not only save your finances, but also surprise you with its offers.  The sea here is quite clean and has a good coastline, but it is still better for demanding tourists to give preference to other resort towns in Tunisia. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There are a lot of attractions in Monastir, so the question of where to go is definitely irrelevant here.  For example, the mausoleum of Habib Bourguiba is in great demand among tourists, or you can look at the famous Ribat fortress, located near the medina and retaining all its splendor to this day.  It is also interesting that the local cemetery Sidi El Mezri is popular, which, according to residents, can heal seriously ill children.  A huge collection of Arabic clothing presented in the museum of traditional costume is also presented to tourists. </p><h2>  Jerba </h2><p>  The island of Jebra is one of the best places designed exclusively for a beach holiday.  The resort greets its visitors with the azure sea, white beaches and fashionable hotels.  This is a whole paradise for those who like to spend all their free time basking in the sun.  Nevertheless, the island did not deprive its visitors of the sights, one of which is the Gazi Mustafa fortress.  The fortress is a truly unique structure built of coastal sandstone stone.  It offers beautiful views of the Mediterranean Sea, and at the top there is an extensive observation deck from where you can make a memorable photo against the backdrop of the Djerba.  The island boasts one of the most fashionable lagoons where pink flamingos live - a favorite place for many tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Djerba Beach in Tunisia" class="if uuid-2450453" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2450453.jpg"></div><h2>  Mahdia </h2><p>  Mahdia is considered the best city of Tunisia for a relaxing and family holiday.  The main advantage of this resort is that on the beaches of Mahdia almost never crowded.  For those who wish to undergo a course of wellness treatments, the best thalassotherapy centers operate in the resort.  From the sights you can see the ancient fortress of Bord el Kebir, built in 1595, the Great Mosque of Mahdia, as well as the famous gate of Skif al-Kala.  But the main hallmark of the island is the El Jem Amphitheater. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.everystockphoto.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mahdia in Tunisia" class="if uuid-2450454" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2450454.jpg"></div><h2>  Nabul </h2><p>  If you are traveling in the northern part of the country, then you should definitely stop by and stay for a few days in this wonderful city.  A feature of the city of Nabul is a well-developed tourist infrastructure.  This resort perfectly combines public beaches with wild ones, where you can retire and spend a romantic evening with your soulmate.  Traditionally, as in all other cities in Tunisia, the main attraction is the medina - the old part of the city.  But the cobra lagoon is especially good in winter, whole flocks of pink flamingos flock there.  Beauty, in a word! </p><h2>  Tunisia </h2><p>  This resort and the capital of the same name does not need a separate presentation.  Not only is there a wide variety of beaches, so Tunisia boasts its attractions!  What is the ancient city of Carthage worth - an open-air museum or the medina of the city of Tunisia!  Do not disregard the mountain oasis in the Atlas Mountains - Shebika, from where a stunningly beautiful view of the Sahara opens. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.icanholidays.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Medina of Tunisia" class="if uuid-2450455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/72025/2450455.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  All cities in Tunisia are unique in their own way, it is impossible to highlight a clear favorite here!  You need to fly to this country and spend wonderful days on your long-awaited vacation.
