Issue of new banknotes in 2017</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In 2014-2015  There were a lot of discussions on the Web about the introduction of new large banknotes with a face value of 10,000 rubles into the Central Bank of Russia.  Now, after several years, we can easily figure it out, looking at these disputes in retrospect, which of those news was official information, and what a newspaper duck, and also to find out which new notes will soon appear in our wallets. </p><h2>  Background: Crimea and LDPR </h2><p>  The initiator of the release of the bill of 10,000 rubles in 2014 was the Liberal Democratic Party, and not the Central Bank of Russia.  Alexey Didenko, the first deputy head of the liberal fraction, presented to the public a design of new banknotes, developed by order of the party.  In the photo you can consider their appearance - the banknotes depict the main attractions of Sevastopol and the whole Crimea, including  Monument to the legendary General Nakhimov and the Orthodox Vladimir Cathedral.  Photos with layouts quickly spread across the Runet - some cunning users even tried to print them and pay off with the fruits of their inventiveness. </p>

    <p>  According to LDPR representatives, the release of thematic bills of 10,000 rubles dedicated to the Crimea is reflected in the history of the memorable 2014, when the peninsula and the heroic city of Sevastopol again became part of Russia - their historical homeland.  At the same time, deputy A. Didenko told reporters that the issue of <span>"Crimean" banknotes</span> is a great opportunity not only to feel the reunion with Crimea spiritually, but also to experience this event financially - in your wallet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  New banknote 10,000 rubles: fake news </h2><p>  In addition to the official project proposed by the liberals, in the same Runet in 2014-2015.  roaming duck news about a different design of <span>ten thousandth notes.</span>  Many Internet users saw messages about the imminent introduction of yellow banknotes dedicated to the sights of Sochi. </p>

    <p>  Another fake news was the announcement of the imminent issue by the Central Bank in <span>Russia of a</span> 10,000-ruble <span>note</span> dedicated to the ancient city of Ryazan.  Executed by unknown designers, the layout was a banknote of a turquoise hue.  On its front side in the foreground was a monument to the poet Sergei Yesenin against the backdrop of the Ryazan Kremlin.  Here, on the right side of the image, the coat of arms of the city is also visible.  On the back was a panorama with a bridge over <span>the Trubezh River.</span>  According to the authors of the news, the need for such a bill arose in connection with the increase in the average salary in the Russian Federation. </p><h2>  The official response of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation </h2><p>  The Central Bank has denied the news related to the early release of notes of 10,000 rubles, calling them nothing more than rumors.  Georgy Luntovsky, the first deputy chairman of this department, noted that the issue of issuing banknotes of such a high denomination would be relevant only when the inflation rate in the Russian Federation dropped to 2-3% per year.  The banker suggested paying attention to the fact that the monthly income of not all Russian citizens exceeds the face value of such a bill, so its issue seriously discredits them.  In addition, such a large banknote can be a real find for especially talented counterfeiters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  G. Luntovsky also assured reporters in his official response to the media that the new economy does not need the new 10,000-ruble note due to the fact that the existing nominal series fully satisfies all the needs of Russian society.  Banknotes in denominations of 500, 100 and <span>50 rubles</span> remain the most demanded - the sum of the average purchase of a Russian citizen does not exceed the mark of 492 rubles. </p><p>  As for the mockups of banknotes designed by order of the LDPR, today you can only admire them in the Goznak Museum.  And with the views of the Crimea, an anniversary "hundred rublevka" was released. </p><h2>  New banknotes in 2017 </h2><p>  2017 was also notable for the news on the issue of new banknotes - only in denominations of not 10,000 rubles, but 200 and 2000. The first official messages appeared on April 12 - the decision to put such notes into circulation was based on the fact that most Russians make transactions, the value range of which varies in the limits of 100-500 rubles and 1000-5000 rubles. </p><p>  As for the design of future bills, it will be offered to be chosen by Russian citizens themselves - public voting with the support of the federal television channel should start in the summer of 2017.  The choice of options will be considerable: Crimean vineyards against the backdrop of Ayu-Dag Mountain, the sights of Vladivostok, the mosque "Heart of Chechnya" in front of the panorama of Grozny, etc. </p>

    <p>  Since it will take a lot of time to summarize the voting results, develop layouts, issue new banknotes and put them into circulation, it is expected that new bills will gradually appear over the course of two years.  The very first, according to plans, will be released at the end of 2017. </p><h2>  Economics and the introduction of new banknotes </h2><p>  It is worth noting that the issuance of new notes does not affect the level of inflation in the country, nor the entire mass of cash in the state.  The necessary balance is achieved due to the fact that dilapidated banknotes and coins are constantly withdrawn from circulation. </p><p>  According to Elvira Nabiullina, chairman of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the very issue of project-denominated banknotes is also not an expendable matter, therefore, it is not planned to expend funds either to issue new banknotes or to withdraw old ones from circulation. </p>

    <p>  Thus, the draft bill of 10,000 rubles was permanently mothballed.  For its implementation there is little initiative of caring citizens and deputies - a significant reduction in the percentage of inflation and an increase in the minimum income of citizens are necessary. </p>
