    <p>  Labor indicators are as follows: the rate of production and time, service and number.  They are established for the rational use of labor.  The production rate, like all other labor indicators, is set depending on existing production factors.  These include: </p><p>  - level of technical re-equipment; </p><p>  - Organization of the process of release of goods; </p><p>  - the level of production relations. </p><p>  In the conditions of the existence of a collective form of payment and <span>labor organization,</span> it is possible to use complex as well as aggregated rates. </p><p>  The production rate, as well as other indicators of professional contribution to the organization‚Äôs activities, are subject to mandatory review: </p><p>  - based on the results of the rationalization and certification of jobs; </p><p>  - as new technologies are introduced; </p><p>  - after installing new equipment; </p><p>  - as organizational measures are carried out that contribute to the growth <span>of labor productivity.</span> </p><p>  If an individual employee or a link (team) due to the initiative taken and the introduction of new methods of <span>labor, the degree of</span> development of finished products reached high values, then this is not the basis for a general review of existing indicators. </p><p>  The volume (quantity of products) that an employee or group having an appropriate qualification level must be completed per unit of time with a certain organization and the availability of technical equipment, shows the rate of production.  The formula for determining this indicator is applied using division.  To establish this amount is the private value of the working time for the reporting period (month or shift, day or hour), and the established time value </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The production rate can be set only if there is the possibility of accounting and control of manufactured goods in quantitative terms.  Also, its definition is likely with the periodic implementation of the same labor process during the shift. </p><p>  Rationing the contribution of employees to the enterprise is one of the most important factors in organizing production relations.  In a market economy, a high degree of managerial decisions in the field of labor and the establishment of rational indicators is a prerequisite for the business entity to obtain the maximum possible profit.  This, in turn, allows the company to be competitive in <span>the market.</span> </p><p>  Separate ministries and departments establish uniform production standards, which are recorded in special collections.  These indicators are used by all units within the structure of this <span>sector of the economy.</span>  To develop these documents are used: </p><p>  - observation of photo-timing; </p><p>  - technical characteristics of the equipment used; </p><p>  - the results obtained in the analysis of the organization of <span>industrial relations,</span> as well as measures aimed at improving them; </p><p>  - data obtained as a result of technical calculations. </p><p>  The unit of developed standards is a machine shift and a person shift.  When conducting a preliminary analysis, preparatory as well as final works are taken into account.  If the company uses more advanced forms of organization of the labor process, production, as well as more modern technical means in comparison with the developed collection, then there is a need for the development and implementation of higher production standards.  Regulatory documents allow to reduce the established indicators of labor in the amount of up to fifteen percent, in the case of certain negative factors.  The specific standardization amount is determined at a particular workplace and is documented in an act. </p>
