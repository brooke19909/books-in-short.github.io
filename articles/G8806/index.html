    <p>  So, the <span>market of insurance</span> services is expanding, and the number of insurers - companies that are ready to take on the risks defined by the contract for a small compensation in the form of an insurance premium, is increasing.  And in the event of the events specified in the contracts, the insurance company undertakes to indemnify the damage incurred within a certain amount. </p><p>  This article will examine one of the prominent representatives of large players in the market - the insurance company Alfa Insurance. </p><h2>  Positive rating </h2><p>  What could be more important for <span>an insurance organization</span> than confirmation of its financial stability, stability and reliability?  Nothing, since this is, of course, the main guarantee that people will trust her with their personal lives, the health of their loved ones and their own property. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since March 2015, AlfaStrakhovanie Insurance Company has been in the AA position according to Fitch Ratings.  Other polls confirm a similar level of reliability.  In addition, six months ago, AlfaStrakhovanie Insurance Company passed the mandatory qualification, which confirmed the high quality level of ISO 9001-2011. </p><p>  One feature of the company is that it makes a big bet on users using the Internet.  On the insurer's website you can find the widest range of services with the ability to automatically calculate insurance premiums.  Thanks to this, the company several times received awards and rewards for the broadest content on the site. </p><h2>  What services does it provide </h2><p>  AlfaStrakhovanie Insurance Company works with both individuals and legal entities, has a wide range of services.  Not every organization can boast the same number of insurance products that are successfully sold and have their own demand. </p><p>  For private customers, AlfaStrakhovanie Insurance Company offers both property and personal insurance.  In addition, there are opportunities to insure your liability to third parties. </p><p>  It is also pleasant that there is accumulative insurance that allows you to create a certain capital, which can be used at your discretion. </p><h2>  Major player in the insurance market </h2><p>  Considering the fact that AlfaStrakhovanie, which has branches in all major cities of Russia, is a partner of such brands as Coca-Cola, Danone, Henkel, etc., we can conclude that the largest manufacturers consider this reliable insurance company to protect legal entities from possible risks. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For companies and enterprises, there are insurance services for numerous transactions, production risks, etc. It is noteworthy that all products for legal entities have their own specific tariff schedule, depending on the sector of the economy in which this or that enterprise conducts its business. </p><h2>  To individuals </h2><p>  Given the fact that the company has more than 20 years of experience, we can talk about a peculiar style of serving individuals.  What is it manifested in? </p><p>  One of the main requirements for employees working with clients is: to be always in a good mood, smile and help choose the most suitable product for them.

    <p>  Consider the popular areas in which this company is engaged. </p><h2>  Driver Liability Insurance </h2><p>  For many car owners it was a shock when they passed a law establishing mandatory liability insurance on the road.  But, as expected, drivers gradually got used to such a norm, and now almost everyone wants to trust a reliable and adequate insurer. </p><p>  For example, AlfaStrakhovanie MTPL sells at a price of about 13,500 rubles for cars of 2013 with an engine power of 100 hp, if the vehicle uses an unlimited number of drivers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  You can calculate the approximate cost on the company's website.  However, many customers are unhappy that the figures presented are designed for the level of Moscow and the Moscow region.  Because of this, the clients of the insurer cannot remotely quickly calculate and issue a policy. </p><p>  It is not possible to find any distinguishing features from competing companies: the risks are the same, there are no additional advantages (for example, some provide free evacuation from the accident scene or refueling on the road). </p>

    <p>  Despite this, in various national ratings of Alfa Insurance, motor third party liability insurance is always in the leading position. </p><h2>  CASCO and car safety </h2><p>  If you want to insure your car, then you need to conclude a CASCO agreement.  Unlike CTP, the company commits itself to cover the damage that third parties will cause to the car in cases specified in the contract. </p><p>  AlfaStrakhovanie CASCO offers its customers three levels: </p><ul><li>  "50/50 +"; </li><li>  "business"; </li><li>  "all inclusive". </li></ul><p>  These levels differ in the set of risks included in the contract.  The first program can be chosen by those who have a long driving experience and are confident that nothing serious will happen to his car. </p>

    <p>  The last level includes almost all the risks that could have been foreseen.  If you want to feel financially secure in terms of a vehicle, then AlfaStrakhovanie CASCO All Inclusive has created just for you. </p><p>  Such a distinction between CASCO levels helps to satisfy the demand of people with different material conditions.  For clarity, the total cost of CASCO services, you can make a preliminary calculation on the website of AlfaStrakhovanie.  Moscow is an expensive city, and insurance here also costs a lot.  So, for a business class agreement with an average set of options, you will have to pay over 90,000 rubles. </p><p>  This is not to say that it is cheap, but paying such an amount is better than constantly worrying that something could happen to the machine.  The company also insures against theft.  If something like this happens, the insurer is obliged to indemnify. </p><h2>  There are good nuances. </h2><p>  A pleasant point that customers indicate in their reviews is that CASCO insurance in relation to vehicle parts works on the principle of ‚Äúold to new‚Äù.  This means that after the occurrence of the insured event, the calculation of damage will not take into account the wear of parts, that is, the cost of equipment, mechanisms, parts will be equal to the price level for the same goods, only new ones. </p>

    <p>  It would seem that this is a trifle, but when drawing up an act of damage, every penny counts, because any automotive materials are now quite expensive. </p><h2>  For travelers </h2><p>  Travel agencies are gradually becoming a thing of the past, as the Internet provides a lot of different information about numerous resorts, leisure and entertainment options abroad. </p><p>  A very cheap option to travel around Europe is to drive your own or rental car to the EU countries.  But in order for such a plan to be implemented, it is necessary to have an insurance policy for the Green Card program. </p><p>  Only 10 insurance companies in the Russian Federation, including IC AlfaStrakhovanie, have the opportunity to draw up such an agreement.  The registration address of the car does not matter, drive around Europe without restrictions! </p><h2>  Compulsory Health Insurance </h2><p>  Today, legal entities must insure the risks associated with the health of workers.  In this matter, you can rely on Alfa Insurance.  <span>Compulsory medical insurance (compulsory medical insurance)</span> helps provide financial support to the enterprise in case of illness of workers.  After all, it is very important not to check the checkers that the employees are insured, but to receive monetary compensation to finance the treatment of the victim. </p>
