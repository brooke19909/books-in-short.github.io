At one time, it was represented by the best in their categories gadgets, which were at the peak of sales.  Due to this, we can assume that the manufacturer received many regular customers who in the future “walked” from one device to another, attracted by the capabilities of the phones. </p><p>  In this article, we will review one of the smallest smartphones in the line, the Samsung 5360. We will talk about how it differs from competing devices, what positive and negative qualities it is endowed with, and how the manufacturer positions this device in its lineup. </p><h2>  The concept of the “younger” model </h2>

    <p>  There is nothing new in that the manufacturer company placed its smartphones in a certain “hierarchy”.  The highest position in it is occupied by the “flagship” - a phone that has the most serious technical characteristics and, therefore, costs more than anyone else.  They are followed by phones that are simplified in one way or another: one of them has a simpler camera, the other has a slightly less powerful processor, the third has a simpler display, and so on.  Thus, a line of devices is formed depending on their functionality and technical characteristics. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since we describe the Samsung 5360, it should be noted that it is the smallest of the presented devices by many criteria.  This applies both to the price of the phone, and to the size of its screen, processor power, RAM, and so on. </p><p>  Based on this, we can say that the Samsung Y 5360 is the most modest, but at the same time very good device in terms of functionality, which the company introduced in its lineup. </p><h2>  Design </h2>

    <p>  To characterize the appearance of the phones combined in the Galaxy line is quite simple.  The fact is that the developer (Samsung) did not try too hard to unify the appearance of all models.  Perhaps, she left some individual features for the top, flagship devices in view of their high cost and uniqueness of their kind.  As for the Samsung 5360, this model had a typical design for the line: a rectangular “brick” with smeared edges near the back cover and rounded edges.  As a result, we got a round “baby” with a characteristic “Samsung” protruding above the screen side edge coated with chrome;  a typical ribbed back cover and a standard set of elements for Galaxy: a speaker slot with a metal “mesh”, a screen lock key on the right side, a “rocker” for changing the sound level on the left, the Home button in the center, surrounded by the Back and “Options” on the right and left.  Nothing, in fact, new. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Continuing the theme of appearance, I would like to note the small size of the <span>Samsung Galaxy</span> 5360. The device is specially made compact in order to provide the user with maximum comfort from interacting with him.  We can safely assume that the phone is designed for those who do not want to wear a “shovel” with a 5-inch screen in the side pocket.  And the case width of 58 mm, together with a height of 104 mm, are excellent indicators for a portable device that is easy to take with you everywhere.  At the same time, you get the functionality that is most appropriate for modern smartphones (at least at the time of the release of the gadget). </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  As you remember, our “baby” Samsung GT 5360 is the “youngest” by all criteria.  The display is no exception.  There is a 3-inch screen, the resolution of which is only 240 by 320 pixels.  It is not worth saying once again that such parameters are far from being “flagship”.  Because of this, the user notices the effect of “grain” on such a screen from the first seconds of acquaintance with the device.  Yes, and movies in HD-quality, in view of such a small size, you will not look at it.  There remains a basic set of basic functions: calls, SMS, surfing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  The smartphone will also not be able to boast of powerful “hardware”.  And you can’t say that he needed it so much.  Here stands a Qualcomm processor with a clock frequency of 0.8 GHz, which clearly does not make the phone the most “smart”.  Obviously, manufacturers focused on the lack of the need to install a strong processor on this device.  Therefore, it is not surprising that over time, the phone begins to “slow down” and “freeze” due to a weak processor.  As evidenced by the reviews describing the Samsung GT 5360, a complete reset of the phone to the factory settings (and, of course, deleting all data on it) can cope with this problem. </p>

    <h2>  Communication </h2><p>  All Galaxy phones, as we are used to, work with two SIM cards.  At least, those who saw a couple of such devices can think so.  Phone Samsung 5360, which became the subject of review today, is an exception.  The model supports only one SIM card, so you can not say about it as economical, allowing you to spend less on communication services.  And in terms of comfort (if you have several SIM cards), this model is a bit behind: do not buy the second one for the other card ... </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Another criterion by which we can evaluate the device is the camera.  In Galaxy phones, as a rule, the Korean manufacturer offers a 5-megapixel module.  And here the Samsung GT S 5360 can be called an exception.  The model has a 2-megapixel camera, which for sure will not be high enough for everyday life.  Most likely, this phone will not be able to translate even the photographed text into a readable form.  Therefore, it is not worth hoping that you will make colorful photos using the device.  Samsung Young 5360 should obviously be used for some other purpose. </p><h2>  Memory </h2>

    <p>  But in terms of capacity, all Galaxy phones hold the mark.  The model we characterize has 160 MB of internal memory on which you can install applications and upload personal files.  In addition to them, there is also a slot for a memory card that works with microSD-format (the volume can reach 32 GB).  Allow yourself the opportunity to store so much information on your phone! </p><p>  However, given the small screen, it will be more likely to be about musical compositions than about any films or series. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The <span>Samsung Galaxy GT</span> 5360 introduced by us operates on the basis of the Android operating system.  Since the gadget was launched back in 2011, we are talking about a modification of Gingerbeard, version 2.2.  If we wanted to use it now, we would not be able to upgrade it to a newer generation of this OS. </p><p>  However, despite the fact that we are talking about an outdated version of the system, the phone still works with Android functionality.  This means that there is everything that an ordinary user may need: navigation, entertainment, communication, surfing, the ability to create your own content and manage existing ones.  All this is possible even on the “younger” Samsung S 5360. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The characteristic that we describe above describing <span>the Samsung</span> 5360 <span>model</span> allows you to create a general idea of ​​the smartphone, but it does not give an accurate understanding of how customers themselves relate to this model and what they think about it after a long interaction.  In particular, we do not know how the device shows itself during operation, what stability it shows and whether such a set of characteristics of buyers suits.  Best of all, the recommendations left on specialized resources with reviews of those who have already used the device help in this. </p><p>  Analyzing such recommendations, the first thing we pay attention to is their positive rating and the high ratings left by the phone.  Users mark the work of the smartphone with marks 4 and 5, which shows their high degree of satisfaction with how the gadget proved to be.  The arguments for such estimates are various factors.  One of the most relevant is the price (from 4,500 p.). </p><p>  The cost of the device, since it is the "youngest" model in the line, is much lower than other Galaxy phones.  For this reason, people buy an affordable device for some simple needs: to use as an alternative, for example.  As a result, the requirements for the device (due to the low price) are significantly underestimated. </p><p>  People note that they are satisfied with the processor, screen quality, device autonomy, its assembly.  In this regard, people in the comments do not complain at all. </p>

    <p>  For example, a smartphone camera received a negative assessment.  She really is not able to convey the image properly, because of which it can be called more likely set "for the look", and not for the sake of some real functional application.  Another point is software errors.  Since the gadget operates on the basis of a weak processor, some modules that require large system resources begin to fail.  This is manifested in the unstable operation of the phone and can be very annoying to the user. </p><p>  In general, as already noted above, the phone has a very high average mark, which makes it possible to talk about it as an excellent representative of its niche. </p>
