Due to currency fluctuations, many Russians refuse to travel abroad, and, as in the good Soviet times, are considering the possibility of relaxing in the domestic Black Sea resorts.  In this article we will consider the conditions of accommodation in Anapa.  This resort in the west of the Krasnodar Territory is no less famous than Sochi.  And in the summer season there are always many visitors.  How to book accommodation, so as not to be at the outskirts of the city, so as not to spend half a day going to the sea?  This article will be devoted to our article. </p><p>  Guest houses are ideal accommodation options.  After all, in state pensions, rest is expensive.  The price of the voucher simply includes a fee for using a huge territory.  Private apartment?  Close and no service.  And in private hotels there is a small area, you can park the car and have a good rest.  Here we look at Anapa guest houses near the Black Sea. </p>

    <h2>  Resort Features </h2><p>  This city has beaches for every taste - sandy and pebble.  The city center is located on the cape, that is, the sea surrounds it on three sides.  There is a long sandy beach called Anapa Peresypu.  It fringes the sea in an arc, forming a bay.  This shallow water quickly warms up, which makes Anapa a predominantly resort for families with small children.  Here are sandy beaches and a comfortable, gentle entry into the depths.  However, if you look for guest houses in Anapa near the sea, focusing exclusively on the map, then you may find yourself in an awkward situation.  And all because the city has an area called the High Coast.  The sea seems to be nearby, but it takes ten minutes to go to it.  But if the path does not scare you, as a reward for this you will get an excellent pebble beach.  There is also the former village of Vityazevo, which has now entered the city limits.  It is located behind the scythe, north of the center of Anapa.  Vityazevo is a very popular holiday destination because of its chic sandy beaches.  The tourist infrastructure in the former village is developing rapidly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Center </h2><p>  So, we clarified the situation with the resort areas.  Now consider guest houses in Anapa.  Prices, holidays, reviews - all this information will be described below.  Let's start our review with the center of Anapa.  Accommodation here is a great option for those who can not imagine their life without urban infrastructure.  Nearby there are shops, pharmacies, markets, restaurants and cafes, plenty of entertainment, shady parks.  Finding accommodation here is easy.  Almost every house is rented out for vacationers.  But how to find a good place? </p><p>  Some private hotels are quite large - for twenty or even fifty rooms.  But there are also such private houses in which only four or five rooms for vacationers are provided.  Among these mini-hotels we can recommend Praskovia.  Four wooden houses with all amenities are for rent in it.  Near each - a table with chairs under an umbrella from the sun.  To the sandy beach go about ten minutes.  Praskosya is located on one of the central streets - Shevchenko (at the intersection with Grebenskaya).  Near the supermarket "Magnet", post office and theater. </p>

    <h2>  Other guest houses in the center </h2><p>  The streets of Shevchenko, Samburov, Turgenev, Gorky, Grebenskaya are full of interesting places to place.  All of them provide a comfortable stay in Anapa.  Guest houses, private hotels, apartments for rent in the area for visiting holidaymakers.  However, during the peak season there may not be any free places.  To live in Anapa close to the sandy beach and close to the city infrastructure, you need to book a room in advance.  After all, it is the center that is filled first of all by vacationers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  ‚ÄúTatyana‚Äù is a three-story guest house where two, three and four-bed rooms of such categories as economy (bathroom on the floor) and standard (amenities in the room) are for rent.  This hotel is located at the intersection of Grebenskaya and Turgenev Streets.  It has a very beautiful green courtyard with a canopy from the sun.  As "chips", reviews note free Wi-Fi and the possibility of three meals a day with delicious homemade dishes. </p><h2>  The question of "daily bread" </h2><p>  In Anapa there is no shortage of restaurants and cafes for any wallet.  There are tourists who prefer to dine each time in a new place to compare cuisine and prices.  But there are many who like to dine in a trusted cafe.  Food poisoning in the south, and even on vacation - is an extremely unpleasant thing.  Therefore, let‚Äôs, if we are already talking about this, consider guest houses in Anapa with meals near the sea. </p><p>  In this regard, the resort city provides a wide selection.  There are hotels in the price of which breakfast is already included.  This, for example, "Three S", located on the street.  Shevchenko.  The cost of living in this guest house is 650 rubles per person.  "Comfort" on the Central street of the Sukko microdistrict offers excellent three meals a day, and asks for everything about everything seven hundred and fifty rubles per person.  Why not all inclusive?  And in ‚ÄúArina‚Äù (four hundred rubles per person) there is a kitchen for self-cooking, but you can order breakfast, half board or all three meals.  Not sure whether you will take food from the owners?  Then to you at Fotini.  Nearby there is a cafe with the same name and a beer bar.  To the sea from this guest house is fifty meters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  First line </h2><p>  All of the above guest houses in Anapa near the sea are located in close proximity to the sandy coast.  It should be said that they are all on the second or third line from the beach.  <span>Anapa embankment is</span> occupied by large state pensions and rest houses.  But it is especially lazy that you should walk as little as possible to the desired sea.  Better yet, live right on the beach.  Such tourists can recommend the hotel "Golden Bay".  Her cozy bungalows are located right on the shore, and vacationers have all the beach equipment.  Also on the first line are large hotels: Atlantis, Blue Lagoon, Captain, Valentina, Plaza, Park Hotel.  Among the guest houses that were as close to the sea as possible, one could mention Vera, Villa Ritu, Diamant, Southern House, Ardo, Caprice, Loris, Patio. </p><h2>  When priority is the pool </h2><p>  Many <span>residents of Anapa</span> are trying to earn money at health resorts.  Therefore, those with homes located away from the beach are trying to attract vacationers with increased comfort.  In addition to comfortable rooms, they offer landscaped grounds with all sorts of amenities.  Let's look at Anapa guest houses with a pool.  After all, when the sea is stormy, it‚Äôs nice to splash in the warm turquoise water or to cheer up in the morning with a sports swim.  Of course, having a pool immediately raises the cost of a bed.  So, in the Iliadis guest house, prices start from a thousand rubles in the low season (in June and September) in private hotels of V.A.Sh.  and "Jordan" the rest will cost even more - from 1200 and 2000 rubles, respectively.  The cheapest guest house with a swimming pool on the territory is ‚ÄúHayat‚Äù - from seven hundred rubles per person per day.  And the largest swimming tank is in the Sanmarin.  Prices there start from one thousand eight hundred rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Therapeutic rest </h2><p>  Anapa is also known as the health resort of Russia.  There are many sanatoriums where many people come for rehabilitation after illness.  But not all those who came to strengthen their health can afford to live in them.  Often people buy "kursovki" - a package of outpatient treatment and a set of procedures.  And such tourists live in the private sector.  You can recommend a guest house in Anapa to such vacationers, which is located near the sanatoriums of the health resort.  This, for example, "Michelle", "Olympus", "Eden."  There are also such private hotels in which it is also possible to use medical procedures, or there are doctors there.  Among these mini-hotels with a health profile can be called "Old Anapa" and "Bohemia." </p><h2>  <span>Anapa, Vityazevo:</span> guest houses near the sea </h2><p>  What is this area famous for?  It is separated from the city center by the spit on which the water park is located, and eleven kilometers.  Despite this remoteness, more and more people prefer to relax not in Anapa, but in Vityazevo.  What motivates them to go there?  Firstly, accommodation prices are lower here.  Secondly, at the height of the season there are no huge screaming crowds, and on sandy beaches it is more or less spacious.  Thirdly, more greenery, better environmental conditions.  As for infrastructure, it is in no way inferior to urban.  Here, vacationers will find <span>cafes, restaurants,</span> discos.  Nearby is the water park.  Such private mini-hotels are located near the sea: ‚ÄúOn Lazurnaya 1‚Äù (the name that reflects the address of the establishment), ‚ÄúQuiet courtyard‚Äù (the most budget guest house - from two hundred and fifty rubles), ‚ÄúAngelina‚Äù (with pool), ‚ÄúAnastasia‚Äù , "Astra", "Glory", "Azure Breeze", "Hope", "Alpha Costas" and others. </p><h2>  Anapa, Dzhemete: guest houses near the sea </h2><p>  Between the resort and Vityazevo is another interesting place.  He is called Dzhemete.  This is a village from one street - Pionersky Prospekt.  Why do many tourists choose a vacation on Dzhemete?  Near this area is located Chembursk Lake, connected to the Black Sea, in fact an estuary.  Wherever you settle, go to the beach for a maximum of four minutes.  After all, the Dzhemete district stretched along the Anapa ‚Äì Vityazevo highway.  Guest houses near the sea are located on both sides of Pioneer Avenue.  Which of them have a high level of service?  These are such as ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù, ‚ÄúSummer‚Äù, ‚ÄúOasis‚Äù, ‚ÄúTashir‚Äù, ‚ÄúVilla Costa‚Äù, ‚ÄúMig‚Äù, ‚ÄúItalmas‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnna-Teresa‚Äù, ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù (breakfast included), ‚ÄúJanis‚Äù , ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù, ‚ÄúSofia‚Äù, ‚ÄúKlim‚Äù, ‚ÄúAssol‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiana‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt Ruzanna‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Highland </h2><p>  This is another <span>area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAnapa.</span>  Even - part of its center.  As we recall, the resort city is located on the cape.  One side of this triangle overlooking the sea is called High Coast.  Here is the guesthouse of the same name.  But we are not interested in it, but in guest houses in Anapa near the sea.  There are several of them in the High Bank area.  But before starting the review, it should be noted that the beaches here are pebble.  The name of the area is not idle either.  This part of Anapa is elevated twenty-three meters above sea level.  Numerous stairs and slopes lead to the beaches.  As for private mini-hotels, among the most worthy are Leroux, Old Courtyard, Nut Grove, Family, Amber, Ardi and Compliment. </p><h2>  Anapa, Alekseevka </h2><p>  Right at the exit to Dzhemete is another area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe resort city.  It is called Alekseevka.  The reasons why many tourists choose this area for recreation are obvious.  It is quiet, calm, very green.  Nearby are the main highways connecting Anapa with Vityazevo, railway station, airport, Novorossiysk, Krasnodar.  The infrastructure of the district is also well developed.  There is a supermarket "Magnet" and the market "East".  In the Alekseyevka microdistrict, one can recommend such places as ‚ÄúGuest House on Ternova‚Äù, ‚ÄúNika‚Äù, ‚ÄúGloria‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoman‚Äù.  Prices in these mini-hotels are approximately the same as in the city center.  Judging by the reviews, the Alekseevsky Guest House has earned many flattering words. </p>

    <h2>  When you need to go to Anapa on vacation </h2><p>  In resorts, prices are largely dependent on the season.  But if all over the world the highest limit of the cost of rental housing coincides with the tourist peak, then in Russia this excitement falls on the summer months.  More precisely, in July and August.  But everyone says that in the Black Sea resorts of the Caucasus it is best in September.  But guest houses in Anapa - near the sea or at a distance from it - are aimed at summer tourists.  They begin to receive visitors, as a rule, from the first of June.  Prices are the lowest this month.  And after an unprecedented leap (sometimes twice), they return to their minimum in September.  According to many vacationers, the first month of autumn is the best time to travel to the resort.  There is no stuffy heat, a warm sea, a lot of fruit, few holidaymakers and the most optimal prices. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about mini-hotels </h2><p>  First of all, many note the convenient location of such a resort as Anapa.  Guest house near the sea can be rented in Dzhemete, Vityazevo, Alekseevka.  Often in these outlying areas the conditions in mini-hotels are better than in the city center, since they have more territory.  According to reviews, High Coast is good for lovers of a pebble beach.  There you can warm the bones to those who suffer from problems of the musculoskeletal system.  But, reviews warn, climbing stairs will not be very convenient for older vacationers and tourists with young children.  Otherwise, everyone responds positively regarding rest in any area, the main thing is to know what you need and choose a hotel based on your needs. </p>
