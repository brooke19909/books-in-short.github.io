Therefore, only the most daring adventurers dared to visit the country.  Now it is open to guests.  Gradually, Cambodia has become a popular holiday destination.  A country located in southeast Asia can offer not only a lazy vacation on the beach, but also educational trips through ancient temples and walks through the jungle.  According to tourists, Cambodia is an incredibly interesting country, which is worth seeing with your own eyes. </p><h2>  Climate of Cambodia </h2><p>  If you consider yourself an active traveler, then a beach holiday in Egypt or Turkey will definitely not surprise you.  Therefore, in search of new sensations and adventures, you can go to Cambodia.  On the Indochina Peninsula you will find wild beaches and quite modern resorts.  In addition, excursions to amazing places will make your stay memorable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.movetocambodia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beaches of cambodia" class="if uuid-2268667" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268667.jpg"></div><p>  Thinking about a trip to an exotic country, you must first understand the features of climatic conditions.  This will allow you to choose the best period for the trip.  According to reviews of Cambodia, the concept of a season in the country does not exist.  You can have a good rest on the coast at any time of the year.  Whenever you visit a country, the water temperature never drops below +21 degrees.  From the beginning of autumn to the beginning of spring, the most favorable period for a beach holiday lasts.  At a time when cold weather begins and winter comes, on the Siamese coast the air is already warming up to +28 ... + 30 degrees.  But in the rest of the months, the weather will not ruin your vacation.  According to reviews, Cambodia simply does not have bad weather.  Of course, rains still happen sometimes, but they do not affect the temperature of the water in the sea.  In addition, showers here pass very quickly. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The average annual air temperature in the country is +27 degrees.  From November to the end of February there is practically no rain.  Sometimes in the evenings it can be a bit cool (+17 degrees).  But the hottest months are May, April and March.  At this time, temperature indicators rise to +40 degrees.  Spring is good for relaxing for those tourists who are not afraid of heat. </p><p>  In general, the country's climate can be described as hot and tropical, which largely depends on the monsoon. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  According to tourists, in Cambodia, the coast stretches for many kilometers, and therefore there is a large selection of places to stay.  We give only the most popular beaches of the country.  The country's coast is ideal for snorkeling and diving.  Local beaches are incredibly beautiful and able to make a vacation unforgettable. </p><p>  One of the country's most famous beaches is Victoria.  It is located in the far part of Sihanoukville.  This beach is popular among Russian tourists.  It is known for its clean sand cover, clear sea and beautiful sunsets.  Flows of tourists to Victoria never decrease.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe beach there are cafes and hotels.  Here is the main attraction - the club of the Russian community "Airport". </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.movetocambodia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beaches of the resorts of Cambodia" class="if uuid-2268686" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268686.jpg"></div><p>  <span>The beaches of Cambodia</span> (reviews are given in the article) are distinguished by their natural beauty.  In search of a wonderful holiday, you should go to the island "Bamboo".  It is located in the south of the coast.  On Ko Russey you can enjoy not only beautiful beaches, but also see real coral reefs.  On the island there are hotels made in the form of bungalows.  Here you can have a great couple of nights.  All buildings are located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sea, so you will enjoy its beauty all day. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to reviews of Cambodia, one can say that another incredibly beautiful place is Otres Beach.  Located literally five kilometers from the city center.  Therefore, it is not so crowded, and the infrastructure is not intrusive.  The local coast has a length of about four kilometers.  Therefore, even wild areas can be found here.  But every year new bars and mini-hotels are being built in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãOtres beach.  The beach is known not only for its calm and positive atmosphere, but also for its wide variety of water activities. </p><p>  Independence Beach got its name from the hotel of the same name, which was built here in the seventies.  The complex is working to this day.  Part of the beach belongs to the hotel and is a closed territory.  But there is also an open part, on which not the guests of the complex can relax.  The coast is covered with clean sand, the entry into the sea is very gentle and comfortable. </p><p>  Soha beach has a length of about 1.5 kilometers.  It was here that the first five-star Cambodian resort was built.  Formally, the beach is owned by Soha Beach Resort, and therefore the entrance to it is closed.  But for a fee you can completely get on it.  You can also quite comfortably accommodate in public areas.  Soha beach is clean enough.  In addition, the absence of annoying merchants is encouraging. </p><p>  Ochutel beach is equipped with umbrellas and sunbeds.  There are numerous cafes on the coast.  Also along the road, many hotels and guesthouses have been built.  The water on the coast is clean enough, and the sand is white. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.lonelyplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Cambodia" class="if uuid-2268711" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268711.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of Cambodia, the sea is always warm.  Tourists note that the coast is reliably protected from the penetration of waves.  They almost never happen, but because the rest on the beach is not overshadowed by storms. </p><h2>  Cambodia Hotels </h2><p>  Currently, there are approximately 1300 hotels in Cambodia.  Among them there are complexes of different levels.  You can find a variety of options - even from 5-7 dollars (300-400 p.) Per night.  Mid-level housing will cost an average of 500-1500 p.  Well, the most luxurious five-star hotels offer rooms from 5,000 rubles and above.  Hotel service is quite actively developing in the country.  The construction of new complexes, guesthouses and restaurants is ongoing.  The largest selection of hotels is available in Phnom Penh, Sihanoukville, Siem Reale.  According to reviews, Cambodia hotels are so diverse that you can find rooms of any price category.  If you do not want to spend extra money or do not have such an opportunity, then you can pick up quite budget options. </p><h2>  Sihanoukville </h2><p>  Based on reviews about Cambodia, we can say that the most popular among our compatriots is the resort of Sihanoukville, Kepe and the local islands.  The most famous is Koh Rong.  It is not difficult to get to it from Sihanoukville by boats that run on a clear schedule. </p><p>  The cost of housing on the islands is quite acceptable.  Basically, the complexes are presented in the form of bungalows, the rental of which costs - 500-1000 r.  per day.  You can also go to the island of Koh Rong Layer.  All islands have very beautiful beaches and clear sea. </p><p>  Among the most worthy <span>hotels of Sihanoukville,</span> one can distinguish "Song Sea Private Island."  The five-star complex has beautiful comfortable rooms.  The hotel is located on two islets that are connected by a pedestrian bridge.  The guests of the establishment have the opportunity to settle in one of the villas, surrounded by greenery.  The hotel area is equipped with swimming pools and relaxation areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landmarks of the country" class="if uuid-2268723" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268723.jpg"></div><p>  Another good hotel, Golden Sand, is located near the beach.  The institution has only three stars, but this does not affect the service.  In general, choosing accommodation in Cambodia on your own based on reviews, remember that the cost of living in the country is largely determined by the proximity of the hotel to the beach. </p><p>  Tourists also praise the three-star Hotel Divers Inc Hotel.  Of course, it is remote from the beach, but it is equipped with an entertainment system. </p><h2>  Kep </h2><p>  According to tourists, on vacation in Cambodia you can go to Kep.  The resort is located on the shores of the Gulf of Thailand.  Previously, the city was the most popular among the French elite who came here to relax.  But later Sihanoukville was built.  Now Kep is not as crowded as in the old days.  From the city you can go on an excursion to the island of Rabbit. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="10.536089" data-lng="104.35591580000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="10"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/8/3/0/830.png"></div><p>  Beach House is one of the best hotels in the resort.  It is built right on the coast.  The hotel has entertainment.  Therefore, rest will certainly not be boring.  The complex leads the list of the best institutions in the city of Kep. </p><p>  But the four-star complex ‚ÄúSemania Beach Resort‚Äù offers guests a high level of service.  The hotel is located on the beach and consists of separate villas. </p><p>  The three-star Khim Voch Lei Bungalow complex is located a few kilometers from the coast.  Such a location more than pays off at an economical cost and excellent service. </p><h2>  Cambodia Attractions </h2><p>  If you are planning a vacation in Cambodia, then it is worth considering in advance what you would like to see in this amazing country.  There are enough sights here.  All of them are connected with historical and cultural heritage.  According to reviews, <span>excursions in Cambodia are</span> very diverse.  Colorful and exotic country attracts many tourists for a reason. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cambodia Attractions" class="if uuid-2268728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268728.jpg"></div><p>  One of the main attractions can be called the temple city of Angkor Wat, which was dedicated to the god Vishnu.  It is believed that the temple is the largest religious building in the world.  The complex is a complex three-level building with 5 towers and numerous passages and stairs.  The temple is the soul of the people, because it represents the skill and art of the Khmers.  The territory of the complex occupies about 400 square meters.  It houses a number of temples.  Angkor Thom is one of them.  It was erected in the 11th century.  Each of the temples is impressive and has its own characteristics. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Country beaches" class="if uuid-2268757" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268757.jpg"></div><p>  The Royal Palace is no less interesting.  Its golden roofs dazzle in the sun.  The palace is still striking in its architecture.  By the way, not all of his chambers are open to visitors, because the royal family still occupies part of the complex.  But tourists can visit the throne room, the silver pagoda, the Royal Treasury.  The palace was built in 1866.  The place for construction was land in the old quarters of the city.  Interestingly, even in our time, the <span>king of Cambodia</span> is considered the governor of the gods. </p><p>  Many tourists will be interested in visiting the Angkor National Museum.  It was opened in 2007.  The museum uses modern technology to tell the story of the Khmer empire.  An interesting fact is that the museum complex covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 20 thousand square meters.  Its exposition consists of eight thematic galleries. </p><h2>  Silver pagoda </h2><p>  Another attraction of Cambodia is the Silver Pagoda.  It is also called the pagoda of the Emerald Buddha.  In this amazing building, the floors are lined with real silver bars.  And along all the walls are valuable gifts presented to the king from the heads of other eastern and European countries.  The central part of the composition is a Buddha statue made of gold and decorated with diamonds.  The Silver Pagoda Complex also includes a number of buildings, including the ceremonial pavilion and the tomb of the king. </p><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  What is a good seaside vacation in Cambodia?  According to tourists, a beach holiday on the Cambodian coast will surely appeal to all lovers of exotic countries.  The variegated exotic of the tropics is amazing right when you exit the plane.  After a gray and dull winter at home, you find yourself in a real riot of colors.  Of course, many will say that Cambodia is a poor country.  And this is true, but there is another side, more attractive.  The local population is very welcoming.  Most people are Buddhists.  Moreover, the population is very religious.  Literally every house has its own Buddha statues. </p><p>  If this is your first trip to the country, then in all seriousness choose a resort.  Especially if you want to relax with your children.  Do not take risks and choose wild beaches.  Pay attention to proven and more equipped resorts.  According to <span>reviews, a holiday in Cambodia is</span> very interesting.  When choosing a good hotel you will get decent conditions at an affordable price.  Tourists recommend paying attention to the three-star establishments of famous resorts or go to the islands.  The choice is wide enough. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.planetware.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Top Attractions" class="if uuid-2268762" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2268762.jpg"></div><p>  In general, according to tourists, a holiday in Cambodia is very good, because the sea is always warm here, and the climate is suitable for year-round swimming.  A minor rainfall is not able to spoil the vacation.  Experienced travelers recommend seeing the most important shrines and attractions of the country.  Believe me, they are worth it. </p><h2>  From Pattaya to Cambodia </h2><p>  Reviews about an exotic country make many tourists want to see Cambodia.  If you have not yet decided to spend your vacation in an amazing country, you can take advantage of a very interesting offer.  Currently, tours to Cambodia from Thailand have become very popular.  Relaxing in one of the Thai resorts, you can go to Cambodia.  When buying a tour, you need to clarify this moment.  Then the tour operator will provide you with two visas.  Having all the necessary documents, you can go on an excursion to Cambodia and see the main attractions of the country, as well as form at least a superficial opinion of the country.  Who knows, maybe the next vacation you decide to spend is in Cambodia.  Reviews about the rest of experienced tourists inspire beginners to explore an exotic Asian country.  Moreover, the local climate favors a wonderful beach holiday. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Cambodia is an amazing <span>exotic country of</span> interest in terms of beach and sea recreation.  The tourist destination here has been developing not so long ago.  But still enough hotels and other facilities have already been built.  Holidays in Cambodia are good because you can find housing at various prices.  If the budget of your trip is very limited, pay attention to guesthouses and three-star hotels, among them you can choose quite acceptable options.  We hope our information will be useful to you. </p>
