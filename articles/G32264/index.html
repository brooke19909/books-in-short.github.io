    <h2>  "Nikolaev Posad" (Suzdal): reviews </h2><p>  To visit this hotel is equivalent to going to a fairy tale.  After all, not only the hotel is attractive, but also its wonderful environment, thoroughly saturated with the spirit of past centuries.  All the tourists who have ever rested in this hotel were satisfied with their travel and vacation, but they could not do without minuses.  The main complaints of guests include a temporary restriction on the use of the pool, the lack of bicycles for middle-aged children and the need for early booking of seats in the restaurant.  There are also some nuances in the work of the maintenance staff, for example, with the declared daily cleaning at some point this may not happen.  But there are still more positive reviews: delicious cuisine, a bewitching interior and exterior, and stunning views of old Suzdal. </p>
