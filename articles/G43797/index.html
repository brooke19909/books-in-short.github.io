The popularity of the camera in the commercial direction is due to the improved matrix (50.6 MP).  In addition, the device in question is characterized by a quick response, however, it is inferior to the main competitors in terms of photosensitivity.  This disadvantage is easily leveled by means of a pulsed <span>studio light.</span> </p><p>  The camera features include the ability to shoot with crop factors of 1.3-1.6 plus the presence of a horizon level in the viewfinder.  Photographers note that the model is great for the studio, but in nature its capabilities are limited. </p>

    <h2>  5D Mark IV Body </h2><p>  Canon‚Äôs fourth-generation 5D series SLR cameras are even more advanced.  The device with an increased number of megapixels up to 31.7 was equipped with a Wi-Fi and GPS module.  Now you can shoot in 4K plus a touch screen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The remaining characteristics are identical to the predecessor.  Using advanced optics, this camera is capable of shooting under almost any conditions, thanks to ISO working values ‚Äã‚Äãof up to 3200 units.  The model is equipped with a metal case, reliably protected from moisture and dust.  The camera is not afraid of light strokes, changeable weather, radio interference.  The modification has an excellent "rate of fire", autofocus allows you to clearly capture the most dynamic scenes.  Among the critical comments of users: a small buffer size, not a very fast processor. </p><h2>  EOS 7D Mark II </h2><p>  Canon's DSLR cameras in this series are great for sequential shooting, and have a high frame rate.  The latest modification reads up to 10 moments per second.  At the same time, frames are processed instantly, not limited by the number of images.  With this indicator, the shutter is quite relevant, the resource of which has been increased to 200 thousand. </p><p>  Aftofocus is also presented in the best possible way with 65 focus points of the cross configuration.  On the body there is a lever that serves to adjust the lens so as not to miss an important point when working in a rapidly changing environment.  There are various connectors and settings that allow you to record scenes in high quality.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- up to 60 frames per second (Full HD).  You can work with the camera in various weathers, the metal case is reliably protected from moisture and dust. </p>

    <h2>  EOS 70D KIT </h2><p>  This series of Canon SLR cameras has been a leader for several years.  The device has high quality characteristics, reliable protection against moisture and dust.  ISO works in the range of up to 1600 units, providing excellent image and pleasant color reproduction.  The shooting speed is 7 frames per second, the electronics processes the material without braking. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Auto focus takes into account 19 points.  This is slightly less than that of competitors, but it is practically not displayed on the final result.  The camera quickly captures the desired object with synchronous focusing.  A simple menu, touch screen and excellent ergonomics are appreciated by both professionals and novice photographers.  An additional advantage is the presence of a Wi-Fi module for aggregation with mobile devices. </p><h2>  600D </h2><p>  This camera was launched in 2011.  Its features include excellent ergonomics and ease of use.  The <span>Canon 600D</span> SLR replaced the EOS 550D.  The popularity of the device is due to an affordable price, the presence of a variety of settings and modes, as well as excellent image quality. </p><p>  The model is equipped with automatic focusing with 9 points and a viewfinder with optics.  In expanded form, the ISO mode is from 100 to 12,800 units.  There is support for external flash control without wires. </p><h2>  EOS 100D KIT </h2><p>  Digital SLR cameras Canon EOS 100D combine all the advantages of a digital apparatus and "SLR".  The mass of the device along with the battery is a little more than 400 grams.  When replacing a standard lens with a reduced fix, the device will occupy a minimum of space, which is very convenient for hiking and long trips. </p>

    <p>  The picture has a quality comparable to an amateur SLR camera, ISO - up to 800, the kit comes with a kit lens with a quiet "engine" STM, recognized by users as the best option for recording.  There is a focus option by touching the screen.  Compactness requires its victims, expressed in cut-off button functionality and uncomfortable grip.  Lack of ergonomics is compensated by an informative touchscreen display, an intuitively simple menu and reasonable prices. </p><h2>  EOS 1200D KIT </h2><p>  The model continues the budget line.  The price of a Canon 1200D KIT SLR camera starts from 26 thousand rubles.  The camera compared to its predecessor received an increased matrix resolution (up to 18 MP), Full HD shooting quality, as well as polymer lining on the case.  Despite the affordable price, the device is endowed with all the basic options for a SLR camera.  Consumers note the high build quality, the information content of the lens and an operating ISO of up to 800. </p><p>  Among the minuses: limited shooting speed (3 frames per second), fixed screen, lack of Wi-Fi and navigator modules.  Such shortcomings do not particularly affect the creative process.  The optimal combination of price / quality rightfully brings this unit to the leading position. </p><h2>  EOS 80D BODY </h2><p>  A new modification from Japanese manufacturers is actively conquering the market.  The Canon EOS 80D SLR camera differs from full-frame counterparts only in the crop factor.  <span>The size of the matrix</span> compared to the previous model grew to 24.2 MP, the focus point - from 19 to 45. This allows for accurate focusing, even when objects are located at the edges of the frame.  Phase auto focus makes it possible to shoot high-quality photos and videos.  The frame rate in Full HD mode increased to 60 pieces per second.  The device is suitable for reportage work, with a shooting speed of 7 frames per second.  Among other innovations: electronic level, support for Wi-Fi and NFC.  This is one of the best offers in the category of advanced "DSLRs", taking into account the ratio of price and quality indicators. </p><h2>  EOS 700D KIT </h2><p>  A reliable amateur device will please beginners with the versatility and balance of settings.  The Canon 700D DSLR is great not only for shooting, but also for recording scenes.  The device differs from analogues by a tracking automatic focus, the presence of a kit lens with a low-noise STM motor.  His work does not in any way affect the sound quality during video recording.  Full HD mode works in parameters 1280 to 720 (up to 30 frames per second). </p><p>  Another significant advantage of this device is a rotary touch monitor.  The buttons are located as standard: on the body of the ISO button, white balance and serial mode.  The shooting speed is 5 frames in one second, but for a long time it will not work at this pace due to a weak exchange buffer. </p><p>  The quality of the output image is one of the best in the budget category.  The capabilities of the technology are supplemented by ISO up to 1600, phase touch sensors, fast auto focus.  For the sake of justice, it is worth noting that the price is significantly higher than for analogues. </p><h2>  EOS 550D </h2><p>  Canon SLR cameras of this series appeared in 2010.  By and large, this is a stripped down version of the 7D model.  The device combines compactness and low weight of the case with excellent functionality and a wide range of settings.  The equipment is equipped with a 18 MP touch screen, has an increased range of light sensitivity (up to 12 800 units).  Auto focus supports 9 points.  The crop factor corresponds to 1.6, the maximum shooting speed is 4 frames per second.  Cost - about 36 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Parameters: </p><ul><li>  The number of pixels is 18. </li><li>  Resolution specifications (pixels) - 5184/3456 (photo), 1920/1080 (video). </li><li>  The screen size is 3.0. </li><li>  Dimensions - 129/97/62 mm. </li><li>  Weight - 530 g. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Canon EOS 1300D KIT SLR Camera </h2><p>  Another novelty from Japanese manufacturers.  The device belongs to the category of entry-level cameras.  Let's try to figure out what this technique is inferior to professional counterparts. </p><p>  "Mirror" is equipped with a touch screen 18 MP.  The type of screen is the same as that used primarily on semi-professional and amateur cameras.  He recommended himself exclusively on the positive side.  The large dimensions of the sensor make it possible to ensure high-quality shooting from a whale lens.  This is due to the fact that the larger the display area, the higher the similar parameter of each pixel.  This configuration has a positive effect on the quality of images. </p><p>  In the Canon EOS 1300D SLR camera, a DIGIC 4+ processor is responsible for image processing and speed.  This is not the most modern chip (there are already 6 variations).  However, it is worth remembering that we are talking about the youngest modification in the "DSLR" line, which does not really need an ultra-powerful processor.  So why overpay? </p><p>  The capabilities of this node largely characterize the other parameters of the camera.  For example, the "rate" of technology is 3 frames per second, which seems to be not so much.  But this is enough for the amateur photographer to fix flying jet aircraft. </p><h2>  Other "filling" </h2><p>  According to reviews, the reflex camera Canon EOS 1300D is equipped with electronics, which is enough to record Full HD video at intervals of up to 30 frames per second.  This opportunity allows you to capture not only quick sketches, but also creative masterpieces with further installation. </p><p>  The auto focus system remained at a level identical to past models.  The viewfinder has all the same nine points.  This is a traditional setting for amateur-class SLR cameras.  There is the possibility of sighting on the monitor through the camera matrix. </p><p>  Among the significant differences from its predecessors, the presence of a wireless control interface can be noted.  The new modification received a Wi-Fi module with NFC parameters.  This innovation allows for the aggregation of a camera with a mobile gadget for sharing images.  In addition, there is the possibility of remote control of the camera from a smartphone with image control on the phone‚Äôs display. </p>

    <h2>  Design </h2><p>  We will continue the review of Canon EOS 1300 SLR cameras by studying the interface and design of the device.  The body part is completely made of high-quality matte plastic.  There are rubber pads on the rear panel and handle.  In general, the exterior of the camera can be called ascetic, but not boring. </p><p>  The main external difference between the considered model from expensive analogues is the display.  Its main parameters: resolution - 920,000 pixels, diagonal - 3 inches.  Among the minuses noted by buyers are slowness, a noticeable gap between the screen and the protective glass, which reduces the quality of sighting at an acute angle.  Disadvantages do not critically affect the final result.  There is no touch interface; functions and modes are adjusted using buttons. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  Nikon and Canon SLR cameras of the same technical group have similar controls.  For the manual adjustment of the exposure parameters, the control disk under the thumb is responsible.  Separate keys are available for the following options: ISO, autofocus, shutter, white saturation, flash pop-up.  All options are available to activate with one touch. </p><p>  You can select the auto focus point using the provided button after pressing the key under the thumb.  Such a solution slightly reduces the speed of control of equipment during sequential shooting. </p><p>  Most of the settings are available for changing through the on-screen menu, activated by the Q button on the rear panel.  The same key is used to configure Live Yiew settings.
