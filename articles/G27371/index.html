    <p>  Of the technology in the rooms there is air conditioning, providing a pleasant coolness and freshness, a TV with satellite channels and a mini fridge.  Each room has an excellent spacious balcony with stunning views of the resort.  The furnishings of the rooms are rather modest, of furniture there are only beds, small bedside tables and a table with a mirror.  At the same time, it is quite cozy and comfortable.  Speaking about the work of technology, tourists note its serviceability.  Of course, some encountered minor breakdowns, but all of them were eliminated upon the first call to the hotel staff. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The wait staff is quite polite and pleasant, but not too quick.  In principle, for a 3 * hotel, this is normal.  The rooms are cleaned daily, bed linen and towels - as they become dirty.  The cleaning is superficial, but overall the rooms are kept clean and fresh. </p><h2>  Entertainment on site </h2><p>  Topkapi Beach Hotel 3 * in Mahdia (Tunisia) has a small territory, but there is enough entertainment here: a huge outdoor and indoor heated pools, as well as a pool for the youngest tourists. </p><p>  On the territory there is a small souvenir shop, as well as several shops where all tourists and vacationers can purchase everything they need.  Reviews emphasize that prices here are among the most affordable in the entire resort: you should not even try to find cheaper. </p>

    <p>  Hotel Topkapi 3 * (Mahdia) is recommended for a relaxing family vacation, but there is an excellent disco with a capacity of up to 100 people.  In the evenings, incendiary musical compositions sound here, all guests, even children, have fun.  All lovers of active and outdoor activities will be able to play tennis, beach volleyball.  An excellent spa complex with a bath, sauna and a range of excellent beauty treatments is available for all vacationers for a fee. </p><p>  Many vacationers emphasize the high quality of the animation: neither adults nor children will be bored here.  Among the vacationers, various sports are held, in the evening there are show programs for them involving magicians, dancers and singers. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Hotel Topkapi 3 * (Mahdia) offers all vacationers meals in their own restaurant.  This, perhaps, is the main drawback that almost all vacationers refer to.  Breakfast here is scarce: even in season you will not see fresh fruits on the table, they really are not enough.  Lunches and dinners are more varied, but you should definitely not expect anything from them: potatoes, pasta, baked vegetables, chicken or fish, a little baking.  Of course, no one will remain hungry, but you will definitely not get much pleasure from eating here. </p>

    <p>  If you consider yourself a true gourmet, want to get acquainted with the national cuisine of Tunisia, we recommend that you refuse to eat at the <span>hotel</span> and eat at local cafes and restaurants. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel is on the first coastline, has its own sandy beach, sunbeds and umbrellas are free for all vacationers.  The beach is wide, clean, the sea is simply amazing.  Sun loungers and umbrellas, even in high season, enough for everyone.  It is necessary to be prepared for the fact that beach towels are not given out at the hotel - they will have to be taken with you.  A rental point for sports and water activities is open on the beach: tourists often rent parachutes, ride bananas and dive. </p>

    <p>  The beach is ideal for families with small children: warm fine sand, gentle entry into the water, a small depth of sea water in the coastal zone.  That is why so many families spend their holidays here. </p><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  In other words, the Topkapi 3 * hotel (Mahdia) is an excellent option for a relaxing family vacation.  The resort is located in a picturesque place of Tunisia, surrounded by greenery, gives the opportunity to spend several days on the chic coast of the Mediterranean Sea.  This is a modest budget option that many will surely enjoy.  Of course, it is not without a number of shortcomings, but as a whole corresponds to its description. </p>
