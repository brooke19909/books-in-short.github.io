Abandoned buildings excite the imagination, and with all sorts of legends and rumors hovering around these places, interest in the latter only intensifies.  Some of them, the most unusual and mystical, attract the special attention of onlookers, and so much so that the most impressionable, as they say, run cold in their veins.  One of such strange, abandoned objects is the Rossiya Hotel in Nizhny Novgorod (address - 2-A Verkhne-Volzhskaya Embankment).  The hotel building is classified as a ‚ÄúCultural Heritage Site‚Äù. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Russia Nizhny Novgorod" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2173108.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Hotel "Russia" in Nizhny Novgorod: history </h2><p>  Having visited at least once on the Verkhne-Volzhskaya embankment, they probably remembered the impressive size of the building, on the facade of which an old faded sign flaunts: "Russia".  It is known that this house was built in the period from 1931 to 1935.  The author of the project was architect A.Z. Greenberg.  Hotel "Russia" in Nizhny Novgorod (photo presented in the article) attracts the eye with a light facade, beautiful balconies, huge windows.  The interior consists of wide stairs and corridors, high ceilings and white columns.  These walls are witnesses to the lives of thousands of people whom they have dutifully watched for many years. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Excavations </h2><p>  Eyewitnesses say that several years ago, archaeologists began excavations here, during which a whole necropolis was discovered at the site where the Rossiya Hotel is now (Nizhny Novgorod)! </p><p>  It turns out that once there was the St. George Church, which was completely destroyed in the 30s, and near the churches, as you know, in ancient times cemeteries were built.  During the excavations, which lasted for about three years, a huge amount of objects (coins, women's jewelry, children's toys, etc.) were found at this place that were once owned by people who lived in the XIII - XX centuries.  In addition, scientists raised to the surface about 20 cubic meters.  m of human remains that are still unburied.  Eyewitnesses say that the hotel still has boxes with bones.  Many feel uneasy about the fact that in the very center of the city there is, in fact, a burial ground. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Russia Nizhny Novgorod reconstruction" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2173078.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Bunker </h2><p>  According to information contained in historical sources, in the building of the former Hotel "Russia" in Nizhny Novgorod, in the fall of 1941, a special object "No. 74" appeared.  This encrypted military bunkers designed for the ‚Äúleader of all nations‚Äù Joseph Stalin.  Shelters from the bombing were built in several cities: in Kuibyshev (Samara), Yaroslavl, Kazan, Stalingrad, Saratov.  In Gorky, the cabinet was built at a depth of 36 m in record time.  Last spring, blogger Valery Shantsev published documents confirming the existence of secret shelter.  In the hotel itself at that time there were 380 rooms.  It is known that in one of them in 1943, Lavrenty Beria himself (the people's commissar of internal affairs) stayed.  In 1944, the base of the hotel building began to collapse, as the builders damaged the drainage system, the creation of which dates back to the beginning of the 19th century.  Therefore, shortly after the war ended, it was decided to liquidate the bunker: its cabinets and adits were covered with sand and stone, and all utilities were dismantled. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel Russia Nizhny Novgorod photo" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2173079.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Acquaintance </h2><p>  Hotel "Russia" in Nizhny Novgorod, later renamed the "Volga slope", is one of the largest city hotels.

You can walk to the street.  Sverdlov.  The airport is a 40-minute drive, and it takes about 10 minutes to get to the railway station.  Before closing for reconstruction (the building has not been in operation since 2008), the hotel had 180 rooms: </p><ul><li>  single; </li><li>  double rooms; </li><li>  suites; </li><li>  apartments. </li></ul><h2>  In the rooms </h2><p>  Facilities for guests in the rooms were provided by the presence of: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  air conditioner; </li><li>  TV </li><li>  Phone </li><li>  radio; </li><li>  a refrigerator; </li><li>  bathroom; </li><li>  hair dryer. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2173069.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Infrastructure and service </h2><p>  Hotel guests could use: </p><ul><li>  conference room; </li><li>  banquet hall. </li></ul><p>  The guests were provided with the following services: </p><ul><li>  <span>a beauty salon (hairdresser)</span> ; </li><li>  taxi order; </li><li>  first-aid post; </li><li>  parking; </li><li>  a store; </li><li>  24-hour front desk </li><li>  laundry room. </li></ul><p>  In addition, you could use: </p><ul><li>  safe at the administrator; </li><li>  dental office; </li><li>  a sauna; </li><li>  a restaurant; </li><li>  Cafe; </li><li>  the bar. </li></ul><p>  Breakfast was included in the room rate. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  The guests did not speak favorably about their stay at the hotel.  The authors of the posts characterizing the local service believed that choosing this hotel can only be found if absolutely necessary to find a place to sleep.  The experts abstained from recommending the hotel for comfort lovers. </p><h2>  Hotel misadventures </h2><p>  In 2003, the Volzhsky Slope Hotel (Russia) was transferred to the Oktyabrskaya State Enterprise, but over the next three years it was regionally owned.  In 2006, the hotel was declared bankrupt, liquidated and sold.  In 2007, the hotel-service company became the owner of the historic building, which acquired the hotel for 204 million rubles.  The investor plans to invest 3.5 billion rubles in a 2-year reconstruction of the facility.  In 2009, the object was not commissioned again, the project was postponed indefinitely due to the presence of financial problems. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="former hotel russia in nizhny novgorod" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41600/2173066.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  More details </h2><p>  Experts believe that the Rossiya Hotel (Nizhny Novgorod), which at the beginning of the 2000s, was prudently renamed the Volzhsky Slope (a less pathos name), the management intentionally launched to a terrifying state.  It is assumed that the scheme worked here, which was once applied to the Vodnik and Tramplin stadiums: at first the monuments were brought to a state of ruins, after which they made a ‚Äúweighed‚Äù decision that it was impossible to preserve them. </p><h2>  The current state of the hotel </h2><p>  Also, experts drew attention to the fact that the construction of the building was difficult, deviations from competent technology were allowed in it, as a result of which cracks appeared on the facades of the building in 1933.  In addition, the building has not been operated since 2008 - this also caused damage to its technical condition. </p><h2>  Hotel "Russia" (Nizhny Novgorod): reconstruction </h2><p>  The owner of the building, which has been Service-Hotel LLC since 2006, commissioned a study that revealed that as a result of the poor quality of construction and further operation of the facility, its technical condition worsened at an accelerated pace, the structures were hit by opportunistic microorganisms, the elimination of which is impossible.  Scientific research and expert conclusions formed the basis of project documentation, providing for the simultaneous replacement of all building structures. </p><h2>  Protests and Courts </h2><p>  The approval of the project actually gave a green light to the demolition of the monument.  The Department of State Protection of Cultural Heritage Sites prepared a decision to cancel the coordination of project documentation, giving the right to carry out work on adapting the Rossiya Hotel (Nizhny Novgorod) for modern use.  The arbitration court upheld the statement of the owner of the Service-Hotel LLC on the recognition of the decision to cancel the approval as illegal. </p><p>  It is known that some Nizhny Novgorod people are actively gathering signatures for the revival of the temple.  Orthodox activists believe that the neglected state of the hotel is explained by the fact that initially this idea was sinful - to build on the site of the cemetery. </p><h2>  Perspective </h2><p>  As stated by the owner, to date, an investor has already been found who agreed to finance the reconstruction of the hotel.  As a result, the hotel building is expected to consist of residential and public buildings and an underground car park. </p>

    <p>  LLC Buigstroy (owned by the French Bouygues Batiment International) and CJSC Mosfundamentstroy-6 announced their intention to build a hotel of the first class in the city of the Volzhsky Slope hotel (formerly Rossiya Hotel).  When conducting a survey of the condition of the building, the experts emphasized the need to preserve the appearance of the facades of the former hotel due to the fact that the building is an integral part of the city‚Äôs river panorama and blends in seamlessly with the environment.

The developers announced their intention to complete the reconstruction of the building by 2018.
