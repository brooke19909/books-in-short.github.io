It seems that soon the next salary, but at the moment there is no money.  What to do and where to get the money right now?  Answers to these questions can be found in this article. </p><h2>  Where to get money right now: reliable ways </h2><p>  The surest way to solve such a problem is to save some amounts of money in advance in order to use them in a difficult situation.  Even a small amount during the year can turn into a good <span>airbag</span> for the family budget.  Not without reason knowledgeable people advise always to save up to 10% of wages every month in the piggy bank.  Thus, having such a piggy bank, you can not worry about the question of where to get the money right now.  This method allows you to always feel financially secure, as unforeseen situations can happen at any time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get the money right now" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/783485.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Help friends and acquaintances </h2><p>  However, not everyone has the opportunity to save even a small amount of money, and some simply do not have enough internal discipline.  Then, once in a difficult financial situation, you can use the following method.  Surely everyone has friends, proven over the years, who will not refuse in a difficult situation.  Then you can turn to them with a request to lend a certain amount of money.  If there are no such friends, then you can ask your relatives for help.  That is, wondering where to get the money right now, you can safely contact your loved ones who can help out at the moment.  Naturally, the necessary amount should be returned on time, while thanking a small gift for the service provided.  It may even be a chocolate bar, but a sign of appreciation is more important here, because in the near future financial assistance from friends, acquaintances or relatives may again be required. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get money right now with a bad credit history" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/783491.jpg" width="600"></div>

In this case, a perfect way out of this situation can be a loan at a bank or <span>credit institution.</span>  The most attractive in this case is the bank.  Here you can take a loan for a certain period at lower interest than in microcredit organizations.  However, banking organizations have the disadvantage of considering the application too long.  A person who is looking for where to get the money right now does not have time to consider the application within a week, and sometimes several weeks.  Then you can contact another credit institution, where the application is considered within a few minutes, less often hours. </p><h2>  If your credit reputation is damaged </h2><p>  Quite often there are unscrupulous borrowers who, having got into an unpleasant financial situation, are looking for where to get money right now with a <span>bad credit history.</span>  Here, a microfinance organization can also come to the rescue, which can get a loan for up to one year.  To receive such a cash loan, it is enough to simply present your passport and pre-fill the application.  MFI managers do not check the credit history of their clients, therefore, if the bank refused to grant a loan, you can safely contact this credit institution.  However, it should be remembered that the interest on the loan will be significantly higher than in banks, therefore it is better to arrange a loan for a short period. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get money right now in St. Petersburg" class="if" height="230" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/783498.jpg" width="230"></div>

There can be many reasons for this, such as the lack of a steady income, the presence of an outstanding loan, or others that prevent getting a loan.  The way out of this situation can be an ordinary pawnshop.  When the question is where to get the money right now, it can help a lot.  Having any precious thing, you can turn it over to a pawnshop.  At the same time, you don‚Äôt have to worry about growing interest, but only if the thing is no longer needed.  If you don‚Äôt want to part with the jewel, then it will be possible to redeem it when free money appears.  It should be remembered that the value of the collateral will increase every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Where to get the money right now" class="if" height="486" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23734/783488.jpg" width="600"></div>
