Known since the 12th century, she repeatedly changed both the appearance and the name, always remaining beautiful and crowded. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="57.6225397" data-lng="39.88672919999999" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/0/5/6/11056.png"></div><h2>  Feast of the Epiphany (Baptism) of the Lord </h2><p>  The process of the spread of Christianity in Russia fell on the XI-XII centuries.  The construction of Orthodox churches, mainly wooden, was carried out primarily in large cities.  Around them formed the appearance of the settlement. </p><p>  In Yaroslavl, on the banks of the Kotorosli River, the first church was built at the end of the XI century and is dedicated to the feast of the Epiphany.  According to legend, it was here that the pagans were baptized.  The tradition remains to this day.  The main Yaroslavl ice hole - Jordan - is cut in the ice of Kotorosli near the walls of the Epiphany Church, now stone. </p><h2>  Formation of the Epiphany Square of Yaroslavl </h2><p>  The area began to take shape simultaneously with the appearance of the eponymous temple, the first religious building in the city.  A small platform near the church was called Epiphany. </p><p>  In the XIII century, the old territory of Yaroslavl, the Chopped City, no longer fit the population in its walls;  beyond its borders, the construction of the Earth City began.  At the same time, the construction of the Spassky Monastery was begun in these places.  It is a mistake to believe that the monastery, built several centuries after the birth of the city, is its Kremlin.  Unfortunately, the ancient Kremlin was not preserved, and it was located in a slightly different place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": Alex, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spassky Monastery" class="if uuid-2938672" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2938672.jpg"></div><p>  In the XIV century, next to the road to Uglich, they began the construction of a convent, which was christened Rozhdestvensky.  Built to the glory of the victory of the Russian army on Kulikovo Field on the day of the Nativity of the Virgin, it did not stand very long and was burned during the time of Troubles.  Later, on the site of the monastery, the Church of the Nativity of Christ was erected, which gave the name to the new site leading from it to the Spassky Monastery. </p><p>  Epiphany Square of Yaroslavl, which surrounded the church built of red brick, already then adjoined from the east to the new, Christmas venue.  Since both squares were located on one of the main roads (Moscow), shopping malls and warehouses began to be actively built on them since the 16th century.  In 1778, these two territories merged and became the main trading area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, Rozhdestvenskaya. </p><h2>  New history of the square </h2><p>  After the revolutionary uprising, the city changed its appearance and name.  But the eponymous church on Epiphany Square in Yaroslavl survived, although it was beaten with fragments and bullets.  In 1918, the Yaroslavl Restoration Commission was created, headed by the architect P.D. Baranovsky.  Thanks to her efforts, it was possible to preserve, and later restore, many historically valuable objects of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In 1920, at the request of postal workers, Rozhdestvenskaya Square was given a new name - named after V.N. Podbelsky, the first People's Commissar of Post and Telegraph. </p><p>  By this time, the shopping arcade, called the Gostiny Dvor, was almost completely lost.  Christmas Temple in 1929 was demolished to expand the roadbed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Epiphany Church" class="if uuid-2938675" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2938675.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport node </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, even before the revolution, tram tracks were laid here that connected different areas of Yaroslavl.  In 1960, to give the square, located in the center, a more significant appearance, the tram tracks were dismantled, the circle was transferred to a neighboring street.  But the area has not ceased to be a major transport hub.  Many bus and trolleybus routes come together with a stop on Epiphany Square in Yaroslavl.  And in the 90s of the last century, the squares returned the historical name. </p><h2>  Square Attractions </h2><p>  The former Cherepakhin house, built at the end of the 18th century, is of architectural value.  But regarding our topic, it is important in that it participated in the formation of the Epiphany Square in Yaroslavl.  The two-story building is made of brick, rests on supports and is decorated with stucco molding on the facade. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monument to Yaroslav the Wise" class="if uuid-2938673" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2938673.jpg"></div><p>  The monument to Yaroslav the Wise was erected at the beginning of the ancient path to Moscow in 1993.  Distinguished guests arrived at its opening: President B. N. Yeltsin and Patriarch Alexy II.  The founder of the city, as conceived by the author, is a builder and defender at the same time, leaning on a sword and holding a mock fortress in his hand. </p><p>  The Epiphany Church, the preserved historical and cultural value of the city, is unique.  For the first time in the construction, pillarless technology was applied.  The building stands on the foundation, without underlay.  The facade is decorated with two rows of kokoshniks, and five high drums crowned with cupola tower above the temple.  Special attention is required to the tiles that adorn the building from the outside. </p><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": Alex, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Painting in the temple" class="if uuid-2938674" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/52060/2938674.jpg"></div><p>  The floral ornament on them is conveyed by paints of five colors, which gives the building an elegant, festive look.  The interior painting is old, on biblical themes.  The temple, of course, has its own shrines.  The premises are used today for religious and educational purposes.  The current church works for several hours a day as a museum of Yaroslavl.  Epiphany Square is therefore known to all citizens. </p><p>  The house that belonged to the spiritual department is an 18th-century building.  Today it is used for its purposes by the Art Institute. </p><p>  And in memory of the large shopping arcades of Gostiny Dvor, modern shops with the name Gostiny Dvor are built here. </p>
