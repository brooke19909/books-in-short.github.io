    <h2>  Device </h2><p>  Duct air conditioning with fresh air flow consists of a pair of modular designs.  The compressor-condenser part aggregates with the internal evaporation element using a pipeline in which there are electric wires and freon.  The external sector is mounted from the outside of the building, and the internal part has several installation variations: </p><ol><li>  In the hollow part of the false ceiling. </li><li>  In the false wall. </li><li>  In the pantry or other utility room. </li></ol><p>  Thanks to the hidden placement of the evaporation unit, the use of the system becomes more practical, especially when implementing original design projects.  Channel air conditioning is supplied for an apartment without a ready-made air distribution system.  It is being worked out when creating a project. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Inside the box there are the following elements: </p><ul><li>  Powerful fan. </li><li>  Heat exchanger. </li><li>  Electronic control board. </li><li>  Tank for condensate collection. </li></ul><p>  Since the cooling of a large area is accompanied by the release of a significant amount of condensate, some modifications have a drainage pump. </p><h2>  How does the device work? </h2><p>  There is a channel air conditioner with an influx of fresh air according to the scheme characteristic of all representatives of this type of equipment.  The unit is based on a heat pump, in the circuit of which refrigerant circulates.  In addition, there are radiators, connecting tubes and a compressor that makes the gas move in a circle. </p>

    <p>  Heat is transferred by alternating refrigerant compression.  The first stage is carried out in the outer circuit of the radiator, while the gas temperature rises.  Due to the thermal difference, heat exchange begins between the refrigerant and the air, as a result of which the gas gives off energy received from the air mixture in the room.  The heat transfer rate is maintained by an external radiator fan. </p><p>  In the external compartment, the pressure increase is ensured by means of a special throttle that allows small amounts of gas to pass through.  Due to this, the injected refrigerant accumulates in the cavity in front of the throttle and is compressed.  As a delayed device, an ordinary long tube (capillary) is used. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Compression pressure is calculated taking into account the possibility of gas condensation during cooling.  This is due to the fact that when the refrigerant is converted into a liquid, the efficiency of the ducted air conditioner increases with the influx of fresh air, since more heat is released.  As a result, the efficiency of the heat pump increases significantly.  An outdoor heat exchanger is often called a condenser. </p><p>  The liquid refrigerant through the throttle enters small doses into the internal radiator, where, under the influence of low pressure, the liquid evaporates, again transforming into a gaseous state.  A small volume of gas occupies the entire space of the evaporator, which contributes to its expansion.  Subsequent cooling and heating of the refrigerant allows you to achieve a constant repeat cycle. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Modern home air conditioners with fresh air inflow are designed so that there is the possibility of refrigerant transfer, allowing you to turn the internal radiator from the evaporator into a condenser, and the external analog - vice versa.  Such a solution makes it possible to pump heat in the reverse order, as a result of which the unit will function to heat the room. </p><p>  A feature of this design is the minimum energy consumption.  The user receives warm masses from cold air.  Compared to standard heaters on heating elements, this system will save significantly on electricity.  On average, four times more heat is generated for every kilowatt consumed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The operation of the unit is appropriate for the temperature conditions recommended by the manufacturer, since a significant decrease in air temperature can lead to zero effect when using the equipment in heating mode. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  Channel air conditioning for an apartment can be of several types.  The first distinguishing feature is the head pressure of the indoor unit fan (pressure measured in Pascals).  The following types of equipment are distinguished: </p><ul><li>  Low pressure models (up to 50 Pa). </li><li>  Medium pressure options (up to 150 Pa). </li><li>  High pressure modifications (up to 300 Pa). </li></ul><p>  It should be borne in mind that with greater <span>aerodynamic drag</span> in the ducts, a stronger pressure will be required for the possibility of air circulation. </p>

    <p>  Also, household air conditioning with an influx of fresh air is divided by the type of electrical circuit (operating mode): </p><ol><li>  Units with start / stop system.  Such devices are equipped with a compressor operating at a constant single speed.  This leads to the presence of an almost constant power indicator.  Maintaining temperature is controlled by a cooler circuit breaker. </li><li>  Variants of the inverter type belong to the more "advanced" models.  They are equipped with a special electronic device, which makes it possible to generate alternating current of any frequency.  This solution allows you to adjust the speed of the compressor and the power of the heat pump. </li></ol><h2>  Installation of duct air conditioner </h2><p>  Installation of the device consists in the following steps: </p><p>  The choice of location for fixing the external unit.  It is desirable that it is located on the north side or in the shade.  Residents of apartments in multi-storey buildings should mount the unit near the balcony, which will facilitate maintenance of the device.  The unit is located below the internal analogue at a distance specified by the manufacturer. </p><ol><li>  At the installation site of the internal part, a hole with a diameter of 8 centimeters is drilled, which will serve for laying communications.  The final size depends on the identical duct index. </li><li>  Brackets are fixed on the wall, an external unit is installed on them.  It should be placed strictly horizontally.  The maximum permissible spacing between the wall and the fixture is 100 mm. </li><li>  The room is mounted on the inside of the unit.  The best option is to fix the unit directly to the ceiling or wall, which eliminates the vibration of the equipment.  Otherwise, vibration dampers should be used. </li><li>  Further installation of the channel air conditioner is to connect the electrics.  A separate wire is drawn from the <span>distribution panel</span> to the indoor unit.  Its cross section should not be less than 1.5 square meters.  mm  The main line connection is through a circuit breaker.  Then the terminals of both blocks are connected. </li></ol>

    <h2>  Installation of freon pipelines </h2><p>  This operation includes the following manipulations: </p><ol><li>  A pair of copper tubes is cut off using a pipe cutter.  Their length should be 1000 millimeters longer than the distance between the fittings, which will ensure smooth bends. </li><li>  On the external parts of the workpiece are bent by means of a pipe bender.  Without this device, the metal can deform and crack. </li><li>  The tubes are equipped with heat insulating nozzles made of polyurethane. </li><li>  Threaded flanges are attached to the edges of the elements. </li><li>  Rolling of the ends of the workpieces is carried out.  Tighten the nuts preferably with a torque wrench.  Excessive force can damage the device. </li><li>  The ends of the tubes are screwed through threaded flanges, which must be tightened tightly. </li></ol><h2>  Final work </h2><p>  From the outside of the building, wiring, drainage and freon conduits are fixed with clamps or masked in a special box.  The hole is blown with foam.  Then the system is evacuated.  The pump must run for 60 minutes, which allows excess moisture to completely evaporate.  The refrigerant is launched into the circuit, while monitoring the pressure readings.  Next, the unit is included for testing.  If the system works without failures, connect the air ducts using flexible rubberized or canvas inserts. </p>

    <p>  If you ignore these measures, the volume of air passing will be reduced, and the unit will not be able to maintain the temperature set by the consumer.  In addition, the device may simply break or leak in the indoor unit.  The price of a ducted air conditioner is not so small as to risk its serviceability, neglecting basic operating rules.  The frequency of maintenance and technical work is indicated in the user manual. </p>
