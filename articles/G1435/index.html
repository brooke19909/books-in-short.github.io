    <p>  The use of nuclear energy is developing in two directions: use in energy and the use of radioactive isotopes. </p><p>  Initially, nuclear energy was supposed to be used only for military purposes, and all developments went in this direction. </p><h2>  The use of nuclear energy in the military sphere </h2><p>  A large number of highly active materials are used for the production of nuclear weapons.  According to experts, nuclear warheads contain several tons of plutonium. </p><p>  Nuclear weapons are classified as <span>weapons of mass destruction</span> because they produce destruction in vast territories. </p><p>  According to the radius of action and charge power, nuclear weapons are divided into: </p><ul><li>  Tactical. </li><li>  Operational and tactical. </li><li>  Strategic. </li></ul><p>  Nuclear ammunition is divided into atomic and hydrogen.  Nuclear weapons are based on uncontrolled chain reactions of fission of heavy nuclei and <span>fusion reactions.</span>  For a chain reaction using uranium or plutonium. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The storage of so many hazardous materials is a great threat to humanity.

    <p>  For the first time, nuclear weapons were used in 1945 to attack the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The consequences of this attack were catastrophic.  As you know, this was the first and last use of nuclear energy in a war. </p><h2>  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) </h2><p>  The IAEA was created in 1957 with the aim of developing cooperation between countries in the field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.  From the very beginning, the agency has been implementing the program ‚ÄúNuclear Safety and Environmental Protection‚Äù. </p><p>  But the most important function is to monitor the activities of countries in the nuclear field.  The organization ensures that the development and use of nuclear energy occurs for peaceful purposes only. </p><p>  The purpose of this program is to ensure the safe use of nuclear energy, protect people and the environment from radiation.  The agency also studied the consequences of the Chernobyl accident. </p><p>  The agency also supports the study, development and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and acts as an intermediary in the exchange of services and materials between members of the agency. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Together with the UN, the IAEA defines and establishes safety and health standards. </p><h2>  Nuclear power </h2><p>  In the second half of the forties of the twentieth century, Soviet scientists began to develop the first projects for the peaceful use of the atom.  The main direction of these developments was the electric power industry. </p><p>  And in 1954, the <span>world's first nuclear power</span> plant was built in the USSR.  After this, fast-growing nuclear power programs began to be developed in the USA, Great Britain, Germany and France.  But most of them have not been met.  As it turned out, the nuclear power plant could not compete with stations that operate on coal, gas and fuel oil. </p>

    <p>  But after the onset of the global energy crisis and the rise in oil prices, the demand for nuclear energy has grown.  In the 70s of the last century, experts believed that the capacity of all nuclear power plants could replace half of the power plants. </p><p>  In the mid-80s, the growth of nuclear energy slowed down again, the countries began to revise plans for the construction of new nuclear power plants.  This was facilitated by both the energy conservation policy and the reduction in oil prices, and the disaster at the Chernobyl station, which had negative consequences not only for Ukraine. </p><p>  After that, some countries completely stopped the construction and operation of nuclear power plants. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Atomic energy for space travel </h2><p>  More than three dozen nuclear reactors flew into space, they were used to generate energy. </p><p>  For the first time, the Americans used a nuclear reactor in space in 1965.  Uranium-235 was used as fuel.  He worked for 43 days. </p><p>  In the Soviet Union, the Romashka reactor was launched at the Institute of Atomic Energy.  It was supposed to be used on spacecraft along with <span>plasma engines.</span>  But after all the tests, he was not launched into space. </p><p>  The next Buk nuclear installation was used on a radar reconnaissance satellite.  The first device was launched in 1970 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. </p><p>  Today, Roscosmos and Rosatom are proposing to construct a spacecraft that will be equipped with a nuclear rocket engine and will be able to reach the moon and Mars.  But for now, this is all at the proposal stage. </p><h2>  Industrial nuclear applications </h2><p>  Atomic energy is used to increase the sensitivity of chemical analysis and production of ammonia, hydrogen and other chemicals that are used to produce fertilizers. </p>

    <p>  Nuclear energy, the use of which in the chemical industry allows you to get new chemical elements, helps to recreate the processes that occur in the earth's crust. </p><p>  Nuclear energy is also used to desalinate salt water.  Application in the steel industry allows the reduction of iron from iron ore.  In color - used for the production of aluminum. </p><h2>  The use of nuclear energy in agriculture </h2><p>  The use of nuclear energy in agriculture solves the problems of breeding and helps in pest control. </p><p>  Nuclear energy is used to produce mutations in the seeds.  This is done to obtain new varieties that bring more crops and are resistant to diseases of crops.  So, more than half of the wheat grown in Italy for the production of pasta was bred using mutations. </p><p>  Also, using radioisotopes determine the best ways to fertilize.  For example, with their help, it was determined that during the cultivation of rice, the introduction of nitrogen fertilizers can be reduced.  This not only saved money, but also saved the environment. </p><p>  A slightly strange use of nuclear energy is the exposure of insect larvae.  This is done in order to remove them harmless to the environment.  In this case, the insects emerging from the irradiated larvae have no offspring, but in other respects are quite normal. </p><h2>  Nuclear medicine </h2><p>  Medicine uses radioactive isotopes to make an accurate diagnosis.  Medical isotopes have a short half-life and are not particularly dangerous for both others and the patient. </p>

    <p>  Another use of nuclear energy in medicine was discovered recently.  This is positron emission tomography.  With its help, you can detect cancer in the early stages. </p><h2>  The use of nuclear energy in transport </h2><p>  In the early 50s of the last century, attempts were made to create a tank on a nuclear traction.  Development began in the United States, but the project was never implemented.  Mainly due to the fact that in these tanks they could not solve the problem of shielding the crew. </p><p>  The well-known company Ford worked on a car that would run on nuclear energy.  But the production of such a machine did not go beyond the layout. </p>

    <p>  The thing is that the nuclear installation took up a lot of space, and the car turned out to be very overall.  Compact reactors never appeared, so the ambitious project was canceled. </p><p>  Probably the most famous transport that runs on nuclear energy is various vessels, both military and civilian: </p><ul><li>  <span>Nuclear-powered icebreakers.</span> </li><li>  Transport ships. </li><li>  Aircraft carriers. </li><li>  Submarines. </li><li>  Cruisers. </li><li>  Nuclear submarines. </li></ul><h2>  Pros and cons of using nuclear energy </h2><p>  Today, <span>nuclear</span> energy accounts for about 17 percent of global energy production.  Although mankind uses <span>fossil fuels,</span> its reserves are not endless. </p><p>  Therefore, as an alternative, <span>nuclear fuel is used.</span>  But the process of its receipt and use is associated with great risk to life and the environment. </p><p>  Of course, nuclear reactors are constantly being improved, all possible safety measures are being taken, but sometimes this is not enough.  An example is the accident at the Chernobyl <span>nuclear power plant</span> and Fukushima. </p>

    <p>  On the one hand, a properly functioning reactor does not emit any radiation into the environment, while a large amount of harmful substances enter the atmosphere from thermal power plants. </p><p>  The greatest danger is spent fuel, its processing and storage.  Because to date, a completely safe way to dispose of nuclear waste has not been invented. </p>
