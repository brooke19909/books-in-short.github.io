How to get to this place, not everyone knows.  But, before dwelling on this issue, it is necessary to know what it is.  A rattlesnake spring is a source representing strong streams of water flowing from a high slope formed by limestone rocks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="rattling key how to get there" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/331594.jpg" width="600"></div><br>  They flow down various gutters hollowed out of solid wood.  Each of the streams has its own healing properties.  So, for example, the one to the right helps with heart disease;  the one to the left is from female diseases, and the central one is from headache.

    <h2>  Giving about the source </h2><p>  Regarding this place, there is one legend that describes the action that occurred here 600 years ago.  At that time, St. Sergius of Radonezh, who was traveling with his students to Kirzhach from the Trinity Monastery, stopped at this place for rest.  During a prayer for the unification of the Russian people and their liberation from the Mongol-Tatar invaders from the mountain, an abundant source of cold spring water was scored from the mountain, which was later called Gremyachiy Klyuch.  How to get to this place?  This can be done in various ways: by public transport, by car, by bicycle.  But first things first. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get to the source by car </h2><p>  Driving your own car is the most profitable way to get to such a unique place as the Gremyachiy Klyuch.  How to get to this source from Moscow?  You must follow the Yaroslavl highway to <span>Lake Torbeevo.</span>  Many make a mistake and turn ahead of time - in Sergiev Posad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get to the rattling key" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/331592.jpg?1391956888429" width="450"></div>  Of course, this is also one of the unique places that deserves attention.  But, if it is not the purpose of your visit, it is better to go on the right side, right up to the lake.  Roughly this will take you about an hour.  But this is not the Great Key.  How to get from the lake to the desired location?  You need to go right along the road.  If there is a stationary traffic police post on your way, then the direction is correct.  Right in front of him goes a turn to the right.  You can navigate by the sign with the inscription "Nizhny Novgorod."  It is necessary to turn into this turn, behind which there is a tape road, which can be overcome in about 15 minutes. The road is not very convenient for transport.  She runs past the village of Malinniki. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="raspberries raspberries key how to get there" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/331593.jpg?1391956916677" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Crackling Key.  How to get from Malinnikov </h2><p>  Behind this settlement there is a climb uphill, along which you must go to the sign "Botovo and Gremyachiy Klyuch".  It will be installed on the right.  Then our path lies along the field road, breaking which you will find yourself on a small platform in front of a steep descent.  Those who are not sure of their driving abilities should leave the car at the descent and walk.  It should be noted that even in the driest weather this stretch of road is dispersed.  But, and we will return to the car.  After this descent, a large field will stretch out in front of you.  If you look to the left, then it is easy to see the mountain and the church in the distance.  It is there that the source is located. </p><h2>  <strong>How to get to the rattling key without having your own car</strong> </h2><p>  From the Yaroslavl station, you need to go by train to the stop Sergiev Posad.  Next, you need to change to a bus that goes to Zhuklino on route No. 120.  You need to go to the village of Robin.  On weekends, the bus goes to the village of Voronino, from where it is much further to the Gremyachy Klyuch. </p><p>  When planning your journey, you need to know that the bus runs once an hour.  The time of the return bus can be found in the village of Voronino in a blue house with the sign "Board".  Then you need to walk through the field, about 4-5 kilometers (depending on which point you will follow) - and you are at the source.  Many take a bicycle with them and ride it from Sergiev Posad. </p>
