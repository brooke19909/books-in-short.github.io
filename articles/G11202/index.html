These buildings are original symbols of cities, countries or religious denominations.  <span>Doge's Palace</span> in Venice falls into this category of iconic architectural masterpieces.  It is his image that most often arises in the mind when it comes to Venice.  In a sense, its creators were counting on such an effect. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Doge's Palace in Venice" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276383.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Doge's Palace in Venice.</strong>  <strong>His story and style</strong> </p><p>  This palace was obliged to make a strong impression on everyone who sees it.  It was intended to live and perform administrative and state functions to all future rulers of Venice.  And this unique city-state reached a high degree of power and influence by the beginning of the fourteenth century.  They were ruled by elected rulers - Doges.  And the Doge's Palace in Venice was obliged to emphasize their status.  In addition to the supreme rulers, many other state structures were to be located here: the Senate and the Grand Council, the Supreme Court and the secret police.  <span>Material resources</span> made it possible to solve this problem.  The city was the richest in the entire eastern Mediterranean.  Doge's Palace in Venice was built over a quarter century.  The best masters and artists of the era worked on its construction.  Professional secrets of craftsmanship in the Middle Ages were carefully guarded from outsiders and transmitted only within their clan or family dynasty, from father to son.  That is why some construction and finishing technologies remain unsurpassed to this day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Doge's Palace in Venice Photo" class="if" height="374" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276385.jpg" width="498"></div>  To make sure of this, just look at what the Doge's Palace in Venice looks like inside.  The luxury and expressiveness of its interiors are amazing.  It organically corresponds to the general style of the entire architectural concept.  And the palace building was included in all world architecture books as the brightest example and the highest rise of Italian Gothic architecture, which immediately preceded the Renaissance.  In Italian, it is called the "Palazzo Ducale".  The Doge‚Äôs Palace was very lucky in the sense that for several centuries it did not undergo significant restructures and reconstructions.  Even after a severe fire in 1577, it was restored to its original form.  This allows us today to admire the original masterpiece, and not its subsequent distortions. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="doge's palace in venice inside" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14156/276384.jpg" width="497"></div>

    <p>  <strong>Palazzo Ducale: view from the sea</strong> </p><p>  It is impossible not to note how the Doge's Palace was successfully inscribed in the overall composition of the ensemble of the central square of San Marco in Venice.  It is visible from afar, at the entrance to the sea lagoon, in which the city is located.  It was in this form that he appeared to the gaze of those who looked at him from the side of the ships as part of merchant caravans from all over the Mediterranean.  It is also precisely seen by modern tourists who seek the lagoon, including in order to see the Doge's Palace in Venice.  His photo is traditionally decorated with all the advertising materials of tourist structures in all countries and on all continents. </p>
