These are those elements of a modern house that are almost impossible to refuse, and the washer is one of the first to be bought in a new apartment. <noindex>  <span>Washing machines in demand in Moscow</span> </noindex>  sold including in online stores.  When buying, as a rule, two key questions arise: where to buy and which to choose.  And if, in response to the second question, we recommend online stores, after ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù the machine in a usually household appliance store, then it‚Äôs more difficult to determine the choice of a device that suits you, with all the variety of modern models. </p><p>  One of the most respected brands producing washing machines is the German giant Bosch.  This technique is characterized by high reliability, stylish design and the use of innovations that greatly facilitate and make washing more efficient.  However, you have to pay for quality, so <strong>Bosch</strong> washing machines cost a little more than their competitors. </p><p>  Before you buy a washer, first decide on the place where you plan to install it.  For small bathrooms, the best choice would be a washing machine 40 centimeters wide and with a vertical load of laundry.  If you are going to install appliances in the kitchen, then the best choice would be a washing machine with front-loading items and the function of reloading linen.  The front-facing Bosch machines are also equipped with a removable cover that can be easily integrated under the countertop.  The Germans even took care of such trifles.  Speaking about the thoughtfulness of Bosch washers, one cannot but mention such functions as SpeedPerfect and EcoPerfect, which save your time and energy in almost any washing mode.  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù washers dispense water independently, depending on the loading of the drum and the type of fabric - this helps to significantly save water consumption.  All Bosch washing machines have options for protecting against children, controlling foaming and suppressing unbalance during the spin cycle.  And leakage protection - full or partial - makes these models as safe and reliable as possible. </p><p>  To the most successful <noindex>  <span>Bosch cars</span> </noindex>  that can be found on the market today, we would include the following models: WVD 24460, WOT 24454 OE, WAE 24444 OE, WAE 20164 OE and WLK 24263 OE.  Let us briefly talk about each of them.  Model WVD 24460 is a front-loading washing machine with a maximum weight of loaded items - 5 kg.  Spin speed 1200 rpm.  This machine has a dryer where you can load up to 2.5 kg of things.  Management - intelligent (electronic) with an abundance of programs and modes.  Energy class - C. WOT 24454 OE - a vertical model with a maximum mass of linen - 6 kilograms.  Of the interesting points - the presence of a drum parking lot, the AquaSpar function and a complex system of protection against leaks.  The power consumption class of the machine is A-20%.  The Bosch WAE 24444 OE model has an excellent capacity of 7 kilograms and a high spin speed of 1200 rpm.  And the electromagnetic lock allows you to reload things with any program you run.  This model uses all the latest developments of Bosch engineers.  Front-loading washing machine WAE 20164 OE differs from the previous model even more economically - at the level of class A ++.  Applying the latest innovations makes it very practical and effective.  Well, the latest WLK 24263 OE model impressed us with its design features.  Here, a unique drop-shaped surface of the drum, and asymmetric grips and a special housing design, which reduce noise and vibration during washing.  The energy class is slightly lower than previous machines - it is marked as A-10%. </p></div></article>
