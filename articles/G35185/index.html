    <h2>  The beginning of the war.  First wounds and rewards </h2><p>  As soon as the First World War began, Rodion Yakovlevich persuaded the soldiers to take him on the echelon.  And he was enrolled in the machine gun team of the 64th division of the 256th Elisavetgrad regiment with a cart carrier.  True, there was a small incident.  In the metric where the name of the father was to be written, there was a dash.  The senior clerk wondered how to write down his middle name, and suggested "Varvarovich" - on behalf of his mother.  So Malinowski was listed.  Subsequently, he still changed his middle name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1915 he was seriously wounded near Smorgon.
