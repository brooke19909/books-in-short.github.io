Initially, it was a country estate. </p><p>  Kuntsev was called this area for its natural beauty.  In old Russian, ‚Äúkunk‚Äù means ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù.  Until now, this place is attractive with its pacifying beauty. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Now <span>it is a respectable</span> district of the capital.  Today you can easily find a way to get to the Naryshkinsky pond in Filyovsky Park not only by car, but also by public transport. </p><p>  You can get directly from the metro stations "Bagrationovskaya" and "Filevsky Park."  It‚Äôs better to get from Bagrationovskaya: go up, cross the road, walk 200 meters, and you are at the entrance.  There is a park plan here that you can easily navigate. </p><h2>  Homestead </h2><p>  The first estate on this site was erected in the middle of the 16th century by the princes of Mstislavsky.  But it was still difficult to call it a homestead.  According to the inventory there were "... two chamberlains, ....  between them canopy, in the canopies and in the upper rooms attics;  behind the bathhouse in a choir; ... in the courtyard there are three sheds, a cookhouse, near the cellar and a glacier ‚Äù, then in the list there are seven buildings for cattle house, there are three human huts, a stable, two sheds. </p><p>  Here, the efforts of nature and the owners created a beautiful park and pond. <em></em></p>

    <p>  During the reign of Peter I, the land with all the buildings passed to Prince Naryshkin, according to one legend, for his services in suppressing the Streltsy rebellion at the end of the 17th century.  In memory of those times, they began to call this place the Naryshkinsky estate, and the pond - Naryshkinsky.  Although it also has a second name - Soldatenkovsky, by the name of the last owner of the estate, a well-known philanthropist and manufacturer Kozma Terentievich Soldatenkov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The estate itself was originally wooden, but was rebuilt after the fire.  All farm buildings were rebuilt again.  Only the house church of the Sign of the Virgin was immediately erected in stone. </p><p>  Even in Soviet times, buildings were preserved and restored.  This is the cultural heritage of our country of federal significance. </p><h2>  Pond </h2><p>  Initially, the modern resting place of many citizens - the Naryshkinsky pond <strong>-</strong> belonged to the outbuildings.  He was a digging pond.  So called then reservoirs dug for domestic needs, and then for breeding fish. </p><p>  Turned over time by Alexander, the son of Leo Naryshkin (uncle Peter I), into a wonderful place for relaxation and eye delight, the pond began to be supported by local water flow - melt and rain, flood waters, underground springs. </p>

    <p>  The smooth expanse of water, the mild climate of this area, the aroma of the forest - all this led to the fact that the reservoir created for household needs has become an integral part of the park ensemble of the Naryshkinsky estate. </p><p>  The surrounding landscape, as it were, initially suggests a quiet place for boat trips or a leisurely promenade along the <span>gentle beach.</span> </p><h2>  Famous guests of the estate </h2><p>  It is generally accepted that it was about this estate and about this pond that was written in the novel by I. S. Turgenev ‚ÄúOn the Eve‚Äù.  This gives rise to many call the reservoir Turgenevsky pond. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  M. Yu. Lermontov, P. I. Tchaikovsky, I. S. Turgenev, L. N. Tolstoy, <span>A. I. Herzen</span> and many other honored guests of the estate owners strolled and enjoyed quiet summer evenings on its shore. </p><p>  Perhaps it was these amazing landscapes that inspired ideas for the famous works of these talented people.  It is worth looking at the photo of the Naryshkinsky pond in the Filevsky park to understand how unfading the nature of this area turned out to be. </p>

    <p>  Czarina the Great also reigned here, and after a while the Prussian emperor Frederick William III, when Alexander II and his wife Maria Alexandrovna went to celebrations in honor of the birth of the future emperor Alexander I. </p><h2>  Modernity </h2><p>  Now the Naryshkinsky pond continues to be a decoration of a personal park and a place for walks for the whole family on weekends both in summer and in winter. </p><p>  There is a path along the coastline, willows were once planted right by the water.  Now these are large majestic trees, bending their branches to the water itself.  They resemble large green clouds hovering over the surface of the Naryshkinsky pond in Filyovsky park. </p><p>  There is still a fish here, and lovers of fishing are frequent guests here.  But once the ancestors of today's carp were served on the princely table.  Now, instead of princely cuisine, there is a wonderful restaurant "Manor". </p>

    <p>  And about feeding ducks, it is also worth mentioning.  This has become literally a direct responsibility of all visitors to the homestead park.  In the spring, having acquired fluffy, cute offspring, ducks simply oblige vacationers, mainly children and women of all ages, to feed them. </p><h2>  Bon Appetit </h2><p>  Not only in the afternoon, you can have a good time in the former Kuntsevo estate.  For the older generation in the evening there is where to spend time.  The illuminated alleys of the park have a pleasant evening chat.  And the restaurant "Manor" at the Naryshkinsky Pond is perfect for a business meeting or for a romantic date. </p>
