    <p>  Despite the fact that in recent years we have written fewer and fewer letters and sent parcels mainly using courier services, postal services have not lost their relevance.  That is why many are faced with the problem of how to find indexes.  This is fairly easy to do, and soon we will find out exactly how this can be done.  We will also talk about what an index is and what is the history of its occurrence.  In this article, we will cover the index system valid for Ukraine. </p><h2>  What is an index? </h2><p>  Let's start with the very definition of the index, in order to better understand what it is and why it is needed.  Later we will analyze the meaning of each digit in it, and also discuss the history of its occurrence.  Then we will talk about how to find out the indices for Ukraine. </p><p>  A zip code is a sequence of different letters and numbers that are added to a postal address and serve to facilitate the sorting of correspondence.  In Ukrainian indices, only numbers are used, while, unlike Russia, each set consists of five numbers. </p><p>  The use of postal codes can significantly speed up the sorting of correspondence, and as a result, the speed of its delivery.  That is why it is important to always enter this set of numbers in the appropriate field on envelopes and address lists of parcels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  History of occurrence </h2>

    <p>  After the collapse of the USSR, letters that indicated that the post office belonged to a particular republic disappeared from the indices of most countries. </p><p>  Before we talk about how to find out indexes, let's say a few words about their occurrence.  It is believed that in our country, indices arose in 1932.  It was then that they began to use the digital addresses of a particular department, which were set using letters and numbers.  Then, in Kharkov, a directory was created containing all postal codes of Ukraine.  With the beginning of World War II, the index system was abolished.  They reintroduced it in 1971. </p><h2>  The value of the digits in the index </h2><p>  As already mentioned, zip codes always consist of numbers.  And before talking about how to find out indices using an address, we‚Äôll look at what each of the numbers or a pair of numbers in it means. </p><p>  Depending on the country, their number may fluctuate - this is due to differences in the size of the territory, the number of regions and cities.  If in Russia the postal code consists of six digits, then in Ukraine only five.  Naturally, each of the numbers has its own meaning.  Let's talk about what each digit or pair of numbers in Ukrainian indices means. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The zip code is divided into three parts. </p><p>  So, the first pair of numbers denotes a region.  Moreover, to designate one region, not one number is used, but several - depending on its territory.  So, for example, indices beginning with the numbers 46 - 49 indicate the Ternopil region. </p><p>  Further, the third digit in the index indicates the district or province in which the post office is located.  And finally, the last pair of numbers indicates the post office.  Now we can move on to the question of how to find out the index.  Mail for sending is sorted using the index, therefore, this question needs to be considered as detailed as possible. </p><h2>  Find out the index at </h2><p>  Quite often, we encounter such a problem as ignorance of our own index.  What can we say about remembering the indexes of all friends or acquaintances, enterprises to which you send letters?  What to do in this case and how to find the index at the address? </p><p>  Consider this situation as an example of sending a letter to Ukraine.  You know the address of your friend, his name and surname, but the index is unknown to you.  How to proceed? </p><p>  In such a situation, you should visit the ukrposhta website, because this is the only way to find the index at.  To do this, you just need to know the region, district and city, the street along which your addressee lives.  Note that the ukrposhta site only supports Ukrainian and English.  Therefore, we will write down your actions using the menu items recorded in Ukrainian. </p>

Then select the ‚ÄúOn-line services‚Äù section at the top.  In the window that opens, we look through the list and find the item "Post Yandex."  Next, select "Poshuk after m—ñsets roztasuvannya" and fill in the fields that appear below.  Click the "Show" button and then compare the results with the address we have.  The branch index to which the address of your friend belongs will appear on the screen.

    <p>  As you can see, everything is quite easy and simple, moreover, this action will not take you much time. </p><h2>  Can I find the address by index </h2><p>  So, we talked about how to find out the post office index in Ukraine.  Now we will touch upon another interesting question that has arisen at least once with a particular person - is it possible to find out the address, knowing only the index.  To some extent, yes, but the address will be approximate, that is, you will only find out which post office has this index.  But at the same time, you can view basic information about him.  You can find out the address of the post office, work schedule, phone number and see on the map where it is located. </p>

Then, in the field that appears, enter five digits of your index.

    <p>  The screen will display the post office number, its address, as well as all information about it.  As you can see, there is also nothing complicated. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Zip code is one of the most important postal details.  Ukrainian postal codes consist of five digits, each of which has its own designation.  Indexes were first introduced in 1932 and, although they were abolished in wartime, in 1971 they returned to their everyday life, and now the modern postal system cannot imagine its existence without using these details. </p><p>  We have found out what the numbers in the <span>index</span> mean <span>, how to find out the index</span> by address in Ukraine, and vice versa - how, using the index, you can find out the address of the post office and even find out the mode of operation. </p>
