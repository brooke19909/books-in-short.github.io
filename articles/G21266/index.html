  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All US presidents who scored worse</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The post of <span>President in the United States of America</span> (head of state, as well as commander in chief of the Navy and Army) was introduced after the adoption of the Constitution in 1787.  From that moment until 2016, 43 people managed to visit this post.  In the event of special circumstances in the USA, the post may be taken by the Vice-President - the 2nd person in the state, who is at the ‚Äúhelm‚Äù of the upper house of the US Congress (Senate).  All this is of course formal, but there are cases of sudden death of the current rulers or in the country the question may arise of impeachment or resignation of the current President of the United States. </p><p>  For more than two centuries in history, all US presidents have distinguished themselves.  Someone showed himself from the best side, and someone from the worst.  And so, the presidents of the United States are presented to your attention, whose rating table is based on the worst acts and deeds.  There are also politicians on this list who, due to their unprofessionalism or fatal combination of circumstances, did not hold out for long. </p><h2>  William Henry Harrison </h2><p>  One of the places in this ranking is occupied by the infamous Henry Harrison, the 9th president of the United States, who became the shortest ruler in the country in history.  On the occasion of his inauguration, Harrison prepared a 2-hour speech.  The weather that day was rainy and cloudy, and the principled president did not leave the rostrum until he read out the speech completely.  He got wet all the way and became seriously ill, and a month later he died suddenly from this.  Thus, he became the first notorious president who died right on his post. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Zachary Taylor </h2><p>  The 12th president of the United States, Zachary Taylor was remembered as the most passive ruler.  He had little interest in politics, and did not even take the oath of his religious convictions, since the day of the inauguration fell on the "day of rest" by his Protestant faith.  Even while serving in the army, he rarely wore a military uniform, and his colleagues, once mistaking him for a simple peasant, were sent to dig the ground.  Actually, having been in office a little over a year, he did not receive the proper authority.  And in 1850 he died under incomprehensible circumstances, either being poisoned or ill. </p>

    <h2>  Jimmy carter </h2><p>  In 1977, he distinguished himself by giving the <span>Panama Canal to the</span> Panamanians, despite the fact that most Americans believed that it belonged to them. </p><p>  A little later there was a revolution in Iran, which provoked an increase in oil prices and all the ensuing problems, and this was not the worst moment for Carter.  In 1979, students in Iran took the US Embassy in Tehran and put forward their demands, including the extradition of the Shah, who, by coincidence, was in New York at that time.  Carter's planned release of prisoners did not go as planned, and as a result failed.  Due to the prevailing contempt for Carter, the hostages were released only a year later, when Ronald Reagan came to power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Lyndon Johnson </h2><p>  Usually, all US presidents took the oath at the ceremony, but Vice President Johnson had to take the oath right on board the presidential plane, on the same day after the assassination of President <span>John F. Kennedy.</span>  During his reign, Lindon entered into a loss-making and protracted <span>war in Vietnam,</span> sent troops to the Dominican Republic, which in turn had an extremely negative impact on his rating.  With such a reputation, Johnson did not even begin to run for next term in 1968, but chose to leave for the suburbs of Texas and write memoirs for the rest of his life. </p>

    <h2>  Richard Nixon </h2><p>  All in all, the 31st President Nixon was not so bad.  On his account established relations with the Republic of China and several significant treaties with the Soviet Union, as well as the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. </p><p>  President Nixon might not have been on our list if it hadn't been for the political scandal at the Watergate Hotel.  According to journalists, which received widespread dissonance, the president‚Äôs apparatus was involved in the installation of listening equipment in the same hotel.  Shame could not be avoided, and the case ended with the first in history and the last to this day resignation of the incumbent president. </p>

    <h2>  Franklin Pierce </h2><p>  I remembered that I could speak well without a piece of paper, although such a desire for controversy, we can assume, was well supported by the frequent use of alcohol.  He distinguished himself by not hiding his intention to expand the state, and also supported slavery.  At his own expense, he recorded the maintenance of the dictatorship in Nicaragua and an unsuccessful attempt to take Cuba from Spain. </p><h2>  Gerald Ford </h2><p>  Ford managed to earn such a reputation that they attempted his life twice, and both times the women were unsuccessful killers.  Not all US presidents could boast of such a merit.  It accounted for the economic crisis and, above all, the defeat in the Vietnam War. </p><p>  Such bad luck has become the subject of ridicule and many jokes that sounded everywhere. </p>

    <p>  Not all US presidents have earned such a negative attitude.  The first person to hold this post, George Washington did a lot to strengthen America on the world stage.  Thanks to Washington, the <span>institution of the presidency and</span> other authorities are functioning.  It is George W.  built the state capital, named after him. </p><p>  And, for example, Franklin Roosevelt, the president of the United States, who was elected for 4 consecutive terms and held this post from 1933 to 1945, carried out a number of important reforms that have become landmark in world history.  He is under the 32nd number on the list and, despite the fact that he came to power in the midst of the "great depression", was able to establish relations with the Soviet Union, as well as make a significant contribution to the fight against fascism and its consequences.  He, like none of his predecessors, was close to the people.  Roosevelt - President of the United States, <strong> </strong>  who attached great importance to helping those in need, made successful attempts to restore agriculture and industry.  The social security system with us for the first time in many years began to work harmoniously. </p><p>  Nevertheless, the list of ‚Äúworst‚Äù continues to be replenished to this day (recall that at the time of publication of the article Obama is the US president) and who knows how he and his followers will be able to distinguish themselves in the future. </p>
