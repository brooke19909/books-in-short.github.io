Let the heavenly night luminary not warm, but, rather, evoke cold thoughts, unlike the Sun.  Nevertheless, it is just as important as it is the first and only natural satellite of our planet.  Many astronauts spent half their life preparing and flying on it.  However, now, perhaps, even the most erudite person will not say <span>how many</span> <span>people were</span> on the moon and the more how many still have to step on its surface. </p>

    <h2>  The moon is a double of the Earth </h2><p>  Our planet and its satellite are very often called twins, but this is just a joke, since they are not similar in appearance or in size.  The mass of the moon is only a smaller part of the weight of the Earth, about 0.0123, its diameter is comparable to a quarter of the earth (about 3476 km).  But even despite such a difference, the night luminary is considered to be a rather large satellite, only Jupiter‚Äôs satellites (Io, Hannimed and Callisto) and <span>Saturn‚Äôs satellite</span> (Titan) are superior in size to it.  Along with the larger planets, the Moon is the fifth largest satellite among the satellites, while the Earth itself is on the same fifth, but already on the list of heavyweights.  Such a coincidence is quite rare.  Surely all the studies could not have been so reliable if we did not know how many people have already visited the moon and contributed to the knowledge of this unusual celestial body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So why is the Earth and its satellite - double planets?  Superstitious astronomers believe that such differences in size are extremely small, because if you take, for example, Mars with its Phobos, the largest of all the ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù of the Red Planet, then it is so small that, if it is in the place of the Moon, not only earthly inhabitants, but also special equipment could not make out it. </p>

    <h2>  Who was the first to visit the moon? </h2><p>  Each student knows a famous photograph showing the legendary installation of the <span>American flag</span> on the surface of our satellite.  Also, everyone knows the name of this person - Neil Armstrong.  But how many people were on the moon after him and did anyone dare to leave their mark on the dusty surface of the night luminary before that?  Of course, many scientists and engineers worked on creating specialized devices for landing on the moon, but still their attempts were unsuccessful.  One has only to imagine what joy such a breakthrough brought to the American government and how happy they were at last to overtake the Soviet Union. </p><p>  Be that as it may, but after the flight of Yuri Gagarin into space to build a rocket, the forces of the best engineers were thrown, the best resources were bought, and again the best conditions were created in order to become better. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  So, thanks to the desire to succeed in many years of struggle, in 1969 a command was given from Earth to launch the American Apollo 11, and, without a doubt, the ship went into space with a crew in the person of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.  But whether he made a landing on the moon and how the famous picture was taken is still unclear.  But still, after this, the Americans were proud that they were the people who had visited the moon.  The photo was distributed in all newspapers, on all channels and advertising stands.  The Americans were proud of their victory over the USSR and, as they could, showed it. </p>

    <h2>  How many people, so many opinions </h2><p>  While the Americans showed ‚Äúdirect reporting‚Äù from outer space to the whole world, where astronauts set their flag, the Russians and Chinese bit their elbows, because they were denied such honor.  How many people were on the moon that year, whether they were there and how to prove it, is still a mystery, because there are a lot of reasons for doubt. </p><p>  Firstly, a few months before the decisive flight during testing, the equipment was seriously damaged, as it was not brought to mind.  It was simply impossible to repair it in such a short time, but the flight took place, and very successfully. </p><p>  Secondly, the Soviet satellites during their patrol of the earth's surface in the Nevada desert noticed fake lunar craters, and the territory was like a real moon, thus, it was concluded that the Americans really furnished the Russians in a trick competition. </p><p>  Thirdly, a flag stuck into the surface of the moon develops in the wind, but where did the wind come from?  And finally, the shadows are falling in different directions, it‚Äôs really strange, because they didn‚Äôt bring lamps and spotlights from the Earth with them to make the pictures more successful? </p>

    <h2>  Points of view </h2><p>  As far as is known, doubts did not begin immediately, at first even the most inexperienced believed that the landing on the Earth‚Äôs satellite did take place, but did not last long, because the surprise passes over time, giving way to common sense.  After some time, even literature began to appear, documentaries began to be filmed, and too daring directly expressed their opinion about the quality or not very staging. </p><p>  Skeptics were divided into two camps: some believe that astronauts did not even board a rocket, not to mention space flights, and the landing on the moon, in their opinion, was due to the professionalism of the editors.  The second turned out to be realistic and decided that the flight into space was perfect, but the astronauts probably only flew around the moon. </p><p>  No matter how much doubt and no matter how much evidence of deception is found, the Americans are still people who have been on the moon.  The Russian cosmonauts have not yet replenished the list with their names, perhaps this will happen in the near future. </p>

    <h2>  List of the moon </h2><p>  According to official figures, 12 US astronauts landed on the moon.  Of course, of all the people who officially flew to the moon, only Neil Armstrong is known, and this is completely understandable, because, as they say, after returning to his homeland in 1969, all the laurels went to him, since he was the first to leave the spacecraft.  But there were other people who visited the <span>moon.</span>  <span>The names</span> and surnames of these ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù are in the public domain today, because so far the space competitions of our country with the USA have stopped. </p><p>  The first landing was carried out by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on July 21, 1969 and lasted more than 21 hours.  The first flight gave rise to the second, there were two astronauts in the rocket: Charles Conrad and Alan Bean, they spent 31 hours and 31 minutes on the moon.  Subsequently, landed on the moon: </p><ul><li>  Alan Shepard; </li><li>  Edgar Mitchell; </li><li>  David Scott </li><li>  James Irwin; </li><li>  John Young </li><li>  Charles Duke </li></ul><p>  Over the years, the amount of time spent in zero gravity increased, the highest rate was the last flight made in 1972 by Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.  They spent 75 hours at night. </p><h2>  Earth satellite facts </h2><p>  We cannot say for sure how many people were on the moon and whether there is any sense in mistrust of the Americans.  Better to vouch for the facts already verified.  For example, in fact, the satellite does not revolve around the Earth, it moves next to it always at the same speed.  Also, few people know that during a space expedition in 1971, tree seedlings were taken from the surface of the Moon, now they grow in the United States. </p>
