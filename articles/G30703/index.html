Coins in denominations of one and five kopecks were made of aluminum bronze, and for minting small change of denomination of greater denomination, the young Soviet government did not spare the base silver.  For minting half a penny coin, copper was used. </p><h2>  A brief history of half a penny </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.realmofhistory.com" data-author=": Dattatreya Mandal, "><img itemprop="image" alt="1 2 kopecks" class="if uuid-2708219" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2708219.jpg"></div><p>  The founder of a half-kopeck coin was the Russian Tsar Peter the Great.  He was asked to introduce a new monetary unit suitable for exchanging a silver penny.  By the end of the 17th century, the already small penny had become even smaller - this minuscule piece of silver was called the ‚Äúflake‚Äù.  For everyday expenses, it was not suitable for the reason that it was a rather large sum, and merchants who trade in large quantities were not satisfied because of its meagerness. </p><p>  Fearing another "copper" riot, Peter introduced the new money very slowly and carefully - for fifteen years.  The first such money was denga or 1/2 a penny. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The size of the first Soviet bargaining coins (five-kopek, three-kopek, kopek, 1/2 kopek and 1/4 kopek) did not differ from tsarist money.  The same can be said about the metal from which they were minted. </p><p>  The value of the Soviet trifle minted in 1927 (half a dime is one such coin) is that it really contained pure copper. </p><h2>  The debunking of myths </h2><p>  Copper alloys, like pure copper, have been used by miners since time immemorial, not only for the manufacture of copper coins (such as the Soviet Union‚Äôs half a penny), but also for silver and gold. </p><p>  Today, as in the distant past, a huge amount of copper goes to minting coins from the "noble metal", as well as the manufacture of commemorative medals and badges. </p><h2>  Can I make money on collecting? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="half a penny 1927" class="if uuid-2708222" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2708222.jpg"></div><p>  Experts say that it is possible if you act correctly.  The most affordable way to earn money is to search and then purchase rare coins at the lowest possible prices, followed by their resale at a higher price. </p><p>  For example, a half-kopeck denomination in 1927 in satisfactory condition in a satisfactory condition, a purposeful numismatist, who set himself the goal of earning on the price difference, will be able to buy for 5100 rubles and sell for at least 5500 rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the collector is not satisfied with the above strategy, he can choose a simplified option - find, exchange and receive rare coins as a gift in order to sell them. </p><p>  It should be noted that most collectors-numismatists prefer the first method of earning.  The profitability of the "money business" numismatists explain as follows: </p><ul><li>  Collecting and selling rare coins does not imply any preliminary financial injections.  The only case when the seller has to spend money is to buy another rare coin; </li></ul><ul><li>  the collector does not need rented premises and can do without maintenance staff; </li></ul><ul><li>  the seller of rare coins does not need to advertise his activities and spend money on paying for expensive advertising campaigns. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="half a penny 1927 price" class="if uuid-2708220" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2708220.jpg"></div><p>  We must not forget that collecting rare coins is an almost perfect investment.  Once purchased, a coin can be resold many years later for a much larger amount.  The main thing is to be patient. </p><h2>  Description of a half-penny coin of 1927.  Bid price </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.allnumis.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="half a penny of the ussr" class="if uuid-2708221" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2708221.jpg"></div><p>  On the obverse, the coin engraved the abbreviation "USSR" (this inscription is located in the center) framed by the call "Workers of all countries, unite!", Separated by a dot.  On the other hand, the coins were minted year of issue and denomination. </p><p>  The weight of a half-cent coin of 1927 is 1.64 grams.  The diameter of this coin is 16 millimeters, and its thickness is 1.2 millimeters.  Edge coins ribbed.  What circulation it was minted is not known for certain. </p><p>  The cost of a half a penny, according to numismatists, depends on which mint it was made in and in what condition it is now.  At numismatic auctions, the maximum price of such a lot may exceed 20 thousand rubles. </p><p>  In mid-2016, the approximate price of half a penny of 1927 not in very good condition was one thousand rubles. </p>
