The total area of ​​the facility exceeds the mark of 65 thousand square meters.  The skyscraper was built in its northwestern part.  It should be noted that until 2001, the twin towers were located here, which were tragically destroyed as a result of a terrorist attack.  The whole world still remembers that case.  To honor the memory of all those who died that day, the American government decided that the Freedom Tower should be built on this site. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Tower" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/737218.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  First projects </h2><p>  A few months after the destruction of the twin towers in the USA, a heated discussion began regarding the further operation of their former territory.  In 2002, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was the owner of the rights to this land, announced <span>an open tender</span> to determine ways to use the site <span>.</span>  Numerous projects that were proposed by the public were perceived extremely negatively.  As a result, at the end of that year, the organization held another contest.  His winner was a proposal by Daniel Libeskind.  And his project was repeatedly revised in the future. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Final project </h2><p>  The final view of the skyscraper was presented to the public in 2006.  Almost immediately, representatives of the New York police announced that the Freedom Tower should be better protected.  In order to increase the safety of the building, the designers decided to use concrete in the construction of the lower level.  Its height was 57 meters.  On the other hand, many critics insisted that this part of the skyscraper should not look like a bunker.  To solve this problem, numerous glass elements were used in the decoration of the facade. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Tower in New York" class="if" height="422" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/737219.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  Work on the construction of a new structure began in December 2006, when the first steel columns were installed at its base.  It is planned that in the future three high office buildings and one residential building will be erected on the territory of the complex.  The city government wants to surround them with a memorial opened in 2011 dedicated to tragic events.  The final aspect in the construction was the installation of a metal spire.  It weighs 758 tons and has a height of 124 meters.  The Freedom Tower in New York was put into operation late last year.  As of today, it is the tallest building in the United States (541 meters including the spire). </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Specificity </h2><p>  About 241 thousand square meters of space has been allocated for office premises inside the tower.  In total, 69 floors in the lower part of the skyscraper are reserved for them.  Under the hall, whose height is 24 meters, there are technical floors that are designed to service the structure.  At 341 meters, offices are ending.  Above them, the builders provided for several additional floors of technical purpose.  Further, as you climb, the rooms belonging to the City Television Alliance follow.  The stylized spire antenna mounted on the roof of the building has a symbolic meaning.  The fact is that, thanks to its presence, the Freedom Tower in New York reaches a height of exactly 1,776 feet.  It was in this year that the declaration of US state independence was proclaimed.  Observation platforms with cafes and restaurants are equipped at an altitude of 415 and 417 meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Freedom Tower photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/737216.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Design features </h2><p>  The Freedom Tower has sides whose width at the base differs by 61 meters.  Thus, the object is characterized by virtually the same parameters as the twin towers destroyed in 2001.  The exterior of the skyscraper is made due to several thousand glass elements, which differ in a shape resembling a prism.  In this regard, it seems that the building seems to shine.  One cannot but note the fact that the structure blended into the surrounding landscape very organically.  The construction of the facility was completed at the end of 2013, although it was put into operation a little later. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  At the initial stage of the preparatory work, before installing the steel columns, a commemorative inscription was attached to the base of the skyscraper with the name of the building and the emblem of the national flag. </p><p>  After the end of construction work, the Freedom Tower became one of the most popular places in New York among travelers.  Every year millions of tourists from all over the world and Americans take photos with this architectural masterpiece.  It should be noted that the skyscraper is open for public visits, and from its viewing platforms a unique view of the city opens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Liberty Tower in New York photo" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11316/737217.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building has a purely commercial and office purpose.  Along with this, the city government is currently considering the possibility of building several residential high-rise buildings in the complex in the near future. </p><p>  Entrance halls are specially equipped on one of the lower levels, due to which the Freedom Tower has a direct connection with the metro and railway lines PATH. </p><p>  Work on the further development and arrangement of the skyscraper is still ongoing. </p>
