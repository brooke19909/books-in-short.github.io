  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Climate Australia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Australia is located in the <span>Southern Hemisphere,</span> in three latitudes: subequatorial, subtropical and tropical.  The northern part of Australia is the subequatorial belt, the southern part is the subtropics, and most of the continent is the tropics. </p><p>  The climate of Australia in the northern part is characterized by a large amount of rainfall, about two thousand millimeters.  Most of them are brought from the northwest by a wet monsoon in the summer.  In winter, the amount of precipitation decreases significantly, at this time there is more likely a drought, which is brought by hot winds.  The average annual temperature fluctuations are small. </p><p>  Tropical latitudes of the continent - it is here that two main <span>types of climate are formed:</span> dry and humid tropical.  The extreme eastern region is under the influence of a humid tropical climate, moisture comes here with the air masses of the Pacific expanses.  The eastern slope of the Great Dividing Range and coastal plains receive annual precipitation in an amount of from a thousand to one and a half thousand millimeters.  The climate of Australia in this part is characterized by a warm, soft and fairly even "temper": the temperature of the warmest days is about twenty-five degrees, and cold - ten <span>degrees Celsius.</span>  Located in the tropics and subtropics, the mainland heats up significantly.  This means that the climate in Australia is arid and hot. </p><p>  Almost the entire central part of the mainland is desert.  They occupy huge spaces with a length of about two and a half kilometers.  The climate of Australia - desert tropical - prevails in the west and in the central part.  In summer, the temperature here exceeds thirty degrees, and in winter it does not drop below ten degrees.  The large sandy desert is the hottest area on the continent.  Here the difference between the temperatures of summer and winter is only ten to fifteen degrees.  And the climate of Australia in this region is characterized by a scanty amount of precipitation. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The part of the mainland, located in the subtropics, is climatically divided into three zones: Mediterranean, subtropical continental and subtropical wet. </p><p>  The first zone is close to the mild climate of the Mediterranean countries.  It is hot and sometimes dry in summer, and wet and warm in winter.  As for precipitation, it is enough here - from six hundred to a thousand millimeters per year. </p><p>  The subtropics should include the southern part of the continent, where the <span>Great Australian Gulf</span> stretches <span>,</span> up to the western part of New South Wales.  Here, temperature rises significantly during the year, and precipitation does not differ in particular abundance. </p><p>  Victoria, the southwestern foothill of New South Wales, has its own climatic features.  This part of Australia has a mild, warm and <span>humid climate,</span> and the amount of rainfall in the coastal areas ranges from five hundred to six hundred millimeters per year.  Going deeper to the center of the mainland, precipitation is becoming less and less.  This part of Australia is favorable for agriculture, although there is a need for additional artificial irrigation.  At the same time, rivers and lakes in most of the continent do not have direct drains into the ocean, because the waters of most lakes are salty, and rivers during the hot months have the peculiarity of partially drying out.  In summer, the air temperature reaches twenty-five degrees, and in winter does not drop below ten. </p><p>  Of particular interest is winter in Australia.  If the summer period is relatively even, then the winter in different climatic regions is completely different.  For example, the interior of the mainland is characterized by hot and dry winters, since the <span>air masses</span> coming from the ocean, on their way to the center of the continent, have time to warm up and lose most of their moisture.  In the capital, winter is characterized by low temperatures and the presence of snow. </p>
