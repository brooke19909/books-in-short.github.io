    <h2>  What is a pager and what is its history </h2><p>  The most popular pagers were in our country in the nineties.  But due to the universal availability and proliferation of mobile phones, these devices have lost demand and have practically disappeared from the lives of citizens. </p>

    <p>  However, the meaning of the word ‚Äúpager‚Äù has not been forgotten today, and you can quite use it in Moscow - just use the services provided by paging companies that are still on the market today.  An example is the company Vessolink, which provides services in Moscow and the region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How does a classic pager work? </h2><p>  To send a message, you need to call the operator, call the subscriber number and dictate a text message.  It is possible to notify several subscribers at once during group forwarding.  With a modern pager, you can send messages to your mobile phone or email.  If you wish, you can organize a hotline or receive alerts from different points.  In general, today there are extensive opportunities for using a pager. </p><h2>  Where are these devices used today? </h2><p>  There is the possibility of using this device in different situations.  In addition, a pager is a gadget whose price is much lower than the cost of a mobile phone.  Outwardly, it looks like a rectangular box with a pair of buttons.  Learning to manage it will be easy for everyone.  Due to the fact that pagers have long gone out of fashion, it is possible to purchase them through private advertisements or paging network operators. </p>

    <h2>  What other areas of use are known </h2><p>  In addition, today the meaning of the word "pager" is somewhat expanded and involves various functions. </p><p>  So, in alarm systems, certain device models are used.  For example, a GSM pager functions so that when the alarm is turned on, a small text message is sent to it.  This is convenient, as time is given to take measures to prevent theft or allows you to save the contents in a safe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The small size and convenience of the pager make it a practical electronic device.  It has resistance to shock and mechanical stress.  Using the pager in accordance with the instructions guarantees a long service life. </p><h2>  Car Alarm Pager </h2><p>  Despite the complexity of modern car alarms, only a siren is the most effective factor against a hijacker.  Many manufacturers can offer devices that significantly increase this spectrum.  To do this, you need to understand what a car alarm pager is. </p>

It is also possible to control by means of alarms and external signals ‚Äúclose‚Äù and ‚Äúopen‚Äù.  The kit for installing the central lock is 2 or 4 electronic <span>actuators</span> with parts for mounting and a control unit.  They are installed inside the door cavity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  These mechanisms give a reciprocating movement of rods transmitting movement to parts of the door lock.  Electrical signals are generated by <span>the control unit</span> and drive the actuators.  The block has inputs to which the corresponding signaling circuits are connected. </p><p>  An optional bonnet lock is a useful accessory.  After opening the hood, the car thief has access to most important car components and alarms.  By disconnecting the siren, he will be able to quickly remove the alarm and blocking nodes.  If an additional lock is installed for the hood, which opens with a key, and not just a lever from the passenger compartment, then the steps to open it with a hijacker will become very difficult.  Among other things, this lock has an electrical circuit that breaks the ignition. </p>

    <p>  Power windows are electric drives that serve to lower and raise windows in the car doors.  The <span>windows are operated by buttons</span> located in the passenger compartment in a convenient location.  It is possible both together and separately to lower and raise glasses. </p><h2>  Pager as part of car alarms </h2><p>  There is the ability to remotely control the alarm when applying a signal to a separate input.  Power windows are of two types.  For external installation, on the surface of the protective card on the door, and for installation inside, in the door cavity.  One or another of them should be preferred, given the tastes of the owner and the design of the doors.  Most often, the least time-consuming is installing windows from the outside. </p><p>  In a car alarm system, a pager is a small receiver, about the size of half a cigarette pack, which the car owner always carries with him.  During use of the device, a transmitter is connected to the alarm, which is activated during its operation. </p><p>  The radio signals from the transmitter are picked up by the receiver, and if the code of it and the transmitter matches, an <span>audio signal is emitted by the</span> pager. </p><h2>  Pager alarms - which is better? </h2><p>  The working distance in urban conditions is from 300 meters to 1 kilometer.  Certain manufacturers indicate distances of up to 5 kilometers, but this range applies to the desert.  Pagers tested by specialists functioned in two ranges - 27 megahertz and 300 megahertz.  The transmitter power was 1.5 watts and 0.5 watts. </p><p>  The Enforser Cop group provided greater operating distance, but at the same time had antenna installation requirements.  The other Road Star group had more reliable, but also more modest characteristics. </p>

    <p>  Pagers from the Secopage-35 range not only record the alarm, but also determine its cause by the color of the display (opening the hood, door, shock sensor). </p><p>  When using the pager, it is important to turn the receiver off and on regularly due to the rapid discharge of the batteries.  When turned on, a pager as a source of radio waves can interfere with some types of alarms.  It is difficult to turn off the alarm with the remote control when it is triggered and the pager is turned on.  Thus, the best signaling devices with a pager can be of the most various models. </p><h2>  For fishing </h2><p>  Lovers of the bottom fishing method go to various tricks to see the bite in a timely manner.  After the appearance of the feeder, it became easier - now, at any touch of the fish to bait, bites can be seen on top of the rod.  The difficulty is that the fisherman does not spend all the time near the fishing rod.  The assistant in this case will be an electric bite alarm.  With a light or <span>sound signal,</span> he will inform the fisherman that the bait has already been swallowed by the fish.  Nowadays it is possible to purchase a set of signaling devices with a pager of various types.  What is a pager for fishing, should be considered separately. </p><h2>  Choosing the best pager for fishing </h2><p>  All signaling devices work on the principle of perception of twitching fishing line.  Upon purchase of the signaling device, as an additional convenience there may be a pager.  It serves for audible alarms and for remote control of the bite.  Thus, a fishing pager is a gadget that allows you to determine the presence of bite at a distance. <br><br>  Pagering your alarm provides many advantages.  For example, when there are several gears and you need to quickly determine which one of several fishing rods is biting.  With the help of a pager, the necessary fishing rod and the nature of the pull are accurately determined.  When setting the signal for the movement of fishing line from one coast to another, you can determine what is happening under water. </p><p>  There are two types of pagers: </p><ul><li>  Wired. </li><li>  Wireless </li></ul><p>  Sometimes electric signaling devices are connected by wires to a pager.  Paging will be the best solution.  The radius of its action, depending on the company, can be up to 200 meters.  Due to this opportunity, the fisherman, without missing the bite, can move away, cook, light a fire and more.  The pager (photos are presented in this article) is configured simultaneously with the signaling device.  If desired, you can lower the volume on the annunciator and set the necessary on the pager. <br><br>  The best choice would be models with a charge indicator for timely detection of a lack of energy.  It is very convenient to purchase sets of alarms for a pair of pieces complete with a pager.  You can purchase such a device both in specialized retail facilities and in various online stores. </p>
