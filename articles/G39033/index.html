    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The Cherkizovskaya metro station was opened simultaneously with the <span>Ulitsa Podbelskogo station,</span> also located on the Red Line.  Here once was a village, which only in 1917 became part of Moscow.  The name of the village of Cherkizovo, according to one of the Soviet researchers, comes from the name of the large landowner Ivan Serkizov.  His ancestor possessed enormous wealth, when Dmitry Donskoy left the Golden Horde and went to Moscow, where he was baptized. </p><p>  Over time, Ivan Serkizov sold the estate he inherited to Ilya Ozakov, who built the church of Ilya the Prophet in the village, which, unfortunately, has not survived to this day.  The church, located in its place, was built much later. </p><p>  It is not known how exactly Serkizovo was transformed into Cherkizovo.  These changes are probably associated with the phonetic features of the Russian language.  In 1917, when Soviet power was established in the country, the village, on the territory of which the Cherkizovskaya metro station was opened 70 years later, entered the city limits, and in the 60s multi-story residential buildings began to appear here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Cherkizovsky market </h2><p>  For many years the station, which is discussed in this article, was known not only to Muscovites, but also to visitors, thanks to the huge market located nearby.  Exits from the Cherkizovskaya metro station lead to Bolshaya Cherkizovskaya street and Shchelkovo highway.  We will talk about what shopping centers are here today.  And now let's recall the market, which was closed not so long ago. </p><p>  It was located between the Lilac Boulevard, Schelkovsky Highway, Izmailovsky Highway and Izmailovsky passage.  Among the people, the Cherkizovsky market did not have the best fame.  Not only Muscovites, but also journalists often used the dismissive word "Cherkizon" in their notes.  It was believed that only consumer goods could be purchased here.  So even those who furtively visited the most famous Moscow market claimed.  It appeared in the early nineties.  Its closure was preceded by a grand scandal, a terrorist attack and a lawsuit. </p><p>  Once on the site of the Cherkizovsky market was the building of the research institute.  In the early nineties, like many similar institutions, the research institute was closed.  In its place appeared a messy, noisy market, which quickly gained crazy popularity.  Everything was sold here, from personal hygiene products to winter clothing.  Moreover, it was possible to purchase it both at retail and in bulk.  Experts of the market, located in the east of the capital, claimed that you can buy the same goods here as in high-end stores, but several times cheaper. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In August 2006, a terrorist attack occurred on the territory of the market.  Several dozen people were injured, 14 people died.  The culprits were found, convicted.  Some of the criminals received life sentences.  But the reason for the closure of the market was not a terrorist attack, but rather a change of city government. </p><p>  In 2009, reports appeared in the media that the construction of a fitness center would soon begin on its territory. </p>

    <h2>  Shops at the metro station Cherkizovskaya </h2><p>  The metro stations of the Sokolnicheskaya line, from which access to the eastern part of the city are always crowded.  Even after the closure of the famous market, the situation in this regard has not changed. </p><p>  Near the metro station "Cherkizovskaya" and today there are several large and small shops.  Among them are the following shopping centers: </p><ul><li>  "City Hobbies." </li><li>  "Novocherkizovsky". </li><li>  "Rainbow". </li><li>  Cherkizovsky passage. </li><li>  "Mandarin". </li><li>  "Union of business people." </li></ul><p>  In addition, there is a cake shop "Tortik &amp; Tortik" and a shopping center "Kingdom of Coziness", which presents a wide selection of interior items. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Before answering the question of how to get to the shops located near Cherkizovskaya by car, one should tell about public transport routes. </p><p>  As you know, in Moscow it is most convenient to travel by metro.  Being in the south-west of the capital, for example, on Vernadsky Prospekt, in just forty minutes you can be where the Cherkizovsky market used to be.  But the metro will not be used by those who are at the Izmailovskaya station.  From here to the "Cherkizovskaya" regularly runs bus number 34k.  You can get from Solovetsky Jung Square by shuttle bus No. 52.  From Kamchatskaya street - take bus number 171.  Other routes: No. 230, No. 716, No. 32. </p>
