    <p>  From 1743 to 1917, the Sheremetev family owned the estate.  In the XVIII century, its representative, Nikolai Petrovich, built a theater-palace here.  Around him was a park.  It was organized in a French style, fashionable at the time.  Then, from 1791 to 1798, the palace and park ensemble of the estate was built.  In 1918, it became the State Museum of the Serfs. </p><p>  At first glance it seems that the palace is built of stone.  But actually it is made of wood.  The palace was built so harmoniously, its interiors are so elegant that it fascinates visitors throughout its history. </p><p>  At the end of the 16th - beginning of the 17th centuries a pond was dug in the floodplain of the Ostankino stream.  He was given the same name.  But the people still call him Palace and Acterkin.  The last name is due to the fact that earlier performances were organized in the estate.  The actors in them were <span>serfs.</span>  Unable to withstand difficult life and punishment, they drowned in the pond. </p><p>  He experienced a lot in his story.  In the XX century, its shores were lined with stone.  The channel of the Ostankino stream was transferred to the collector. </p>

    <p>  In February 2013, the estate was closed for reconstruction.  Also, the Ostankino pond located on its territory does not work.  The reconstruction will approximately last until December 2016.  During work, the pond will be cleaned.  People who used to like to spend their free time here and relax, ask: ‚ÄúWhat are they building on the Ostankino pond?‚Äù  Do not worry about this.  The pond will remain, nothing will be built in its place.  But the area around it will undergo changes.  There will be additional walkways, playgrounds, a stage.  Reconstruction of the pond and park will benefit. </p>
