    <p>  Moscow is a hero city, the capital of Russia, the oldest bastion of Russian culture and statehood. </p><p>  During its history, it has experienced many crises, seen competent rulers and despots.  However, the most interesting for researchers is the ancient history of the city.  How did a small settlement under the leadership of <span>Yuri Dolgoruky</span> manage to turn into the main city of Russia? </p><p>  The reasons for the rise of Moscow are ambiguous and very peculiar.  In fact, each ruler contributed to the creation of the greatest city on Russian soil.  However, this article is devoted to identifying the true and fundamental causes of its exaltation. </p><p>  1) Moscow was located in a surprisingly convenient and comfortable area for trade.  The main trade routes passed through it, almost all roads ran.  We can say that Moscow is located in the heart of Russia.  Actually, the first mention of the city came to contemporaries and dates from 1147.  Judging by the chronicles, the city ordered to lay Yuri Dolgoruky.  Some of the modern scientists are not sure that it was he who took part in the creation of Moscow, however, this is an established historical fact that has been deposited in the memory of generations.  According to the chronicles, Dolgoruky was fascinated by this land, its favorable location and soil fertility.  Soon, the Muscovites themselves realized that in their hands was a true treasure of incredible value to the entire state.  The city began to grow rich before our eyes. </p><p>  2) The competent policy of the princes is another reason why the rise of Moscow took place.  There could have been no reason for this if not for the notorious fragmentation.  Each prince strove to conquer as many territories as possible, and then to receive tangible income from them.  As a great warrior and strategist, Daniil Aleksandrovich became famous, who actually set the development of a policy of conquering new territories.  He became not only the first prince of Moscow, but also a role model for future rulers.  Prince Yury continued the policy of his father.  It was thanks to the competent and deliberate policy of the first princes that the city was elevated. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  3) There was another reason why the rise of Moscow took place.  Ivan Kalita is still considered the wisest ruler of Moscow.  He managed to achieve not only the exaltation of the city, but also the raising of its cultural level.  Under Kalita, Moscow gradually acquired the status of a capital city, although officially it has not yet received it. </p><p>  4) The reasons for the rise of Moscow are ambiguous, but one of them can be considered fundamental.  It is about moving the metropolis to this city.  Of course, this process was gradual.  At first, after the complete decline of Kiev, the metropolitan had a difficult question about where to move.  He decided to move to Vladimir-on-Klyazma.  The next <span>Metropolitan Peter</span> had great sympathy for Moscow, he often stayed in the city, sometimes for months.  Kalita gladly received Peter, realizing that the transfer of the metropolis would bring his city the final and undeniable status of the capital.  However, Peter did not dare to move to Moscow.  But this was done by his successor Theognost, who settled in the principality of Kalita.  Religion in Russia has always played a special, important value.  In an instant, Moscow turned into the very place where all the citizens of the country flocked in search of a religious refuge. </p><p>  5) The reasons for the rise of Moscow are also directly related to the sympathy of the boyars in relation to the city and its princely elite.  Boyars have always helped the princes of Moscow not in word but in deed, also influencing the change in the positive side of the status of the city. </p><p>  These are the main reasons for the rise of Moscow.  Of course, there were more, about 20.  Despite everything, the city achieved a supreme position in the country.  Many trials have fallen to Moscow itself throughout its history, but she met them all with dignity and honor. </p>
