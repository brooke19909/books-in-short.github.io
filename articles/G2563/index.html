We pay them in kiosks and shops, in public transport and cafeteria.  Even without paying attention to their appearance, we throw the rest into the piggy bank of our son or daughter for various children's expenses.  Although some of them deserve to show off in a special album for numismatists.  After all, there are Russian coins of value.  Such rare specimens are sometimes tens or even hundreds of thousands of rubles. </p><h2>  50 kopecks in 2001 </h2><p>  Which Russian coins are valuable?  First of all, these are those that have never been introduced into the general circulation.  This is how one can characterize the unique 50 kopecks of 2001.  It is known that this monetary unit was minted by the Moscow Mint.  And somehow the part of the party, very small, hit the market.  Numismatists immediately appreciated a rare instance - only on it under the hoof of a horse can you find the treasured letter "m", which made the coin the target of hunting for all collectors.  It is made of an <span>alloy of zinc</span> and copper - brass.  The obverse depicts <span>George the Victorious.</span>  Sitting on his faithful raven, he pierces the head of the monster with a spear.  The original is worth 100-120 thousand rubles. </p>

To do this, they use 50 kopecks, but only in 2004, where the number 4 is neatly and imperceptibly for ordinary people fixed on the cherished unit.  But even a fake coin is relatively cheap.  For a quality fake will have to pay 3-4 thousand rubles.

There is only one officially released copy.  He was discovered already in 2009.  Therefore, it costs more than other valuable Russian coins.  The list of unique numismatic samples is headed precisely by 5 rubles in <span>1999.</span>  Around the history of his appearance, rumors are still circulating, discussions continue.  Could the <span>St. Petersburg Mint</span> have been able to issue a coin in only one single copy?  Be that as it may, but no other analogues have been found to this day. </p>

A coin is made of bimetal: copper, on top of which a cup of nickel silver is placed.  Russian coins of value can envy its value.  It is simply astronomical - 250 thousand rubles.

Just in 2001, the <span>Moscow Mint</span> in honor of the decade of the Commonwealth of Independent States, launched a commemorative banknote.  Of course, it can also become an adornment of your collection.  But it is not very expensive and rare.  The circulation of the issue totals 10 million copies, which are quite easy to find and buy. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

These coins were not going to be officially released to the market, but a couple of them still fell into the private hands of collectors.  Like all modern Russian coins of value, it costs respectively - 30 thousand rubles.  Its appearance is similar to the previous coin: an eagle with two heads and a beautiful twisted twig.  The coin is made of an alloy of nickel and copper, is not attracted by a magnet.  The color of the banknote is silver.

    <h2>  2 rubles 2001 </h2><p>  This differs from the previous coin in even greater value.  The price ranges from 30 to 50 thousand, depending on the appearance and degree of preservation.  Like other valuable Russian coins, the list of which is published in this article, it is very rare and unique in its kind.  It is not known what reasons prompted officials to first put into production 2 rubles in 2001, and then put off the entire batch of goods to gather dust in a warehouse.  Some specimens have come into use, but only the exact number is difficult to determine.  This coin has the usual appearance - the color is white-silver, edging is observed at the edges.  The image of a traditional double-headed eagle is on one side of it, on the other there is a denomination decorated with a tree branch. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

Therefore, money samples that are not published are a treasure for every numismatist.  By the way, they pay attention to various anniversary valuable Russian coins.  10 rubles with the inscription "Chechen Republic", for example, are made of inexpensive metals.  But due to the fact that the banknote is associated with a certain event, its prices are rising annually, which means that demand is also rising.

For example, 3 rubles - biathlon, figure skating, hockey and skiing;  50 rubles - bobsleigh and curling;  100 - "Russian winter";  1000 - "Flora" and so on.

    <p>  The Paralympic Games also received their own monetary symbol.  A coin in denomination of 25 rubles, which depicts Luchik and Snezhinka holding hands, was put into circulation in March 2014. </p><h2>  10 rubles.  Gagarin </h2><p>  That is the name of the banknote, which in 2001 was issued by two mints at once: Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Its circulation was huge - 2 million.  Despite this, the sample is considered valuable, as it is dedicated to a major event in the country: the 40th anniversary of space exploration.  Its edges are made in golden color, the central part of a silver hue.  On one side is a portrait of the legendary Soviet pilot - Yuri Gagarin, on the other - a nominal value of 10 rubles. </p>

Despite this, private individuals sell Gagarin for dozens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of rubles.  The overpriced is unjustified, since the most common inexpensive metals were used in the manufacture of the sample.  But the coin is a memory of the anniversary event, so we can talk about its <span>cultural value</span> for society, which is also important.  Coins like this will become a worthy decoration of your numismatic collection and a pleasant memory of the anniversary of the solemn date.

    <h2>  Other Russian coins of value </h2><p>  If everything is simple with rare and commemorative copies, then how to determine the significance and uniqueness of regularly issued banknotes?  There are three options here that will help novice collectors accurately single out valuable modern Russian coins from the total mass: </p><ul><li>  Wide edging.  If it is present in the coin, then it can be attributed to unique.  For example, the ruble issued in Moscow in 1997 has a wide edging.  At auctions it can be sold for 10 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Mintless unsigned instances.  All modern samples have the abbreviations MMD or SPMD, abbreviated options are possible - "M" and "S-P".  The chances of finding an instance without these tags are small, so they are very much appreciated and are popular with collectors.  For example, 5 kopecks of 2002, on which there is no sign of the mint, cost 4-5 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Banknotes issued in small print runs.  Due to their small number, they are in demand among numismatists.  Their cost is different - from several thousand rubles to tens, and sometimes as many as hundreds. </li></ul><h2>  Mint plans for 2015 </h2><p>  We can say that they are very extensive.  The most valuable Russian coins to be issued will be made of precious metals.  For example, samples from the St. George the Victorious series: 3 rubles from 999 fine gold, 50 from 925 silver.  The series ‚ÄúOutstanding Personalities‚Äù will also be replenished.  Silver copies dedicated to the artist Serov, composer Tchaikovsky and pianist Richter will be minted.  Coins will be made of the same metal in honor of the architects Shechtel and Rinaldi.  And the series ‚ÄúSave Our World‚Äù will include seven more samples under the general name ‚ÄúElk‚Äù.  Also, gold and <span>silver coins</span> will be <span>issued</span> in honor of the 70th anniversary of the victory of the USSR in World War II. </p>

Namely, they will be depicted: Mozhaisk, Taganrog, Khabarovsk, Kovrov, Lomonosov, Petropalovsk-Kamchatsky, Kalach-on-Don and Maloyaroslavets.  One banknote will be dedicated to Mordovia as a subject of the Russian Federation, and a number of coins will appear in honor of the Great Victory.
