This is a digital receiver that has good features.  It allows you to quickly switch between channels, has a small size, and also seamlessly plays files from USB-drives. </p><div class="photo" data-original="seocompass.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Set-top box" class="if uuid-2318496" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2318496.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  This device is not only compact in size, but also has a small weight.  The case is glossy.  The packaging is covered with a shipping film.  Fingerprints may remain on the device during use.  Therefore, in the future it must be installed in a place where no one will touch it. </p><p>  You can connect to a TV via HDMI or RCA mode.  However, it is better to use the first option.

There is also a warranty card.  The remote is small.  However, in the reviews of the Rolsen RDB-517 describe the fact that using it as convenient as possible.  Nobody misses the buttons, the keys for adjusting the volume and switching channels are specially made a little more than the others.  In general, this item is easy to get used to. </p><h2>  Digital set-top box features </h2><p>  This receiver perfectly reproduces any files.  And we are talking about both MP3 and MP4.  Many are concerned about the performance of the described device with regards to multimedia.  Consumer tests indicate that the file manager is very fast.  This unit reproduces even heavy MKV.  Often users watch videos up to 12 GB.  No problems, including freezes, occur. </p><p>  With regards to codecs, their set is only pleasing.  Most versions are supported.  The multimedia and other features of the device are impressive.  This is due to the fact that not every device of this type is capable of boasting similar characteristics.  External drives with a large amount of memory, even if it is 750 GB, open without any delay.  Therefore, it should be said that the Rolsen RDB-517 is a pretty good device. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="leroymerlin.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Receiver panel" class="if uuid-2318493" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2318493.jpg"></div><h2>  Settings </h2><p>  The actual issue is how to configure the device.  It is necessary to direct the antenna towards the telecentre, where the signal is broadcasting from.  Next, turn on the receiver, activate auto search and wait for the results.  If nothing is found, it is necessary to check the antenna settings, if everything works.  If she has her own power supply, then it must be connected to the network.  Next, check the condition of the splitters, if any, and the integrity of the cable.  All wires must be of high quality. </p><p>  Answering the question of how to configure the Rolsen RDB-517, it must be said that it is necessary to take care of the signal level and quality.  Their indicators should reach 100%.  The device is able to reproduce and options with 60-70%.  Sometimes a situation may arise when the level is powerful, but the quality is not more than 20%.  In this case, the channel will show poorly. </p><p>  After the receiver finds all the signals, the search will automatically turn off and the device will switch to viewing mode.  As a rule, the device finds about two multiplexes in which there are 10 channels.  The set of programs for each of them is impressive.  This completes the setup.  Nothing more should be regulated. </p><p>  The main thing you need to remember: if there is no high-quality signal, then there is no reception.  Do not twist the cables into rings, bend them, and so on.  No need to use faulty splitters, it is better to purchase new ones.  If it is not possible to buy an antenna, then you can use the indoor. </p><h2>  Device Reviews </h2><p>  Consumers leave positive feedback about this receiver.  It is fast and small in size.  They also note that the described device can serve as a regular player that can play any files.  The cost of the Rolsen RDB-517 is small, which further pleases consumers.  The approximate price of the device is about 2 thousand rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rolsen.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Remote and Receiver" class="if uuid-2318494" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2318494.jpg"></div><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In general, it must be said that this device is recommended for purchase by all users.
