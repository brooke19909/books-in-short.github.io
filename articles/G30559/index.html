Search for the missing</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How scary to live ... Everyone knows this phrase, but few people really think about it.  The modern world is full of dangers and unexpected situations, the abyss is not so difficult today.  In this article, I want to talk specifically about people who are missing. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="disappear without a trace" class="if" height="265" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460325.jpg" width="321"></div></h2><h2>  About the concept </h2><p>  First of all, of course, you need to decide on the concepts.  So, who is this ‚Äúmissing person"?  It is worth saying that the legislation does not give a clear definition of this concept.  At first glance, it seems to be clear what it means, but as soon as you need to deal with the nuances, many different difficulties and problems can arise.  Indeed, if people simply do not know the whereabouts of their relative or friend, this does not mean that the person was missing.  Only between these two concepts is the line very thin.  And this is just one example.  So, a person is considered missing if he suddenly disappeared, there were no obvious reasons for this, and at the moment his fate and whereabouts are unknown.  After a certain procedure, he is added to the list of missing people.  Such lists exist at local, regional and state levels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What to do? </h2><p>  It is worth saying that almost every person can go missing.  Indeed, today many maniacs and various criminal persons roaming the streets, stealing people for the purpose of ransom, and not only.  Therefore, if a person is missing, you must definitely contact the police for help. </p><ol><li>  If a child under 9 years old is missing, contact the police urgently and immediately. </li><li>  If a teenager is missing, i.e.  He doesn‚Äôt appear at home for a long time after the time of his usual arrival, you must first call all his friends and classmates, and only then write a statement to the police. </li><li>  It is also worth immediately contacting the police if a person is missing whose age exceeds 60 years. </li></ol><p>  The people have an opinion that relatively different rules apply to other people, i.e.  the police give them three days to return.  It is believed that during this time a person can walk up, take offense and return home.  After this period, if the lost person is not found, you should contact the police for help.  However, it is not.  A statement of disappearance in the internal affairs bodies must be accepted no matter how much time has passed since the moment of disappearance. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="missing list" class="if" height="419" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460322.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  When to contact? </h2><p>  A person can go missing at any time, anywhere.  This is worth remembering.  So, there are special cases when you immediately need to contact the police: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  If the missing person received threats before his disappearance. </li><li>  If the missing person at the moment of disappearance could have valuable things, a large sum of money, jewelry. </li><li>  If the missing person owns real estate and valuables. </li><li>  If the missing person left in a company or private car. </li><li>  If the missing person is an important or famous person: political or public figure, entrepreneur, journalist, etc. </li><li>  If a person disappeared, then a ransom demand came. </li></ol><p>  It is worth saying that the application can be submitted to any internal affairs agency, it must be accepted there.  The time of a person‚Äôs absence, his ‚Äúattachment‚Äù to another regional department of the interior, and the absence of a photograph cannot cause a refusal to accept a missing person application. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="missing person search" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460319.jpg" width="320"></div></h2><h2>  Intelligence </h2><p>  In order to facilitate the search for missing persons by the <span>internal affairs bodies</span> , the following information should be provided: </p><ol><li>  The main signs of the missing: height, eye color, physique, moles, tattoos, <span>birthmarks</span> , etc. </li><li>  Clothes in which the missing person was dressed: color, style. </li><li>  What was with me: accessories, documents, jewelry. </li><li>  It is necessary to indicate the important acquaintances of the missing person that may cause the abduction: acquaintance with politicians, businessmen, etc. </li><li>  Indicate possible location. </li></ol><p>  These are important points that they will definitely ask the relatives of the missing person.  However, they can ask other questions that need to be answered as clearly and necessarily honestly as possible.  Any hidden information may interfere with the search for the victim. </p><h2>  Recognition process </h2><p>  An abyss can be anywhere and anytime, as mentioned above repeatedly.  But also to know that there is a certain process of recognizing a person as missing.  It consists of only a few points that must be fulfilled: </p><ol><li>  The absence of a person at the place of residence for quite a long time. </li><li>  The complete lack of knowledge and information about where this person may be. </li><li>  The end of a certain deadline that has passed since the moment when something was known about the person. </li></ol><p>  It is worth saying that the recognition of a person as missing occurs in court at the request of the person concerned (not necessarily a blood relative), if the missing person was absent for a year at the place of residence.  The cancellation of this recognition is carried out when a person appears either himself or some information is sought about his whereabouts. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="missing in WWII" class="if" height="260" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12733/460320.jpg" width="390"></div></h2><h2>  War </h2><p>  A special category are people who are missing in the Second World War, i.e.  during the Great Patriotic War.  Even today, relatives are looking for them, wanting to find out what exactly happened.  It is important to say that a special site was created for the search, where you need to indicate the name, year of birth and rank of the warrior.  There is also the possibility of an advanced search, where it will be necessary to indicate more detailed information.  Today, the database is still under development, information is constantly being added there.  So if you still could not find a missing relative during the Second World War, you should definitely resume attempts a little later. </p>
