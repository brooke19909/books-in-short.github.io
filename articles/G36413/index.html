    <h2>  Hurghada - one of the oldest and most traditional Egyptian resorts </h2><p>  This name, known to many in ancient times, had a different meaning than now.  Once upon a time, the route from the Roman Empire to the mysterious eastern countries passed through the southern part of this resort, and from there they brought rare expensive fabrics for the nobility and spices for fine cuisine.  Quarries and mines were located nearby, from where they took material for the construction of many architectural monuments, which we admire now.  Until now, not far from Hurghada, the so-called "Claudius Mountain" has been preserved, where the remains of the Roman camp are located.  There, archaeologists discovered dwellings, workshops, walls for defense against nomads, and much more.  But with the fall of the <span>Roman Empire,</span> these places became an abandoned province, and for many years Hurghada was famous only for the production of carpets and good fish.  The decisive event for these places was the Arab-Israeli war, when water was brought here for the needs of the army.  What else is needed for the desert to bloom? </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Therefore, in recent years, Hurghada has become a world famous resort.  Beautiful sandy beaches, coral reefs, warm climate have made it a center of attraction for many vacationers from different parts of the world.  And from Russia, of course, too.  Being here is not only pleasant for body and soul, but also not burdensome for a wallet, especially if you choose a hotel like Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 * (Hurghada, Egypt).  After all, here the excellent service is combined with very reasonable and reasonable prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel reviews festival shedwan golden beach resort" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/700083.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Budget resort hotels </h2><p>  Hurghada does not belong to the category of fashionable resorts such as Sharm El Sheikh.  Therefore, there are a lot of "three rubles", and also the Egyptian "spill."  The prices in them are more than affordable, but too picky tourists should not go there, so as not to be disappointed.  The furniture in their rooms, as a rule, leaves much to be desired, the cleaning and cleanliness of the territory, too, as a rule, are not up to par.  The vast majority of ‚Äúthree rubles‚Äù in Hurghada does not have its own access to the sea (although, to be honest, these are the ‚Äúfours‚Äù here).  As a rule, mostly young people have a rest here, who do not have enough money for hotels of a higher class.  They also prefer hotels closer to the center, so that they can easily reach dance floors, discos, nightclubs and other entertainment appropriate to their age. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Quite a lot among the guests of hotels of this class and family people burdened with children.  The main thing for them is the low price, good service, all-inclusive meals and the ability to sunbathe and heal the children in a safe place.  But the Hotel Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 * (Egypt) is significantly different from the rest of the "three rubles" in this resort.  Its location right on the sea, chic beaches, excellent service, excellent food and helpful staff have become the reason for its excellent reputation among tourists who prefer this hotel more expensive and fashionable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Festival shedwan golden beach resort 3 egypt" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/700080.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Good location </h2><p>  Transfer from the airport to the hotel complex takes only twenty minutes.  This is very important for vacationers who come with small children.  The area where the Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 * Egypt Hurghada is located is called Dahar.  This is the territory of the old city.  There are many pharmacies, markets where you can buy fruits, and fairly cheap shops.  A big bonus of the hotel's location is that it is here that locals are purchased, and therefore all goods can be bought at least several times cheaper than in the city center.  A ten minute walk from the hotel is a grocery supermarket chain "Abu Ashara" with fixed prices.  Near the hotel you can also take a minibus and for a pound or two get to the "downtown" of Hurghada or any of its area.  In a word, there is where to go out in the evening to buy souvenirs, fruit or just have fun.  By the way, the hotel has its own taxi, quite cheap and convenient for tourists. </p><h2>  Territory </h2><p>  This hotel is new.  It was built in the last century, in 1986.  But a couple of years ago, she survived the repair and reconstruction.  Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort has several buildings (two or three floors) and bungalows, picturesquely scattered across a beautiful garden.  There are many beautiful palm trees of different types, skillfully trimmed bushes, flowers.  Tourists love to be photographed in the hotel park.  They constantly clean something, sweep, clean.  Therefore, everything is extremely well-groomed everywhere.  The hotel garden is so big that you can just get lost in it.  The hotel has a hairdresser, laundry, dry cleaning, Internet cafe.  There you can buy a Wai-Fai access card for three dollars per hour. </p><p>  Washing clothes at the hotel is profitable.  A whole big bag can be gotten clean for ten dollars.  You just need to fill out a special form at the reception.  The hotel has a number of shops with perfumes, souvenirs and beach accessories.  You can smoke a hookah, treat yourself to beauty treatments and massages at the spa.  Hotel Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort (Egypt) shares the territory with another four-star Smart Line Color Beach hotel.  Mostly European tourists live there, free Wi-Fi is available throughout, there is a heated pool, and superior rooms.  To get there, you need to pay five dollars per person per day.  You cannot buy a ticket to Smart Line right away; they are not sold in Russia.  But if you stipulate the number ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù in a travel agency, then you can safely settle there.  As for other territory and benefits, including the restaurant.  If the season is low and the hotel is not very full, then it happens that tourists are allowed to use all the services of Color Beach.  But they still live in the buildings of Shedwan. </p>

    <h2>  Beach vacation </h2><p>  Reviews of the Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort hotel suggest that the coast at the hotel is huge - as much as seven hundred meters.  This is a private area.  There are as many as three beaches.  One of them is located on the spit, and those who want privacy go there.  The beaches are sandy, comfortable, separated by three lagoons.  They are very clean.  There is a pier going to the sea, to the corals.  Sunbathing, according to vacationers, is very comfortable, the water is clean.  In general, getting to the beaches of the hotel, vacationers forget about all its shortcomings.  There are many umbrellas, sunbeds, barriers from the wind, towels for sunbathing.  Not only the coast, the entrance to the sea is also sandy.  One of the beaches is conditionally called among the vacationers ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù, the other - ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù (the guests there are mostly ‚ÄúSmart Line‚Äù guests).  And the third one, the one on the spit, is wild, although there is a small bar and a beautiful beachboy. </p><p>  On the beaches of Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 *, you can not only play soccer or volleyball, but also go diving, snorkelling or windsurfing.  Kids can ride here on a water slide.  Recently they have been under repair, but the administration promises to open them soon.  Near the entrance to the water near one of the beaches there is a coral reef where you can swim with a mask.  It‚Äôs best to get there from the spit.  Various vacationers will like the bathing in the sea - both for good swimmers and those who can only splash around the shore.  There are different places here - with great depth, shallow and medium.  The hotel also has several pools.  One of them is heated, but only Smart Line guests can swim there.  Although families with small children are given written permission to swim in such a pool. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews for shedwan golden beach resort 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/700092.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and shopping </h2><p>  When we look at what is around the complex, it becomes clear that it is not for nothing that this hotel deserves such good reviews.  Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 * is a hotel that is suitable not only for those who want to sunbathe and swim, but also for lovers of travel and shopping.  Even if you go very close to it, then there is always the opportunity to walk around Dahar and get acquainted with the local flavor.  In the local shops you can cheaply purchase various household trifles for the home, as well as cosmetics, not only Egyptian, but also Italian.  From the hotel you can take a minibus to Sheraton - it costs two pounds per person one way.  A quarter of an hour's walk from the hotel is the fruit market, where they buy inexpensive mangoes, strawberries, figs, dates. </p><p>  You can also get to the fish market by minibus.  King prawns, lobsters, exotic fish are purchased at very low prices.  For five pounds all of this will fire you.  Excursions the Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 * hotel (Hurghada) offers standard ones - Paradise Island, Luxor, ATVs or jeeps in the desert, Cairo (which can be connected to Alexandria), <span>El Gouna.</span>  Many people like traveling on a yacht.  There included visits to the islands, diving with masks.  You can see dolphins. </p><h2>  Reviews about the hotel Shedwan Golden Beach Resort 3 * </h2><p>  Hotel prices are average - thirty-six thousand rubles for two for eleven days.  But there are promotions when you can get good discounts.  Tourists who previously rested in hotels of a class higher write that at first they doubted whether to go to this budget hotel.  But when they read the opinions of the regulars, they discarded all fears.  In their reviews, guests often thank the Shedwan administration for doing everything possible so that vacationers feel as good as possible.  Here is a beautiful territory, better than some of the "fives".  Tourists characterize the hotel food as very worthy, especially for the "three rubles".  Everything is fresh, tasty, varied.  For food everyone puts the hotel only the highest scores.  The staff is friendly and helpful. </p><p> Holidaymakers know the animators by name and leave great feedback about them.  You can read some reviews about this place: ‚ÄúOh, Festival Shedwan Golden Beach Resort is so cool!‚Äù  You can‚Äôt even say at first that this is a three-star hotel.  It is recommended even for discerning tourists.  Some guests call this hotel their favorite.  They give him a rating much higher than the declared three stars.  About the rest in it are only pleasant memories.  Comparing this hotel with some ‚Äúfives‚Äù, for example, with ‚ÄúDesert Rose‚Äù, vacationers draw conclusions in favor of ‚ÄúShedvan‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt want to leave at all, as tourists say, because there are frequent cases of farewell with tears in our eyes. </p>
