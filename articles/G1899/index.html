The king, who conquered half the world, was an outstanding person, an intelligent and educated man, a talented military leader and a good warrior.  Of course, he also had flaws: he was rather cruel, did not like being opposed or resisted, had a passion for alcohol.  Attributed to him a cold attitude towards women and sexual attraction to men.  But this did not prevent him from having many loyal friends and associates, the soldiers simply adored him.  And what attracts you to the personality of Alexander the Great?  Let's figure it out together! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="What attracts you to the personality of Alexander the Great" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/765295.jpg" width="306"></div>

    <h2>  Excursion into the past </h2><p>  Before talking about what attracts you to the personality of Alexander of Macedon, it is worth familiarizing yourself with the life story of this <span>amazing person.</span>  A lot of information has been preserved about him.  According to information, the heir of Philip II was born on the night when Herostratus burned the <span>temple of Artemis at Ephesus</span> - one of the wonders of the ancient world.  The boy was taught military craft from an early age, but he gained good knowledge in many fields.  Philosophy, religion, culture, medicine, mathematics - these are some of the sciences that the future king understood.  At the age of ten he tamed Bucephalus, and at sixteen he took part in the first military campaign.  Having exchanged two dozen, Alexander ascended the throne after the death of his father and reprisal against possible rivals.  It is possible that he himself organized the murder of Philip.  The rebellious neighbors wanted to take advantage of the fact that an inexperienced youth appeared on the throne of Macedonia.  However, the troops of Alexander of Macedon, <span>souls not repenting</span> in their commander, stood behind him a wall.  Thus began the victorious procession of the new king and his legendary conquests. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="troops of Alexander the Great" class="if" height="256" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/765296.jpg" width="600"></div>

First, he strengthened his power in his homeland, tamed the rebellious Greek cities, and then turned his eyes to the rest of the world.  He defeated the Persian Empire and burned its capital Persepolis, conquered Egypt, <span>Asia Minor,</span> Syria.  In <span>Central Asia,</span> he fought with varying success, and to gain a foothold in these lands he was helped by marriage to a local girl Roxanne, daughter of a nobleman. </p><p>  A trip to India, organized by the Macedonian after a short rest, failed.  First of all, because his army, brilliantly organized for open battles, met absolutely atypical resistance.  Difficult conditions joined the partisan attacks: heat, lack of drinking water, previously unheard of illnesses.  Realizing his mistake, the king stops the campaign.  The ability to stop in time is another feature that attracts you to the personality of Alexander of Macedon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="life of Alexander the Great" class="if" height="471" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11992/765297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Death of a legend </h2><p>  Upon returning from India, Alexander undertook the arrangement of his empire.  He laid cities, carried out reforms, married himself and married his close associates to girls of noble birth in conquered lands.  Staying in Babylon, the king is preparing a new campaign against the Arabs, making plans for the siege of Carthage.  However, before he reaches his thirty-third birthday, Macedonian dies.  Death is considered natural, but there are versions that the <span>great commander was</span> poisoned or that he was self-medicating and exceeded the dose of the medicine.  Also, Alexander could die from an intestinal infection, a sexual illness or excessive drinking.  The body of the ruler was delivered to Alexandria, in Egypt, and buried there.  And the empire was divided between friends and soon ceased to exist. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  And what attracts you to the personality of Alexander the Great?  This is not only the mind and talent of the commander.  This is prudence, the careful development of an action plan, innovation (the tsar often committed unforeseen acts, which made his opponents by surprise), flexibility, pressure and perseverance.  He knew how to get people to himself, the warriors only once refused to follow their king - deep into India, exhausted by a nearly ten-year campaign.  Alexander never hid behind the backs of soldiers, but led the attack, personally healed his people and was interested in their affairs.  Undoubtedly, having been born in our time, Macedon could have become an outstanding politician and organizer, capable of turning the tide of history. </p>
