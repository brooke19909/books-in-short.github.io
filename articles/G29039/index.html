The dense membrane of the cell is absent, in connection with which the amoeba can easily change its shape.  The outer coating is a very thin cytoplasmic membrane. </p><p>  Amoeba is an ordinary structure. </p><p>  Amoeba is very simple.  One of the simplest living things.  It has no skeleton.  Common amoeba lives at the bottom of various reservoirs, in silt.  There is one thing but: in freshwater bodies only: a pond, ditch, etc.  If you look at it, it is noticeable that this gray transparent lump does not have a constant shape.  The name of this creature translates as ‚Äúmutable."  False legs form all the time on the body of the cell, due to the fact that the cytoplasm flows here and there.  The size of the lump can be at least 0.2 millimeters and at most 0.7 millimeters.  Pseudopod organoids contribute to the movement of this tiny creature.  The movement is very slow, it resembles a flow of thick mucus.  During the movement, the amoeba encounters various unicellular organisms, such as algae, bacteria.  It flows around them and, as it were, is absorbed by its own cytoplasm, while a digestive vacuole is formed. </p><p>  Cytoplasm amoeba secretes specific enzymes that digest food.  There is a process of intracellular digestion.  Digested foods in liquid form enter the cytoplasm itself, and undigested food residues are discarded.  This capture method is called phagocytosis.  In the body of the amoeba there are thin channels through which fluid enters the body of the cell.  This process is called pinocytosis.  There is one vacuole that throws excess liquid products out.  It is called <span>contractile vacuole.</span>  Get rid of excess every five minutes.  There is a nucleus in the endoplasm.  Reproduction occurs as follows: the cell is divided in half, that is, asexually. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How an amoeba is fenced off from an adverse effect from the outside. </p><p>  If unfavorable conditions arise for the existence of this microorganism, such as drying out of a reservoir, cooling of water in a reservoir, and others, the ordinary amoeba always seeks to fence itself off from them.  It draws its organelles, becomes covered with a double shell and, thus, forms a cyst.  With the onset of favorable conditions, such as summer, the amoeba leaves the cyst.  The cyst is carried by the wind, so the common amoeba is settled.  The breath of this creature takes place over the entire surface of its body, that is, the body of the cell.  Amoeba absorbs oxygen available in the aquatic environment, emits carbon dioxide.  With the help of oxygen, food substances are decomposed into simpler compounds.  In the human body and many animals, in particular, in their intestines, parasite amoeba live.  One of the representatives of such parasites is a <span>dysenteric amoeba.</span>  She feeds on intestinal particles (destroyed), as well as red blood cells.  It is the causative agent of an infectious disease called <span>amoebic dysentery.</span> </p><p>  Conclusions: </p><p>  - common amoeba and dysenteric amoeba are <span>unicellular animals.</span>  Move with the help of organelles, pseudopods, belong to the roots; </p><p>  - the class of roots is like algae, which indicates their kinship; </p><p>  - feeds on <span>organic substances</span> inherited from other plants, or from other <span>simple organisms,</span> which distinguishes their amoeba from algae. </p><p>  Amoeba is, although the simplest, but the whole organism, capable of independent existence. </p>
