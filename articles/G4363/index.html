Developers from the Japanese company Sony did not stand aside.  At the beginning of 2014, it was decided to show the Sony Xperia Z2 d6503 as the main flagship of the line.  The Japanese did not think for a long time about the characteristics of their new smartphone and tried to make each of its elements the best in comparison with the main competitors.  We succeeded or not, we learn from a further review. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 d6503" class="if" height="472" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Key Specifications </h2><p>  Sony did not save on its new flagship smartphone <span>Sony Xperia</span> Z2 d6503.  The characteristics of this model are amazing.  Let's start with the processor.  As it was chosen quad-core Snapdragon 801, the clock frequency of each core of which is 2.3 GHz.  And these are very good processor characteristics compared to even the flagships of past years.  RAM for this device is also enough - 3 GB.  Both the processor and the RAM will be enough to be able to play freezes in the most "heavy" games of our time.  The internal memory of the smartphone <span>Sony Xperia Z2 d6503</span> is 16 GB.  If this amount is not enough, then you can always buy an additional MicroSD card to increase the total memory capacity of the smartphone.  Like many other flagships from competing companies, the smartphone from the Japanese manufacturer boasts the Android 4.4.2 operating system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 d6503 reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579598.jpg" width="600"></div>

But this is only if you look at it, and not hold it in your hand.  The fact is that the new smartphone differs from its counterpart in dimensions.  If Z1 has a more impressive weight, then Z2 gravitates to a longer shape and thin body.  However, this circumstance did not prevent the newly-minted flagship from acquiring a capacious 3200 mAh battery, which is enough for a whole day of work.  There are two color options for the Sony Xperia Z2 d6503: black and white.  The smartphone has a screen diagonal of 5.2 inches.  On the front part there are light and proximity sensors, as well as the main company logo.  All the main buttons are located on the right side of the smartphone, which makes it convenient to use it if you're right-handed.  Here are the volume control buttons, and the power button, as well as connectors for a microSD card.  On the left side is a slot for a USB device, which helps when charging and connecting the smartphone to a personal computer.  On the top there is only a hole for the headset.  The back panel of the smartphone is glossy, and the Sony brand name is printed on its surface.  In addition, in the upper left part is the main camera in more than 20 MP, which makes the Sony Xperia Z2 d6503 one of the most powerful camera phones of our time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 d6503 price" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579601.jpg" width="600"></div>

At its core, the camera is almost the same as on the Z1, but the developers claim that the quality of the photos should be noticeably different.  In fact, in conditions of good light, the quality of the pictures is really at a different level, but at night the image detail is not very different from the smartphone of last year. </p><h2>  Sound </h2><p>  For music lovers, this parameter is almost the main thing.  It should be noted right away that the sound quality of music on Sony smartphones is worse than that of competitors from Samsung and the NTS.  The Sony Xperia Z2 d6503 was no exception.  The reviews of experts who reviewed this model suggest that the speakers of the smartphone could be louder, and the sound quality is better.  That is, the assurances of the developers that each element of this smartphone is considered competitive are not very similar to the truth.  At least in a situation with sound.  The sound volume during a conversation could also be stronger.  In a loud environment, you need to increase the sound level to the maximum in order to be able to hear your interlocutor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 d6503 review" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579602.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Performance and durability </h2><p>  The Sony Xperia Z2 d6503 smartphone has the latest Snapsragon 801 chipset, which can significantly increase overall performance compared to its predecessors.  In terms of performance, this device proved to be very good.  While using the phone, there were no lags when switching programs, as well as when trying to download and play the most "heavy" games on Android.  Also very pleased with the high-capacity battery.  With a strong loading of the smartphone and watching on it a widescreen movie with high brightness, the battery lasts almost 12 hours.  That is, under normal conditions, the battery capacity may last at least 2 days. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 d6503 black" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579604.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Like many other smartphones from Sony or other manufacturers, the Sony Xperia Z2 d6503 has a very prosaic set of components.  Firstly, after purchasing a smartphone you will be given a company box with all the purchase data.  Secondly, inside the box itself, you can find, in addition to the phone, a document - instructions on how to use the phone, a USB cable to connect the smartphone to an electricity network or a computer, an adapter for charging the phone, as well as a branded headset from Sony.  Headphones are not something sophisticated, so if you consider yourself a music lover, it is better to immediately get new ones. </p><h2>  Smartphone Prices </h2><p>  As has been repeatedly mentioned above in the review, the Sony Xperia Z2 d6503 is the flagship of the Japanese manufacturer of communicators, and therefore you should not expect a low price from it.  The starting price for it is in the region of six hundred US dollars for a standard model without additional memory cards and other ‚Äúlotions‚Äù.  In case of additional costs, the cost of a smartphone can reach $ 700.  It is also worth remembering that in various dealer stores the cost of a smartphone, as well as the terms of sale, may vary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sony xperia z2 d6503 specifications" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23189/579605.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews and expert opinions </h2><p>  If you read the reviews of people who bought this model of smartphone, then you can stumble upon most of the laudatory responses.  Everyone, without exception, is impressed by the phone's performance, which allows you to play even those games that can not always go on modern computers.  Also, as a plus compared to the previous flagship in the face of Z1, the quality of daytime photography is noted.  Buyers note that the detail has become noticeably better, the quality of the photos corresponds to a 20-megapixel camera.  Among the minuses, some consumers note the sound quality in the dynamics, namely their insufficient volume.  Another disadvantage is the high cost of the Sony Xperia Z2 d6503.  The price for it, as already mentioned, can reach $ 700.  But this is rather a temporary minus, since after a couple of months this model will be available at a much lower cost.  Experts agreed that the phone is able to win the fight for primacy over its opponents in 2014 by correcting some of the shortcomings that were visible in the previous model.  They also noted the long duration of the phone, which is caused by a high-capacity battery - 3200 mAh. </p><p>  In general, the smartphone turned out to be of very decent quality.  And if you have extra 600-700 dollars lying around in your pockets in order to update your phone, then this model may be suitable for this like no other. </p>
