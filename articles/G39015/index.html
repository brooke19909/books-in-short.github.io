In December 1999, the mayor P.I. Pimashkov decided to create a unique Flora and Fauna Park.  The park got its name from the stream of the same name, which flows nearby.

    <p>  Fortunately, today the parks in Krasnoyarsk are in excellent condition.  In 2010, a large-scale reconstruction began here.  The work was completed at the end of 2012.  Today, the park‚Äôs alleys are decorated with magnificent flower vases; here you can see the Japanese garden and an excellent lawn roll.  All sidewalks have been restored in the park.  Convenient benches are installed around the park so that everyone can enjoy the fresh air. </p><p>  Rest in Krasnoyarsk is also sports.  The park has created wonderful playgrounds for children and sports.  And, of course, the special pride of the townspeople is the magnificent singing fountain. </p><h2>  Central park </h2><p>  It is hard to imagine that in the middle of a large modern city there can be a real island of taiga.  And Krasnoyarsk can be proud of such an attraction.  The park was founded back in 1828.  He took the place of the cottage of the first governor of the Yenisei province <span>A. Stepanov.</span> </p><p>  When laying the park, it was part of a pine forest.  In 1934, it was renamed the A.M. Gorky PKO.  At the same time, it was divided into two zones.  The first is active (west of the central alley).  There were attractions.  The second part (east of the alley) was very quiet, and it was intended for a relaxing holiday. </p><p>  In 2002, the park was once again renamed.  Since that time, it has become Central Park.  Today, there are many valuable species of trees and bushes growing here: pine and <span>spruce, Siberian</span> larch and mountain ash, elm, <span>Hungarian lilac</span> and redcurrant, caragana and <span>aronia.</span>  In the park you can see several larch and pine trees, whose age is more than two and a half centuries. </p><p>  The central avenue of the park is framed by fountains.  She descends to the Yenisei and smoothly passes into the hydropark.  Here you can enjoy pedalos and pleasure boats.  Many-meter fountains erupt from the water surface, which are illuminated in the evening.  The park is decorated with original flower lawns, original compositions from green spaces - quite rare trees for this region (including palm trees). </p><h2>  Circus </h2><p>  The State Circus in Krasnoyarsk is located on the avenue named after the newspaper Krasnoyarsk Worker, located on the right bank of the Yenisei River.  In Krasnoyarsk, a special attitude to circus art.  For the first time, visiting guest performers are mentioned in documents dated to the beginning of the 19th century.  In those days, the modest home-made tents of visiting artists differed from the luxurious building of the current circus, built in 1971. </p>

Shkvarok </h2><p>  In recent years, new restaurants and cafes have opened in Krasnoyarsk.  "Shkvarok" - an original institution located in the city center, offering visitors dishes of Ukrainian cuisine: jellied meat, borscht, dumplings, etc. I would like to note the design of the dishes.
