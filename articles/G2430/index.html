They obeyed other laws, had a different meaning in life, and even considered time differently.  Slavic watches are forgotten by us together with the ancient faith, but their special account makes us think about the modern way of life. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Slavic-Aryan watches came from legendary times, when the Aryans still lived on the mysterious mainland at the North Pole.  The global flood and further cooling led them to Eurasia.  They called their new place of residence Rosseniya. </p><p>  The Arians decided to start life anew and began a new reckoning.  111823 years have passed since the time of the great migration.  The old system of time counting remained for many centuries, up to forced Christianization. </p><p>  The system was partially preserved by the Old Believers, but after the <span>decree of Peter I,</span> only one calendar, the Gregorian, began to be considered correct.  After that, all other <span>calculus systems</span> began to be eradicated and were no longer mentioned in the documentation. </p><h2>  Time </h2><p>  Slavic watches begin their countdown not at midnight, as is customary now, but in the evening.  When all things are done for today, a new day begins.  In the summer it is 19:00, and in the winter - an hour earlier. </p><p>  Only in the Slavic group of languages ‚Äã‚Äãis there such a concept - day.  It is like woven or docked together day and night.  The countdown begins in the evening, the legend says that it was at this time that a person appeared on earth, and this became the starting point. </p><p>  We are used to using 24 hours a day, standard walkers go through two circles.  In the Slavic-Aryan measuring system in days of 16 hours.  This does not mean that the ancients had a shorter day, or another biological rhythm, it‚Äôs just that the Slavic hour includes 90, not 60 standard minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Daily circle </h2><p>  The daily circle is divided into 4 equal parts, for each time of the day it takes 4 hours: evening, night, morning and day.  Each hour has its own special meaning and name, reflecting its essence: </p><ol><li>  Paobed is the first hour of a new day. </li><li>  Vecir - star dew crumbles in heaven. </li><li>  A draw is an odd time of three moons. </li><li>  Caught - time full passage of the lunar path. </li><li>  Morning - the comfort of star dew. </li><li>  Zaura - the radiance of stars. </li><li>  Zaurnice - the completion of the radiance of star dew. </li><li>  Nastya - morning dawn. </li><li>  Swaor - the ascent of the solar circle. </li><li>  Dry - reassurance grew. </li><li>  Get out - the way of collecting soothing dew. </li><li>  Obesity - time to get together. </li><li>  Lunch - Poverty, afternoon meal. </li><li>  Podani is a short rest from business. </li><li>  Utdayni is the time to complete all remaining tasks for today. </li><li>  Poudani - the end of the day. </li></ol><p>  Slavic watches do not go clockwise, but in the direction of the sun, for the uninitiated it may seem that time is going in the wrong direction.  An arrow in the peak position in the evening may also seem strange to those who are used to seeing such a picture at noon or midnight. </p>

    <h2>  Additional functions </h2><p>  Unlike modern ones, Slavic-Aryan watches still carry a lot of information, except for a simple count of time.  In the second circle of Chislobog there are runes denoting the heavenly halls.  Each rune carries a deep sacred meaning.  This has become the reason for their widespread use.  They decorated clothes, utensils, made charms for children and at home. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Around deeper are the elements.  Unlike classical teachings, there are not 4, but 9 as many: earth, star, fire, sun, tree, heaven, ocean, moon, god.  Even closer to the center are the days of the week, there are also 9. The arrangement in the circle helps to determine not only the day, but also the patron god corresponding to the heavenly chamber.  This helped to correctly identify the patron according to the date of birth. </p><p>  The clock helped to choose the right occupation for each day of the week and the time period during the day.  The patron gods helped to do everything correctly and with maximum result. </p>

    <h2>  Long cycles </h2><p>  The Slavic year began in September, exactly on the day of the autumn solstice.  There were only 3 seasons: winter, spring, autumn.  In an ordinary year, even months had 40 days, and odd months 41. Each sixteenth year was considered sacred, all its months had 41 days.  Unlike modern leap years, the holy year was considered the most successful. </p><p>  The life cycle of the <span>Slavic calendar</span> consists of 144 years, 16 years for each of the 9 elements.  The patron of the <span>autumn solstice</span> was considered the patron saint of the whole year.  Autumn is also not in vain considered the beginning of the year.  At this time, all major work is completed, harvested, stockpiles for the winter prepared.  After completing work, you can safely begin a new circle of life. </p><p>  At first glance, the system seems complicated and confusing, but if you look at it once, a lot becomes clear.  Today, people have completely different <span>rhythms of life,</span> but this watch is ideally combined with natural biorhythms.  They helped to live a measured life, without rush and unnecessary stress. </p>

    <p>  In the modern world, everyone uses one count of time, but in antiquity almost every nation had its own system.  Slavic watches ideally fit the lifestyle of the most ancient ancestors.  Moreover, not only time fit into them, but also religious culture and cosmogonic ideas about the world. </p>
