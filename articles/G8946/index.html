Sch√∂nbrunn, without exaggeration, can be called the main rival of Versailles.  A magnificent architectural complex, which includes a magnificent palace, a picturesque garden and a zoo, is a true gem of architectural art. </p><h2>  Ancient legend </h2><p>  In the XIV century, on the site of Austria's most famous cultural monument, there was a small monastery estate, which passed into the possession of the powerful monarch of the Habsburg dynasty.  An old legend says that the hunting emperor Matvey unexpectedly stumbled upon a transparent spring, quietly murmuring among the green thickets.  The enthusiastic ruler could not help expressing feelings and cried out: ‚ÄúSchone Brunnen!‚Äù, Which translates as ‚Äúwonderful source‚Äù.  So this phrase became the name of the future castle of the Austrian monarchs. </p>

    <h2>  The history of the construction of a luxury palace </h2><p>  At the end of the XVII century, after an attack by Turkish troops, the building was seriously damaged and required restoration.  It was decided to build a new palace, more luxurious than the previous one.  The invited architect took as a basis for a large-scale project the magnificent residence of the "sun king" - Versailles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The work was argued, and already in 1728 the beautiful Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in Vienna became the residence of Emperor Charles VI, who presented the castle of his daughter, Archduke of Austria Maria Theresa, in a few years.  According to her, the official residence, which has become the center of the political life of the country, is overgrown with new buildings. </p><p>  A theater appears, giving performances for noble people, office space, a mezzanine.  By order of <span>Maria Theresa</span> , the arrangement of a landscape gardening zone begins. </p><p>  The spouse of the empress proposed to build greenhouses in which rare plants and exotic flowers were delivered from different parts of the globe.  Fond of botany and zoology, he dreamed of gathering in one place animals and birds that would feel at ease in captivity.  So, in the XVIII century, the first large zoo in Europe was built. </p><h2>  From the affairs of bygone days to the present </h2><p>  Unfortunately, after the death of the empress, the palace complex, which is used only as a summer residence, becomes desolate, and after the repair work is carried out, many rooms are deprived of magnificent decoration.  And only during the reign of <span>Franz Joseph</span> , who constantly lived in the palace, does a new era begin in the history of the ancient castle. </p><p>  During the Second World War, the European capital of culture, Vienna, was hit hard by fascist bombing.  Sch√∂nbrunn did not escape the sad fate of other architectural monuments, and after the end of hostilities the British headquarters was located in the castle.  Twenty-four years ago, a private company took upon itself all the costs of restoring an outstanding landmark of world significance, now accessible for tourists. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Greatness of an architectural masterpiece </h2><p>  The palace, consisting of more than 1,400 halls and rooms, evokes a sense of admiration for all visitors.  True, tourists will be able to inspect no more than forty rooms, but even this is enough to convince themselves of the greatness of the historical monument, which charming Vienna considers its visiting card.  Sch√∂nbrunn, owned by <span>the Habsburg dynasty,</span> gives everyone the opportunity to appreciate the unique skill of architects who created an amazing masterpiece of art. </p>

    <h2>  The main trouble - lack of time </h2><p>  The palace guests will find truly magnificent halls and galleries, a wonderful park with many sculptures and fountains, the oldest zoo in Europe, a Japanese garden and much more.  By the way, the old Sch√∂nbrunn (Vienna) offers tourists memorable entertainment for adults and children, which can not be ignored. </p><p>  Therefore, it is recommended to stock up on time, and experienced tourists admit that even two days is not enough to see all the sights of the former residence. </p><h2>  Mirror Hall </h2><p>  So, a fascinating journey through the palace, where ancient history comes to life, begins, and on the way of tourists there appears the first hall with many mirrors that visually enlarge the space.  During the reign of Maria Theresa, oaths of allegiance were sworn here, and young Mozart first appeared before his empress. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Visitors will be surprised by the unusual beauty of Chinese vases and the altar in the hall dedicated to the Virgin Mary. </p><h2>  Large gallery </h2><p>  You can not pass by two wonderful halls, considered the most luxurious in the residence.  The impressive Large Gallery is a huge ceremonial room of the palace.  Designed for meetings with foreign guests and lavish balls, it delights with stunning interiors.  High rounded windows, large mirrors in original frames, gold trim, walls decorated with bright frescoes, a painted ceiling make all visitors stop to enjoy authentic art. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sch√∂nbrunn castle in Vienna" class="if" height="485" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1324596.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Small Gallery </h2><p>  In the second hall, adjacent to the Bolshoi, festive banquets and music concerts were held to delight the emperors' ears.  Here are marble busts of the empresses, and <span>unusual chandeliers,</span> carved in wood and covered with gilding, cause a feeling of admiration. </p><p>  Despite its small size, the Small Gallery is not inferior in the chic design of the Big.  Sunlight spreading in the morning gives the room a truly unreal look.  It seems that liquid gold flows down the walls and chandeliers, and the hall turns into the home of the gods. </p><p>  From the windows of the Small Gallery guests enjoy a wonderful panorama of the well-kept park. </p><h2>  Cabinet of the emperor </h2><p>  The next room, which requires inspection, is called Worker.  This is the favorite office of the great emperor Franz Joseph, who breathed life into the Sch√∂nbrunn castle in Vienna.  The room looks very modest, without any frills.  Such conciseness and simplicity speak of the tastes of an important politician who fundamentally refused luxury. </p><p>  Here you can consider some personal items and a posthumous portrait of the emperor. </p>

    <h2>  Sisi's Room </h2><p>  From Franz Joseph‚Äôs personal account, visitors go to the room that belonged to his wife, the famous Sisi.  The first beauty of Austria, Elizabeth of Bavaria, was known as the standard of femininity and was very afraid to grow old.  The princess, who survived many tragedies, died at the hands of a terrorist in 1898.  In her chambers, decorated with French silk, there is a sculpture of the sad empress, whose charm was admired by all of Vienna.  Sch√∂nbrunn is the place that Elizabeth incredibly loved. </p><h2>  Millionth Hall </h2><p>  Well, the most interesting hall is rightfully the Millionth, for whose decoration it is called the pearl of the majestic palace.  Wonderful rosewood panels and gold trim delight even many travelers who have seen it. </p>

    <h2>  Park complex </h2><p>  After an informative tour of the majestic monument of Austria, tourists go to the marvelous Sch√∂nbrunn park in Vienna, located directly behind the palace.  The amazing beauty of living arches from climbing plants, colorful flower beds, stylishly designed gardens, whole galleries of blossoming roses give endless pleasure to the eyes of the guests of the capital. </p><p>  Launched at the beginning of the XVIII century, a regular park, recognized as a real decoration of the palace complex, occupies more than 160 hectares.  In the green oasis, the geometric clarity of all the lines is clearly traced, and at the intersections of flat alleys there are fountains surprising in the beauty of water jets.  In the most famous pavilion, a marble nymph holding an amphora attracts the eyes, from which the very source that gave the name to the architectural ensemble flows. </p><p>  There are two paid gardens in the park, but the intricate labyrinth of boxwood bushes and the greenhouse with citrus plants cannot be ignored. </p><h2>  What else to see? </h2><p>  Visitors to the Austrian national treasure tell of the impressive man-made ruins symbolizing Carthage, destroyed by the Romans.  This is a silent reminder of the strength and power of the Austrian emperors. </p><p>  And at the sight of an obelisk dedicated to the Habsburg dynasty, everyone is breathtaking: a monument decorated with relief images rests on the backs of huge turtles. </p><p>  Exotic Japanese kindergarten as if created for meditation: a quiet pond, surrounded by green mosses and marvelous plants, causes a feeling of peace.  Here you can succumb to the charms of a cozy place and relax from all worries. </p>
