    <h2>  Cesars Temple De Luxe Hotel (Belek): Russian traveler reviews </h2><p>  As many experienced travelers know, choosing a hotel is a very important step in planning any trip abroad.  After all, the quality of your vacation and the impressions that remain from it will largely depend on this.  In addition, no one wants to pay a considerable amount of money for hotel accommodation and subsequently regret it, realizing that the quality of accommodation and service does not at all correspond to the price.  Correctly deciding on the choice of a hotel helps in many ways to study the reviews of other tourists who have already happened to stay in a particular place.  So, they try to tell not only about the pros, but also about the minuses of the hotel.  Sometimes this opinion is subjective, but there is practically no other option to find out possible shortcomings of people planning a vacation, because, for example, official information about hotels contains, as a rule, only mention of advantages.  So that you do not have to spend a lot of time and effort searching for reviews, we bring to your attention the generalized comments of our compatriots about their stay at the Cesars Temple De Luxe Hotel.  Reviews of guests, we note immediately, the vast majority are positive.  Of course, according to them, even in such a luxurious hotel as Cesars Temple, there are certain disadvantages, but they are insignificant.  So, in general, travelers believe that this hotel complex is fully consistent with its value and category.  But we offer to learn more about everything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  According to our compatriots, the Cesars Temple <span>De Luxe Hotel 5 * hotel,</span> reviews of which we are considering, was planned and built very high quality and thoughtfully.  Therefore, rooms of all categories here are cozy, comfortable.  Even standard apartments with a small area are equipped with comfortable large beds and modern appliances.  Almost none of the guests complained about breakdowns.  But even if there was some kind of malfunction, it was enough to contact the reception, and the problem was solved as soon as possible.  As a plus, tourists note a beautiful view from the windows of all apartments.  Of course, not every room can see the sea, but you could admire the garden, pool.  However, some travelers would like, they said, to also see disposable slippers and a kettle with coffee or tea making facilities in the rooms.  In addition, not all guests were satisfied with the quality of the free personal care products offered by the hotel - shampoo and shower gel.  Therefore, according to them, it is advisable to capture them from home or purchase them already on the spot.  Otherwise, no complaints about the apartments were noted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel cesars temple de luxe hotel" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1045996.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Check in </h2><p>  As the reviews left by our compatriots about the Cesars Temple De Luxe Hotel (Belek) indicate that the check-in of newly arrived guests in the rooms is carried out, as a rule, almost immediately after arrival.  So, even if you arrive at the hotel early in the morning, you will be invited for breakfast, and right after that they will hand you the keys to the apartments and help you with your luggage.  If, nevertheless, it turns out that the hotel is completely full and there are no free rooms in it, then you can leave your things in the luggage room and begin to relax, going to a restaurant, bar, pool or immediately to the beach.  After the previous guests have moved out, and your apartment is prepared for check-in, you can get the keys.  By the way, in their comments, some travelers point out the fact that if you want to get a room of the best category, then it will be cheaper to pay, if you pay for a change of apartments directly at the hotel, rather than when booking a stay. </p><h2>  Cleaning </h2><p>  In general, according to most tourists, the maids of the Cesars Temple De Luxe <span>Hotel (Belek) 5 *</span> completely cope with their duties.  So, according to them, room cleaning is carried out every day.  True, sometimes the maids forgot or did not have time to change the bedding or put clean towels, as well as personal hygiene products.  But this problem was easily solved by a call to the receptionist.  In addition, you can tell the maid about your wishes in person if you meet her on the floor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cesars temple de luxe hotel turkey" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1045997.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Territory, location </h2><p>  Perhaps it is difficult to find a person staying at the Cesars Temple De Luxe, who would be dissatisfied with the hotel grounds.  So, according to our compatriots, there are many beautiful places for walking and holding photo shoots.  The huge territory of the hotel complex is very green, well-groomed, clean.

So, Cesars Temple is surrounded by other hotels, which you can admire while walking along the promenade along the coast.  However, this did not become a problem for any of the tourists, because there are a lot of entertainments in the hotel complex.  Therefore, there is no need to get bored.  If you still want to go shopping, eat in a restaurant outside the hotel, visit bars or nightclubs, or just take a walk around the city, then you can go to Belek.  You can get here by taxi.  Since the hotel is located not far from the city, the trip will be inexpensive.

    <h2>  Restaurants, bars </h2><p>  Meals in the hotel in question are organized according to the "ultra ol inclusive" system.  This means that guests can eat at the hotel almost round the clock and drink free drinks both local and foreign.  Three meals a day, tourists can eat in the main restaurant "Cesars Temple", working in a buffet format.  Here you can find a variety of dishes of both national and international cuisine.  Guests have the opportunity to taste meat, poultry, fish, seafood, soups, salads, snacks, pastries, desserts, fresh fruits.  However, as some of our compatriots note in their reviews, it is advisable not to come for breakfast, lunch or dinner later than half an hour before the end of the meal.  Since in this case, you may not have enough of the most delicious dishes.  At the same time, guests are not advised to rush to the restaurant and at the beginning of the meal.  Indeed, in this case, you run the risk of waiting in line with food trays.  As for the places in the restaurant, here, according to travelers, there are always free tables.  Waiters also work very smoothly and quickly, in a matter of minutes removing dirty dishes and changing tablecloths. </p><p>  If you get hungry during the day, you can always have a bite to eat pizza, french fries, hamburger and other fast food in one of the snack bars Cesars Temple De Luxe Hotel 5 * (Belek, Turkey).

According to them, it is very large, sandy and clean.  There is always a sufficient number of sun loungers and parasols.  However, as travelers note in their reviews, some of the guests went ashore early in the morning to take sun loungers closer to the water.  If this is not critical for you, then remember that you can find free sunbeds on the beach at any time of the day.  Of course, they will not be located at the very edge of the water, but it is unlikely that the need to go an extra dozen meters to the sea is a serious problem for most vacationers. </p><p>  There is a bar on the beach where you can always get a drink.  Tourists also liked that cleanliness workers are constantly present here.  They constantly try to clean the litter left by guests.  In addition, lifeguards are always on duty at the beach. </p><p>  As for entering the sea, it is gentle, sandy and is great for both adults and children.  However, some travelers in their comments mention one feature.  So, not far from the hotel flows a river that flows into the sea.  Therefore, sometimes the flow brings cold water.  According to vacationers, in the summer heat it‚Äôs even nice to be in cool water for a few seconds.  Moreover, it is very quickly replaced by warm.  As for the cleanliness of the sea, there is practically no garbage here, as tourists say.  Sometimes, of course, especially with a strong wind, seaweed nails to the shore, but beach workers quickly remove garbage. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cesars temple de luxe hotel belek 5" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1045999.jpg" width="600"></div>
