Scientists have argued for many years about the origin of natural phenomena, which conceal many mysteries, who have not come to a common point of view. </p><p>  Amazing corners make people think a lot, and the Stone Forest in Bulgaria, which grew 50 million years ago near Varna and is an unusual ensemble of pillars of the most incredible forms, is such a miracle.  From time immemorial, a huge massif had the glory of a sacred place, but the first mention of it appeared in the 19th century.  But the natural monument, which is under the protection of the state, it was declared relatively recently. </p><h2>  The first mention of a mysterious place </h2><p>  It is curious that the first journalist who described the Stone Forest in Bulgaria was the Russian war correspondent V. Teplyakov.  From his pen came a fascinating story about cylindrical giants driven into the ground, arousing interest from all scientists of the world, who set out to find out the true origin of the corner that had become popular. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone forest in bulgaria" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1433325.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Popular tourist attraction </h2><p>  Residents call this place, spread on sandy hills, “driven stones.”  Tourists note the justice of the name: it seems as if a giant with ease, like nails, pounded massive columns hollow inside the earth.  Before the eyes of the amazed guests, perhaps the most unusual valley appears.  Stone Forest (Bulgaria) is a special sight that causes strange feelings. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The area of ​​more than 50 square kilometers is completely filled with huge columns consisting of calcareous sandstone, dotted with centuries-old cracks.  Of course, the mind refuses to recognize these formations as the work of one nature. </p><h2>  Scientists trying to shed light on the origin of the valley </h2><p>  There are more than two dozen hypotheses of the origin of frozen sculptures.  The most popular version says that a few million years ago there was a sea on this place, and at its bottom from different rocks stone layers formed, tightly connected to each other.  Over time, the climate changed, the pond dried up, sand outgrowths turned into frozen tall columns resembling stalactites in caves, and rains and wind trimmed figured statues. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone forest bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1433322.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Some scientists are inclined to think that methane rising from the sea is the main reason for the appearance of such a popular attraction as the Stone Forest <span>(Varna, Bulgaria).</span>  Thin streams of gas rushed upward, hitting the organisms that lived in the sea, which for a long time seemed to meld with the sand into a single whole.  It is believed that precisely in the places where the gas was released, empty cavities appeared inside the colossus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  There is another hypothesis that experts support.  It says that stone pillars are ordinary corals, and all the voids inside them were previously filled with plants that rotted over time. </p><h2>  Alien Versions </h2><p>  Not without theories related to alien civilizations.  Some researchers believe that on the territory of the stone valley there was an ancient temple or observatory, and lighthouse pillars with a diameter of two or more meters received important <span>signals from space.</span> </p><p>  Local residents are convinced that the <span>Stone Forest</span> in Bulgaria can not have a natural beginning.  In fairness, it should be noted that while no version is correct, no one has guessed the secret of the valley. </p><h2>  Dividing stone pillars into groups </h2><p>  Natural formations located on the territory are conditionally divided into four groups. </p><p>  The first is <span>stone trees,</span> which are lined up perpendicular to the road in several rows.  The second is of interest due to the fact that powerful pillars are set on top of each other by some incredible force.  The third group includes giants with a height of more than six meters. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone forest bulgaria how to get there" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1433315.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the most interesting stone forest in Bulgaria is the cliffs that form a ring, in the center of which stands a tall pillar.  Ancient legends go about the fourth group, telling that one who goes around all the figures and touches the main one in the circle will catch luck by the tail, and the desired desire will certainly come true. </p><h2>  <span>Powerful</span> quiet area </h2><p>  Near the stone columns, cameras and cameras often fail, the batteries are discharged, but if you move a little away, the technique starts working again.  The fact that a powerful energy zone lies in the valley of stone sculptures is a universally recognized fact.  Tourists openly declare the impact on the body of certain forces that relieve fatigue and give positive emotions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="valley stone forest bulgaria" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1433323.jpg" width="331"></div>

    <h2>  Stones to help fulfill your secret desires </h2><p>  All the stone sculptures described in the special catalog are assigned numbers, and with the light hand of the visitors to the reserve reminiscent of the ancient ruins of the colossus received the names: “Guard”, “Waterfall”, “Elephant”, “Altar”. </p><p>  With each pillar, you need to do a certain ritual or just touch it.  The “Stork” figure growing out of the earth arouses the interest of those couples who dream of a baby.  The symbol of fertility really helps childless families. </p><p>  The Eye of the Needle removes sins: those who need to be cleansed try to overcome the narrow hole.  But the "Stone of Love" with an unusual hole in the shape of a heart attracts tourists who have not found the second half.  It is believed that loneliness will bypass the one who put his hands to the ancient figure.  And if lovers look through the opening, then they will always be inseparable. </p><h2>  Stone Forest (Bulgaria): reviews </h2><p>  As a person approaches mysterious giants, he is lost in real time and begins to feel himself in some other.  The mysterious landscape, inspiring thoughts of touching something unreal, is fascinating.  Tourists admit that they are embraced by a variety of emotions, but the main idea that visits in a sacred place is the awareness of the insignificance of a person in front of the Universe.  Problems that concern people are receding, and a natural phenomenon gives strength to fight and live on. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone forest varna bulgaria" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1433324.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It seems to many that fate itself led them to a mystical corner to understand the priorities in life.  Thousands of tourists come to feel the unusual energy and surge of energy, who claim to have felt in their hearts some magic of this fairy-tale valley.  Few people believe in the natural origin of stone columns located in the geopathic zone. </p><h2>  Stone Forest in Bulgaria: how to get there? </h2><p>  Shuttle buses do not go to a popular tourist attraction located 18 kilometers from Varna, so the country's guests choose a guided tour.  Many travelers get by rented vehicles, pre-devising routes, among which there is always Stone Forest (Bulgaria). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="stone forest in Bulgaria how to get" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1433314.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  How to get to the corner saturated with magical atmosphere?  You can get here if you take a taxi to the ancient Shumen.  Near the village of Slynchevo there is an equipped corner with giant statues, in addition, the territory of the natural monument is so large that you can stop at the villages of Strashimirovo, Aksakovo, Banovo and Devnya to get to the sites with stone figures. </p><p>  The entrance fee to the fenced area of ​​the reserve is 1.5 euros.  True, some tourists prefer to get inside, bypassing the fence, to independently explore the stone ensemble and recharge with positive energy. </p>
