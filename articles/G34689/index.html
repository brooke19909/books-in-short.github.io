Unfortunately, a simple password and screen lock do not always cope with this task, but there is two-factor authentication, it will protect all data.  The Google Authenticator program was created just in order to provide users with maximum protection of information, contacts and accounts, because already now complex passwords are no longer an obstacle for crackers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.protectimus.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Access recovery" class="if uuid-3036826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3036826.jpg"></div><p>  The advantages of the application are that it is able to protect accounts not only of cryptocurrencies, but also of other projects.  Confirmation codes are automatically installed on the application and constantly generated again in the program, which reduces the load on the brain of a modern person. </p><h2>  Access recovery </h2><p>  Unforeseen situations happen every day - someone broke the phone, someone lost and acquired a new one.  There is an opportunity to restore access to Google Authenticator, transfer your data to another phone.  You need to take care of the recovery in advance, it is advisable to print or save the QR code that is issued when the program is connected.  This precaution is recognized as the highest quality among those who have already lost their account.  This is the easiest way to transfer Google Authenticator to another phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.androidcentral.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Two-factor authentication login" class="if uuid-3036841" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3036841.jpg"></div><p>  The key needs to be stored in a safe place, in no case can it be transferred to strangers or unreliable people, because it gives access to a lot.  Troubles with the program begin when this code has not been written.  If this happened, then in order to regain access to Google Authenticator, transfer your data to another phone, you will have to contact the support of each service to which it was linked. </p><h2>  Data transfer </h2><p>  If you really need to, you can transfer all the Google Authenticator data to another phone through root-rights, this is a rather complicated and dreary procedure.  If the old smartphone is at hand, and it is still in working condition, it is recommended that you first turn off two-factor authentication, remove the application from the old phone, and then install it on a new one, then perform the setup and connection procedure. </p><p>  If you use this method, you won‚Äôt even need to transfer Google Authenticator to another phone.  When authentication is disabled, codes in the program of the old device will continue to be generated, but they will not be valid, which is why the program becomes useless and can be deleted.  By the way, it is recommended to do the same if the program often crashes, after removal it can already be much easier to restore everything. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How to set up Google Authenticator, what errors happen </h2><p>  Before transferring Google Authenticator data to another phone, you need to study the setup instructions, if there are any errors in it, the application will issue inactive codes.  If an application starts issuing codes that are not perceived by the service to which it was logged in, then the problems may be in the incorrect perception by the application of the present time, that is, it may be late for a minute or more, then the code will not be accepted. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.trezor.io" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Authentication protection" class="if uuid-3036846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3036846.jpg"></div><p>  To resolve this error, you need to go into the program settings and check the time synchronization.  When it does not work, synchronization is required, if it works, then the problem is in the program, you need to contact support. </p><p>  In such cases, the support service asks suggestive questions like the number of coins on the account or any little thing that a person who constantly uses the account knows how to think. </p><h2>  Most common problems </h2><p>  In many cases, most of the problems are associated with the loss of an account or device, access to the application.  If you want not to fall into such a trap and not think about how you can transfer Google Authenticator to another phone, it‚Äôs better to check the status of the phone more often and finally print a few copies of the QR code, hide these papers in different places so as not to lose and live further calmly.  You can also save the code to a computer or other devices.  From the monitor it is read as easily as from paper. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lifehacker.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Code Protection" class="if uuid-3036861" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47527/3036861.jpg"></div><p>  Do not hesitate and let everything go by itself, you need to use Google Authenticator and you are no longer afraid for the protection of your own data.  Moreover, with minimal forethought, problems with this program should not arise.  The program itself is so promising that various well-known projects are increasingly inclined to its application. </p>
