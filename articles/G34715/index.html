Gagarin city estate</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The branched princely family of the Gagarins goes back to Vsevolod the Big Nest, and then to Rurik - Prince Mikhail Starodubsky-Golibesovsky belonged to his XVII tribe.  Three of the five sons of Mikhail Ivanovich had a common nickname of Gagar.  From here went the three branches of the princes Gagarin, who were related to many Russian surnames - Trubetskoy, Guryev, Golitsyn.  The illustrious General Skobelev and Prince V. A. Menshikov were related to the Gagarins. </p><h2>  Major dignitary </h2><p>  As the saying goes, "according to the owner and the thing" - the Gagarin estate in Moscow is one of the largest urban estates.  The boundaries of the vast territory on which it is located are <span>Strastnoy Boulevard,</span> Petrovka Street and Uspensky Lane.  Naturally, representatives of this kind held the most responsible public posts.  So, Prince Sergey, to whom the Gagarin estate in Moscow owes his appearance, leaving in 1773 the post of president of the College of Economics, took up the management of the <span>estates of</span> Catherine the Great <span>near Moscow</span> .  In gratitude to him, a plot was allocated for the construction of his own city estate, the construction of which is entrusted to Matvey Kazakov, the chief court architect.  He coped with the difficult task brilliantly - combined a large urban palazzo with a vast courtyard. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gagarin's estate in Moscow" class="if" height="360" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/722584.jpg" width="453"></div>

In the center of the capital, greenhouses were destroyed, which after the death of the prince in 1782 lasted another 20 years. </p><h2>  Bagration was honored here. </h2><p>  The Gagarin's estate in Moscow is a landmark of the capital, sung by Leo Tolstoy: at the beginning of the novel "War and Peace", Prince Rostov prepares a celebration of Prince Bagration in the English Club, which was located after 1802 in the famous estate.  The French, who entered the capital, looked after it under their headquarters (this is known from the memoirs of Stendhal), but the building burned down in the fire of Moscow in 1812.  Naturally, after the war, the prestigious metropolitan club was housed in another mansion, and the Gagarin estate in Moscow was abandoned for some time.  Its owners in 1821 restored the left wing of the city estate in order to donate it to the horse performances of the troupe of Finardi, circus performers from Sweden.  This continued until 1826, when the city authorities bought a huge estate from the Gagarin.  The student of Matvey Kazakov Osip Bove led the restoration work.  The main house of the Gagarin estate in Moscow, which stretched along the entire block and ranged from 15 to 29, was completely restored in accordance with the original project.  From himself, Beauvais added only a relief panel above the columns of the facade of the palace, a church inside the courtyard and small outbuildings.  These additions were located in the demolished greenhouses. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="palace manor gagarina description" class="if" height="390" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/722586.jpg" width="510"></div>

The last address was 3rd Meshchanskaya street.  On it, some powers of the house of sorrow remained, but the main part migrated to the Gagarin estate.  The main Bosyak hospital began to be called New Catherine.  Vast facilities allowed the opening of new departments and laboratories at Moscow University. </p><h2>  Salvaged architectural and historical monument </h2><p>  After the revolution, the Gagarin city estate was a medical institution for many years.  In this role, she lasted 176 years.  Hospital No. 24 moved to the new building on Pistsova Street only in 2009.  The full-scale reconstruction of the Gagarin's estate and the quarter adjacent to it, carried out in strict accordance with the old drawings, saved the wonderful mansion from complete destruction and returned to its former beauty and grandeur.  In February 2015, Moscow Mayor <span>Sergei Sobyanin</span> personally inspected the completion of the work.  They plan to connect the courtyard of the estate with a pedestrian zone and the Hermitage Park.  The new life of the historical and <span>architectural monument of the</span> capital begins. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gagarin Tyutchev estate" class="if" height="456" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/722591.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Crimean possessions </h2><p>  Of course, such a well-known, branched, rich family throughout Russia had more than one castle, palace, manor.  Some of them have survived to this day and are architectural gems.  A perfect example is the palace-estate of Gagarina.  Description of this beautiful estate located on Cape Plaka near Alushta, you can start with a little historical background.  It was erected on the site of the palace of A. M. Borozdin.  At the beginning of the 19th century, the Tavrian governor built a palace in which the best people of Russia ‚Äî Sumarokov and Pushkin, Griboedov and Adam Mickiewicz, Zhukovsky and others ‚Äî were frequent guests.  The second husband of Maria Borozdin‚Äôs daughter was Prince A. I. Gagarin. </p><h2>  In memory of her husband </h2><p>  His second wife was the Georgian Princess Anastasia Davidovna Orbeliani.  She, preserving her love for her husband until the end of her days, in memory of him erected a beautiful new palace on the site of the old one, the construction of which ended in 1907, in the year of the princess's death. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The main house of the Gagarin estate in Moscow" class="if" height="443" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/722592.jpg" width="550"></div>  The best building materials for the castle were brought from all over Europe.  Erected in a very short time, it immediately became a landmark of these places.  Performed in a modernized ancient German style, the Gagarina Palace resembles the Massandra Palace of Emperor Alexander III.  Spiers crowned with weathercocks, red tiles brought from Germany, battlements twined with grapes, openwork balconies give the building a unique charm.  The brainchild of architect Krasnov is an adornment of the Crimean coast.  Above the entrance is the coat of arms of the Gagarin family.  Now the estate has been given over to the Utes sanatorium.

    <h2>  From hand to hand </h2><p>  <span>The attraction of Moscow</span> is also the estate of the Gagarin-Tyutchevs, located in the Armenian Lane.  Its first owner at the beginning of the XVII century was the boyar Miloslavsky, a relative of the wife of Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich.  Then, during the XVIII century, it was owned by the Volkonskys, Dmitrievs-Mamontovs, and Glebovs.  And in 1790, Ivan Sergeyevich Gagarin bought it.  Under him, the palace was rebuilt under the direction of architect Matvey Kazakov. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Gagarin city estate" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17465/722593.jpg" width="565"></div>  Expanded by outbuildings and growing on one 3rd floor, the house has not changed its core, the chambers built during the previous centuries.  Originally decorated with two risalits (ledges) along the facade, it has survived to this day in this form.  Especially exquisite mansion makes his balcony on the columns.  In 1810, the parents of the future poet Fyodor Ivanovich Tyutchev bought the mansion from the Gagarin.  The childhood of the author of the lines ‚ÄúYou Can't Understand Russia with Mind ...‚Äù passed in the walls of this house.  The surname Tyutchev for the history of our country means no less than the surname of the pillar noblemen of the Gagarin.  The mansion that united them together is called the Gagarin-Tyutchev estate.  The poet‚Äôs family did not become the last owner of the palace, and later he passed from hand to hand, both before the revolution and after.  Now in the building, which is located in the Armenian Lane, the Russian Children's Fund is located.
