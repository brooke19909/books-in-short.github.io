It has everything you need to relax - nice and spacious rooms, greenery of the garden, restaurant, the ability to rent a transport, which is indispensable in this resort area.  The closest city to Panaji (the capital of Goa) is thirty kilometers away.  We can say that the hotel is almost in the outback.  But if you are looking for privacy and want to look at the real, and not created for tourists, India - here you are.  The hotel opened in two thousand and ten.  The repair was made three years ago. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The long bay hotel" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1503370.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of the resort Morjim (India, Goa) </h2><p>  This is the most "Russian" resort in the country.  Here, Muscovites or residents of Novosibirsk will hear their native language at every step.  Many Russians live here for years.  Maybe that's why the prices here are slightly higher than in other areas of North Goa.  This village, which is already called Rublevka, is so popular among Russians that almost all local residents can communicate with tourists without any problems.  But Morjim (India, Goa) is famous not only for this.  From here, probably the most spectacular view of the Arabian Sea opens.  The area is surrounded by green tropical forests.  Here you can truly relax from all everyday worries and at least for a little bit move to paradise.  It is better to go here from late autumn to early spring.  At this time, the temperature at the resort is quite comfortable, no higher than thirty degrees of heat. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Long Bay Hotel 2" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1503368.jpg" width="339"></div>

Drive from there for about one and a half to two hours, mainly along the serpentine, and then along the bridge that connects the resort with the "mainland".  Previously, you could only get here by ferry.  The most convenient option for independent travelers is to use the buses that run between the cities of Panaji and Mopusa.  The Long Bay Hotel is located almost by the carriageway, so it‚Äôs convenient to get to it - buses stop almost nearby.  But the hotel is quite far from Morjim beach - you need to go about a kilometer to get there.  Nearby is a small fruit shop and several restaurants with not very high prices.  But if you want to not only sit in your room and go to the beach, you will have to rent a motorbike.  So you will be your own masters.  Taxis are quite expensive here, and the bike costs about two hundred rupees per day.  Near the hotel is the river Chapora. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel The Long Bay Hotel" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1503372.jpg" width="600"></div>
