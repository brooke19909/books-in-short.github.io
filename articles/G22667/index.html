A review of its characteristics showed that, unfortunately, the manufacturer does not think much about introducing new products, so several copies of the M line already practically do not differ from each other.  What are the developers guided by when making such a decision?  No one can reliably answer this question.  Strange, but a fingerprint scanner, a variety of colors, fast charging - all this is already implemented in the M5 model.  There is no highlight in the new product, which should have attracted the attention of buyers.  But the range of digital gadgets is currently quite diverse.  Meizu's direct competitor, Xiaomi, constantly pleases its fans with various innovations.  And if earlier these two brands went almost at the same level, now Meizu has begun to give way to its positions. </p><p>  So, let's look at all the features of the M6 ‚Äã‚Äãmodel, and also see why users find this gadget a disappointment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Review Meizu M6" class="if uuid-2243805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243805.jpg"></div><h2>  Packaging and kit </h2><p>  The style of the packaging box has not changed at all in comparison with its predecessor.  Apparently, the company's designers decided that some mystery is hidden in minimalism and conciseness.  Although, maybe, on the contrary, the manufacturer considered that his products do not need advertising, so there is only one bright element on the box - the name of the phone.  It stands out very well against a white neutral background.  The company logo - Meizu - is printed on the side faces.  At this design delights ended. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now we‚Äôll figure out what the Meise M6 is equipped with.  Instructions, warranty card and other documents are mandatory to be attached to the phone.  Also in the box is a 5V / 1.5A charger with a USB connector, a cable to it and a key with which the user can open the tray in order to insert SIM cards. </p><h2>  User opinion on the appearance of the smartphone </h2><p>  It so happened that Chinese manufacturers rarely offer original solutions.  Most often, new items are a copy of some <span>popular smartphone.</span>  For this reason, the reviews do not sound the most flattering, however, there are no frankly negative ones either.  To call the design ‚ÄúMeizu M6‚Äù, a review of which will be made in this article, unique, truly new, of course, is impossible.  The phone is made in the typical style found in most of these gadgets.  Those who are not the first time to buy a smartphone of this company, drew attention to the fact that the manufacturer practically does not make changes to the design.  To be honest, you still have to say one difference - the shape of the glossy strip on the rear panel.  In this model, she received a slight bend.  But users do not consider such changes significant.  By the way, why these furrows are needed is not clear.  After all, the body of the device is completely made of polycarbonate. </p><p>  But even despite this, reviews of the Meizu M6 often say that as a budget employee the smartphone looks pretty good overall.  This opinion is shared by those buyers who would like to purchase Samsung or Apple products, but do not have the means to do so. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetmatch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description Meizu M6" class="if uuid-2243806" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243806.jpg"></div><p>  Users gave high marks to the build quality.  And indeed, the case does not creak, does not bend.  Users noticed that the device is presented in different colors.  There are classic options in the line - silver and black.  For lovers of luxury, a golden copy will do.  But young people will be able to purchase a smartphone in blue.  Note that all options look attractive.  During use, discomfort does not occur.  The gadget lies perfectly in the hand, does not slip. </p><p>  There is no point in dwelling on the controls in detail, since they have not changed their location in comparison with the predecessor.  The fingerprint reader is integrated into the mTouch key, which is located on the control panel (on the front side). </p><h2>  Meizu M6: screen reviews </h2><p>  Many users in their comments indicated that they chose this model because of the 5.2-inch display.  If you do not delve deeply into its characteristics, then it may seem that the novelty received the display from the predecessor without changes.  All the same HD quality with a few pixels (282 ppi).  However, not so deplorable as it might seem at first glance.  If you put two phones nearby - M6 and M5, then the difference is still noticeable, albeit small, but users are seeing shifts for the better.  The reviews say that the color of the image has become brighter and more saturated, the viewing angles have noticeably expanded, and the level of contrast has become more comfortable.  Those who want to adjust, for example, temperature, need to go to the settings of the Meizu M6.  Here you can change other parameters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Owners attributed the presence of a state employee to the presence of 2.5D glass.  It is <span>oleophobic coated</span> and scratch resistant.  Due to the absence of an air gap, the image remains readable even in the sun. </p><p>  So to summarize.  In user reviews, you will not find comments on the display.  Most believe that the characteristics of the screen are fully consistent with the price of the device.  The optimal diagonal size, decent resolution, does not consume much energy - what else can a user want when buying a smartphone for 120-130 dollars? </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meizu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Features Meizu M6" class="if uuid-2243807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243807.jpg"></div><h2>  Meizu M6: performance features </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the most disappointing users felt when they learned the characteristics of the hardware platform.  Given that in just one year the manufacturer released five M-series devices, many thought that the last instance would still receive a powerful Snapdragon processor, but the hopes did not materialize.  <span>The Meizu</span> M6 <span>smartphone</span> runs on the Chinese <span>MediaTek MT6750</span> chipset <span>.</span>  In total, eight cores are laid in it.  A 64-bit system of the 4 * 4 type functions.  The first half of the computing modules accelerates to 1500 MHz, and the second reaches a frequency of 1000 MHz.  This processor model is popular with manufacturers from the Middle Kingdom, so it can be found not only in state employees, but also even in the middle segment.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to say that he copes with the tasks set perfectly.  The speed of work is average.  Many applications and games will run on the phone.  But there is one significant drawback of such a hardware platform - 28 Nm process technology.  It is already outdated, so you can‚Äôt count on profitability. </p><p>  Users were pleased that the manufacturer offers two modifications.  The first is composed of 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory.  In fact, in the "younger" version, about 11 GB will be available for storing files, but this may not be enough for a modern user.  The characteristics of the "older" version are much more preferable.  It sold 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of ROM.  It‚Äôs good that the manufacturer has provided a way to expand the memory (although, according to many, it‚Äôs not very convenient).  If necessary, instead of the second SIM card, you can install a 128 GB flash drive. </p><p>  Even if for some advanced users such a ‚Äúfilling‚Äù seems unattractive, in defense of this model we say that in the price segment up to $ 130 it is impossible to find a more powerful gadget. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.gadgetmatch.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Meizu M6 Reviews" class="if uuid-2243808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243808.jpg"></div><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  Most of the positive feedback ‚ÄúMeizu M6‚Äù receives thanks to the latest version of the OS.  The seventh Android is installed on board this device.  Of course, there is a proprietary shell - Flyme 6. Users consider the interface as functional, beautiful and convenient as possible.  There are no comments on the operation of the system.  All manipulations are quick.  An indisputable advantage for the domestic buyer was the fact that the menu is completely in Russian (literate translation). </p><p>  In fairness, we note that the Meizu M6 firmware has pleased advanced users.  It can only be compared with MIUI (shell from Xiaomi).  For those who like to constantly update their gadgets, let's say that new firmware comes out regularly, and everyone can install them on their device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.aliexpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Main camera Meizu M6" class="if uuid-2243809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243809.jpg"></div><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  We will not dwell on the characteristics of cameras for a long time.  There are also no significant changes.  The main camera of the Meizu M6 is equipped with a Sony IMX278 sensor, which has a resolution of 13 megapixels.  Unfortunately, the aperture value (f / 2.2) did not please those who often photograph indoors - it is impossible to achieve a frame with high detail. </p><p>  The front camera also did not receive any particular complaints.  It is based on an 8-megapixel matrix.  Selfies are of decent quality. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.meizu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manual for Meizu M6" class="if uuid-2243811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243811.jpg"></div><h2>  Battery Life </h2><p>  Now let's look at the Meizu M6‚Äôs autonomy indicators.  Battery performance did not impress users.  The phone has a 3070 mAh battery.  Her resource will be enough for about a day of use in a combined mode.  If we consider separately, we obtain the following results: </p><ul><li>  video - about 7 hours; </li><li>  games - approximately 3.5 hours; </li><li>  music - up to 50 hours </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.meizu.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battery Meizu M6" class="if uuid-2243812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2243812.jpg"></div><h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  As you can see from the review, Meizu M6 is another unattractive smartphone.  Of course, it has both advantages and disadvantages, but its most significant drawback is that it practically does not differ from its predecessor.  In the reviews of the Meizu M6, you can read that only a few characteristics became a little better.  For example, the image displayed on the screen has changed quite a bit.  Also, users noticed that the developers ‚Äúconjured‚Äù over the front camera.  But no more than that. </p><p>  In general, this model may well attract a buyer, but the lack of zest in it makes this smartphone faceless, not allowing it to stand out from the rest. </p>
