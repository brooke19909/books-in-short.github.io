  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why does the skin blacken from gold, or the Golden ring and black finger</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Indeed, you just won‚Äôt believe what, when a black rim appears on the finger of the hand where a golden ring flaunted during the day.  One of the most common causes is the small amount of gold in the product and the many alloys added to it.  Another reason is often called problems caused by the state of the <span>body, in other</span> words, a disease.  Why does the skin turn black from gold?  Maybe jinxed its owner? </p><p>  <strong>Love, ring, organism</strong> </p><p>  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough not to use the cream that you‚Äôre used to to get rid of this phenomenon - a black band from the ring.  Some creams contain small amounts of mercury.  Interacting with gold, it <span>leaves marks</span> on the skin.  Or cream in a bucket, or gold is not worn, a third is not given. </p><p>  There is a widespread opinion why the skin turns black from gold - because there are problems with the liver or the state of the endocrine system.  In the human body there are electric charges, each person is individual.  In contact with the skin, gold forms a galvanic pair, a kind of micro-battery.  In different parts of the hand she "works" in different ways.  It happens that the skin turns black on one finger, but not on others. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  <strong>Causal relationship</strong> </p><p>  Sometimes the question of why the skin turns black from gold, for verification is very simple: when processing gold <span>polishing paste is used.</span>  If the product is poorly washed, then the paste may leave dark stripes on the skin from the ring or chain for some time.  After some time, the paste will be washed off and the ring will no longer leave dark marks on the finger. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes the main reason is that a person has an <span>allergic reaction to</span> nickel, used in precious metal alloys.  The phenomenon of electrolysis (a chemical reaction caused by the reaction of the skin to metals) enhances the makeup or cream used for hands.  If the alloy contains copper, then the skin can not only turn black, but also turn green. <br><strong></strong></p><p>  <strong>Another reason why the skin turns black from gold</strong> </p><p>  The cheapness of products that are issued for gold may be the answer to the question why the skin darkens from gold.  Sometimes the data indicated in the certificate does not correspond to the content that is actually in the gold jewelry.  You do not need to buy jewelry where there is no firm belief that the gold jewelry really matches the specified certificate. </p><p>  In addition, there is a theory that human sweat changes its composition in the event that any disease occurs and changes its structure.  Perhaps in theory there is a rational kernel and it makes sense to check health.  The practice of wearing rings suggests that the same ring is able to leave or not leave black circles on the skin at different periods of a person‚Äôs life.  Probably, poor-quality cosmetics, creams containing mercury are to blame for this, but once again checking your health will not hurt anyone. </p><p>  Precious metals affect a person in different ways, everyone knows that there is no sale of pure gold from products, since the metal is very soft and expensive.  The gold content in jewelry corresponds to such an indicator as a test.  The higher its value, the more gold is contained in the product.  It may well be that the prejudice that the skin darkens with gold is not justified, since it darkens with the alloys it contains. </p><p>  It is believed that people who eat large amounts of meat can also become the object of "dislike" of gold to the skin, expressed in the fact that you have to ask yourself and your friends why the skin turns black from gold.  It is believed that many <span>nitrogen compounds are</span> released along with sweat <span>,</span> and this contributes to <span>darkening of the skin</span> from contact with nickel or copper added to the alloy.  Although there is no scientifically proven data in this regard. </p>
