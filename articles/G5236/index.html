Today it has already become the norm.  We are all used to living on loan.  However, giving money, you need to immediately think about how to collect the debt.  Because among honest comrades there are sometimes individuals who borrow money and are not going to return it.  Of course, the situation is delicate.  It seems that if you don‚Äôt take it, you lose a friend, and if you take it ... you can lose not only your comrade, but also <span>your own money.</span> </p><p>  How <span>to borrow money</span> so that you don‚Äôt have to regret your kindness and compassion?  Firstly, you should clearly understand that when giving money from the recipient, you need to take a receipt and draw up a loan agreement and you should not be afraid that you will offend the feelings of the one who came to you for help.  Secondly, any person should understand that no matter how they trust him, but to be safe, just in case, the owner of the money has the right not to puzzle over the question of how to collect the debt. </p><p>  In addition to the receipt, a pledge may be another option for guaranteeing repayment of a debt.  This is a normal civilized relationship.  Before you open a wallet with a wide <span>gesture of your hand</span> , ask for what amount he needed, when he plans to return it to you, where he works and how much he will teach.  This is necessary to understand whether your friend really needs money.  In any case, if you lend money, you must be prepared for the fact that you will not see this money anymore, or you will have to work hard to get it back.  Therefore, count on the real amount, which in which case it will not be a pity to lose. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  How to collect a debt if you borrowed money, and the lender does not want to return it to you?  If you have insurance, it will not be a big problem to repay the due amount of the debt through the court, if you have a receipt or loan agreement.  In the case of a pledge, you can sell a thing received from a creditor.  The main thing when taking a deposit is to calculate that it is two times more expensive than the amount you gave, because you will probably have to sell the same phone or laptop for half the price. </p><p>  It is important to consider that, by law, a loan agreement is drawn up for an amount at least 10 times the minimum wage.  Moreover, such a contract can not be certified by a notary.  The main thing is to indicate the <span>terms of the contract, the</span> period for repayment of the debt, and make sure that the creditor signs it.  A receipt must be attached to the contract, indicating that the money was really transferred from one person to another. </p><p>  How to collect a debt through the court?  Yes, very simple.  It is necessary to write a statement with a detailed description of the circumstances and conditions of the loan, provide documentary evidence of the loan.  The application must be made in duplicate, but before you take it to court, you must <span>pay the state fee.</span>  After the court made a positive decision in the case, the bailiffs receive a writ of execution and they themselves come to the debtor either for the necessary amount of money or for property.  Watching what he has.  The main thing is not to delay the appeal to the court, since, according to the law, you can only claim money from the debtor for three years. </p><p>  How to make repay a debt if you want to go to court only as a last resort?  In this case, you can seek help from professionals - collectors or private detectives.  It is they who will be able by legal methods to convince the debtor that the return of money is simply necessary.  In this case, it is even possible to return the debt without a receipt.  Of course, you will have to pay for the services of professionals, however, only they can return the money without crossing the line of the law, choosing an individual approach to an unscrupulous debtor. </p>
