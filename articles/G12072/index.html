Ideal conditions for living are created here - beautiful rooms, attentive and friendly staff, excellent cuisine in restaurants and cafes. </p><p>  But the reviews about the Sport Hotel are not so positive.  There are many complaints about room service - cleaning once a week, a rare change of bedding.  According to guests, in this hotel you can stay for one or two nights, no longer.  We hope that the hotel administration will hear the opinion of its guests and eliminate the existing shortcomings. </p>
