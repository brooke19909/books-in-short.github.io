The lack of heat and other weather conditions in October are favorable for diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, high blood pressure and autumn depression. </p><h2>  Weather benefits </h2><p>  The Crimean peninsula is located in the temperate climate zone, so the onset of autumn is felt here.  But even in October, in most regions, and especially on the South Bank, it is still warm.  September is considered the last summer resort month, but holidays in Crimea in October are also popular.  The weather at this time is striking in its diversity, and even weather forecasters hardly predict its whims.  The temperature in the first half of the month often rises to 30 degrees, but the next day it can rain and the wind rise.  Why do many tourists still like a vacation in Crimea in October?  At this time, there is no longer such sweltering heat, the sun is soft, and the sea is still warm.  <span>The average temperature</span> on the peninsula this month is 18-20 degrees.  And at the beginning of the month it‚Äôs still quite warm.  In the afternoon, the air warms up to 25-28 degrees, however, the nights become already cold. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Crimea in October where to go" class="if" height="232" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10994/1030843.jpg" width="309"></div>  The sea in Crimea in October only cools by the end of the month, and in the first weeks it is quite possible to swim.
