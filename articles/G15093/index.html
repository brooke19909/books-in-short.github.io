But what can be said about Tele2?  Employee reviews about this employer cannot be called unambiguous.  Rather, they are somewhere good, but somewhere not so good.  So you have to figure out what Tele2 is.  And thoroughly enough.  After all, after employment, I don‚Äôt really want to know that they will deceive you or force you to perform not their duties, right?  Therefore, let us begin as soon as possible to study the task before us today.  It is not so difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103823.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Activities </h2><p>  About <span>"Tele2"</span> employee <span>reviews</span> are different.  For example, judging by the activities of the company, everything is very good here.  This employer is another mobile operator.  And often in such organizations, the recruitment and placement process has been established.  So there are no complaints. </p><p>  It is from "Tele2" you can buy a SIM card, mobile, some gadgets, as well as connect your mobile and home Internet.  Useful organization, what can I say!  The main thing is that consumers are satisfied.  The way it is.  But the opinion of workers for the reputation of the corporation is also not the last thing.  Let's try to figure out what's what. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Whom to work </h2><p>  For example, pay attention to the posted vacancies for employment.  They play far from the last role.  Work in "Tele2" employee reviews in this sense earn neutral.  This is not to say that all potential employees are delighted - everyone wants to be a leader.  But Tele2 cannot promise this.  After all, only ordinary jobs are posted. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="work in body2 employee reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103822.jpg"></div>

    <p>  What can you do here?  For example, a promoter or sales manager for SIM cards.  Sales consultants, office workers, as well as call center operators are also constantly needed.  In principle, nothing surprising.  All vacancies correspond to the activities of the company.  And therefore, we can say that there is nothing to fear so far. </p><h2>  Age for work </h2><p>  In terms of employment, work at Tele2 (Voronezh) gets pretty good reviews from employees.  And not only in this city, but throughout Russia.  In particular, due to the fact that almost any person can get into the company.  The age of the applicant varies and depends on the position held. </p><p>  For example, a promoter, according to applicants, may be a 10-year-old student.  But the sales manager (in the office or the store) is a teenager from 16 years old.  If you want to distribute SIM cards, you must be 14 years old.  Here is such an affordable place to earn money.  This, of course, pleases.  So <span>"Tele2" reviews from</span> employees <span>(Voronezh, Moscow</span> and so on) earn in a sense very good.  But do not rejoice and immediately run to work in the company.  Perhaps there are more important points worth paying attention to? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Job interview </h2><p>  Of course there is.  Say going through an interview.  This process is sometimes able to push a potential applicant from a particular company.  And here the work at Tele2 receives very good <span>reviews from employees (Moscow,</span> St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia).  In particular, for the fact that the whole process does not take much time. </p><p>  According to the applicants, you will either be invited to the company‚Äôs office, or they will allow you to discuss employment directly in the corporation‚Äôs store.  In a friendly atmosphere, you talk with the manager, fill out the application form, write a resume (you can bring your own with you), answer the questions that you are asked (usually asked to describe your character and your characteristics), and then listen about the selected vacancy.  The whole dialogue takes place in a friendly atmosphere, without undue pressure or injustice.  Very happy.  Few can boast of such friendliness towards applicants! </p><h2>  Schedule </h2><p>  Regarding the work schedule, our employer is not so simple.  Here, rather, negative opinions are more common.  And they are often justified.  The whole problem is that "Tele2" employees reviews (sellers in points and stores) are not earning the best because of some violations of the contract regarding the work schedule.  What is it about? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  For example, you initially agree on the length of the working day and the frequency of your exits to work.  Typically, popular options are 2/2, 5/2 or <span>part-time.</span>  With all this, you will have a fixed weekend.  This alignment is more than satisfied.  <span>The</span> average <span>working day</span> is 8 hours each. </p><p>  But in practice the situation is a little different.  You will be called very often for replacements (especially if you are a new employee), and also left to work overtime.  According to the applicants, quite often it turns out that the working day instead of the prescribed 8 hours lasts 12-13.  No weekends and holidays.  Some workers generally say that they are forced to work like <span>draft horses.</span>  Almost without sleep and rest.  And such a phenomenon few people are satisfied.  Especially if you are just starting a career. </p><h2>  Career </h2><p>  "Tele2" employee reviews regarding the career is also mixed.  Some claim that you want to work in a normal position, do not contact this mobile operator at all.  Others, on the contrary, assert that it is here that you need to go to build a career.  Very easy to get confused! </p>

    <p>  Practice shows that you do not have to wait for any rapid career growth, as you are promised at the interview.  Unless you can rise from the manager to the senior manager.  There is no difference in salary, but a lot of responsibility will be imposed on you.  Not the best case scenario, is it?  Thus, it turns out that if you plan to find a job with the goal of career growth, you do not need to contact Tele2.  And in principle, in the salons of mobile operators in general.  Everywhere the same scheme is used. </p><h2>  Earning </h2><p>  If we talk about earnings, then everything is very bad.  In any case, this is what the reviews of Tele2 say about employees.  They are not satisfied neither with the size of wages, nor with payments, nor with the working conditions.  Why is this so?  After all, there is an explanation for everything! </p><p>  And Tele2 is no exception.  To begin with, it is worth noting that at the interview you will be deceived.  They promise a high salary, as well as a good salary (at least 20,000 rubles).  Plus, the payouts will be ‚Äúwhite‚Äù.  It feels good.  But only in practice, you can see that all this is the most common lies. </p>

    <p>  The salary agreement will indicate to you no more than 10 thousand rubles.  Significantly less than what you were originally offered.  Plus, it turns out that earnings will be "gray."  And no premiums and bonuses can be expected.  The main income will be generated for you based on your transactions.  Sold your phone or SIM card - you get about 2-3% of the sale.  Not?  You can‚Äôt expect any ‚Äúadditions‚Äù to wages. </p><p>  On the one hand, everything is quite honest.  But on the other hand, the applicant is simply misled and lured by high earnings for employment.  And nobody will like this kind of attitude.  It is worth noting the fact that at the end of the month you can generally be left with nothing.  They used to hold salaries in Tele2.  And pay late and incomplete.  All this, of course, cannot please.  Employee reviews about the company "Tele2" (Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities) relative.  Not very good, but not terrible. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  It is also worth considering that the company has its own characteristics of labor.  And for them, Tele2 receives far from the best reviews from employees.  But not as terrible as they could be. </p><p>  For example, there is a system of fines.  It is superimposed literally for everything.  They love fines at Tele2.  And this causes great bewilderment and discontent on the part of the applicants. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tele2 sales staff reviews at points" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1103816.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, there is such a feature as internships and free training.  All this is about 1 month.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs normal.  A person can learn everything that is required, and then get to work.  But on the other hand, there is a staff turnover at Tele2.  Training and practice are not paid.  You can just work a month for free, and then leave.  And stay without a salary.  Or you‚Äôll even be fired on the very first day of work so as not to pay anything.  Consider these nuances before employment. </p>
