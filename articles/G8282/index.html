For example, Asklepion is an ancient temple built on three levels.  You should also look at the fortress of St. John and admire the nearby plane tree of Hippocrates, which, according to legends, was planted by the healer himself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Bars and Restaurants </h2><p>  At the very beginning, Mitsis Family Village serves its guests an all-inclusive system.

    <h2>  What else is worth knowing </h2><p>  The hotel is popular among those people who want to come on holiday with children.  They come here mainly in the summer - at the height of the season.  Therefore, people who want a quiet and relaxing holiday in this hotel, it is better to go in October or in April.  The climate here is excellent, in the middle of spring and autumn it is also warm, but the water is cooler.  However, this is on the one hand even good - there are not so many vacationers, as in summer, more space.  At night, the beaches are generally empty.  And very romantic. </p><p>  By the way, it is definitely worth doing diving here (fortunately, the hotel provides such an opportunity).  Or at least buy glasses and swim underwater.  There are a lot of different animals in the sea.  You can even feed the fish by hand, as experienced tourists claim. </p><p>  The bus to Kardamena must be booked in advance.  He is free.  A ticket for a scheduled flight departing regularly from the stop costs 1.6 euros.  You can take a taxi - for 9 y.  e. And having arrived in Kardamena, you should definitely visit a restaurant called Paradis.  People claim that there are very tasty seafood dishes and fish, and all at modest prices.  The restaurant is also owned by a friendly and pleasant owner who provides attention to all guests, without exception. </p><p>  In general, having arrived on the island of Kos, in Mitsis Family Village, no one will be bored.  Both in the hotel and nearby there is a huge amount of entertainment - for every taste, color and age. </p>
