Nevertheless, if the phone loses more than 20% of the charge overnight, this causes bewilderment and the question of why the battery on the iPhone 6 quickly runs out. The solutions and causes of such problems will be discussed in the article below. </p><h2>  Cause for concern </h2><p>  For each device, the reason can be individual, depending on the device itself and the functions that its owner most often uses.  Nevertheless, there are five of the most common reasons, because of which the battery on the iPhone 6 quickly dies. </p><p>  Possible reasons: </p><ol><li>  Functioning geolocation.  Usually this option is activated by default, and most background programs are constantly connected to the GPS receiver.  For this reason, he has to restart very often, which leads to a charge consumption. </li><li>  The backlight can also <span>drain the battery</span> quickly <span>.</span>  This happens as a result of setting the brightness to maximum.  Firstly, it is energy-consuming, and secondly, it does not have the best effect on vision. </li><li>  The Internet.  It is important to monitor the network to which the smartphone connects and, if possible, choose Wi-Fi instead of 3G. </li><li>  Synchronization.  The iPhone has an automatic mail update feature, which is installed by default.  Regular network connections quickly drain the device, and notifications sometimes distract. </li><li>  Automatic updates.  The activated mode of automatic updates each time loads the programs installed in the device, and does this even when the battery in the device is already exhausted.  However, this can be done manually and as needed. </li></ol><p>  Let's consider such inconveniences in more detail. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Location Services Control </h2><p>  One of the main reasons why the battery runs out quickly on the iPhone 6 S is the activated geolocation feature.  If you can‚Äôt completely disable it, it can be done for individual applications.  To do this, go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab and select the ‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù section, and then ‚ÄúGeolocation Services‚Äù.  In the list of programs that use GPS, the access to geolocation for applications that are rarely used is disabled.  Only those who really need a location are left. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interesno.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quickly sits down battery on iphone 6" class="if uuid-3166796" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166796.jpg"></div><h2>  Background programs </h2><p>  In recent generations of the iOS operating system, most applications run in the background.  For example, in some social networks, the news feed is constantly updated, mail notifies you of incoming letters, and so on.  As a result, the <span>iPhone</span> battery <span>runs out quickly.</span> </p><p>  In order to prevent constant updates, you need to remove minor programs.  For this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the Settings tab. </li><li>  Choose "Basic." </li><li>  They find the line ‚ÄúUpdating content‚Äù and stop all unused ones, since it‚Äôs quite difficult to immediately understand which utility is functioning incorrectly and why it consumes battery power. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="sonyps4.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the battery runs down quickly on the iphone 6 possible reasons" class="if uuid-3166829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166829.jpg"></div><h2>  Animation and screen brightness </h2><p>  If the battery runs out quickly on the iPhone 6, the cause may be an animated splash screen.  A special program or a separate team is also responsible for it.  Very often, the animation not only consumes, but also slows down the process of charging the phone.  If it is installed on an ongoing basis, then over time it will consume a lot of battery power.  Since this is not a fundamental function, but only a beautiful screensaver, it can be turned off in the same way as it was turned on. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Screen brightness is another feature that, if improperly installed, will quickly drain the smartphone.  Often the automatic brightness setting makes it possible to adjust it to the lighting.  In most cases, it works correctly and does not require additional settings.  If you need significant battery savings, the color saturation of the screen can be reduced manually to a minimum. </p><p>  You can reduce the brightness in iPhone 6 as follows: </p><ol><li>  Go to the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab. </li><li>  Select the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù section and the ‚ÄúScreen and brightness‚Äù line.  Already in it, select "Universal Access" and "Display Adaptation". </li><li>  Then, the brightness of the device comfortable for the eyes is set. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="guide-apple.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quickly runs out of battery on iphone 6 reasons" class="if uuid-3166824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166824.jpg"></div><h2>  Airplane Mode, Mobile Internet </h2><p>  In some cases, smartphone users are faced with increased battery consumption when traveling outside the city.  This can happen due to being in places with poor network coverage, in other words, in the ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù.  The iPhone system begins to use all kinds of resources to search for a signal, which inevitably affects its autonomy.  You can avoid excessive charge consumption by activating flight mode.  To do this, go to the Settings tab, find the Flight Mode at the top and put the slider in the on state.  Wireless systems will be deactivated, while Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can be turned on separately. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="optogadzhet.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quickly drains the battery on iphone 6 solutions" class="if uuid-3166826" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166826.jpg"></div><p>  Often, with access to the Internet, many programs work without stopping.  If the signal level is low, the device makes increased efforts to find the best connection.  As a result, consuming battery power.  You can disable it in the settings section of the "Cellular" tab. </p><h2>  Turn off spotlight, push notifications, photo stream </h2><p>  Spotlight can also cause abnormally high levels of charge.  If it is always on, it may malfunction.  To maintain fullness of the battery, it is necessary to stop the operation of this mode. </p><p>  Push notifications not only distract from using the smartphone, but also connect to the Internet, which leads to a fast discharge of the battery.  Disabling them in the device settings significantly saves the energy of the device. </p><div class="photo" data-original="interesno.co" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="quickly drains the battery on iphone 6 s" class="if uuid-3166812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166812.jpg"></div><p>  A photo stream is a transfer of photos from a device to IKlaud in automatic mode when connected to Wi-Fi.  Such actions adversely affect the battery charge.  To maintain the desired interest, you should turn off automatic transmission and resume it when you need it. </p><h2>  Charging failure and notification calibration </h2><p>  Often the battery on the iPhone 6 runs out very quickly due to a charger malfunction.  For example, in the process of powering the smartphone, the display shows the full charge of the battery, in fact, the device is partially charged.  For this reason, it seems to the user that the phone is quickly discharging.  In this case, you must try to charge the device with another accessory, and if the problem is not solved, you need to take the phone to the workshop. </p><p>  Another reason the battery runs out quickly is due to calibration.  Speaking in accessible language, smartphone firmware.  Special applications will help you to check and configure the battery.  They display battery statistics on a particular gadget.  It is quite fast and convenient, moreover, this method has helped to fix problems for many users. </p><div class="photo" data-original="expertland.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the battery runs down very quickly on the iphone 6" class="if uuid-3166822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166822.jpg"></div><h2>  Wi-Fi, bluetooth and startup </h2><p>  The autoload function of programs and applications has several advantages and carries a lot of useful information downloaded from other devices.  However, in addition to its advantages, it leads to a quick discharge of the smartphone.  You can control and disable this feature in the iPhone settings. </p><p>  Most people using a mobile device, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are constantly in the activated state, regardless of whether they are currently in use or not.  If you need to save charge, these functions must be enabled only at the time of use.  It should be noted that the battery consumption for Wi-Fi is an order of magnitude lower than when you turn on 3G.  And some users almost never use bluetooth, while it remains on by default. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apple-geek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="the battery on iphone 6 quickly settles the problem" class="if uuid-3166828" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3166828.jpg"></div><h2>  If the described methods did not help </h2><p>  Any of the above methods does not require large time and financial costs, however, in cases where none of them brought the desired result, more drastic measures are required. </p><p>  If the battery runs out quickly on the iPhone 6, the solution might be: </p><ol><li>  Flashing through iTunes.  Having made a backup copy of all the files available in the device, they completely reinstall the operating system.  Within a couple of days, you need to test the phone without downloading back-up data.  If, in this case, the battery runs out quickly, the point is in the accessories. </li><li>  Most often, when it comes to internal damage, this is a battery.  Despite the fact that it was checked by a special utility, the case may be in a departed loop, power connector, etc. </li></ol><p>  If you can‚Äôt fix the problem on your own, you need to contact the service center, where the damage will be eliminated or the device will be replaced with a new one.  In any case, without special skills, it is better not to open the phone yourself. </p>
