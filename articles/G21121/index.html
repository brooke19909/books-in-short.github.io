    <h2>  "Live" dish </h2><p>  The first interesting fact about chemistry is about unusual food.  One of the famous dishes of Japanese cuisine - ‚ÄúOdori Don‚Äù - ‚Äúdancing squid‚Äù.  Many are shocked by the look of squid moving tentacles in a plate.  But do not worry, he does not suffer and has not felt anything for a long time.  Freshly freshened squid is placed in a bowl with rice and poured with soy sauce before serving.  The squid tentacles begin to shrink.  This is due to the special structure of the nerve fibers, which for some time after the death of the animal react with the sodium ions contained in the sauce, causing the muscles to contract. </p><h2>  Random discovery </h2><p>  Interesting facts about chemistry often relate to discoveries made by chance.  So, in 1903, Eduard Benedictus, a famous French chemist, invented safety glass.  The scientist accidentally dropped a flask that was filled with nitrocellulose.  He noticed that the flask was broken, but the glass did not shatter into pieces.  After conducting the necessary research, the chemist found that in this way you can create shockproof glass.  So the first safety glasses for cars appeared, which significantly reduced the number of injuries in car accidents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Live sensor </h2><p>  Interesting facts about chemistry tell us about the use of animal sensitivity for human benefit.  Until 1986, miners took canaries underground with them.  The fact is that these birds are extremely sensitive to mine gases, especially methane and carbon monoxide.  Even with a small concentration of these substances in the air, the bird can die.  Miners listened to the birds singing and monitored their well-being.  If the canary is anxious or begins to weaken, this is a signal that the mine must be abandoned. </p><p>  The bird did not necessarily die from poisoning, it quickly became better in the fresh air.  Even special sealed cells were used, which closed when signs of poisoning occurred.  Even today, no device has been invented that senses ore gases as subtly as a canary. </p><h2>  Rubber </h2><p>  An interesting fact about chemistry: another random invention is rubber.  Charles Goodyear, an American scientist, discovered a recipe for making rubber that does not melt in the heat and does not break in the cold.  He accidentally heated a mixture of sulfur and rubber, leaving it on the stove.  The rubber process has been called vulcanization. </p>

    <h2>  Gray cardinals among plants </h2><p>  <span>Interesting facts about proteins.</span>  Chemistry can explain the behavior of animals and plants.  During evolution, many plants have developed defense mechanisms against herbivores.  Most often, they secrete poison, but scientists have discovered a more subtle method of protection.  Some plants secrete substances that attract ... predators!  Predators regulate the number of herbivores and scare them away from the place of growth of "smart" plants.  Even plants familiar to us, such as tomatoes and cucumbers, have such a mechanism.  For example, a caterpillar undermined a cucumber leaf, and the smell of secreted juice attracted birds. </p><h2>  Squirrel protectors </h2><p>  Interesting facts: chemistry and medicine are closely related.  During experiments on mice, virologists discovered interferon.  This protein is produced in all vertebrates.  A special protein, interferon, is released from the cell infected with the virus.  It does not have an antiviral effect, but it contacts healthy cells and makes them immune to the virus. </p>

    <h2>  The smell of metal </h2><p>  We usually think that coins, handrails in public transport, railings, etc., smell like metal.  But this smell does not release metal, but compounds that are formed as a result of contact with the metal surface of organic substances, for example, human sweat.  In order for a person to feel a characteristic smell, very few reagents are needed. </p><h2>  Construction material </h2><p>  <span>Interesting facts about proteins.</span>  Chemistry studies proteins relatively recently.  They arose more than 4 billion years ago in an incomprehensible way.  Proteins are the building material for all living organisms, other forms of life are unknown to science.  Half of the dry mass in most living organisms is made up of proteins. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts.  Chemistry and soda </h2><p>  In 1767, <span>Joseph Priestley</span> became interested in the nature of the bubbles that come out of beer during fermentation.  He collected gas in a bowl of water, which he tasted.  The water was pleasant and refreshing.  Thus, the scientist discovered carbon dioxide, which today is used to produce sparkling water.  Five years later, he described a more efficient method for producing this gas. </p><h2>  Sugar substitute </h2><p>  This interesting fact about chemistry suggests that many scientific discoveries were made almost by accident.  A curious case led to the discovery of the properties of sucralose, a modern sugar substitute.  Leslie Hugh, a professor in London studying the properties of the new substance trichlorosaccharose, instructed his assistant Shashikant Pkhadnis to test it (test in English).  A student who does not speak English well understood this word as ‚Äútaste‚Äù, which means a taste, and immediately followed the instructions.  Sucralose was very sweet. </p>

    <h2>  Flavoring </h2><p>  Skatol is an organic compound that forms in the intestines of animals and humans.  It is this substance that causes the characteristic smell of feces.  But if in high concentrations skatol has a smell of feces, then in small quantities this substance has a pleasant smell, reminiscent of cream or jasmine.  Therefore, skatol is used to flavor perfumes, foods and tobacco products. </p><h2>  Cat and iodine </h2><p>  An interesting fact about chemistry - the most ordinary cat was directly involved in the discovery of iodine.  Pharmacist and chemist Bernard Courtois usually dined in the laboratory, and he was often joined by a cat who liked to sit on the owner‚Äôs shoulder.  After the next meal, the cat jumped to the floor, while overturning containers with sulfuric acid and a suspension of algae ash in ethanol, standing at the desktop.  The liquids mixed, and violet vapor began to rise into the air, settling on objects with small black-violet crystals.  So a new chemical element was discovered. </p>
