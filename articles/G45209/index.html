    <h2>  <span>Types of headphones</span> and their properties </h2><p>  First, let's determine which headphones are.  What is the difference?  What should I look for when choosing?  According to the method of fixing the headphones on the head, they distinguish: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Arc mount.  The arc goes around the head and presses the cups to the ears.  This is the mount our Sennheiser HD 215 earphones have. </li><li>  Hook mount.  Headphones look like two hooks hooked on the auricles. </li><li>  Occipital arch.  It differs from the previous one in that the hooks are connected by an arc passing along the back of the head. </li><li>  Inserts.  Small headphones that we used to see in the kit with the purchased phone. </li></ul><p>  According to the method of fitting to the head, the headphones are divided into: </p><ul><li>  Overhead, cheaper devices. </li><li>  Monitor, or portable, Sennheiser HD 215 headphones belong to this category. </li></ul><p>  In <span>-ear</span> and in <span>-ear headphones</span> can be monitored <span>.</span>  Such models have a folding design, and some are equipped with a convenient carrying case or case intended for carrying.  Sennheiser HD 215 ii headphones also come with a case. </p>

    <p>  The following device classification divides them into: </p><ul><li>  Open. </li><li>  Closed.  These include the Sennheiser HD 215. </li></ul><p>  It is believed that closed headphones have a specific sound.  They are very tightly pressed to the head and have better sound insulation.  The owner of such headphones does not hear extraneous sounds, and people around can not hear the music directed to the ears of the music lover.  Closed headphones are suitable for musicians, since their design does not distort the frequency response, due to which the sound is more accurate. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Headphone Specifications </h2><p>  When choosing headphones, important indicators are: </p><ul><li>  <span>Frequency range.</span>  The wider it is, the better the sound.  The average value of the frequency range of 18-20 000 Hz. </li><li>  Device power.  The higher it is, the brighter and juicier the bass. </li><li>  Sensitivity.  The volume of the music being produced depends on it.  Typically, the sensitivity is not less than 100 dB. </li><li>  Resistance.  This parameter must be considered if you select headphones for the player.  Most devices have a resistance of 32 ohms. </li><li>  Frequency response.  Shows the accuracy of the transmitted audio material. </li><li>  Harmonic Distortion  Responsible for sound quality.  If this parameter matters to you, choose headphones with a coefficient of at least 0.5%. </li><li>  Cable. </li></ul>

    <p>  Not every buyer wants to delve into the numbers and read the characteristics of resistance, frequency, and so on.  Moreover, most of them are conditional enough to greatly affect the sound quality.  Therefore, you should adhere to the rule "it is better to hear once than to see a hundred times."  In stores, you can always connect the device and check whether these headphones are suitable for you, and then make your choice. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Criterion: cost.  What is the best price for headphones? </h2><p>  When choosing headphones, you need to adhere to the principle: the best headphones are the ones that you like.  So, their cost is equal to the price that you agree to pay for them.  A reasonable range of headphone prices is from 1000 to 4000 rubles.  What is cheaper is a blind purchase.  And more expensive - unjustified expenses. </p>
