People are photographed by both professionals and amateurs.  The only difference is how they do it right.  In this article you can learn more about how to photograph portraits. </p><h2>  Idea, plot, mood </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting that photographs should carry an emotional or semantic charge, tell a certain story.  As for portraits, in this case, such shooting is no exception.  The photographer must not only convey the appearance of the model, but also tell about this person, about his character.  At a minimum, the photograph should show the mood at a particular point in time.  That is why it is important to know how to photograph portraits so that they can convey all this. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.corvettehomecoming.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="photography portrait" class="if uuid-3193683" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193683.jpg"></div><h2>  Distance </h2><p>  A very important fact is the distance at which the photograph is taken.  How to photograph portraits?  How far should this be done?  As a rule, it is recommended to focus on the focal length of your lens.  For a portrait, a focal length of 85 mm is used.  However, you should pay attention to the fact that different cameras with a focal length of 85 mm will have a completely different scale due to the crop factor.  For example, if at a full frame the distance 85 mm is ideal, then on the crop the scale of the photo will be completely different.  But what about a person, if his lens has parameters of 18-55 mm?  This question is a sore point among beginners who want to master a portrait.  And how to take pictures in this case?  In this case, experienced professionals recommend taking portraits at a distance of at least 2 m. All the disadvantages of the scale can be compensated for by the zoom. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you shoot from a long distance, but with an approximation, then this will give the following advantages: </p><ol><li>  A familiar and calm perspective.  If you try to take a photo at a wide-angle focus, you will get a portrait where a person does not look like himself.  All of this will be to blame for a perspective that distorts the proportions of the face.  The further you move away from the person, the less the effect of perspective will be, the result will be a more correct portrait.  However, do not go to extremes, do not photograph the model from a distance of 30 m, while stretching your lens to full. </li><li>  If you take pictures from a distance, then it will be much more convenient for you to work with the background.  First of all, you will easily remove all unnecessary objects from the frame that distract attention.  In addition, the larger the focal length, the stronger the background will develop. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.doublemesh.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="blurred portrait" class="if uuid-3193685" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193685.jpg"></div><h2>  Suitable technique </h2><p>  So, we continue to consider how to photograph portraits correctly.  Above, we figured out that the focal length plays a special role in the portrait.  However, not all cameras have such a function.  A large focal length will require a large aperture value.  Thanks to this, the background is blurry, and the model is clear.  Good portrait lenses, while not very expensive, are currently offered by a variety of manufacturers.  Noteworthy: Canon EF 85mm F1.8, as well as Nikkor AF-S 85mm F1.8. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Camera setup </h2><p>  How to photograph portraits?  What else needs to be taken into account?  First of all, you need to properly configure your camera.  You need to start with exposure.  People are a pretty complex subject for photographing, as they move, so you need to select the shortest shutter speeds of 1/125 second or even less.  Otherwise, even a slight movement of a person can cause too blurry images.  In poor lighting conditions, you can increase the light sensitivity and use the flash. </p><p>  In this case, special attention should be paid to the flash sync speed.  This refers to the fastest standard shutter speed when the flash is on.  If the flash glow is shorter, but it does not support high-speed synchronization, then a black bar will appear in the photo, which is a shadow from the shutter curtain.  If you want to achieve a blurred background on the wall, you should open the aperture completely. </p><div class="photo" data-original="keywordsuggest.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portrait of a man" class="if uuid-3193688" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193688.jpg"></div><h2>  Preparing for a photo shoot </h2><p>  If you are wondering about how to photograph a portrait with a reflex camera, you should also pay special attention to preparing for a photo shoot.  First of all, it is necessary to plan it in advance, while explaining to the model how the whole process will go.  You should agree in advance on all the little things, for example, on various teams, so that the model immediately understands what you mean. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is necessary to rehearse all the difficult moments in advance, the model must be asked to depict various emotional states that will depend on the main purpose of the photo shoot.  Ask to show her sadness, arrogance, thoughtfulness.  If you have a lot of time, then take 2 pictures in a row, otherwise it turns out that on one portrait the model blinks and the whole photo goes bad.  Speaking about how to photograph a portrait with a reflex camera, you should pay attention to the fact that professional photographers usually make a sketch of a photo in advance, where they depict the model‚Äôs pose, facial expression, and also the setting of light. </p><h2>  Shine </h2><p>  Particular attention should be paid to such an important aspect as light.  If you are learning to photograph portraits, then you must also learn how to properly adjust the lighting in a photo studio.  A small light source, for example, the sun, a system flash, give a very hard light, which only emphasizes the flaws of the appearance of the model.  Try to experiment with artificial lighting using light diffusers: a softbox or a studio umbrella. </p><div class="photo" data-original="blog.54ka.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl on the background of snow" class="if uuid-3193696" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193696.jpg"></div><p>  For hard light, you can use reflectors, such as a portrait plate or a simple reflector.  You need to choose according to your taste.  When shooting outdoors, the sun will give the best light in the evening or late morning.  A photo session can be carried out in daylight, but this must be done in the shade of a tree, directing the lighting with a large folding reflector.  This is very important if you do not know how to photograph a portrait on the street. </p><h2>  Correct frame layout </h2><p>  Art portraits provide much more freedom for creativity.  Classical portraits are mostly shot in vertical format.  However, the horizontal format is also not prohibited in this case.  With it, you can best show the background in the photo. </p><p>  How to photograph portraits of people in this case?  The success of the portrait will depend on 99% of the correct focus.  It is always necessary to focus on the eyes of a person, or on the eye that is closest to the viewer.  The main rule is that you cannot change the aperture value until you are satisfied with all the indicators.  Since this parameter will depend on the situation, the focal length and the distance to the model, it is impossible to give exact advice on a specific value.  Try just experimenting.  As a result, you yourself will understand how to photograph a portrait indoors or outdoors. </p><h2>  Posing </h2><p>  Much will also depend on the model itself.  A special role in the success of a portrait is played by the posing of a person.  At the same time, it is very important to know what position to choose for a portrait in the dark, how to photograph a model in a particular setting. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portrait of a guy" class="if uuid-3193690" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193690.jpg"></div><p>  Most often, inexperienced photographers shoot novice models who still can not pose.  However, this factor is one of the most important in conveying the mood and plot in the photograph.  Speaking of posing, here it is necessary to take into account several requirements, which are as follows: </p><ol><li>  When you picked up the camera, started shooting, you should already understand what you want to get and show the audience.  Posing in this case plays an important role.  For example, the hero is thoughtful, joyful, he is cold.  In everyday life in such situations, people usually take a certain position.  It is these poses that should be used when photographing a portrait.  The viewer must understand in what particular emotional state the model is.  A closed pose, for example with arms crossed, is ideal for a dramatic plot.  The most open ones are suitable for positive photos.  It will not be superfluous if you learn sign language, so that you can independently lay the necessary emotional background, advising the model of a particular pose. </li><li>  Some people cross their arms over their chests, others try to keep them in their pockets.  Please note that this or that position should be familiar to the person you are photographing.  Otherwise, there will be tension, as well as unnaturalness in posing. </li><li>  So-called magazine poses are suitable for experienced models and magazines.  Such people for a long time learn to control their own body in order to look beautiful in photography.  If you are shooting for a portrait of an inexperienced person, then most likely you will not be able to take such a photo as in glossy magazines.  That is why choose the most vital, simple poses. </li></ol><p>  If you are making a portrait of a beginner model, then some difficulties may arise.  To avoid them, check out the typical mistakes in posing: </p><ol><li>  No need to hide your hands behind your back or in your hair, otherwise they seem cut off.  The same applies to pockets: at least thumbs should be visible. </li><li>  The neck is an expressive part of the body of a woman.  Do not cover it with very raised shoulders. </li><li>  If the model rests with its face on its hand, then it is necessary to ensure that the facial features are not distorted. </li><li>  Do not smile with half your mouth, as it looks very ugly. </li><li>  When taking a full-length portrait, you must ensure that the leg that is closest to the camera does not overlap the other.  Otherwise, the person turns out to be one-legged. </li></ol><h2>  Winter photos </h2><p>  Now we will consider in more detail how to photograph a portrait in winter.  Indeed, it is during this period of time that novice photographers have some difficulties with photography.  In general, in general, the rules will be the same as in the summer.  A fashion model needs only to be protected from the cold.  If possible, regular respite should be given in a warm room.  You should take a thermos with a hot drink with you.  As for the snow in the background, it can be either white or gray, bluish.  Everything will depend on the camera settings, as we discussed above.  On the other hand, the weather also plays a special role.  If you want snowdrifts to be as white and shiny as possible, it is best to take portraits in sunny weather. </p><div class="photo" data-original="jasonduchowphotography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="winter portrait" class="if uuid-3193695" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193695.jpg"></div><p>  It is also important to observe some technical points.  In particular, do not allow snow to enter the chamber, or rather, into its body.  Do not change the lens during snowfall.  Condensation, frozen fingers can damage your equipment. </p><h2>  To phone </h2><p>  And how to photograph a portrait on the phone?  To do this, you must follow very simple principles that apply professionals.  What will be the basic rules? </p><p>  First of all, do not skew the horizon.  In some cases, the skew line on the horizon creates an unusual effect.  But if you do not have advanced knowledge of composition, it is better not to use this tool.  We must try to align the frame.  To do this, activate the "grid" on your smartphone.  Along the lines, you can easily align an object in a frame that is located both horizontally and vertically.  This is necessary if you are photographing a model on some kind of complex background. </p><p>  The most important criterion is also lighting.  It is best to take pictures in diffused soft light.  As a rule, such lighting happens on the street in the late afternoon or in the morning.  However, there is another extreme.  Too bright a sun can be a problem for the phone to automatically measure exposure.  The result is a strong overexposure either on the face or in the background.  If you are photographing a model in the midst of a sunny day, it is best to do it in the shade.  To do this, you can use trees, a wall near the building. </p><p>  The correct shooting angle also plays a big role in creating a portrait using a smartphone.  The main problem with the wrong choice of angle is the deformation of the body and face proportions.  For example, if you shoot down, the result will be too elongated face with a disproportionate figure.  And if you take the picture too low, this will add a second chin to the model, as well as a too heavy jaw.  That is why it is necessary to take photos from the chest level of the model or from the level of the belt.  At the eye level, you can also take pictures, but it is best to use this maneuver when the portrait is at the level of the belt or slightly higher. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.titofineportraits.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="black and white portrait" class="if uuid-3193687" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/102572/3193687.jpg"></div><p>  If you are photographing a person on a smartphone, it is recommended to use the additional features of the gadget.  To do this, you should carefully familiarize yourself with the features offered by your smartphone.  If there is a double optical zoom, then this is a definite plus.  After all, it is not always possible to get as close to the model as possible.  In some cases, a small river or a fence of a person separates from the photographer.  The same should be said about other functions.  Before you go to the photo shoot, you should carefully study all the features of your mobile camera.  Consider in what specific situations it is possible to apply them. </p><p>  One can talk endlessly on the subject of portraiture.  You can get much more information from the book "How to Photograph People. Beyond the Portrait" by B. Peterson. </p>
