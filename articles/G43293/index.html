Some of them can only be used domestically, while others can be used abroad.  International <span>bank cards</span> are accepted for payment of services, served at terminals and ATMs anywhere in the world. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first analogues of bank cards appeared in 1914 in New York.  Then cards were issued from cardboard and used to certify the solvency of the client.  After 14 years, metal began to be used for the same purpose, which made it possible to automate the processing of information.  The first mass payment system appeared in 1949 under the leadership of Diners Club.  It was a club system with a limited number of participants, which worked according to the same scheme as modern <span>Visa and MasterCard.</span> </p>

    <p>  Cards began to be issued from the 50s of the last century in the USA as a new tool for cashless payments, replacing obsolete <span>checkbooks.</span>  The pioneer in 1951 was the New York Bank Long Island Bank.  In Europe, the fashion company for a new payment instrument introduced the British company Finders Services.  Only 10 years later, a magnetic strip appeared on plastics, and in the 90s a chip. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Glossary </h2><p>  Before considering the procedure for transactions with international bank cards, you need to study the basic terms: </p><ul><li>  An acquirer is a bank servicing a card. </li><li>  The issuer is the credit organization that issued it. </li><li>  A processing center is a division of banks that interact between settlement participants in order to collect and process card transactions. </li><li>  A correspondent account is opened by a bank in the Central Bank. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Settlement Algorithm </h2><p>  Transactions with international bank cards can be carried out at any retail outlet in the world equipped with a terminal.  But in this case, the process is different from the standard one: </p><ul><li>  At the time of payment, the terminal verifies the authenticity of the plastic and the availability of money in the account. </li><li>  Funds are debited, the terminal issues a check. </li><li>  The outlet transfers it to the acquiring bank, which transfers the amount to the accounts of enterprises.  He also transmits information about operations using extraneous cards to a processing center. </li><li>  These data are collected, analyzed, after which the final information is brought to the attention of the issuer, acquirer and payment system. </li><li>  The settlement bank writes off the required amount from the issuer's account and transfers it to the acquirer. </li><li>  The issuing bank writes off the debt from the cardholder taking into account all commission expenses. </li></ul>

Over the past five years, the number issued amounted to 230 million units, of which only 30 million - with a credit limit.  In the Russian market alone, the number of transactions with foreign currency increased 6 times and amounted to 2549 million units.  At the same time, Russians began to less frequently withdraw cash from the account (751 million operations totaling 5,317.4 billion rubles) and use the card more to pay for goods (1,798 million operations amounting to 1,714 billion rubles).  The reason is the increase in the number of outlets equipped with a terminal and the increase in the number of ATMs through which you can withdraw funds (224 thousand units) and pay for goods (133 thousand units). </p><h2>  Card types </h2><p>  In the world there are two international payment systems based on bank cards: Visa and MasterCard.  More than half of the market is Visa International - 57%.  MasterCard International accounts for 26% of the market.  Other participants are also present: American Express (13%), DinersClub (4%) and JCB - (4%).  The main task of payment systems is to ensure settlements between banks of all countries.  MasterCard unites more than 20 thousand financial institutions in 220 countries, VISA - 21 thousand organizations.  International VISA cards are used mainly for settlements in dollars.  MasterCard is also focused on the euro.  However, for an ordinary Russian client there is no difference between these systems. </p><h2>  Other criteria </h2><p>  <span>Debit payment</span> instruments are used for settlements within the scope of funds in the client‚Äôs account.  These plastics are most often used in salary and social projects.  Credit cards allow you to pay for goods at the expense of the bank, and then return the accumulated debt with a small percentage.  Such a revolving <span>line of credit</span> for individuals. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  There is also a division into classes: from Electron and Maestro to "platinum".  The higher the category, the more opportunities are provided to the holder, which affects the cost of plastic.  International bank cards are issued in the categories Classic, Gold, Platinum and Black Edition.  With an increase in the class of service, the credit limit rises.  For example, with a classic Alfa-Bank credit card, you can get up to 150 thousand rubles, and with a platinum one - already 750 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Allocate a separate class of electronic cards that do not have a physical medium.  They are intended solely for purchasing goods over the Internet. </p><p>  International credit cards with a credit limit are primarily aimed at customers who travel frequently.  Another special product has been developed for them - co-branded cards with airlines.  According to them, the holder receives bonuses for using the services of partners.  For example, Aeroflot Visa card holders could spend the accumulated ‚Äúmiles‚Äù on the purchase of airline tickets of the same company.  Another additional option is Cash Back.  For completed purchases paid with a card, the holder at the end of the month received a certain percentage of the amount spent back to the account.  Otherwise, the plastic was no different from a regular card. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  Almost every working Russian has a <span>debit card</span> on which salary is charged.  Most often these are Electron and Maestro plastics, but reputable companies issue international bank cards to their employees.  You can order such a card by contacting the bank yourself. </p><p>  The application procedure is simple.  You need to contact a bank employee, provide a passport, a second identity document (driver‚Äôs license, passport, etc.) and write a statement.  Two more weeks will have to wait until the plastic itself is made.  The fee for the year of service is debited directly from the account.  A plastic payment instrument is issued already with a negative balance. </p>

    <p>  To order a credit card, you need to additionally prepare a statement of income and wait for the response of the loan manager.  The presence of a passport with fresh stamps on going abroad or real estate documents increases the chance of getting a credit card. </p><h2>  For whom? </h2><p>  Even if you do not use the services of an airline, you rarely travel outside the country; having an international credit card in reserve will not hurt.  At any time, there may be a need to make a purchase of goods in foreign currency via the Internet or there may simply be problems with a debit payment instrument. </p><p>  Today, international credit cards with a credit limit are a convenient means of payment that can be accepted for service in any heat of the world.  If you wish, you can even find a product with a long grace period and a minimum commission for withdrawing funds from ATMs. </p>

    <h2>  Bank Market Sanctions </h2><p>  According to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, last year credit organizations issued 234 million cards, of which 87% were debit and 13% were credit.  Under the influence of international sanctions, the number of banks engaged in acquiring decreased by 7.8% to 572 units.  Most of the cards issued are related to local payment systems.  This was reflected in the growth of the share of payment instrument holders: pensioners and non-working people began to issue social cards for benefits. </p>
