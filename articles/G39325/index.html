So in June 2017, the new Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace came on sale.  Characteristics and a description of it are discussed in detail in this article.  User reviews about the device will also be affected. </p><h2>  Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace Feature Description </h2><p>  This smartphone has a budget version, and its cost does not exceed 3000 rubles.  The Micromax manufacturer itself is from India, but in the Russian market it has long held good positions in the niche of budget smartphones. </p><p>  Externally, the device is a classic version of the touch phone.  Exquisite style of performance or ornate forms to meet in it will not work. </p><p>  On the front panel are the front camera, earpiece and touch control buttons.  At the back is the main camera, flash, and general speaker.  The manufacturer‚Äôs logo flaunts here. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that this model in the world and Indian market is known as the Bharat 2 Q402, released in the same year, but in April.  So settings and firmware can be searched for for the specified version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the time of release, this unit could be purchased at a promotion in Beeline stores for 990 rubles.  According to the conditions, the bundle contained a certain amount of traffic that had to be used for several months. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  Computing power is based on the very weak Spreadtrum SC9832 processor.  This is a 32-bit representative of the class with 4 Cortex-A7 cores at 1300 MHz.  The graphics are implemented due to the work of the Mali-400 MP2 - not the worst adapter.  This chipset is not very popular and is rarely found even in very budget devices. </p><p>  The internal memory in the phone is 4 GB, operational - 512 MB, which is very small in modern realities.  To increase the total memory, there is a slot for SD cards, which supports up to 32 GB. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The screen has a very small size of 4 inches.  Budget TFT matrix has a resolution of 480 by 800 pixels.  You should not expect large angles and good brightness in the sun from such a display.  On the street he will have to peer.  And reading from a screen of this size is quite difficult. </p><h2>  Communication and Interfaces </h2><p>  The device has two slots for sim cards.  One of them supports LTE and can only be used for Beeline SIM cards.  However, you can easily unlock the slot for other operators, having received a special code.  The second connector is able to work in other modes and with any SIM cards. </p>

    <p>  To connect to wireless networks, use the Wi-Fi interface.  Other devices include Bluetooth.  There is the possibility of navigation via GPS.  Judging by user reviews, satellites are not too fast.  And stability is a little lame. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  One of the important <span>features of the Micromax Q402</span> Bolt Pace is its battery capacity.  In this device, it is equal to 1300 mAh.  Taking into account not the most productive processor and undemanding screen resources, such a charge should last for a long time.  However, the latest version of Android and 4G can consume a lot of energy. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  You don‚Äôt have to wait for special qualities from the capabilities of smartphone cameras.  Pictures have pronounced noise, even in good light, even in the dark. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Oddly enough, but on this smartphone installed "Android" 6.0.  With such budget characteristics, the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace system works pretty tolerably.  Of course, you can forget about launching modern heavy applications, but all simple things will go off with a bang. </p><h2>  Overview of analogues </h2><p>  It is interesting that this unit has many competitors that are better in price, parameters and appearance. </p>

    <p>  Alcatel Pixi 4 4034D is very similar in characteristics to the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace.  Moreover, its price reaches 2,000 rubles.  The version of Android is the same.  In terms of performance, the 4-core, more popular MT6580M with 1300 MHz is installed here.  The amount of memory is similar, with the only difference being that more than 2 GB of internal memory is available to the user. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The screen and dimensions are no different from the specifications of the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace Dark Blue.  The only drawback of this device relative to the monitored is the lack of 4G. </p><p>  ZTE Blade L110 costs the same.  In this case, the operating system is older than the version.  The screen and its size are identical.  But productivity is one level higher.  Although the processors are similar, the RAM is 1 GB, and the built-in memory is 8. But there is an obvious minus - there is no LTE. </p><p>  <span>Fly FS458</span> Stratus 7 is more similar to the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace smartphone in terms of performance.  True, it is immediately worth noting the lack of 4G.  The same operating system and screen resolution.  The size here is slightly larger - 4.5 inches.  The pixel density is much lower - 218. The processor, although dual-core, is still not bad and with a frequency of 1300 MHz.  RAM is also small - 512 MB, but the built-in memory for such a phone is not bad - 8 GB.  Interestingly, with all the modest characteristics, the smartphone has a 1700 mAh battery.  And its cost has not gone far from the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace and is also within 3000 rubles. </p>

    <p>  In the line of the manufacturer Micromax there is a fellow hero of the article - Q346.  It is 300 rubles more expensive.  It has a similar quad-core processor with a frequency of 1200 MHz.  The memory capacity here is twice as much - operational 1 GB, built-in - 8. The battery capacity is also acceptable - 1700 mAh.  The phone does not support 4G, the version of Android is 5.1.  However, it is more balanced in terms of performance than the Q402. </p><p>  Philips S309 is perhaps the most obsolete in this collection of analogues.  However, it is also interesting.  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù is already installed on it, as many as 4 versions.  At the same time, it has a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1000 MHz.  There is enough RAM in it - 1 GB, but the internal memory is not enough - 4 GB.  With such undemanding characteristics, the smartphone is equipped with a capacious 1600 mAh battery.  In theory, its charge should be enough for a long period of use. </p><h2>  User Comment Overview </h2><p>  Reviews about the characteristics of the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace are pretty monotonous.  In addition, the phone is relatively new, so there are not many of them. </p><p>  Basically, they all relate to the strange combination of 6 "Android" and such weak characteristics.  Accordingly, there are frequent ‚Äújams‚Äù and ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù during the operation of the system. </p>

    <p>  Reviews about the battery can be divided into two camps - those who use the phone for calls, and those who use Wi-Fi and mobile Internet.  The first claim that the charge lasts for 2.5 days, the second claim that it is necessary to recharge 2-3 times a day. </p><p>  The small size of the smartphone fits perfectly in the children's hand, so young users are comfortable with it. </p><p>  The characteristics of the Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace Champagne in terms of memory also did not particularly please the owners.  Only about 700 MB of the claimed 4 GB are available to the user.  Naturally, amateurs will often be very inconvenient to install new applications due to the constant lack of system resources. </p>

    <p>  The cameras, as was said, are not a ‚Äúfountain‚Äù.  With sufficient lighting, you can still take a clear picture of something.  If it‚Äôs bad, you need to ‚Äúplay a little‚Äù at the settings, which also does not always help. </p><p>  Two sim cards is, of course, good, but the main slot is blocked for other operators.  To wean a smartphone from Beeline, you have to ‚Äúdance with a tambourine‚Äù a little.  By the way, judging by the specialized forums, the second slot can actually also work in LTE mode.  However, it must first be unlocked with the help of difficult manipulations with the firmware and recovery. </p>

    <p>  In general, smartphone users are satisfied.  However, the ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù 4G technology in it is also a frank minus.  With the active use of Internet traffic, the battery sits right before your eyes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  In general, the device is rather ambiguous.  The characteristics of the smartphone Micromax Q402 Bolt Pace Champagne are somehow too unbalanced.  Weak battery, but at the same time there are energy-consuming Wi-Fi and 4G.  Out of place here is Android 6. If the calculation was to support new applications, then system resources will obviously be insufficient for their work.  The very last ‚ÄúChrome‚Äù, even in medium performance devices, can cause solid ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù.  There is nothing that this smartphone could really surprise.  The cameras are below average, the characteristics are strange, the screen is small. </p><p>  Most likely, it will turn out to be a really profitable purchase only for the ‚Äúdialer‚Äù and ‚Äúrogue‚Äù modes on the Internet.  And then, if you buy it on a stock from a mobile operator.  Or a temporary replacement until it becomes possible to purchase a more productive device.  In all other cases, it will be more profitable to look at more worthy analogues.  Moreover, there are a lot of them. </p>
