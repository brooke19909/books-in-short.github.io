Recommendations</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A modern washing machine is an indispensable assistant in the house.  It will wash and almost dry the laundry, and some models will also iron.  But it often happens that, along with the laundry, various kinds of objects fall into the tank and remain there: coins dropped out of the pocket, buttons torn off, rivets, or a stone from the bra got into the washing machine.  And if a small object is less dangerous for the internal parts of the device, then part of the female underwear due to its shape can cause great harm.  How to remove a bone from a bra from a washing machine?  Of course, you can call a qualified master, he reanimates the machine in a matter of minutes.  The cost of such a service will be from 1000 rubles, depending on the city and the service center.  But if you wish, you can save on the services of a wizard and solve the problem yourself. </p><h2>  What harm can this piece of lingerie cause to the machine? </h2>

    <ol><li>  Damage to the drum, the tank in which it rotates, or the heating element.  During operation, the drum of the washing machine spins at high speed, if the bone from the bra stands across, it can break through its walls or damage the tank itself.  The same can happen with TEN.  In addition to repairing these parts, it may also be necessary to eliminate the flood. </li><li>  Cuff damage.  Although this is a fairly strong elastic located around the hatch, it is easy to damage it with a sharp object. </li><li>  The bone can fall into the drum and stop its work. </li><li>  If you don‚Äôt get the metal part of the lingerie in time, it will eventually leave rust on the linen and clothes. </li></ol><h2>  How to understand that the bone from the bra got into the washing machine? </h2><p>  If during the washing process a characteristic sound of metal grinding is heard, in order to avoid problems, it is best to stop the program, drain the water, remove the laundry and find the noise source, after examining the laundry and finding out what part of the clothes can make it.  If during the inspection it turns out that a bone from the bra has got into the washing machine, you need to arm yourself with a flashlight and find its location.  This part of lingerie can be in three places of the device: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  in the drum; </li><li>  in the tank; </li><li>  between the tank and the drum. </li></ul><p>  If it is not in the drum itself, it is worth examining the bottom of the tank through the holes.  In the absence, it can be diagnosed that it is stuck between these parts. </p><h2>  How to get a bone out of a car depends on the material </h2><p>  In the female holding underwear, bones from different materials are inserted.  They are both plastic and metal. </p><p>  Iron elements can cause more serious damage to the details of the washing machine, but you can try to get them with a magnet, without disassembling the device.  While to remove the plastic bone will have to disassemble the washing machine.  But if a stone from a bra made of plastic gets into the washing machine, it will not do much harm, since it is flexible and soft compared to metal.  But in any case, you have to work hard to remove a foreign object from the apparatus.  So, there was a bone from a bra in the washer.  How to pull out?  You can do this in several ways, depending on which part of the device it is in. </p><h2>  Extraction of a foreign object through the hole from the heater </h2><p>  It is worth noting that this method of extracting garments from the tank is suitable only for those models in which the heating element is located at the back.  For example, an LG washing machine.  The bone from the bra got into the tank itself or remained between the tank and the drum, it does not matter. </p><p>  In order to get it, you must: </p><ol><li>  Disconnect the device from the power supply. </li><li>  Turn the washing machine so that it can be conveniently approached to the back wall. </li><li>  If the machine has a service hatch, then all work can be carried out through it.  In case of its absence, it is necessary to remove the back wall, having previously unscrewed the screws on which it rests.
