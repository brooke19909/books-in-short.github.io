    <h2>  About the resort </h2><p>  Goa attracts tourists from various corners of the globe with its snow-white beaches and exotic.  This is a paradise, a pearl of the west coast of India, in which the exotic and traditions of Western Europe intertwine.  The natural diversity, even splendor, strikes the imagination of the most sophisticated tourists.  Here you can find impenetrable jungle, mango thickets, huge plantations of spices and spices, enchanting lakes and waterfalls.  This is truly a paradise that you do not want to leave.  That is why many of those tourists who visit Goa at least once come back here again and again. </p><h2>  About hotels </h2><p>  In Goa, you simply will not find multi-story hotels with a huge surrounding area.  All hotels here are not higher than palm trees (9 meters) and not closer than 300 m to the sea.  The reason for this is quite strong ebbs and flows, which can cause a lot of discomfort to vacationers.  Most often these are small private hotels, nice and cozy houses with an average of 30-40 rooms.  There are not so many vacationers in them, which allows you to enjoy peace and tranquility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All tourists should be careful about the stardom of the chosen hotel - it is far from always true.  Yes, of course, there are fashionable hotels here, where the staff is ready to fulfill any client‚Äôs wishes, but there are very, very few of them.  Most often, after checking in, tourists encounter dirt in the rooms, old dry furniture, the appalling state of plumbing, and find exotic lizards, spiders and even snakes in their rooms. </p>

    <h2>  Rooms </h2><p>  Of course, going to Goa, it is unlikely that you will spend all your free time in the hotel - you need a room exclusively for sleep and relaxation.  Nevertheless, the question of the state of plumbing, living conditions in the rooms excites all tourists, without exception.  Goa is an exotic resort, so there is a serious cause for concern. </p><p>  So, if we look at the Sao Domingos 2 * hotel photos, we will see that they have a nice three-story building that looks like a small country house.  Vacationers are invited to stay in one of the 30 small rooms.  The rooms have comfortable beds, a wardrobe for storing clothes, a bedside table, satellite TV and, perhaps, the most necessary in the conditions of the sweltering heat - air conditioning.  Each room has its own balcony, where you can meet the sunrises and see off the sunsets.  On the balcony there are two <span>wicker chairs</span> and a small table. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  For a fee, tourists can purchase a password for wireless internet and use a minibar.  By the way, about the wireless Internet: almost all the reviews of tourists speak of disgusting signal quality.  This is understandable and justified by the location of the hotel.  In general, for what to write to relatives and friends through social networks, to share your emotions and impressions from the rest, speed is quite enough. </p>

    <p>  Let's discuss the condition of the equipment of the Sao Domingos 2 * hotel.  Reviews of vacationers most often say that the state of technology is poor.  The TV may not work during the whole rest, there may be problems with the climatic equipment, in some rooms the plumbing is out of order.  In fact, for Goa hotels - this is the norm.
