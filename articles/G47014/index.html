    <p>  On the territory of different regions you can ride as part of one ski pass.  Like any coin, this resort also has two sides.  Nobody is perfect.  On a day off, you may have to wait in line: not all lifts are replaced with new ones.  To relax with taste, you will have to postpone a tidy sum for a trip to the ski resort of Madonna di Campiglio. </p><p>  If you want to pass a difficult track - this venture will be limited to one zeal.  If you do not know Italian, it will be difficult for you to find mutual understanding with employees of many local institutions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Way to the resort </h2><p>  Perhaps the pros interest you and, despite the flaws, you want to relax on Madonna di Campiglio.  "How to get there?"  - This is the first question you ask yourself.  It will be most convenient to arrive in Balzano, on the land of Milan or Verona.  Three hours you will have to spend on moving Venice - Milan.  The road from Verona to Milan will last an hour and a half.  And you will have to spend about a quarter of a day if Turin is your starting point. </p>

    <h2>  Apres-ski and excursions </h2><p>  When resting in the mountains it is hard to deny yourself an apres-ski.  When it comes to Italian cuisine, we are faced with food, which is inherent in good taste and simplicity.  As they say, all ingenious is simple.  So, speaking of the simple nature of the dishes, we do not detract from its quality and captivatingness. </p><p>  So where without a cultural drink of an exquisite wine drink?  Miller recently acquired a local vineyard.  The American is not only engaged in the production of drinks traditional here: the skier also began to create wine in local workshops, which include grapes from America. </p><p>  In addition to sports and recreation, health care, you will also find a rich cultural program that will enrich knowledge.  You will have to spend no more than an hour on the road in order to visit the castle of Castello de Buonaxillo.  It is not the only one here: there are many others that amaze with their ancient beauty and scale of buildings.  These places are full of interesting museums exhibiting a wide variety of antiquities. </p><h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  At the same time, the resort accommodates 27 thousand visitors who live in apartments, hotels and cottages.  Their device is well thought out and supported by the best masters of their craft.  Planners thoroughly approached the issue of accommodation with the aim of providing them with the best access to all important and interesting points. </p><p>  Madonna di Campiglio differs from a number of similar places in the Alps.  The prices here are not small, but this is also justified by the quality of service and comfortable living conditions, a lot of interesting entertainment events.  The resort includes the best hotels with 4 stars on a comparative scale.  Why not five?  The reason for this is placement near the city outskirts.  Although this flaw is compensated by the availability of free transport, working during the day.  If you are careful about the budget and want to relax a little cheaper, Christiania or Ambiez 3 is suitable for you. These items are also located in the bosom of stunning nature: next to them is a dense forest. </p>
