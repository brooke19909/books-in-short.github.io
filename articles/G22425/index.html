How to use the common interface (CI) module slot in LCD TVs</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A new generation of television devices allows, with minimal hardware resources, access to a wide range of media channels.  The aging system for connecting autonomous tuners is being replaced by more compact modules and signal translators that efficiently process the received information.  Philips, LG and Samsung are actively developing advanced technologies in this field.  In this case, we consider the Common Interface system on a Samsung TV.  What does this give to the end user?  In fact, the Common Interface (CI) concept allows for a simplified design to access channels that have an encoded signal.  In other words, a device in the form of a decoder is integrated into the TV, increasing the functionality of the technique. </p>

    <h2>  Interface Overview </h2><p>  The Common Interface system is often and erroneously confused with the channel decoding tool itself.  This is fundamentally wrong, since it is only an interface for the integration of such cards, which, in turn, are supplied by telecommunication operators.  The presence of such a slot in the TV makes it possible to use the interface as a replacement for a traditional receiver.  Therefore, such systems are sometimes called the DVB Common Interface, that is, a slot that supports a specific interaction format with an integrated tuner.  Moreover, the DVB tuner is currently popular, though still giving way to more technological satellite counterparts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In practice, the operation of the slot, the user gets the opportunity to view encoded channels from a particular operator that issued the card.  This is a CI module that is inserted into the corresponding interface and, after making settings on the TV itself, opens closed programs. </p><h2>  The principle of operation of the decoder </h2>

    <p>  The decoder operates in a specific decryption system encoding algorithm, which is used by the telecommunications service provider.  The interface in this case only provides the technical feasibility of decoding with the subsequent presentation of the signal in one format or another.  Most of the encoded signals arrive at the receiver along with the access key.  This key is sent through the same slot to the card, which gives an answer in the form of a generated code.  The latter goes to the tuner itself, connected to the Common Interface system on the Samsung TV.  What does this mean from a legal perspective?  Using such a signal decoding scheme is completely legal.  The fact is that when buying a card, the service for using one or another channel is also paid at the same time.  Usually a whole package is purchased, to which, when connected, the installed card will gain access. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the CI + module </h2>

    <p>  A more advanced system based on the CI interface, the changes in which are due precisely to the requirements of the copyright holders of media content.  The fact is that modules of this type of first generation open up wide opportunities for users to handle received materials.  After the primary processing of the signal in the card, it is further transmitted to the tuner and, accordingly, to the screen in an open, that is, decoded form.  This feature allows the equipment owner to save content. </p><p>  It is with the aim of limiting the possibilities of copying that the improved Common Interface is implemented in the Samsung TV.  What does this mean for the viewer?  Firstly, the impossibility of saving materials in the viewing process.  This operation can only be performed using additional playback and recording devices.  Secondly, the user cannot skip <span>ad units.</span>  Access to content is provided only in a single order - for one impression.  The module with the prefix ‚Äúplus‚Äù does not provide full decoding of the signal, but only gives it the possibility of entering the tuner, and decryption is already performed on the screen before the direct broadcast. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  It is such an algorithm that limited the owners of TVs with CI + interfaces in the possibilities of performing additional actions with the received material. </p><h2>  Adapter connection </h2>

    <p>  An adapter is required for subsequent installation of the operator card itself.  It should be embedded in a special interface niche on the rear panel.  Moreover, Samsung developers recommend performing this operation before the TV was installed at a permanent place of operation.  This is especially true for models that involve a wall-mounted fixation method.  And the card should be installed for convenience after the adapter has been successfully integrated. </p><p>  The device is attached using special clips, which can have different designs depending on the model.  Usually, clamps and holes are used to ensure that the Common Interface adapter fits tightly on the Samsung TV.  What does this give in the context of installing the card itself?  The adapter itself allows you to purposefully work with specific modules using a common interface.  That is, when changing or updating formats for connecting tuners and carrier cards, the Common Interface slot will remain relevant due to the possibility of using such adapters. </p><h2>  Module integration </h2><p>  Installation of the card is carried out in accordance with the instructions for a specific model.  Usually, the direction of the integration is indicated on the modules themselves.  Before installation, the TV will record on the decoded channel, but after installation it should disappear.  Usually, when these modules are first placed, the screen displays basic information about the supplier and specific user identification data.  Its appearance means that the Common Interface card has been connected correctly and the channels can be decoded.  It is important to note that physically such modules are quite sensitive, so you should handle them as carefully as possible without damaging the surface. </p>

    <h2>  Module settings via TV </h2><p>  Usually, the system automatically makes the necessary settings with the broadcast output from the connected signal receiver.  You can find out about the correct connection and the current status of the module‚Äôs connection with the tuner in the special section ‚Äúcommon interfaces‚Äù, and in some models this information is reflected in the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù or ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù menu.  When the necessary section is found, it remains only to put the CI-module on activity and switch the TV to the display mode. </p><h2>  What to do if the module does not connect? </h2><p>  During the installation of the module and signal detection, various problems can occur.  Most often, their solutions can be achieved by reconnecting the components.  Thus, for example, a problem is fixed in the form of inactivity of the card.  But even if the CI-module for the TV is integrated correctly, the automatic broadcasting of channels does not always start.  In this case, you need to search for channels during which auto-scanning will be performed.  But it is advisable to carry out this operation in advance even before installing the adapter.  Even if the channels are not registered as decoded, the system will fix them. </p><h2>  Interface operation reviews </h2>

Reviews note the stability of signal reception, the ease of managing settings, and fairly high image characteristics in terms of color reproduction. </p><p>  At the same time, there are negative opinions about the operation of such systems.

    <p>  The development of technology in the field of television equipment is also oriented towards reducing the component base.  An example of the interface in question just confirms the effectiveness of the work of specialists in this field.  Samsung's modern digital TVs allow you to get rid of third-party equipment in this way and get by with compact and easy-to-use cards.  Another thing is that the technical execution of this technology is not always successful in terms of ergonomics.  In addition, there are dangers associated with the very fact of the intervention of inexperienced users in the technical stuffing of the hardware of the TV itself.  Nevertheless, this concept is actively developing and, as more and more optimized devices appear, it gets rid of technical and operational problems. </p>
