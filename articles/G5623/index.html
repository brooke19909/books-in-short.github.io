    <p>  Therefore, having made every effort and having invited leading experts, they erected a unique resort complex ‚ÄúChistye Prudy‚Äù (Adler) that meets all international standards.  The photo above shows how fantastically beautiful he has at night.  If they say about Adler that this is a city in the city of Sochi, then about the object under consideration we can say that this town is already in Adler itself.  It occupies an area of ‚Äã‚Äã420 hectares, which houses 120 hotel buildings, 19 cottages, about 50 establishments where you can eat or just eat (cafes, restaurants, snack bars, bars), parks, alleys with convenient shops, shops of various kinds ( souvenir, grocery, manufactured goods), fitness centers, playgrounds, spas.  Interested in?  Want to relax here?  Welcome! </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The Chistye Prudy Hotel (Adler) has the following address: 66 Staroobryadcheskaya Street, Sochi, Adler District, Imereti Lowland.  I must say that the Imereti Lowland is a unique natural monument, the only one in Russia where thousands of migratory birds, of which nearly 200 species, constantly nest or winter.  There are also several dozens of especially valuable plants and about 10 rare animal species.  Perhaps in the future the Imereti Lowland will become a reserve.  Unusually beautiful parks are laid out here, there are many ponds and small lakes.  Here in such a wonderful place to live for those who decide to spend their holidays in this hotel. </p><h2>  Location, how to get there </h2><p>  The location of the Chistye Prudy Hotel (Adler) is wonderful.  The Black Sea splashes on one side, and on the other two large ponds surrounded by an emerald green lawn and still small young trees.  A racing track was laid nearby, several parks were opened (Olympic, ornithological, botanical "Southern cultures", the famous Adventure Park), a temple of the image of the Savior Christ was built, there is a wonderful promenade with recreation areas.  All these facilities are within walking distance of the Chistye Prudy Hotel.  So, you can leisurely walk to the Olympic Park in just 10 minutes.  Nearby is the railway station of the same name. </p><p>  Getting to the Chistye Prudy Hotel (Adler) is very convenient from the local railway station.  You just need to transfer to the "Swallow" train (runs along the coast) and get off at the stop "Olympic Park".  From there to the hotel - walk about 20 minutes, but you can take a taxi or book a transfer.  In addition, from the railway station to the hotel there are buses and minibuses No. 57, 125 and 100. The route from Adler Airport is also easy.  You need to take the minibus number 135, get on it to the television center (called "New Century"), and then transfer to all the same buses No. 57, 125 or 100. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Chistye Prudy Adler" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/951723.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <p>  There are many dining options outside the hotel.  Here is the kind of information tourists give to those who come to rest in Adler (Chistye Prudy): a canteen with inexpensive prices is located near Checkpoint 1, but there are always lines.  You can dine for a family of 3-4 people for 600 rubles.  Vacationers praise the restaurant with a spectacular interior and pleasant atmosphere, ‚ÄúRoyal Hunt‚Äù.  The dishes here are very tasty, and the prices are reasonable.  They also prepare well at the Black Sea Restaurant, located on the waterfront.  Many advise you to visit the restaurant La Luna, located in the micro-district of <span>Sovkhoz Russia</span> (it is not far from the hotel).  Of course, everyone has different tastes.  But hungry, relaxing in the hotel "Clean Ponds", as if no one will remain. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The Black Sea coast is famous for its beaches, clean and gentle sea and excellent weather for almost the entire season.  Many vacationers who intend to spend a vacation in the institution we are considering are wondering if the Chistye Prudy (Adler) hotel has a beach.  We answer: there is, it is called "South Star".  Located, if you go from checkpoint 2, about 150 meters.  The beach is small in size, about 100 meters, but well-groomed.  Umbrella fungi are installed here, sun loungers are issued for the price of 200 rubles per day.  Rest on the city beach (from checkpoint 1 to 250 m) costs 100 rubles per day.  The soil on both beaches is medium-sized pebbles, so you need special rubber bathing sandals, which can be purchased at the local market or in one of the many shops.  The average price of such shoes is 200 rubles.  The entrance to the water on the beach is not quite gentle.  The second inconvenience is stones underfoot.  Third, sometimes there are many jellyfish in the sea.  But, as vacationers say, all these shortcomings are more than covered by a clean, warm and gentle sea.  The water temperature here in the summer months is +28 degrees, in May it is already +19 ... + 20 <sup></sup> , and in September-October it still keeps at +23 ... + 25 <sup></sup> . </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Adler Chistye Prudy" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/951721.jpg" width="534"></div>
