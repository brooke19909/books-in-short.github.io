He got his name at the location - on the banks of the Artek River in the tract of the same name.  The camp is located 12 km from the world famous southern coastal resort - the city of Yalta, in the urban-type village - Gurzuf. </p><p>  As you know, Artek is a camp of international importance.  It is the most famous children's health center, accepting 3,000 children a year and more than 3,500 children per shift in the summer and more than 1,500 children in the winter.  The duration of each shift is 21 days.  During this time, the guys are waiting for a real fascinating life.  A huge number of events, acquaintance and collaboration with celebrities, a complex to promote health and develop sports skills, the opportunity to try yourself in the chosen profession and much, much more.  There will be almost no free time, because Artek is a camp for active, purposeful, curious and erudite children. </p><p>  The vast territory (218 ha, 102 ha - parks) allows you to fully experience the climate and features of the Crimean peninsula.  Located on the Black Sea coast, "Artek" has its own coastline, the length of which is 7 km, beaches.  And the camp harbor is an international yacht marina where many famous films were shot. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Years passed, the structure of the camp changed, the territory expanded, and at the same time, the emergence of camps and squads, which they include.  At the moment, there are 10 camps in the wellness center that have their own infrastructure, traditions, educational programs and innovative technologies.  However, after the “global reboot” carried out in 2014, 9 of them were restored: “Azure”, “Amber”, “Crystal”, “Sea”, “River”, “Lake”, “Forest”, “Field” and “ Cypress. "  The last of which will be considered in more detail. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  In the children's camp "Artek" "Cypress" stands out especially.  It is unique and unusual in its own way.  His “biography” dates back to the time of Justinian I. Previously, there were summer cottages of famous personalities such as Princess Kavkasidze, doctor Naumov, Minister of the Provisional Military Government Guchkov, and homeowner Gurov.  Accordingly, these buildings are named after the former owners: “Tupolevskaya”, “Naumovskaya”, “Guboninskaya”, “Gurovskaya” and the cottage of Countess Kavkasidze. </p><p>  Also on the site of the modern camp was the sanatorium "Collective Farm Youth", which in 1945 became part of the modern Artek Center.  "Cypress" became the first post-war camp.  He opened his doors on July 7, 1945 (this date, as a rule, is considered the birthday of the camp).  Until 1954, "Cypress" took sick, severely weakened children.  Special medical rooms were equipped for them, where intensive treatment was carried out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="&quot;Artek&quot; Cypress squad" class="if" height="311" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62468/2034878.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  The territory and structure of the camp </h2><p>  In “Artek”, “Cypress” can be called a kind of island: a special place with its usual atmosphere in the shadow of huge cypress trees near the sea coast.  The camp is really "dotted" with a huge number of these trees, for which it got its name.  They give it a special charm: comfort, the ability to hide from unnecessary eyes.  The originality and antiquity of this camp, the park laid by the previous owners of the land, will not leave indifferent even the most sophisticated traveler.  Bright colors of numerous colors, greenery, fresh air - all this distinguishes and highlights the camp "Cypress" in the Artek MDC.  The proximity to the sea, the beach helps to relax, relax, and also improve the health of the children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MDC &quot;Artek&quot; camp &quot;Cypress&quot;" class="if" height="290" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62468/2034873.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Cypress in Artek has its own programs aimed at developing a child in all areas of life: from creativity and science to sports and ecology.  They allow children to try themselves in different fields, try on the role of a scientist, director, writer, etc.  One of the many programs offered by Cypress is presented below: </p><ul><li>  Program "Artek Media"; </li><li>  "Young ornithologists"; </li><li>  Educational workshop "Strategy of the future"; </li><li>  "Climbing NANO"; </li><li>  Programs of studios of children's creativity. </li></ul><h2>  Interesting facts and sights </h2><p>  One of the most interesting places of Artek is Ayu-Dag or Bear Mountain.  Firstly, it is a mountain of volcanic origin, located at an altitude of 577 m above sea level.  Her age is 160 million years.  It was formed by igneous rocks and is a unique archaeological site for scientists.  Ayu-Dag is also the natural border of the camp, protecting it from east winds and, accordingly, affecting the climate.  This mountain is inextricably linked with the guys themselves, because they often make trips there, conduct the "initiation rite" in Artek. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ayu-Dag Mountain" class="if" height="283" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62468/2034871.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Another attraction of "Cypress" in "Artek" is the cliff of Jenevez-Kaya.  It was on it that the remains of the Genoese fortress were preserved.  Previously, it performed a defensive function, in addition, it had an excellent location, since it opened a view of the entire chain of the Crimean Mountains, the Gurzuf Valley and the main road.  From the tunnel, punched in the same fortress, you can see the panorama of the entire Artek, Adalary, Bear Mountain and the bay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The cliff of Genevez-Kaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/62468/2034874.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Vacation and documents </h2><p>  Not everyone can get a ticket to Artek, because only the best go there.  To receive the coveted “ticket”, the child must register on the site, entering his achievements in the portfolio, after which his rating and the chances of acquiring a budget ticket will be set. </p><p>  To purchase a commercial permit, you must perform the same steps.  Since there are a lot of willing people, the sale is also based on the rating of children. </p><p>  A detailed list of documents required for children upon arrival at the Artek IDC can be found on the camp’s official website. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p><strong></strong>  Undoubtedly, the best children's center in Russia is Artek.  He confirmed this title many times.  There are no bad camps.  Especially after the reconstruction of 2014. </p><p>  Reviews about "Cypress" in "Artek" are a description of every second of joy and admiration.  The children were satisfied with the camp programs, the work of counselors, living conditions and territory.  They write that "Cypress" gave them many new friends, taught them never to give up and only go forward, make discoveries, value loyalty, improve, be brave, selfless, responsible and strong both spiritually and physically.  And they remembered their squad “Cypress” in Artek forever, keeping warm memories of it in their hearts.  Many of the guys claimed that they would like to return here, but already in the role of counselors, to pass on to the next generation of Artek residents a part of their knowledge, experience, kindness, to light a fire in them, and to increase the thirst for life. </p><p>  Parents also did not stand aside, saying that they were very happy that their children had visited this fabulous place among the mysterious and majestic cypress trees. </p>
