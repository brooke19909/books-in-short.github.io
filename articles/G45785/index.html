Beach hotels in Barcelona</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Barcelona is a major tourist destination in the Mediterranean.  The capital of Catalonia has all the amenities for a comfortable stay.  The infrastructure here is very developed.  Barcelona hotels, accommodation prices which depend on the level of service, are dispersed throughout the city.  You can settle in luxurious establishments or rent a room at a fairly affordable cost in a hotel complex.  Camping sites, hostels and apartments are also available.  The guides contain a map of Barcelona.  On it, tourists can find the addresses of the most popular institutions in the city.  Especially popular are the hotels of Barcelona by the sea.  In the warm season there are no empty rooms.  Therefore, you should book Barcelona hotels in advance.  On the map below, you can see the location of some of them. <img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelona hotels on a map" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479350.jpg" width="558"></p><h2>  General information about the city </h2><p>  Barcelona is a little different from Rome or Paris.  She only recently gained wide popularity.  This happened after the Olympics in 1992.  Since then, the <span>capital of Catalonia has</span> changed.  The best <span>beaches of Barcelona</span> invariably attract more and more tourists from year to year.  A lot of hotel complexes appeared in the city.  However, the owners of these institutions do not have time to cope with a large influx of visitors.  More often than not, in high season rooms are not enough.  Reservations must be made in advance.  This becomes a necessity if guests plan to stay at the establishment for the weekend.  In many hotels, these days, a system of discounts.  It should be said about the undoubted advantages that Barcelona has: the sea, the well-groomed coast, a large number of entertainment centers for active pastime. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hotel classification <strong> </strong></h2><p>  Hotel complexes are located in each district of the city.  However, most of them are concentrated in the <span>center of Barcelona,</span> where there are many popular places. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="beach hotels in Barcelona" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479321.jpg" width="486"></p><h2>  Expensive establishments </h2><p>  The best hotels in Barcelona are concentrated mainly near Plaza Catalunya, as well as Paseo de Gracia and La Rambla.  Many establishments of a high level of comfort are located in the Forum area.  All of the above areas of the city are next to each other.  If you stay at any local hotel, then the surrounding attractions and the best beaches of Barcelona will be within walking distance.  Not far from the Sants station is located no less popular urban place.  Here are mainly apartment hotels and four-star hotels.  Guests can rent not only a separate room, but also an entire apartment.  The Camp Nou district, where the legendary stadium is located, also has a similar specialization.  Local hotel complexes provide the highest level of service.  Those who prefer a luxurious stay most often stop here. </p><h2>  Budgetary institutions </h2><p>  In Barcelona there are many options for where you can stay for a reasonable fee.  Similar hotel complexes are mainly located in the Old Town.  Gothic Quarter establishments are also included in this category.  Signs for such hotels contain the following inscriptions: Hostal, Casa de Hu√©spedes and Pensi√≥n.  These hotel complexes are concentrated around the Royal Square.  Near the entrance, visitors will see a blue square.  The letters F, HsR, Hs and P are imprinted on it. These elements belong to the old classification.  They currently have no legal effect.  However, even now, these signs can tell guests a lot about the quality and price of institution services.  For example, a hotel that does not have a sign and is located in the port area, while being awarded only one "star" or the letter "P", most likely, is a furnished room where the corrupt "priestesses of love" often stop with their customers. <img itemprop="image" alt="the best beaches of Barcelona" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479322.jpg" width="486"></p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location Features </h2><p>  Barcelona is not a very big metropolis.  Even from the most remote hotel complex, using a taxi, you can get to any of its points quickly enough.  Many tourists prefer to walk.  These guests should settle in the Eixample or the Old Town.  In any case, such travelers should be accommodated in establishments located next to Gracia Boulevard.  Precautions should be observed.  You should not wander into Barrio Chino or stroll between the sea and Escudelers Street.  In reality, nothing bad happens here, but you should avoid these places at night. </p><h2>  Features of accommodation </h2><p>  There are many premium hotels in Barcelona.  Among them, a special category stands out: boutique and design hotels.  This is the most interesting class of establishments. </p><h2><img itemprop="image" alt="barcelona sea" class="if" height="206" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479323.jpg" width="486"></h2><h2>  Design Hotels </h2><p>  Institutions feature exquisite facilities.  All of them are tastefully and in a certain style.  For example, it may be a modern design.  There are also rooms made in the classical style of the 19th century.  Absolutely all hotels of this category are distinguished by the highest quality of service.  Guests of such establishments can not only relax with maximum comfort, but also truly enjoy the beauty of the premises. </p><p>  <em>List of the most famous design hotels:</em> </p><ol><li>  Villa Emilia. </li><li>  Neri H&amp;R, Hotel 1898. </li><li>  Catalonia Catedral. </li><li>  ABaC Restaurant Hotel Barcelona GL Monumento. </li><li>  Hotel Palace GL. </li><li>  Hotel Omm. </li><li>  Mandarin Oriental Barcelona. </li></ol><h2>  Boutique Hotels </h2><p>  These institutions are very similar to the above.  However, there are differences.  The main feature of these places is the unusual and original atmosphere.  The main emphasis is on design.  Search and luxury fade into the background.  For this reason, hotels in this category have 3 or 4 stars.  Most of them are concentrated in the city center.  All of them are fundamentally different from each other.  Each institution has its own unique features. </p><p><img itemprop="image" alt="Barcelona hotels by the sea" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479324.jpg" width="452"></p><p>  <em>List of the most famous boutique hotels:</em> </p><ol><li>  Hotel Silken Diagonal Barcelona. </li><li>  Granados 83. </li><li>  Duquesa de Cardona. </li><li>  987 Barcelona Hotel. </li><li>  Hotel Record. </li><li>  Ayre Hotel Caspe. </li></ol><h2>  Bed &amp; breakfast </h2><p>  Hotels of this category, as well as hostels, are a more budget option for accommodation.  A place in such institutions, as a rule, costs no more than 20 euros.  The rooms are more expensive.  In some hotels, the price for them can go up to 35 euros.  Most hostels equipped with private rooms can well compete with two-star hotels in the quality of the service provided.  In addition, many of them are located in the city center.  This allows guests to significantly reduce <span>transportation costs.</span>  In total there are about two hundred similar institutions of various categories. </p><h2>  Hostels </h2><p>  Establishments of this category are divided into official and private.

Private establishments accommodate travelers who travel to Timbuktu via Barcelona. </p><h2>  Apartments </h2><p><img itemprop="image" alt="the best hotels of Barcelona" class="if" height="308" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/479325.jpg" width="550"></p><p>  These establishments are a great alternative to hotels.

As a rule, they are located in nature.  Travelers can enjoy the fresh air.  The noise of a crowded city will not bother them.  However, in this case, the path to the sights will not be close. </p><h2>  Main advantages </h2><p>  One of the most popular resorts in Spain today is considered to be Barcelona.
