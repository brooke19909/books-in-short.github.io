Do not trust the indicated hours of operation too much, this parameter depends on too many factors to be calculated up to a minute. </li><li>  <em>Version of the operating system.</em>  Not only the gadget interface should change, but also the OS, today it should be at least 4.3, 4.4 </li></ol><h2>  What kind of memory should a tablet have </h2><p>  To identify the best tablet on Android, you need to pay special attention to its memory.  Given that Android is an OS, which allows you to easily download programs using the market or other sources, this option is of great importance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  It is necessary to pay attention to: </p><ol><li>  <em>RAM</em>  More precisely, its size, the minimum value should not be lower than 1 GB.  With less RAM, the tablet‚Äôs performance is unlikely to please. </li><li>  <em>The presence of a slot for an SD card.</em>  A tablet computer without the ability to connect additional memory does not deserve attention. </li></ol><h2>  CPU Recommendations </h2><p>  As a rule, a tablet is not purchased for production needs.  More often the reason for the purchase is entertainment and leisure activities.  Therefore, the best tablet on Android should have an excellent processor so that there are no problems with various games and applications stuffed with graphics. </p><p>  So, a good engine should have: </p><ol><li>  Four cores, then it will cope with all applications, and fans of modern computer games should choose eight-core models in general. </li><li>  Clock frequency more than 1 GHz.  Ideally, if it is in the range of 1.8-2.5 GHz. </li></ol><p>  Having studied all the characteristics, it is not at all difficult to choose the best android (tablet) for yourself. </p><h2>  What else will facilitate the search </h2><p>  The best advisor in choosing gadgets can be experience.

    <p>  It is known that the minimum screen diagonal of 7 inches is not enough to fully enjoy games or movies, for these purposes it is better to choose gadgets with a screen of 9.7 inches or more.  And for clarity, a high resolution is required.  Also of particular note is the camera.  Two megapixels is enough for video communication, but you can get high-quality photos only with a 5-megapixel camera and higher. </p><p>  Before buying, it will not be superfluous to read customer reviews about the model you like. </p><h2>  Which operating system is better </h2><p>  Along with Android <span>tablet computers,</span> sellers are rushing to offer Windows devices.  Which tablet is better - "Android" or "Windows"? </p><p>  The first and very important criterion for buyers when buying any device is price.  Android wins here, not everyone decides to overpay for a new system. </p><p>  "Windows" have proven themselves in smartphones, but have not yet achieved the same reputation in the work of tablets.  The proven Android is still better.  Windows is significantly behind in terms of interface and functionality. </p><p>  "Android" is being improved with each new version.  In terms of touch capabilities, Windows does not meet specified standards, and the main drawback is the incompatibility of this OS with the ARM architecture common in tablets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Speaking about whether to purchase a tablet on Windows or Android (which is better to choose), it is worth noting the uselessness of Intel processors in tablet PCs.  Therefore, to date, the arguments in favor of Android more. </p><p>  Currently, the following 10 best Android tablets can be distinguished. </p><h2>  <span>HTC Nexus 9</span> 32Gb Wi-Fi </h2><p>  This tablet boasts not only a powerful 4-core processor, but also a large memory of 32 GB.  The medium-sized screen (8.9 inches) has a resolution of 2048 * 1539 plus a 8 megapixel camera. </p>
