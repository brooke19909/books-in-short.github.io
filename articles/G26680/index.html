Such autumnal natural crafts serve for a long time, are durable and practical.  The simplest thing you can do out of sticks is a vase.  Take the jar from under the animal feed (or something like that), with the help of glue, fix the broken sticks around its perimeter.  Their height should be the same and equal to the height of the can.  After that, tie your creation with a rope or ribbon.
