However, their list is not complete without another important structure.  <span>The description of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky,</span> with a detailed explanation of what kind of folk heroes they are and what they became famous for, is included in all tourist brochures and city guides.  It is understandable.  After all, the majestic sculptural composition, cast from copper and brass, has been rising near the Kremlin for almost two centuries.  And it is already impossible to imagine the heart of Moscow without its heroic defenders, as if to protect the peace and tranquility of citizens by the very history set here for centuries.  And the description of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky will be incomprehensible without an excursion in times long past, in the era of the Time of Troubles.

Heroes are representatives of the militia <span>Kuzma Minin</span> and Dmitry Pozharsky.  The first one stands at full height, energetically throwing his hand back, pointing in this inviting gesture to Moscow, which must be defended from the Polish invaders.  He gives his brother-in-arms a sword so that he, as a commander, leads the militia.  The base of the monument is decorated with bas-reliefs.

    <h2>  Characterization of images </h2><p>  The description of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky suggests that the figure of Minin attracts attention in the first place.  It forms the semantic center of the monument.  With his famous gesture Kuzma calls the whole people - not only contemporaries, but also future generations - to defend the Fatherland from any encroachment on its independence. </p>

    <p>  The proud face reminds with the correct expressive features portraits of the heroes of antiquity.  But the beard and the hair trimmed with a ‚Äúbrace‚Äù indicate a clearly Russian, common folk origin of the hero.  His shirt, on the one hand, is clearly a peasant braid.  At the same time, it is associated with the Greek tunic.  Thus, the description of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky is built on the original Russian and ancient traditions.  This further magnifies the feat of folk heroes.  It is characteristic that it was a commoner, a posadsky man who was chosen by the sculptor for the basis of the composition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="author of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/411453.jpg" width="496"></div>  A powerful torso, a wide step - everything is full of strength, energy, inspiration, confidence in the rightness of the cause, in the name of which the hero rose to fight.  A monument to Minin and Pozharsky was erected, and the second character of the composition is no less important.  Prince Dmitry Mikhailovich is wounded, but Minin‚Äôs appeal does not leave him indifferent.  Pozharsky rises from the bed, clutching his sword with one hand, leaning on his shield with the other.  His gestures are also energetic, the will and determination are felt in the hands.  And the image of the Savior on the shield affirms the holiness of the heroism of the defenders of Moscow and Russia.  The sword in sculpture is not only a weapon, but also a symbol of military prowess, the unity of the aspirations and thoughts of the characters, the awakening of the consciousness of the people at the time of trouble and war.

He decorated the base of his work with two allegorical bas-reliefs.  Litseva talks about how Minin collects donations for the people's army.  The author depicted the mournful and majestic figures of women in kokoshniks - peasant women and young ladies who give their values ‚Äã‚Äãto the needs of the troops.  Their kneeling silhouettes symbolize the sanctity of the act.  Men's figures reinforce the impression.  This is the father who gives the army of two sons.  This plot was not accidentally introduced by Martos.  The monument to Minin and Pozharsky glorifies yet another feat of Russian weapons - the Patriotic War of 1812.  In the army of Kutuzov, one of the sculptor's sons fought and died.  Representing the scene of parental blessing, the author of the monument emphasizes the spiritual connection and the <span>continuity of generations, the</span> glorious traditions of the feat.  The top bas-relief is decorated with a thank you inscription. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sculptor of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky" class="if" height="209" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/411458.jpg" width="472"></div>

    <h2>  Second bas-relief </h2><p>  The sculptor of the monument to Minin and Pozharsky devoted the second bas-relief to battle scenes.  He depicted episodes of the battles of the Russian army led by the prince, whose horse tramples the hooves of Polish soldiers.  They scatter in panic and look back at the courageous, focused and stern faces of the militias.  This shows the liberation of Moscow.  This bas-relief, like the previous one, is full of dynamics, expressiveness and vitality.  But, emphasizing the national basis of the feat of the Russians, Martos nevertheless places on the front side scenes of collection of donations. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bas-relief of the monument" class="if" height="270" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7454/411455.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Historical basis </h2><p>  And now a few words about what a monument to Minin and Pozharsky was erected.  Moscow began in the distant XVII century.  The troubled times, as they were nicknamed in the history of Russia.  After the death of Ivan the Terrible and Boris Godunov, the country, weakened by boyar intrigues for the throne and power, was a tidbit for enemies: the Commonwealth, Swedes and Germans.  And although their first invasion, led by False Dmitry, ended in defeat, peace and quiet did not come to Russian soil.  The year 1610 was a turning point in this struggle.  When the gates of Moscow were opened before the Poles during the ‚Äúseven-boyars‚Äù and an agreement was signed to call Vladislav Sigismundovich to the kingdom, Minin and Pozharsky rallied the people, organized a militia and saved the Fatherland.  The first raised funds for the Russian army, the second led the Russian people, led the fight.  About 3 years of intense war culminated in the victory of Russian weapons.  Russia was saved. </p><h2>  Monument History </h2><p>  The idea to embody in sculpture the memory of the liberation of Russia from the Polish invasion belongs to the members of the Free Society of lovers of literature, science and art.  In 1803, they organized a collection of donations for the monument.  Initially, they thought to install the sculpture in Nizhny Novgorod - in the homeland of the militia.  Emperor Alexander approved the idea and issued a decree in every way to facilitate the development of projects.  Among the contestants exhibiting their versions of the monument, Martos was the undisputed winner.  Given the enormous ideological and patriotic importance of the project, the Highest Command decided to establish the composition in Moscow, and in the Lower - an obelisk of marble.  After winning the war of 1812, the significance of the project grew even more.  At the opening of the monument, a solemn parade of troops was held.  Since then, he adorns Moscow - the first monument in Russia in honor of the liberating people! </p>
