    <p>  <span>Currently, the funds of the Kirov Local History Museum in Kirov contain more than a quarter of a million exhibits.</span> </p><p>  <span>This is a rich archaeological collection, which is based on excavations conducted in the Kirov region.</span>  <span>The oldest of them date back to the seventh millennium BC.</span>  <span>On them you can trace the entire history of this region.</span> </p><p>  <span>Here is one of the largest numismatic collections located in museums.</span>  <span>It contains about 45 thousand genuine coins.</span>  <span>Its basis is made up of samples that were in circulation in Ancient Greece, Ancient Russia.</span>  <span>The collection of banknotes of modern Russia is presented in detail.</span> </p><p>  <span>The Kirov Museum is proud of its metal collection.</span>  <span>Here are samovars, and bells of local masters, and cast-iron products of wizards of the Kholunitsky factories, <span>household utensils,</span> lighting tools and much more.</span> </p><h2>  Weapon collection </h2><p>  Of great interest to visitors is always a collection of weapons.  There are a large number of items that belong to the XIV-XV centuries.  For example, especially valuable exhibits are squeaks and broadswords. </p><p>  The cold steel and firearms of the Great Patriotic War are presented in detail.  One of the most valuable exhibits is a sniper rifle, which belonged personally to the hero of Russia Nikolai Galushkin, a native of these places. </p><p>  The history of national costumes can be traced to the textile collection exhibition.  On the territory of the Kirov region originally a large number of peoples lived.  Therefore, here you can find samples of outfits of the Russian, Mari, Tatar, Udmurt and Komi peoples.  There is ornamental sewing, lace and embroidery. </p><p>  The museum has an extensive collection of paintings.  Starting from the icons of the XVII century, ending with the Soviet avant-garde masters of the beginning of the 20th century. </p><p>  The pride of the museum is the work of Vyatka icon painters, among which there is an icon called "Rev. <span>Tryphon of Vyatka</span> before the Mother of God."  There are also sketches of Vasnetsov, Mezentsev, Charushin, Isupov and Vershigorova. </p><p>  The works of military artists of the revolutionary period are interesting.  For example, "The establishment of Soviet power in Vyatka." </p><p>  In 1969, the skeleton of a short-bison bison appeared in the museum.  This is one of the best-preserved skeletons of this extinct animal, presented in Russia for review in the public domain.  Since the 1920s, the museum has gathered an entomological collection. </p>
