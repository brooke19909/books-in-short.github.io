In summer, the days are mostly sunny, there is not much rain, but the sea can storm for several days.  And then on the beaches a black flag is hung. </p><h2>  How to get to Bulgaria? </h2><p>  Firstly, all Russians and citizens of the CIS countries who want to visit this country need to apply for visas.

It is by far the most popular among all recreation areas belonging to the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria.  The resort stretches for several kilometers between Varna and Kavarna.  The first tourist sites appeared here in the middle of the 20th century.  Since then, the infrastructure in the area has developed with incredible intensity.  Hotel complexes, restaurants and bars, cabarets, clubs, discos and other entertainment facilities opened with incredible speed.  Due to the proximity of mineral springs, balneological health resorts were built in the wooded area.  After leaving the socialist camp, the development of the resort went in a different direction.  For several years, hotels belonging to the global brand were opened, numerous water parks, attractions, etc. appeared. In short, the resort began to live a completely new life.  For incredible cleanliness and grooming, for high service, Golden Sands Beach was awarded the EU Blue Flag.  This achievement attracted tourists from capitalist Europe, especially the northern parts.  From a topographic point of view, Golden Sands looks like a simple, even, straight and wide strip of sand, along which squares of hotels and resorts are located not far from each other.  One among them is Detelina Park Hotel 3 *.  It is located on the border of yellow and green lines.  Behind the hotel-beach zone begins a wide strip of the natural park. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bulgaria, Detelina Park Hotel 3 *," class="if" height="409" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14479/1550057.jpg" width="575"></div>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  The hotel has no private beach.  The nearest city is 400-600 meters away.  Locals come here on weekends, so if you want to have time to take a deck chair and an umbrella, you need to hurry.

There are both positive and negative.  What is the reason for this?  Well, firstly, do not forget that this is just a 3-star budget hotel - do not demand from it the service inherent in luxury hotels.  The main complaints are that cleaning and linen change in the rooms is very rare.  In the bathrooms it smells bad, the Internet catches badly, and the TV remote does not always work.  In addition, some Russians feel the hostility of the hotel staff, attributing this to Russophobia.  Although there are tourists who, on the contrary, talk about the hospitality and hospitality of the local population. </p>
