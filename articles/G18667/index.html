    <p>  The history of the development by people of this area on <span>the Crimean coast</span> dates back to the 9-10th centuries, but one cannot but note the fact that these data were not confirmed by any archaeological excavations. </p><p>  It is reliably known that in the 15th century this settlement was in the possession of the Genoese, and later passed to the Ottoman Empire.  In the 18th century, the settlement of Kuru-Uzen belonged to the <span>Crimean Khanate.</span>  And only in 1883 he was annexed to Russia. </p><p>  History books indicate that Soviet power was established in Crimea in January 1921.  At the same time, the volost system was also abolished. </p><p>  In 1924, Kuru-Uzen was annexed to the Yalta region, and in 1930 to the Alushta Tatar national region.  The liberation from the fascist invaders during the Great Patriotic War took place in 1944.  <span>Crimean Tatars</span> living in this area were deported to Central Asia, and collective farmers from the Krasnodar Territory were resettled in the village of Kuru-Uzen.  In August 1945, the village was renamed Solnechnogorsk (Crimea).  A map of the peninsula will help those who are curious immediately determine the exact location. </p><h2>  Section 3.

    <p>  Highlands, small pebble and gray-red sandy beaches - this part of the Crimean coast is very similar to what we are used to seeing in documentaries or feature films dedicated to the perfect vacation on the sea coast. </p><p>  Natural conditions provided a wide variety of plants in these places.  In general, in Crimea there are almost 2.4 thousand species of plants!  Local authorities pay much attention to protecting the amazing flora - 118 species of plants are under the control of the law. </p><p>  By the way, not everyone knows that tourists should be careful about warning about the high degree of danger of certain types of vegetation growing in Crimea. </p><p>  Unless you are sure that the plant is safe, inhaling, for example, the scent of evergreen magnolia flowers or tasting yew berries can create serious health problems. </p><p>  The climate in these places is subtropical Mediterranean.  In July, which is the hottest, the average temperature is + 24 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The coldest in January is when the average temperature is + 2.6 ¬∞ C.  Precipitation in this area is relatively small. </p><p>  Humidity throughout the year - no more than 72%.  But there is really a lot of sun here - more than 2.2 thousand hours a year. </p><p>  Swimming is recommended starting in May, during the summer and early fall - until October.  In spring, the water off the coast in the Solnechnogorsk region is relatively cool, and in autumn it remains more comfortable than in other places on the Crimean coast. </p><h2>  Section 5.

    <p>  In this area, you don‚Äôt have to worry about running out of space on the beach.  Small pebbles are located underfoot on a strip whose length is about 1 km and a width of 30 m. Near the village there is another beach on which there are usually few people. </p><p>  Entrance to the beaches is free.  The sea, according to tourists, is clean.  There are no breakwaters.  At a depth of more than 3 meters in the sea there are many stone grottoes.  There are crabs, mussels, raps and many fish. </p><h2>  Section 6.

Here you can listen to a lecture by a professional lecturer and learn a lot of interesting information about the process of creating grape wine. </p><p>  Well, and, undoubtedly, rest in Solnechnogorsk (Crimea) can not even be imagined without lazy lying on the beach and swimming in clear water. </p><p>  In addition, excellent impressions can be supplemented if you go by boat to the sea in Sevastopol, Yalta, Alupka or Alushta. </p><p>  Mobile bureaus offer vacationers various excursions - in addition to sea trips, you can go horseback riding, travel by bus and jeeps. </p><h2>  Section 8.

    <p>  8 km from Solnechnogorsk is Jur-Jur waterfall.  Water in this natural spring falls from a height of 15 m. Near it you can enjoy the freshness and listen to the powerful rumble of falling water. </p><p>  If you climb higher into the mountains, to a height of 2 km, then you should visit the state wildlife sanctuary in the Hapkhal gorge (entrance is paid).  There are many water cascades.  It is very interesting to look at the unusual trees growing in the reserve and, of course, take a picture on their background. </p><p>  A small waterfall is located between the village of Malorechenskoye and Solnechnogorsk.  Below this waterfall is a <span>nudist beach,</span> and at the entrance to Malorechenskoye you can admire a bizarre "cheese" rock.  It got its name because of its unusual appearance - it was so strongly influenced by natural factors. </p><p>  In Malorechensk there is a Temple lighthouse, which was erected in memory of those people who died in the water element.  The temple is visible from afar and, undoubtedly, is the pearl of the Crimean coast.  Tourists are eager to get acquainted with this famous building with great interest. </p><p>  If you drive from Alushta 16 km to Cape Soter and get on a dirt road to a small village that looks like a country one, you can specify the locals and go to the remarkable geological formations that have a mushroom shape.  In Ukraine, such a miracle occurs only on the Crimean peninsula.  Solnechnogorsk is located quite close to this place. </p><p>  Small gorges, Geyser waterfall, stream, Dzhurla tract - all this is really worth a visit, as it will allow you to feel the nature and enjoy the wonderful scenery and atmosphere. </p>
