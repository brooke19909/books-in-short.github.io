It is insanely convenient to always keep a certain amount at hand for various payments via the Internet.  Some sites work exclusively with this type of wallet, and in this case you no longer have to choose.  In addition, freelance people often also receive their fees through this payment system.  Their work is well coordinated, errors in the system are minimal, and the quality of transaction execution is at a decent level.  There are many reasons to use Kiwi.  But here there are some <span>unforeseen circumstances.</span>  What to do if money does not come to Qiwi?  Consider this issue below. </p>

    <h2>  Top-up wallet via terminal </h2><p>  Kiwi terminals are widely distributed in all cities of our country.  The interface they have is quite simple in all respects, the receipt of funds is fast.  Therefore, the use of terminals is quite common.  Moreover, no cards and other things are required.  When replenishing "Qiwi" through the terminal, the user must remember one effective rule.  If the money did not come to the Qiwi wallet, it will help you find the lost payment.  Be sure to keep the receipt of the transaction until the moment you see the funds in the account!  If money did not come to Qiwi through the terminal, you can find all the necessary information on the check, namely: transaction number, date and time, wallet number, address and number of the payment terminal itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sometimes delays occur due to network congestion.  If money does not come to Qiwi, just wait a few hours.  However, the terminal itself may be faulty.  In this case, look in the "Information" window, rewrite the information about the owner, address and number of the device.  For this information, contact the support service whose telephone number you will find there.  Next, inform that the money did not come to Qiwi through the terminal located at a specific address. </p>

    <h2>  Personal Area </h2><p>  Make sure that the payment is received, but the money did not come to the Qiwi wallet due to network load or for other technical reasons, but it will be reached in the near future by using your personal account on the payment system website.  You must go to the "Help" section.  Next, find the item "Search payment".  At this moment, information from the check is useful to you.  Enter it in the request fields, and then the system will show you the payment status.  If the payment was not found, call the support service for round-the-clock toll-free numbers. </p>

    <h2>  Calls to support operators </h2><p>  If you have lost, not saved or not received a receipt of payment through the terminal at all, then the only way to find the payment is the help desk of the payment system.  In the terminal or on the official website, find the phone number of the support service, contact the operator and state the essence of your problem.  To search for a payment, you need the following data: the number of your personal wallet in the system to which funds were credited, the date and time of crediting, the total amount of the payment, the address of the terminal through which you made the payment, and the number of this terminal.  You can find the latter in the information section in the device itself.  Having accepted all the available information from you, the operator will ask you to wait a few minutes and will search for your transaction.  In the vast majority of cases, when contacting the customer support service, money is found and transferred to a wallet. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Contact form on the service website </h2><p>  Communication with the support service is not always convenient for the client.  For such a case, there is a special form for writing to specialists.  On the Kiwi website, in the "Help" section, select the "Feedback" item.  Enter your data in the fields of the proposed request form and send it to the moderator for consideration.  This method of treatment requires a lot of time.  The answer may come within a few days from the date of treatment.  And therefore urgent issues through writing are better not to try to solve, for this there are telephone operators. </p>

    <h2>  Account Intermediaries </h2><p>  In addition to the official methods of replenishment directly through the website and terminals of the payment system, there is the possibility of interacting with the wallet through various intermediaries.  In this case, you must first contact the help desk of a third-party organization through which you acted.  Perhaps the payment did not reach directly to the final service.  Why money does not come to Qiwi, you have to deal with an intermediary. </p><p>  The role of such intermediaries can be various banks that carry out money transfers, terminals of third-party payment systems, online money transfer services.  Also, they often use withdrawals to such wallets as Qiwi, freelancers working on free Internet exchanges through which withdrawals are made. </p><p>  In all of these cases, you should initially contact the reseller support service.  Perhaps the transaction has already been created, but the system database is still not completed.  Upon your appeal, they will conduct it, and you will receive your money. </p><h2>  Rules to help protect yourself </h2><p>  In order to minimize risks and not to ask further questions about why money did not come to Qiwi, what to do, it is necessary to observe a few golden rules.  The first of them has already been announced above: always keep a receipt of payment until funds are received in your personal wallet.  Until you saw the received money, the check is in an accessible place.  Its absence creates additional difficulties in identifying a payment.  If you transferred money to your wallet online, print the receipt attached to the file or sent by e-mail.  In a pinch, take a screenshot of the transaction. </p><p>  The second golden rule is to keep your work computer clean and safe.  Check it regularly for a variety of viruses and update anti-virus databases.  In the network, cases of theft of passwords and filling forms from stationary and mobile devices with malicious programs are quite common.  If the support service does not see your payment, it is quite possible that money does not come to Qiwi precisely because of viruses. </p><p>  The third rule also applies to the Internet and electronics.  Follow the status and rating of the site through which you conduct the operation.  Read the title carefully.  Fraudsters create double sites of well-known systems in order to steal money and information. </p>
