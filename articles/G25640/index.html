Yes, we are talking about <span>Watch smart watches that</span> managed to make a mark in the several months of their presence on the market. </p><p>  For most users, this gadget is something new and unusual, because, according to sales statistics of other similar devices, buyers are not too seduced by smart watches, bracelets and other similar products.  Perhaps this is just a matter of habit, and in a few years, a watch with a smartphone stuffing will become an integral attribute of our daily life.  An alternative point of view is that Apple tried to release a new product by creating artificial noise around it. </p><p>  Be that as it may, in this article we will try to figure out what this gadget is.  Here, both customer reviews and the general technical specifications of the device will be posted both about the Apple Watch.  And readers of the article, in this way, will be able to independently determine how they see the new Watch. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple watch reviews" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/834084.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The general concept of smart watches </h2><p>  Let's start with how this device was implemented.  Traditionally for Apple, he was represented by Tim Cook - the head of the company - at a general conference.  The device was shown in action, enumerated its advantages and emphasized that the Apple Watch will show customers what kind of model this class can be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  That is, in the words of the representative of Apple, information really says that the company intends to bring smart watches to a new level of popularity, to make them a sold accessory and a gadget that is in demand in every person‚Äôs life.  In this, one can read the understanding that previous attempts to release such a device, which were undertaken by Samsung and other representatives of the electronics market, can be called not entirely successful.  Indeed, not many people use smart watches right now, and the Apple Watch remains the brightest representative of products in this segment, the characteristics of which we will present in the article. </p><p>  Therefore, obviously, the "apple" corporation seriously intends to restore the reputation of smart watches in the eyes of the buyer and make this device a kind of must-have. </p><h2>  Housing </h2>

In the meantime, we‚Äôll decide what they‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúpalm off‚Äù us under the guise of a revolutionary, high-tech product in a beautiful wrapper.  Let's start, of course, with the case, which is extremely important for any device. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  First of all, we emphasize its water resistance.  Watches <span>Apple Watch</span> (reviews confirm this) are designed in such a way as to prevent moisture from entering the device.  This is normal, taking into account the peculiarities of using the device and its possible contact with water.  Here, in general, there is nothing surprising - it‚Äôs right when the watch is protected from water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the body of the device is made of different metals, depending on its model.  For example, Apple Watch Sport (reviews of which go as the lightest gadget of the entire line of models) is made of aluminum.  Due to this, the watch is not afraid of scratches and bumps;  they are lightweight and look quite stylish. </p><h2>  Device screen </h2><p>  Apple Watch <span>(</span> we will give <span>technical specifications</span> below) is equipped with a <span>touch screen.</span>  It is quite sensitive to touch, because it reacts not only to touch, but also to the force of pressure.  This is very useful when working with some applications. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Specifications" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/834087.jpg" width="600"></div>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Since a watch is a thing that must be protected from any factors, it is not surprising that the screen here is covered with protective glass of various types (depending on the model of the watch).  This is either sapphire Sapphire Glass or Ion-X Glass.  It, as you can guess, is also not subject to scratches and scuffs, so you should not worry about its quality and its service life. </p><p>  Since, as noted, the screen of the Apple Watch (in Russia and around the world) is touch-sensitive, it has special protection against accidental touches.  We are talking about locking the display, which is removed automatically if a person raises his hand sharply.  The developers implemented this function precisely in order to be able to check the time without delay. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Also worth mentioning is a feature such as geolocation of the gadget (working with maps).  As you might guess, it is inconvenient for a person to view the map on their own using the touch screen.  Therefore, Apple provided for the presence of a special wheel with which you can scale the card so that all the necessary information is visible. </p><h2>  Clasps and straps </h2><p>  Finally, we mention one more feature of this watch.  It touches the strap and buckles of the Apple Watch.  Reviews show that for many people, an unreliable strap is a serious problem when wearing a watch.  Apparently, Apple also took this threat seriously.  Therefore, the clasp here was made of solid metal, it looks quite impressive, and it functions "on the top five."  As for the strap itself, it is made of rubber or metal - depending on the model of the device.  Thus, firstly, it makes it possible to talk about the long life of the watch, about its high performance.  Secondly, the strap is another way to personalize the device, to make it unique. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Apple Watch Specifications" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/834088.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The lineup </h2><p>  By the way, do not forget about individualization.  This is another strength of the Apple Watch.  Reviews indicate that there are a huge number of different models of this brand.  They all differ in color, design and features.  In particular, if there are only three versions - just Watch, the Apple Watch Sport and Watch Edition, then there are several dozen color solutions (ultimately) with them.  This is good, because it allows you to choose a model that will ideally satisfy all your wishes. </p><p>  For even more variety, Apple has released two versions of watches with different displays (we are talking about 38- and 42-mm screens).  Thanks to this, even more people can like smart watches. </p><h2>  Version Comparison </h2>

So, just the Watch version has an aluminum case and a <span>sapphire crystal</span> display <span>.</span>  It has several colors and types of straps.  Another model is Watch Sport.  This watch, as can already be judged by its name, is adapted for playing sports due to its lightness (weight reduced by 20 percent compared to the basic version) and strength (the screen of the device is covered with another glass - Ion-X brand).  Finally, the third version is the most luxurious of the ones presented above and, due to this, allows you to position a smart watch as a "toy" for wealthy people.  But the thing is that they are made of yellow or pink gold and cost up to 27 thousand dollars per copy.

    <h2>  Key features </h2><p>  You ask: ‚ÄúWhat can this watch do?  What are the features of the Apple Watch? ‚Äù  We answer: this is a universal electronic device operating on the basis of the Apple Watch OS.  By its logic, the latter is similar to the operating system of modern smartphones - you can install add-ons in it in the form of various applications.  Thus, again, you can expand the capabilities of smart watches. </p><p>  In particular, in addition to showing the time and the map, the Apple Watch can determine the rhythm of the heartbeat and breathing rate, air condition, serve as a walkie-talkie for connecting with the iPhone, connect to the Internet, work with many information applications (for example, to book a ticket, search for a bus, etc.) )  Thus, we can say that the functionality of the Apple <span>Watch (reviews</span> can confirm this) is similar to what a smartphone can do. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="watch apple watch reviews" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29714/834090.jpg" width="600"></div>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <p></p>
    <h2>  Owner Health </h2><p>  Particular attention is paid to health monitoring.  As already mentioned, a watch can calculate the <span>rhythm of a</span> person‚Äôs <span>heart</span> and breathing, determine the pressure.  With these features, Apple Watch, the characteristics of which allow the ability to download sports applications such as Nike Run, can become an indispensable assistant in training.  With them, you can monitor your health even more carefully, determining well-being and adjusting the pace of classes.  And this is the effective development of your body and the promotion of health. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  If we talk about the price of this device, then this is rather its drawback than an advantage.  Even for American buyers, according to reviews, watches from Apple are quite an expensive product.  Buying a bracelet that can track the rhythm of your heart in training for almost $ 350 is not a very worthwhile action, while your iPhone can easily handle other tasks. </p><p>  In general, the spread in prices is as follows: the cost of Sport starts at $ 349;  simple Apple Watch (the technical characteristics of which are not much different) - from 549 dollars;  and luxury Watch Edition - from 10 thousand dollars.  The prices shown are valid when buying from the official website of the company.  Of course, this is true for the United States and other developed English-speaking countries. </p><p>  If we talk about how much the Apple Watch costs in Russia, then Sport will cost at least 30 thousand rubles, the regular version - 60 thousand, and Edition - 1.2 million rubles.  As you can see, the cost is slightly higher than with a simple conversion rate. </p><h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  If you look at the recommendations of those who have already purchased Watch from Apple, the most common opinion is that the device is offered at an overpriced price.  Yes, the functions of the Apple Watch (tracking the performance of the owner‚Äôs body, the ability to use applications, a stylish design and so on) are useful for buyers.  But the high cost makes such a gadget an overly expensive toy, because for the amount of 2-3 times less you can buy smart watches from competitors. </p><p>  Other negative aspects of using the Watch are its low battery life (the battery lasts about a day, then you need to use <span>wireless charging</span> to recharge it) and attachment to the iPhone (the watch performs most of its functions after synchronization with the phone).  In addition, there is no Russian-language menu. </p>
