The same applies to air conditioners.  Their internal parts are absorbed by a thick layer of dust, because of this, the equipment can overheat, work worse and even fail.  For this reason, timely cleaning is required.  And you can well do without the help of a specialist.  The implementation of such work is available to anyone who is at least a little versed in technology. </p><h2>  The need to clean the air conditioner </h2>

    <p>  Do-it-yourself <span>air conditioning</span> cleaning is quite simple and can be done in a short time.  However, many home masters are wondering whether it is worth making such manipulations.  Specialists point out the necessity of carrying out these works, however, certain rules must be followed in order for the equipment to subsequently work properly.  The only difficulty that people who clean can run into is disassembling the equipment.  If the described works are not done in a timely manner, this can lead to deterioration of sanitary conditions in the room where the device is located, among other things, an unpleasant odor may appear due to the development of bacteria inside the air conditioner.  Dust can cause a decrease in the quality of the system, air cooling will not occur so intensively.  Efficiency due to a layer of dust will be reduced.  You can determine the frequency of such work, it will depend on the intensity of the load on the device.  Experts advise cleaning once every 6 months, as for household appliances.  If we are talking about the office model, then these manipulations are performed every three months.  If the system operates in a restaurant, club or any other public place, then cleaning should be done once a month. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Work on cleaning the indoor unit </h2>

    <p>  If you will clean the air conditioner with your own hands, it is important not to forget about the indoor unit.  There is an air filter, which is most often made in the form of a drum or rectangle.  In order to remove this element, in most cases, just remove the cover.  It must be remembered that the air conditioner must be de-energized.  After the cover is removed, the <span>protective net</span> is removed <span>.</span>  The latter is intended to protect the filter from damage.  In the next step, you can proceed to dismantle the air filter.  It is recommended to rinse it under running water.  Using a vacuum cleaner, you need to blow, while the body itself is immersed in a basin with water.  Do-it-yourself air conditioning cleaning involves drying the filter under natural conditions.  This is due to the fact that this component of the device contains paper elements that will deform if exposed to hot air.  About 8 cleanings can take place before the change of this part.  During operation, the throughput will be reduced, the structure will be violated, which will negatively affect the operation of the device.  The next step will be to work with a heat exchanger, which is made in the form of pipes, the last is moving the refrigerant.  Among other things, flows through it that occur with a functioning fan.  When handling in which a heat exchanger is involved, work should be done with extreme caution.  This is necessary in order to exclude damage to internal parts.  It is necessary to use a vacuum cleaner and brushes that have a long pile.  This will eliminate all the dust that has accumulated inside.  Do-it-yourself air conditioning can be cleaned without professional help.  However, if you notice rust on the heat exchanger, then you will not be able to remove it yourself, this entails the need to call a specialist.  Help will be needed in order to adjust the level of freon, the wizard will help to analyze how well the external unit is functioning. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Drainage system cleaning </h2>

    <p>  If you clean your Dantex air conditioner yourself, you may need to work on the drainage system.  The need for these works is indicated by the absence of condensate discharge.  This fact indicates that the drainage system was clogged.  This is due to improper installation of the air conditioner.  If the hose sags or is bent, condensation will not be discharged either.  Dirt and sewage that forms and accumulates in the drain pan block the pipeline.  In winter, the liquid freezes, which leads to the formation of an ice plug in the hose. </p><h2>  Drainage cleaning technology </h2>

    <p>  If you will clean the air conditioner with your own hands, it will be useful to consider the photo before starting work.  This may allow us to understand what the technology of manipulation is.  In order to clean the drainage, it is necessary to flush the indoor unit with the help of water pressure.  Next, the flushing of the unit that was partially disassembled is carried out.  The drain hose must be well purged with air, and then the drainage system of the disassembled unit is flushed. </p><h2>  Cleaning the car air conditioner </h2>

    <p>  To begin with, it is necessary to dismantle the filter, then a hose with an extension cord is used, through which detergent must be introduced.  At the next stage, the recirculation mode is activated, it must be left for 10 minutes.  The tube must be installed in the <span>interior of the</span> duct and the jet directed to the surface of the evaporator.  All liquid must be worked out, and then wait about 15 minutes.  After the fluid has been discharged, it will exit through the drain hole.  Now the air conditioner must be turned on in recirculation mode.  On the fan, you can set the maximum speed.  When you clean your LG air conditioner with your own hands, the next step is to leave the car, closing all doors and windows.  The air conditioner should work for 10 minutes.  Only in this way all harmful substances will be eliminated from the device, after which they can no longer cause harm to health.  The tube may not be installed in the duct, but in the drainage hole.  From there, the spent liquid can also leak.  Now you know how to clean the drainage system of the air conditioner with your own hands.  It will only be necessary to change the old filter in time, this will extend the life of the equipment. </p><h2>  Deep cleaning </h2>

    <p>  In order to perform a more thorough cleaning, it is necessary to remove the capacitor, which is done by unscrewing the fasteners.  The radiator must be treated with a substance that can eliminate the presence of insects.  In this state, the element must be left for 15 minutes.  Next, water is sent to the condenser under high pressure, this will help flush the product from the surface.  There is another cleaning method that involves the use of foam.  If you clean the Panasonic air conditioner with your own hands, using this technology you can wash the evaporator.  Foam for this needs to be fed into the evaporation unit through the drainage hole, which is located at the bottom of the car.  You can use the duct that goes directly to the cabin.  The foam will turn into a liquid, which will independently leave the device. </p><h2>  Features of foam cleaning </h2><p>  The hose must be installed in the drain hole until it hits the evaporator grate.  Then the foam bottle is fixed to the end of the hose, but before that it must be shaken well.  When holding the container in an upright position, foam must be supplied.  The master should wait 20 minutes, during this period the foam will turn into a liquid.  Only then can the air conditioner be put into operation.  The air flow should be directed to the face or feet, while the damper should be in a closed state.  The fan must be set to maximum power.  The car closes, while the device works for 10 minutes. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Now you know how to clean the window air conditioner with your own hands.  You can easily perform such manipulations yourself.  However, before starting work it is necessary to make sure that you yourself can not only disassemble, but also assemble the equipment, because this is the only way to ensure its normal operation.  This will allow the owners to save money on complex repairs. </p>
