The name of one of them was Schus Theodosius Justinovich.  The people called him Fedos.  He became famous for his dashing disposition and love of freedom.  Theodosius was respected by brothers in arms and loved by women. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  Schus Theodosius Justinovich was born on March 25, 1893.  His father was a poor Cossack.  They lived in Dibrovka - a village that at that time belonged to the Ekaterinoslav province.  Today this place is called Velikomikhaylovka (Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine). </p>

    <p>  During the life of Theodosius Dibrovka was a fairly developed settlement.  It had more than one thousand yards, a brick factory, steam mills worked, there was a post station and a telegraph. </p><h2>  Young sailor </h2><p>  In 1915, Schus Theodosius Justinovich celebrated his twenty-second birthday and was called up for military service.  He became a sailor on the ship "John Chrysostom", which belonged to the Black Sea Fleet.  The battleship took part in the battles more than once. </p><p>  Very quickly Theodosius Justinovich Schus (photo posted in the article) became one of the best employees, although he did not differ in perfect discipline.  He had good physical data, which allowed him to win the championship in boxing and classic wrestling in the Black Sea Fleet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During his service years, he became interested in politics, in particular the anarchist movement, which many sailors were interested in.  Theodosius was no exception and joined the anarcho-communist group. </p><p>  With the beginning of the February Revolution, he became part of the detachment of <span>revolutionary sailors.</span>  But soon he abandoned everything and returned to his native land, where the anarchist movement was actively developing. </p><h2>  Dashing Hussar </h2><p>  Arriving at home, Schus Feodosiy Justinovich became part of the Black Guard, which operated in Gulyai-Pole.  The 24-year-old man was overwhelmed with ambition, so he soon decided to create his own squad. </p>

    <p>  The young anarchist saw himself only as a commander.  He gathered around him the same daring anarchists.  These are former military, young workers and villagers.  The detachment was one of many, but wealthy owners were especially afraid of it. </p><p>  The young chieftain liked to look good.  The hussar uniform was chosen as a form, associating himself with the partisan commander of the war with Napoleon <span>Denis Davydov.</span>  He preferred to wear a sailor cap on his head, on which was written the name of the ship from the time of his last service.  Like Davydov, Theodosius loved poetry, he composed poems that formed the basis of some songs of the anarchists.  The words are attributed to him: "Black banners in front of the regiments ...". </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Schus was not indifferent to good weapons.  He carried with him a <span>Caucasian dagger, an</span> expensive saber with a great historical past, a Colt revolver. </p><h2>  As an assistant to Makhno </h2><p>  Despite his youth, Theodosius Justinovich Schus was a brave and charismatic ataman, but did not have enough experience and knowledge in political affairs.  In terms of organizational qualities, Nestor Makhno was ahead of him.  It was he who managed to become an anarchist Old Man.  Shchus and his detachment reunited with the Makhnovists in the summer of 1918. </p><p>  This happened when the anarchists were almost destroyed by a large Austro-German detachment.  Under the command of Makhno there were thirty people, but he decided to attack the enemy corral, which was stationed in Dibrovka.  An unexpected, well-thought-out attack stunned the Austrians. </p>

    <p>  Despite a significant superiority in strength and armament, foreign troops were defeated.  The victory made Makhno a rebel dad.  Schus has faded into the background. </p><p>  Makhno began to collaborate with the Red Army, but soon decided to create his own Revolutionary rebel army.  Theodosius Justinovich Schus entered its composition. </p><p>  He enjoyed considerable authority among the rebels, had influence not only on them, but also on Nestor Makhno.  Theodosius was able to sharply object to the decision of the rebel leader.  On this unit was decided. </p><h2>  Mysterious death </h2><p>  With Nestor Makhno, the former sailor went through almost the entire Civil War.  Theodosius Justinovich Schus, whose biography is connected with anarchism, completed his life in 1921. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="I am Feodosiy Justinovich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/1978204.jpg" width="211"></div>  According to one version, he died during the battle of the Makhnovists with one of the detachments of the Red Cossacks near Nedrigailov.  The defeat in this battle was the beginning of the end for the Makhnovist movement.  Its representatives began to retreat, after which they completely went abroad.

    <p>  According to another version, Theodosius was sent to the other world by the Makhnovists, perhaps the Old Man himself.  Some historians admit that Schus has ordered Nestor Makhno to surrender.  To this, the leader of the anarchists suggested that the brothers in arms take the side of one of them.  Most chose the side of the Old Man, who immediately shot the apostate.  This version has no documentary evidence. </p>

    <p>  Makhno and other rebels spoke of the ataman as a reckless man, he was respected for his exceptional energy and personal courage.  Schus was the most prominent and charismatic leader of the Makhnovist movement. </p>
