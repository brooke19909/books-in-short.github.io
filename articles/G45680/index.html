Krasnodar is considered the economic and tourist center of Russia.  It is this fertile land that an increasing number of people choose for permanent residence.  There are many developed comfortable farms and villages.  One of the most promising and developing is considered the village of Dinskaya in the <span>Krasnodar Territory.</span>  It is about her that this article will be discussed. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  This territory - Don Kuren - was granted to the Kuban Cossacks in 1794 by Catherine II, after the defeat on the land of the Kuban Zaporizhzhya section.  Over time, the kuren began to be called Dinskaya, and in 1842 this territory became known as the Dinskaya village. </p>

    <p>  A lot of tests fell on the Dynch.  They survived the revolution, collectivization, civil and domestic war.  In 1942, in August, the village was occupied by German invaders.  In February 1943, the Soviet troops expelled the Nazis from these lands.  In memory of the fallen soldiers, a memorial was created with the names of 253 fallen Dincans.  The T-34 tank was installed as a tribute to the soldiers-liberators during the Second World War. </p><p>  Immediately after the liberation of the village, the population began to restore the national economy.  In the middle of the 20th century, many different enterprises were created in the village of Dinskaya: a bakery, factories (sugar and canneries), a confectionery factory, and ATP.  Out of several small collective farms, one large farm was created.  Several new schools, a book house, and a department store were built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dinskaya village of Krasnodar Territory: description.
