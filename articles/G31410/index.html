    <p>  Everything is pretty well packed, which eliminates damage to the smartphone during transportation. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  The Acer Z150 smartphone is slightly different in form from previous models.  This time, Acer has changed its style a bit and made the new device angular.  The smartphone is completely flat, with the exception of a small protrusion of the main camera module on the back side.  The beveled upper and lower sides are equipped with conversational and multimedia speakers, a microphone, which are covered with thin grilles. </p><p>  The sides are rounded and gently go to the back.  On the right sidewall is a protruding volume control key.  It has a kind of droplet, which allows you to make adjustments to the touch.  On the same side is a slot for a memory card.  On the left side of the smartphone are slots for 2 SIM-cards.  They allow you to use both micro-Sim and mini-Sim.  Using them is not very convenient, but most likely you will not have to rearrange the cards often. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the upper end area there is a headphone jack.  There is also a power button.  The bottom of the smartphone has a connector for a USB cable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="phone acer z150" class="if" height="401" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1020649.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the front side is the display of the smartphone, bordered by a thin frame made of glossy plastic.  In the upper part of the frame to the right of the logo is the <span>front camera</span> and the event indicator, and to the left - the <span>proximity sensor.</span>  In its lower part there are three touch buttons for navigation: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúLast‚Äù. </p><p>  On the back side, in addition to the camera, there is an LED flash and a shortcut key, when pressed, it starts any application connected to it, including a player or camcorder, even if the screen is locked.  To the right of the camera is another microphone.  The back also has a print of the manufacturer's logo. </p><h2>  Acer Z150: display specifications </h2><p>  The smartphone has a fairly large touch screen with a diagonal of 5 inches.  Its resolution - 854x480 pixels - can be considered excellent, given that the Acer Z150 is a budget model.  The screen has good horizontal viewing angles and good color reproduction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone acer z150" class="if" height="427" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1020648.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <span>The screen is</span> locked according to the usual system for smartphones of this manufacturer.  Status information is displayed in the upper corner of the screen.  If you move the screen to the left, the camera will be launched on the smartphone, when shifted to the right, a list of widgets will appear. </p><p>  The display is covered with a special <span>tempered glass.</span>  There is no film for the screen, so you have to buy it separately.  Brightness can only be adjusted manually. </p><h2>  A little bit about the operating system </h2><p>  The Acer Z150 smartphone runs on the popular mobile operating system Android 4.2.2.  The developers took care of people with low vision and installed on top of Android 4.2.2 the proprietary shell Jelly Bean, which changes the interface beyond recognition. </p><p>  If desired, the smartphone can be flashed and install a newer operating system.  Choose the most suitable version will help comments from experts. </p><h2>  What's inside? </h2><p>  The Acer Z150 smartphone uses a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz, which provides a pretty good performance for the device, given that the phone is a budget model. </p><p>  Installed RAM is 512 MB, and internal - 4 GB.  According to experts, this volume is not enough to install modern games on a smartphone.  Also, when loading a huge number of applications, the device may slow down or freeze.  Flash cards will help correct the situation, with which you can significantly expand the capabilities of the smartphone. </p><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The smartphone copes with most everyday tasks.  True, the interface can sometimes slow down slightly, which is typical of budget devices.  Fans of complex games will be somewhat disappointed with the Acer Z150 smartphone, since it is equipped with not the latest processor. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acer z150 specifications" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1020652.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Wi-Fi network sharing is average.  The speech speaker allows you to transmit sound of normal quality.  In a noisy environment, its volume is not enough. </p><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a powerful battery that allows the device to work for a significant period of time without recharging.  It is also possible to use the energy-saving mode, but the Wi-Fi connection will be disconnected. </p><h2>  Play sound </h2><p>  For fans of listening to music, the Acer Z150 smartphone will be a good choice.  The reviews of many users confirm the high-quality sound reproduction on this phone.  But according to other owners of the device, good sound is possible only with correctly configured settings. </p><p>  The Acer Z150 can play sound files in the following formats: </p><ul><li>  MP3 </li><li>  AMR </li><li>  WMA </li></ul><p>  Of course, the smartphone is not a leader in sound quality, but still the volume and clarity of sound are at a fairly high level. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The smartphone is equipped with a five-megapixel camera, which allows you to take pretty high-quality photos or videos.  It has autofocus and an LED flash, which allows you to take pictures in almost any light.  The noise reduction effect does not allow to accurately display fine details on the pictures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acer z150 reviews" class="if" height="330" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1020651.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The settings menu for the camera is quite extensive, which makes it possible to carry out continuous shooting, panoramic photography, detect faces, eliminate flicker and more.  It is also possible to capture information on the location of shooting on photographs or videos.  To display geotags, you must enable the "GPS data about the place" function before recording. </p><p>  The front camera has a resolution of 640x480 pixels, which is quite enough for video communications. </p><h2>  Communication opportunities </h2><p>  Since at present the most popular is communication on the network, the speed of the Internet is an important parameter for modern communications.  Smartphone Acer Z150 in this regard will not disappoint users.  The menu allows you to make all the necessary settings to optimize the Internet.  A correctly selected browser will also help, which will not heavily load the system and provide a quick transition to the tabs of interest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acer z150 freezes" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14531/1021266.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The Acer Z150 is thought out to quickly receive and send messages.  It is also worth noting that the buttons on the keyboard are slightly highlighted, and this allows you to write messages even in very bright conditions.  Thanks to the bluetooth, which is available in the device, you can easily share various files with friends. </p><h2>  Smartphone flaws </h2><p>  Like all smartphones, the Acer Z150 caused mixed reviews among users, among which the minuses of this device are often voiced.  Most complaints are caused by the non-removable back panel.  Of course, this innovation has some advantages, such as the lack of creaks and play when using the phone.  But it also does not allow you to disconnect the battery if the phone freezes.  Acer Z150, according to user reviews, slows down quite often, and it will take a long time to wait for it to work again. </p><p>  The brightness of the screen does not satisfy many, since in sunny weather it is difficult to see anything on it.  In this case, it is not worth talking about using the energy-saving mode. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acer z150 does not turn on" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34853/1020647.jpg" width="600"></div>

        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  Also, many users claim that quite often the Acer Z150 smartphone does not turn on.  Most often this happens due to a discharged battery.  But there are cases that only masters in service centers can bring it back to life. </p><p>  The outrage among people who bought the Acer Z150 causes the lack of film for the screen and covers for this phone in the domestic market.  They have to be ordered in China or other countries. </p><h2>  What are the positive reviews talking about? </h2><p>  Despite all the shortcomings, the smartphone is a pretty good budget model.  Very many are satisfied with the size of its display and fast work.  It also features good playback of both video and audio files.  It is quite easy to use, despite its versatility.  Of course, such a device is hardly suitable for lovers of modern games, but a smartphone will be enough for communication, work or study. </p>
