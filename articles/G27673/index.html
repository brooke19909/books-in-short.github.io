Someone from acquaintances borrowed money from you, but did not repay it?  Such a situation may be encountered not only by very gullible and kindhearted people.  You could lend money to a friend, and at the same time you did not expect the person to forget about his promise to pay you off in a week.  How to make a person repay a debt?  Read about it below. </p><h2>  Find out the reason for the delay </h2><div class="photo" data-original="under30ceo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="person's duty" class="if uuid-2934180" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934180.jpg"></div><p>  The first thing that a person about whom the credited person has forgotten should do is to speak frankly with the person.  No need to beat around the bush.  If you can‚Äôt think of a way to get a person to repay a monetary debt, then proceed directly.  Remind the person that he took the money from you and ask when the person will return it.  Do not let people evade.  Speak frankly and ask the person to act directly too.  A similar approach would be optimal.  But remember that in this case you can hear an honest answer that will not sound very encouraging.  For example, you hoped to hear that the person simply forgot about the debt, but in fact it turns out that the person has missed all the money and now he cannot return the necessary amount to you.  Tell the person that you will not tolerate such a relationship for a long time, so ask the person when she will have the next cash receipt.  How to repay a receipt without a trial?  On the day when a person will receive a salary or an advance, come with a receipt to the person and exchange a piece of paper for the amount you need. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Consciousness </h2><div class="photo" data-original="aabgu.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="repay a person‚Äôs debt" class="if uuid-2934178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934178.jpg"></div><p>  Do not want to talk heart to heart with a person?  You do not have to go into the details of the life of the person who took the money from you.  An unpleasant situation can be resolved not only personally, but also remotely.  How to talk with debtors on the phone?  Press on a person‚Äôs conscience.  This method cannot be called too honest, but it can be used if circumstances so require.  Try to mislead the person by telling him that you will not tolerate this state of affairs for too long.  Focus on the words that the person has a conscience, and she should wake up from time to time.  The phrase can be supplemented as follows: only fallen people who do not have responsibility to friends and cannot be called full members of society cannot repay debts.  Sounds like humiliation?  Little.  But what to do, in war all means are good. </p><p>  Is it possible to repay a debt if there is no receipt?  In this situation, pressure on conscience will be especially relevant.  Try to convey to the person the idea that he is treating you very unfairly without returning money to you.  Remind about debt as often as possible.  Then a person‚Äôs conscience will wake up faster. </p><h2>  Pressure for pity </h2><div class="photo" data-original="reductress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="sue" class="if uuid-2934182" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934182.jpg"></div><p>  Can't get the person out of the way?  How to collect debt from the debtor in another way?  You can put pressure on pity.  This method of returning money back is also not the most honest.  But you may have no other choice if the person does not want to understand in a good way.  Tell a person that life is hard for you without money.  You are forced to save on everything and are not even sure that you can reach the nearest salary.  Such sayings can pity you and help repay a debt.  What else can you tell the person who holds the money?  Say that you need to feed your family and you just need to buy medicine for one of the relatives.  To cheat in this case is not worth it.  Just remember what you have long wanted to buy or what you really really need money for now.  If you speak sincerely, the probability of returning the debt will be higher. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Writing a claim </h2><p>  Do you have a receipt form?  Then you have every legal reason to demand money back.  How to do it?  Write in a free form a letter to the person who is delaying your money.  Attach a copy of the receipt to such a letter.  In such a letter there is no need to put pressure on conscience or pity.  It should be in the driest terms to demand money back.  And so that the motivation to repay a person‚Äôs debt is higher, you should scare the person a little.  For example, notify your debtor that if he does not return the money to you this week, or better on the day you have decided, then you will file a lawsuit against the person.  Threatening people is not very nice.  Many are afraid to do this, because after going to court about the existence of a friend whom you filed a lawsuit, you can forget.  But think about whether you need friends who only need finance from you.  If the person was decent, he would return the money on time.  And since the person treats you not too well, do not try to treat her softly. </p><h2>  Court </h2><div class="photo" data-original="thenetworkingstrategist.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a person return a monetary debt" class="if uuid-2934185" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934185.jpg"></div><p>  Does a person hold money for a long time?  Then hurry to sue the debtor.  There is nothing wrong with demanding a person back money.  You will have every chance to win the case if you have a receipt on hand.  And so that your arguments about the return of money sounded even more convincing, you can invite several witnesses who will confirm that for a long time your debtor has not made any attempts to return the money to you.  The court will be able to make a decision by which the person will return the money to you within the current month.  And if the person does not do this, then she may go to jail or she will be given a suspended sentence.  It is unlikely that anyone will want to be involved in such matters.  Therefore, the person will try to satisfy your demand on time.  But remember that judgment is your last hope.  Such measures should only be taken if the person with whom you are communicating does not want to give you money at all. </p><h2>  Public prosecution </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.quora.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="is it possible to return" class="if uuid-2934183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934183.jpg"></div><p>  Are you on good terms with the debtor?  Then do not immediately sue.  You can publicly bring down your anger against a debtor.  Such scenes greatly confuse decent people, and they will make every effort to prevent the scene from repeating itself.  When will it be appropriate to demand a debt?  You can do this by visiting mutual friends.  Start a topic about debts, and then, by the way, ask a person when she plans to return the money.  If a person is hushed up, act with great pressure.  You need to unleash a scandal.  At the same time, you can act by all available methods: put pressure on conscience, pity, or threaten the court.  All this comedy will be played for a person who in a similar situation will feel very awkward.  In such circumstances, it will be easy for you to get a second receipt from a person, which will confirm the person‚Äôs desire to give you the money up to the number you need, and ideally, today or tomorrow. </p><h2>  Conversation with relatives </h2><p>  Can't you reach a man?  Then go on the other side.  How to make a person repay a debt?  To do this, you should talk with the relatives of the person.  Whom to choose?  It is best to talk with the parents of the individual who has not returned the money to you.  The second half can defend the beloved, while the parents themselves will be ashamed of the behavior of the child and they will make every effort not to blush for their child anymore.  In extreme cases, you can ask for money from the parents of your debtor.  If the relatives have a good relationship, then they will give the necessary amount of money, and they will somehow return their money back.  Therefore, do not write off the person‚Äôs parents. </p><p>  Are you unfamiliar with the parents of the debtor?  Then turn to your soulmate, brothers or sisters.  Relatives will help you find the strings you need to pull for the person to pay you a debt. </p><h2>  Collector Agency </h2><div class="photo" data-original="english.stackexchange.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to repay a debt if there is no receipt" class="if uuid-2934184" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934184.jpg"></div><p>  Want to get money back without big problems?  Do you need at least some amount, and you no longer hope to repay all the debt?  Then the collectors agency will help you.  <span>How to make a person</span> repay a debt?  If you have a receipt, you can easily resell the debt to a third party.  You will not receive all the money, but get rid of many problems.  In this case, you do not have to humiliate yourself, put pressure on your conscience or constantly visit the debtor.  Specially trained people will do this kind of work.  Experienced psychologists and lawyers will be able to put the case so that a person returns the required amount within one week. </p><h2>  How to protect yourself? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.cuidatudinero.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a person" class="if uuid-2934186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/56028/2934186.jpg"></div><p>  Don't want to wonder how to get a person to repay a debt?  Then you need to follow the following simple rules.  Namely: </p><ul><li>  Always require a receipt form.  A person should leave a receipt even if he took a small amount from you and plans to return it tomorrow.  It is clear that a receipt for 100 rubles is not worth writing, but for 1000 it is already possible. </li><li>  Do not give large amounts of debt.  The ideal amount that you can lend to someone is that money, without which you will manage to return.  In this case, you do not have to fight over the question of how to repay your debts. </li><li>  If you do not trust a person, then do not give him money.  The idea seems quite logical, but for some reason many people neglect it. </li><li>  If you are forced to give money to someone from relatives, for example, for treatment and think that a person will not be able to return your savings to you, then try to assure the receipt from a notary.  In this case, you can be sure that if the person cannot pay his debt, then the money will be claimed from children or other close relatives. </li><li>  Always repay your debts on time.  Remember: how you deal with people, so they do with you. </li></ul>
