There are at least four, and there are also arteries hidden in underground pipes.  Consequently, there are many bridges, about twenty pieces, no less.  But there are quite few beautiful river crossings.  More precisely, there are only two - Kamenny and Tsarsky bridges.  Both of them are thrown across the small Iset river.  Yekaterinburg as a city actually began from this place, and therefore, going to watch bridges, you can also admire the old manor buildings of the nineteenth century.  These are beautiful houses of merchants and philistines, made in the Ural style.  Between the Tsarsky and <span>Kamenny bridges</span> , a beautiful walking alley is laid along the river bank.  So visit this place is definitely worth it.  And also learn the history of the Tsar‚Äôs bridge ... and, ironically, the street that runs along it.  After all, it is called the Decembrists, in honor of the fighters with the absolute monarchy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsarsky Bridge" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1687824.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  For the time being, we will not disclose in honor of which king the bridge was named.  But across the Iset River (Yekaterinburg) the crossing arose long ago.  It is reliably known that already in the year one thousand eight hundred and twenty-fourth there was a wooden bridge at this place.  At the very least, and the townspeople were crossing from one coast to another.  As it became known here, that Alexander the First himself, the emperor of All Russia, is going to Yekaterinburg.  And the city authorities were bustling.  How will the imperial motorcade pass along the blackened boards of the old bridge?  In a hurry, they built a new one.  It was also made of wood, but it pleased the look with freshness.  According to some sources, the king rode on this bridge.  According to others, realizing that on his august person the townspeople are trying to check the strength of the crossing, he refused to cross it.  Be that as it may, the city government ordered the bridge to be called the Tsar‚Äôs after this event.  Although it would be more correct to call it imperial - in accordance with the status of Alexander the First. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Iset Yekaterinburg" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1687795.jpg" width="600"></div>

And especially when wagons and pedestrians scurry around on it daily.  It is not known how many times the wooden flooring on Tsarsky Bridge was changed.  In the end, the city government decided to replace this crossing with a more durable construction.  As usual, a project competition was announced, in which the work of architect S. Kozlov won.  The Tsar‚Äôs bridge began to be built in 1880, and by 1890 it was completed.  The construction was purely utilitarian.  Durability and reliability were put at the forefront.  In the construction used the local Ural large rubble stone.  The bridge supports are low, and the horizontal orientation of the bridge is emphasized by its three gentle arches.  Architect S. Kozlov already at the end of the century before last foresaw that not only laden carts and carriages would cross his bridge soon.  Therefore, he laid in his brainchild a large margin of strength and reliability.  But he paid little attention to the decor to regret.  Until recently, the railing on the bridge was plain and simple.  They did not at all correspond to royal status. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsar bridge yekaterinburg" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1687826.jpg" width="600"></div>

From one thousand nine hundred and fifty-two, trolleybuses of several tons were launched along it.  In general, Tsarsky looks much more solid than the nearby Stone Bridge in Yekaterinburg.  And this is not surprising.  After all, it was built fifty years later than Kamenny, and newer technologies were used in its construction.  The city authorities in every way take care of this attraction of Yekaterinburg.  A few years ago, wrought iron elegant railings were installed.  And on the pedestals between the grills installed electric lights "antique".  The renewed and embellished bridge has changed its status.  Now this is not just a crossing, one of many.  This is a historical and architectural monument of federal significance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The bridge in yekaterinburg" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14322/1687970.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  <span>Tsarsky bridge</span> and Decembrists street </h2><p>  Alas, the story is full of tragedies and farce.  A few years after the imperial motorcade crossed the new wooden bridge, the Decembrists who were exiled to Siberia also passed it.  In their honor, during the Soviet era, Alexander Prospect was renamed.  By the way, the Tsar‚Äôs bridge remained royal.  The authorities of the USSR, so sensitive to all manifestations of nostalgia for the previous regime, somehow overlooked it.  And so it happened that a street named after those who fought with the emperor passes along the Tsar‚Äôs bridge. </p><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  In modern Yekaterinburg there are not so many architectural sights.  Citizens are proud of their Royal Bridge and strongly recommend visiting it.  Moreover, it is located near the center.  A particularly beautiful view opens from the side, from the embankment of the Iset River.  The Tsar‚Äôs bridge and Plotinka are connected by a walking alley running along the very bank of the river.  Street artists sometimes get to the pillars of a historical and architectural monument and leave graffiti on them.  But a small rivulet and an old three-span bridge still leave a lasting impression. </p>
