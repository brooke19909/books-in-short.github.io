And thanks to the name, the river is remembered all the first time.  She is associated with fish and fishermen.  And the question immediately arises: how did the river Vobla get such a name? <strong></strong></p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  There are several versions of why r.  Wobble got such a name.  But all the same, historical facts and the etymology of the word are taken as the basis.  Although there is a legend that the name of the river was given by the Russian prince in the Middle Ages.  Crossing the river, he strongly scolded, and this formed the basis of the name. </p><p>  But the legend is refuted by historical facts.  It is known that the name of the river was approved only in the 20th century.  And before that she was called "Vobla."  This is only a version, since the Ryazan chronicles dated to the 16th century contain the names "Black Wobble" or "Dry". </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wobble river" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1454400.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If we consider the etymology of the word, then it stands for "moist, damp, softened."  Most likely, the name of the river was given due to the climatic and natural features of the area.  Maybe earlier the shores were very swampy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A century ago, Voblya - a river flowing through the Moscow region - was full-flowing and wide.  She often overflowed and flooded meadows and peasant fields.  There is another version of the name of the river.  Perhaps flax was whitened in its waters.  In this case, the river received the name from the word "lure."  In translation, this will mean "whitening." </p><h2>  River description </h2><p>  Wobble is a river that has long been a natural and climatic border.  On the left bank there was a deciduous forest, swamps and small rivers.  There were no trees on the right.  There were hayfields and arable land.  From the north, Vobla had lowlands, and from the south - highlands.  The land here was dry, small birch groves grew there.  The rivers almost did not leak. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="river wobble story" class="if" height="231" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1454398.jpg" width="410"></div>

    <p>  When from 1838 to 1941  The construction of the highway to Ryazan began, this had a great impact on the river landscape.  One part of the coast has changed for the better.  For example, the left bank has become drier and suitable for agriculture.  Over time, active settlement began in the river area, and at the end of the 19th century.  archaeological research was carried out. </p><p>  In the 20th century  Wobble was a favorite vacation spot of Lukhovitsch.  In winter, they skated on ice, and in summer, young people gathered on the bridge and arranged holidays.  To date, the river is significantly shallow.  The water is heavily polluted and in some places is more like a swamp.  The river does not have commercial or shipping value.  The length of the watercourse is 36 kilometers.  Water supply is snow. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  River settlements </h2><p>  The Voblya River, whose history goes back to the distant past, had many settlements on its banks.  This is evidenced by <span>archaeological excavations.</span>  The largest settlement is considered to be the Lukhovitsky settlement.  It was located on the right bank of the river and was surrounded by ravines.  The settlement was fortified with ramparts and moats. </p><p>  But the largest village, which played a large role in the development of the Lukhovitsky Territory, was considered the village of Glukhovichi.  It was one of the largest settlements and it belonged to the Ryazan bishop.  A kilometer from the river several more fortifications were found.  The most studied - Gigantic hillock - dates back to I millennium BC.  e.  On the banks of the river were discovered 2 burial mounds. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="river wobble name history" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17625/1454401.jpg" width="600"></div>
