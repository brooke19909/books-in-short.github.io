Previously, they were push-button, simple, but reliable assistants, which we used exclusively for calls and sending messages.  Now these are full-fledged multimedia centers with a wide range of opportunities with which we have fun, travel, study and do a lot of other things. </p><p>  However, you should not think that push-button devices, which once had such popularity, have gone into oblivion.  No, nothing like that - phones with a physical keyboard are still popular among users.  They have a lot of positive qualities, which we will talk about today. </p><p>  And the hero of our review, strangely enough, will be not the familiar touch device with a large screen and a real processor, but a small keyboard device that serves for communication between people.  Meet: we present the Samsung 3322 to your attention. The model, released in 2011, is still sold on the shelves of electronics stores.  Why does she bribe the user and what special can be found in her - read this article. </p><h2>  Positioning </h2>

    <p>  We will begin, of course, with a description of how this phone is presented by its developer.  We will describe what goals the manufacturer set and how much he managed to achieve them by launching Samsung 3322. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So, speaking of price orientation, we can say with confidence that this is a budget class.  And, unlike the available touch devices, in our case the low price is due not to the noname-developer or low-quality technical stuffing.  Not at all - the <span>Samsung</span> 3322 <span>phone is</span> released by an advanced company, the ‚Äútop‚Äù brand of the mobile industry.  Taking the phone in hand, you immediately realize how well this device is assembled and how convenient it is in daily use.  The user most often just falls in love with the design of the model, its usability.  Therefore, there can be no talk of any savings on anything here.  Just our Samsung 3322 is a keyboard all-in-one that works without an operating system and processor (in the meaning of these terms from the point of view of modern devices).  Therefore, the low cost of the phone is a phenomenon due to objective criteria. </p><h2>  Developer Goals </h2>

    <p>  We are used to the fact that each new touchscreen smartphone is a miniature computer with a lot of additional modules, working with powerful technical equipment: a powerful processor, large-capacity RAM, and a powerful graphics adapter.  All these and other elements must have maximum technical characteristics, be advanced in their niche. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is strange to see that the Samsung 3322 is not participating in this ‚Äúrace."  It‚Äôs just a good phone that can call, receive and send messages, perform some basic multimedia functions.  Then what is the purpose of the developers? </p><p>  The fact is that the manufacturer is not going to make a powerful model of the most technologically advanced smartphone.  No, Samsung‚Äôs task is to create a convenient and easy-to-use phone that meets the daily needs of its user.  It should be stable, simple and convenient.  And, judging by the reviews (which we will address a bit later), our Samsung C 3322 mobile phone is just that ... </p><h2>  Design </h2><p>  ... And appearance plays an important role in this.  Yes, exactly what a smartphone looks like determines a significant proportion of the user's attitude to it.  If a person is pleased to use this model, it lies well in the hand, looks stylish and technologically advanced, such a phone will definitely be in demand.  It should be noted that keyboard devices pay much more attention to this than modern touch devices.  And the <span>Samsung C 3322</span> phone clearly excelled at that. </p>

    <p>  It is presented on the market in a metal case, which already makes it attractive a priori.  This appearance will suit the style of both a business person and someone who simply wants to stay stylish in all situations.  Due to this, the model is universal for both sexes, and for all age categories. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The phone has a visual separation into two zones: a black ‚Äúisland‚Äù around the screen and a gray ‚Äúexternal‚Äù zone.  This technique cannot be called new, we have seen it on many models, however, it effectively separates the model, makes its design more interesting and attractive. </p><p>  Metal buttons rounded in the corners only complement this effect, having not only practical, but also decorative purpose. </p><h2>  Screen </h2>

    <p>  The phone display will not surprise us with anything original or new.  Yes, this is not a large five-inch sensor installed on the next iPhone.  This is only a two-inch screen with a minimum set of information, which serves as a source of information about the status of the device.  Here everything is depicted as concisely and understandably as possible (although if you are used to working with Nokia or other developers, switching to Samsung 3322 Duos (whose programs have a different design) will be a little more difficult. However, you should not worry about this - all without exception, users learn with the phone for several days. </p><h2>  Duos </h2>

    <p>  The device that we describe in this article supports two SIM cards.  This is very cool if you would like to save on mobile services by choosing different operators for calls in different directions.  An example may be simple: it‚Äôs cheaper for you to call one number from one operator, and another from another.  Thus, the Samsung 3322 Duos (an instruction whose characteristics contain information on how to switch between cards) can be a good universal tool for more profitable calls. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The internal memory of the phone is another story.  Since, as noted by the Samsung 3322 Duos manual, the phone has some basic multimedia capabilities (for example, a media player), it is very important that there is enough space inside it to store your favorite recordings and important materials.  Those 50 MB that were installed initially is clearly not enough for this.  For such purposes, users use a slot for memory cards.  You can install a standard microSD in it, which will increase the space on the phone to 1 GB (or more). </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  To create some simple photos, a camera is installed on the phone.  Its resolution of 2 megapixels, of course, does not allow us to seriously talk about any high-quality images, so we just note that it really is here.  But we will not discuss how much it will be clear what exactly the user tried to photograph, since this is not quite a key topic of our article. </p><p>  Outbreaks in order to somehow save the situation with the received image in low light conditions were not provided here.  As well as there is no front camera.  She is here, however, and would not be useful, because there is no way to shoot here in the video conferencing mode. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  Nevertheless, you should not think that the Samsung C 3322 mobile phone is an empty ‚Äúdialer‚Äù without any capabilities.  We characterize a full-fledged smartphone on which there are programs of different directions and for different tasks.  And to make sure of this is very simple.  Take a look at the software that comes with it. </p><p>  For example, we can mention social networking applications on the Samsung 3322 Duos.  This is primarily Facebook and Google Talk.  With their help, the user can fully communicate with his friends, without using a touch phone.  The second point is the ability to download any application that interests you.  Instead of social networks, it can be some messengers, weather forecast programs, and much more.  You guessed it, we need the internet to download these add-ons.  It is quite possible to use another solution - a home PC to connect to the phone and send applications downloaded from the network to it. </p>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  The phone can work with wireless internet.  True, the access technology in this case is not the 3G / LTE format familiar to all of us today, but the outdated GPRS.  Consequently, the access speed will be many times lower, and the cost of each megabyte of traffic is higher.  Unfortunately, nothing can be done with this: the phone is clearly not designed for normal, modern Internet surfing.  And, as customer reviews describing the Samsung 3322 Duos show, you just need to come to terms with it: after all, the Internet is clearly not the main purpose of the model.  It should be used for other purposes more suitable to its concept. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  I would also like to note other communication modules inherent in the C3322.  First of all, it's Bluetooth.  The phone is able to send and receive files using this <span>user interface,</span> due to which you will not have problems in order to replenish your music collection on the device, for example.  It is very convenient to exchange files even if your computer also has a Bluetooth adapter: it will allow you to refuse wires and work ‚Äúover the air‚Äù. </p><p>  If your PC does not support working with this interface, you can connect the phone using the classic USB-connector.  Thus, you synchronize the device in the shortest possible time without additional difficulties. </p><p>  The settings also contain information about some SyncML (DM) interface, however, how it works and how it can be useful to us, ordinary users, remains incomprehensible. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Finally, the best outcome in order to summarize all the information about the phone during the review may be reviews and recommendations left by other customers.  In this case, we are interested in the opinions of these people about the C3322 model, its quality and functionality. </p><p>  As analysis of user comments shows, the model is really much appreciated by customers.  They note that the smartphone is indeed capable of showing stable operation for several years after the acquisition.  If you use it carefully, you can also keep its original appearance. </p><p>  Among the negative comments, one can only notice the opinion about the lack of a normal Internet connection in the device, as well as about some software failures.  They arise if you incorrectly install additional software directly from the Internet.  As practice shows, flashing will help to get rid of such errors best.  The truth about <span>how to flash the Samsung</span> C3322 <span>phone</span> , we will not talk in detail, since this is a separate topic for conversation.  We only note that you will need a USB cable, a computer, a recognition program and software for firmware.  It can be found on any phone forum. </p><p>  In general, there can be no complaints about how the Samsung C 3322 phone works.  It is very convenient, fast and simple, affordable and reliable in daily use, holds a charge for a long time and allows you to save on calls.  What else is needed from such a device? </p>
