This place has always attracted guests with its beauty, infrastructure, and entertainment.  The Winter Olympics in 2014 particularly influenced its development.  Here for tourists there is absolutely everything.  Due to the warm climate and the sea, many tourists prefer to relax here only in the summer.  But winter recreation here can be very intense and vibrant.  Consider below whether it is worth coming here in the winter and is it possible to rest in Sochi in December? </p><h2>  Air temperature </h2><p>  Sochi in December is also very interesting for tourism.  Let us first consider how cold it is in winter.  In general, although this place is part of Russia, but because of its convenient location, winter is much milder here than in any other regions of the Russian Federation. </p><p>  Cooling is already beginning in December, but the temperature in the daytime can reach as much as +12 degrees, but at night and on cold days the thermometer can drop closer to +3 degrees.  But it is worth noting that sunny this month is rare.  Usually cloudy and with precipitation.  It often rains with an admixture of snow.  And also here it is often very windy in December, especially in the coastal part of the city.  This causes small storms at sea.  And if snow falls, then it is often very slushy and quickly melts due to plus temperatures. </p><p>  It is worth going here if the hot summer weather is not for you, but at the same time you are not a fan of the cold winter, when the temperature drops below -20.  Because the weather in Sochi, even in winter, is more favorable than in many other regions of Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  But swimming here is clearly no longer necessary.  The water temperature in Sochi in December drops to +10. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="weather in sochi in december" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2101996.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Things to do? </h2><p>  But not only the temperature in December in Sochi is optimal.  Here you can find a lot of entertainment and in addition to swimming in the Black Sea, as it could be done only in the summer.  The plus is that no matter what you decide to do, there will no longer be such a stream of tourists as in the summer. </p><p>  There are a lot of health resorts and mineral springs, spas.  There are places with mud baths and other services with useful procedures.  Sea air also has a very beneficial effect on health, so such a vacation can really be very useful.  On the territory of the city there are also a lot of restaurants, cafes, baths, city pools, etc. There is a wide selection of hotels and hotels, the cost of most of which in December is much cheaper. </p><p>  Separately, it is necessary to highlight the Sochi attractions that the city is famous for.  There are many <span>churches, cathedrals, temples,</span> monuments, whose beauty is mesmerizing.  There are also many beautiful parks.  For example, Sochi National Parks.  There are several museums. </p><p>  You should definitely visit the arboretum, marine zoo and aquarium.  Here you can see crocodiles, a large number of different types of fish.  This place is especially suitable for a relaxing family vacation.  There are several more water parks. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature in sochi in december" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2102007.jpg"></div>

The temperature in the mountainous parts in December is already set so that ski resorts begin to open.  This usually occurs in the second part of the month. </p><p>  Fans of winter sports should definitely visit Sochi in December.  The weather at this time is not so cold, so you can relax, but not freeze.  During the day, the thermometer mark reaches an average of + 6-7 degrees, and in winter it drops to zero.  Vacationers should pay attention to everyone known after the Olympics Krasnaya Polyana, where you can perfectly ski, skateboard and more.  But there are sometimes thaws, because of which you have to postpone the rest for several days.  However, you can play it safe if you choose hotels with adjacent places where there is artificial snowmaking.  Then any warming will become unimportant to you. </p><p>  Another famous resort is Rosa Khutor.  In winter, this place is incredibly beautiful, as if in a fairy tale.  Many tourists note that both in winter and in summer it is incredibly good here.  There are casinos, hotels, opportunities for winter sports, ski lifts.  This place is so popular that foreigners often relax here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Holidays in Sochi in December" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2102000.jpg"></div>

    <p>  And you can afford even more expensive pleasure - sightseeing helicopter flight.  You will have beautiful open spaces and views of the mountains, hills. </p><h2>  New Year in Sochi </h2><p>  But the New Year and a few days before its onset are the most favorite time for tourists to visit the resort, which is why the prices for holiday tours are slightly higher than usual. </p><p>  A large fair opens at the Arts Square, where you can buy many souvenirs for the holiday, food, honey, nuts, various objects, <span>ice towns</span> are built <span>,</span> and at the peak of the holiday in Krasnaya Polyana a fairy tale is being created: beautiful fireworks, music concerts, shows, a laser show and much more. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  The plus is the fact that prices for tours in Sochi are very affordable in comparison with tours to many other countries.  December holidays cost almost one third at least cheaper from the summer period.  On average, a week of rest here costs from 20-30 thousand rubles, not counting tickets.  The sooner you buy a tour, the cheaper.  It is worth noting that New Year tours are a bit expensive.  But if you take care of organizing the rest yourself, without involving a tour operator, you can pick up very good budget hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water temperature in sochi in december" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2102018.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  The benefits of winter holidays according to tourists </h2><p>  Sochi in December and other winter months has its advantages, as we have already identified. </p><p>  Many tourists believe that in winter it is very good here, especially at a ski resort: not warm, but not cold.  The temperature is about the same as in spring or autumn in other colder regions of the country.  Another significant plus - fewer tourists.  You can take a solitary walk along the coast or look at the sights in the city center, from which no one can distract you. </p><p>  And one of the most enjoyable is, perhaps, that you don‚Äôt need to spend money on a visa and a foreign passport if you are a resident of Russia.  You can celebrate New Year in a new beautiful place, ideal for relaxation, but without leaving far to another country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="air temperature in sochi in december" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2102020.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  So is it worth going to Sochi at the beginning of winter?  Definitely yes, if you like active winter sports, healing spas with mineral springs, relaxing alone, with family or children, or just don‚Äôt like the heat, but don‚Äôt know where to relax, but don‚Äôt want to go to distant lands.  Sochi is a great city for tourism. </p><p>  The temperature here rarely drops below +5 degrees, there are no frosts and cold air.  There is a developed infrastructure, so anyone will find something to their liking: active skiing or mud mineral baths, relaxation in the arboretum or a walk along the coast.  There are convenient places for families with children.  But also here you can have a great rest with friends, alone or with a soul mate. </p>
