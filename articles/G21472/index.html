In our article we want to talk about a brilliant architectural creation - the Sagrada Familia Cathedral.  The amazing structure attracts tourists from all over the world with its bizarre shapes and reliefs, transferring them to Bible times. </p><h2>  Historical facts </h2><p>  The redemptive cathedral of Sagrada Familia has been under construction for more than 150 years and is considered the most famous long-term construction.  It's hard to believe, but the way it really is.  In 2005, UNESCO even listed this unique object on its lists of the heritage of mankind, which in itself already speaks of the importance of the structure. </p><p>  At one time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuilding a temple came from a regular book seller from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãJoseph Bocabella.  In those distant times, he led the community of admirers of Joseph.  In 1872, Bocabella arrived in the town of Loreto, in which there was a house that, according to legend, served as the monastery of Jesus, Mary and Joseph.  The bookseller was so fascinated by the beauty of the temple that he decided to create a copy in his hometown. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sagrada surname cathedral" class="if" height="339" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026454.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a construction eventually turned into a decision to build an unusual structure in the <span>center of Barcelona.</span>  However, due to lack of funds, Bocabel managed to acquire land only on the outskirts of the city. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Sagrada Familia Cathedral, as our tourists often call it, was founded on March 19, 1882.  In general, it is worth noting that the name of the building correctly sounds slightly different - the Sagrada Familia temple.  The start of construction turned into an important event in which representatives of the clergy and city authorities took part.  The architect of the Sagrada Familia was Francisco del Villar.  It was he who proposed the construction of a temple in the Neo-Gothic style, which was incredibly popular in that era.  However, during the construction, the architect had disagreements with the performers, so in the future he moved away from participating in the project. </p><h2>  Ingenious Gaudi </h2><p>  In 1883, the further construction of the Sagrada Familia Cathedral in Barcelona was led by the famous Gaudi, who in turn made significant changes to the project and decided to erect a gigantic structure.  According to his idea, around the church will be built stone columns like trees, covered arches and benches for parishioners. </p><p>  According to the architect, the Sagrada Familia Cathedral was supposed to accept up to 14 thousand parishioners at the same time.  Ever since childhood, Antonio Gaudi had an extraordinary fantasy, which greatly differed from his comrades and peers.  It seemed that the boy had some special connection with the world around him, he incredibly appreciated everything that was created by nature.  Antonio could spend hours admiring the clouds and imagining that these were trees, fairy-tale characters or animals.  Even drops of dew in the grass and flowers aroused the young man's interest and admiration.  All the objects he saw, he turned in his fantasies into something unusual. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sagrada last name in barcelona" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026448.jpg" width="600"></div>

His creations were always beautiful and natural, and any unusual ideas corresponded to strict engineering rules.  The architect used in his practice the latest thoughts of the time, for which he can safely be called an innovator. </p><p>  Such a difficult science as sopromat was already then known to Gaudi, and he actively used his knowledge. </p><h2>  Gaudi's plans </h2><p>  In order for the Sagrada Familia temple in Barcelona to look more magnificent, Gaudi noted in his sketches that the height of the central tower of Christ should be a meter lower than <span>Mount Montjuic.</span>  Religious architect believed that the creation of human hands cannot be higher than God's creation.  According to plans, the facades were supposed to be decorated with scenes on the theme of the birth and resurrection of Christ. </p><p>  Gaudi has repeatedly been reproached for the fact that construction is proceeding too slowly.  To which the architect replied that his brainchild was in no hurry.  Initially, it was assumed that the temple will be built on donations.  However, Antonio was so obsessed with his project that he invested all his available funds in the construction.  But this money was not enough, I had to collect it at home. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tickets to sagrada last name" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026457.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  But, unfortunately, in 1926 the life of a brilliant architect was cut short.  At that time, Gaudi was 74 years old.  From his project, he managed to realize only a part - to create one tower of the Sagrada Familia, the facade of Christmas, crypts and apse.  From 1954 to this day, construction is ongoing. </p><h2>  Followers of Gaudi </h2><p>  In the nineties of the last century, a new architect, Subirax, took up the temple.  He set about creating a facade called The Passion of Christ.  An interesting fact is that the new architect was a real atheist, unlike the deeply religious Gaudi.  When Subirax received such a tempting offer to make sculptures for the design of facades, he spent a year studying the work of Gaudi.  And only in 1987 he set to work.  Subirax is currently working with several other architects on the naves, courtyard and choirs of the Sagrada Familia Temple.  Absolutely all the decor of the building contains Christian symbols.  When viewing the elements of the building, it seems as if you are turning over the pages of the Bible. </p><p>  A total of eighteen towers are planned.  All of them will be at different heights.  The Tower of Christ is the highest; a cross will be located on its spire.  The tower of the Virgin Mary will have a slightly smaller size.  The next four will symbolize the evangelists.  Also in the temple are planned twelve bells, which personify the number of apostles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sagrada surname tower" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026460.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Despite the fact that the Cathedral of Sagrada Familia is not finished inside, as well as outside, in 2000 it was consecrated by Pope Benedict Sixteenth.  The temple is officially recognized as suitable for church services. </p><h2>  Facade of Christmas </h2><p>  The facade of the Nativity was built by Gaudi himself, through it visitors enter the temple.  Initially, the building was erected, which was divided into three entrances to the internal halls.  It is equipped with four bell towers with high spiers in honor of the holy apostles Jude, Barnabas, Simon and Matthew.  The open light tower structure was built taking into account the output of the sounds of the bells, which makes them look like blinds. </p><h2>  Facade of Glory </h2><p>  The facade of Glory overlooks Calle Mallorca Street.  Its theme is connected with the fall and virtue.  The building looks towards the coast, so it is exposed to the sun throughout the day.  Even this has a deep meaning, since Glory is the light that brings joy and spiritual happiness.  The construction of this part of the temple complex has begun recently.  But there are already clear plans and storylines that will demonstrate biblical stories. </p><h2>  Facade of the Passion </h2><p>  But the facade of the Passion was conceived by the brilliant Gaudi, who wanted to depict on it paintings that show the last days of Christ's life.  All sculptures are made so masterfully that they involuntarily attract people's attention. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temple sagrada last name" class="if" height="224" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026462.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The gates of the facade of the Passion are unusually made.  A fragment of a text from the Gospel is carved on bronze, in which there is a narration about the earthly life of the Son of God. </p><h2>  Monastery </h2><p>  The monastery, according to the plan, will have to be located outside the temple, framing it with a ring, which will be interrupted only in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe gate and apse.  The building should fulfill the role of a kind of protection against street noise and fuss. </p><h2>  Apse </h2><p>  Between the facades of Christmas and the Passion is Apse.  It was built one of the first, so it is made in the Gothic style.  Apse is dedicated to venerating the memory of the mother of God.  Its front part is still under construction.  Many figures and elements have already been completed, but much remains to be completed.  For example, it is planned to erect inside statues that personify the founders of a religious order.  And at the very top should be built the dome of St. Mary, which will crown the star. </p><h2>  Inside </h2><p>  Non-standard saw Gaudi and the interior of the temple.  As a load distribution on numerous arches and columns, he decided to use tree columns.  Such an ingenious idea gave beauty to the interior of the temple. </p><p>  The construction of the cathedral inside continues to this day, but still visitors have the opportunity to purchase tickets to the Sagrada Familia and visit this amazing place, because there is something to see.  Inside the building, a special atmosphere is generally felt, which is partly achieved by the play of light.  The fact is that Gaudi himself believed that the bright illumination of the inner part could violate the harmony of the decor and would not create an atmosphere of peace of mind.  Therefore, light enters the building through colored glass stained-glass windows, which creates a special mood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sagrada last name how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026472.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Already, everyone can take the elevator to the belfry, which are interconnected by bridges.  And in the basement of the building is a museum where you can learn about all the stages of construction. </p><h2>  Museum </h2><p>  After work on the crypt was completed, the museum was opened in 1961.  It is now open to visitors.  In it you can see unusual exhibits, such as the originals of drawings and drawings by Antonio Gaudi, which are stored in special rooms with dim lighting for maximum protection of the paper from the influence of external factors. </p><p>  In addition, in the museum you can look at photographs that depict all stages of construction, there are even photos from Gaudi themselves. </p><p>  On the shelves of the museum are collected various models of architectural elements of the temple and other unusual exhibits dedicated to all stages of the design and construction of the Atonement Church dedicated to the Holy Family.  Also here you can see many reproductions of the works of Gaudi, who loved Catalonia very much and rarely traveled beyond its borders. </p><h2>  How to get to Sagrada Familia? </h2><p>  Tourists who decide to see the temple will be interested to know how to get to their destination by transport.  It is most convenient to use the subway.  You need to go out at the Sagrada Familia station (5th and 2nd line).  In addition, shuttle buses 19, 43, 34, 50 go to the temple. Do not forget about the City Tower and Bas Turistic tourist buses, which run on special routes that cover the most interesting places in Barcelona. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sagrada last name inside" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2026475.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Sagrada Familia address: Barcelona city, Mallorca. </p><p>  Experts make a variety of forecasts regarding the completion of construction.  According to the plan, the temple should be completely completed in ten years.  The unusual acoustics, which was thought up by Gaudi himself, will make it possible to gather 2.5 thousand singers in the church to perform the solemn liturgy to the accompaniment of several organs.  The temple should become one of the most ambitious creations in world architecture. </p><h2>  Tickets </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the temple is not yet fully completed, it can already be visited.  Tickets for the Sagrada Familia can be bought at the box office near the cathedral.  Their cost varies between 15-29 euros, and for children tickets will cost a little cheaper (15 euros a ticket without a guide; if you plan to climb the tower, you will have to pay 22 euros without a guide and 29 euros with a guide). </p><p>  The temple is now incredibly popular.  During the tourist season, a large number of people gather near the box office.  Experienced tourists recommend buying tickets with a Russian audio guide so that you can find out the history of the construction of the greatest temple.  The cathedral has its own website, where you can also book an excursion.  But unfortunately, the resource is not equipped with Russian navigation. </p><h2>  Reviews of tourists about visiting the temple </h2><p>  Enthusiastic reviews about the Sagrada Familia give reason to recommend the temple to visit.  The unique monumental structure is worth seeing.  Many even consider the cathedral the main attraction of Barcelona.  Of course, the capital of Catalonia is already full of interesting places, but the Sagrada Familia is something special and unique.  Tourists note that inside the temple is stunningly beautiful.  It seems that you are in the garden, among the trees, because the columns are made in the form of plants.  The cathedral has a very special lighting thanks to the numerous color stained-glass windows.  In the inner part of the temple you are not overcome by painful feelings, which is characteristic of many buildings of this kind.  A large amount of sunlight makes the interior space incredibly beautiful.  Still, Gaudi managed to achieve his plan. </p><p>  Outside it is worth admiring the facades of the building.  So far, only two of them are ready.  According to tourists, it is clearly visible which of them was performed by the great master.  Although modern construction is carried out in the same vein as in the time of Gaudi, the difference between the hand of a genius and the masters of our time is visible to the naked eye. </p><p>  You probably will not see such magnificence anywhere else, so the temple is worth a visit.  But only tourists recommend purchasing tickets over the Internet in advance, otherwise you will have to stand in a very long line. </p>
