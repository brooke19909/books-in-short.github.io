Sanatoriums of the Irkutsk region: reviews, prices</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Spring is the time when you want to flutter like a butterfly.  However, this is not for everyone: someone has not moved away from hibernation, someone is tired at work, someone is lacking vitamins, someone is not happy with his body.  And someone just can not boast of health.  That is why in spring we are drawn to nature, closer to the sun and greenery.  One Sunday family walk in the park - and a charge of energy for the whole week is provided.  Of course, this is not enough for someone.  Then vouchers for the sanatorium are purchased, directions are sought from the doctor, and those in need of recovery look forward to finding out where fate will throw him. </p><p>  Bright leaflets often promise us cozy houses in the woods, the latest equipment, clean furnishings, attentive staff.  And we, looking at happy people from advertising booklets, believe that it will be so.  Unfortunately, it happens that after arriving at a place of rest, we are disappointed in the surroundings, although wellness treatments are pleasant to everyone.  Fortunately, there are also sanatoriums that are good not only for brochures.  You will not be mistaken, choosing the sanatoriums of the Irkutsk region.  Their features, as well as one of the best places of recreation in Sayansk ("Cedar") today will be discussed. </p><h2>  Treatment and rest in the Irkutsk region </h2><p>  If you want real Siberian health, be sure to pay attention to this region.  So, what sanatoriums of the <span>Irkutsk region</span> really deserve attention?  There are health facilities for every taste.  So, for example, luck is to get a ticket to the sanatorium of the FSB "Baikal", located one and a half meters from the lake of the same name.  People come here who need treatment of the musculoskeletal system, respiratory system, nervous, circulatory, genitourinary systems, as well as patients with metabolic and nutritional disorders.  Of the procedures there are all kinds of physical procedures, among which are the treatment with local mineralized waters and sapropelic mud.  Striking abundance of practices aimed at peace of mind, improving energy. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sayansk sanatorium cedar" class="if" height="420" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/670595.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Among other sanatoriums, "Angara" stands out, in the list of specialized areas of which there is gerontology.  This means that special attention will be paid to the elderly.  However, the sanatorium is family-friendly, families with children from four years old are accepted.  In addition to the standard set of procedures, they also offer apitherapy - treatment with bee stings. </p><p>  Wellness center with the unusual name "Nukut Matsesta" definitely deserves attention.  He specializes in skin diseases, gynecology and urology.  Mineral waters are offered, both low-mineralized and sulphide waters for baths and massage. </p><h2>  Sayansk.  Sanatorium "Cedar" and others </h2><p>  This village does not have beautiful views or an interesting history: it is relatively young - 45 years in 2015!  City life is just beginning.  Nevertheless, the city of Sayansk has already managed to gain considerable popularity among tourists.  The thing is in the health centers located in coniferous forests near the city.  The sanatoriums of Sayansk, and there are only two of them, use the air saturated with needles as the main treatment tool.  The first is Cedar, the most popular and already loved by many visitors.  We should talk more about him, which we will do in the next chapter. </p><p>  The second sanatorium is Vostok-Ulan, designed for one and a half hundred guests.  The specialization is quite narrow: the musculoskeletal system, the genitourinary system and the central nervous system.  This institution is located near Lake Ulan, uses the mineral water "Ordai".  It is also the main factor of treatment and the reason why the creation of sanatoriums in the city of Sayansk (Irkutsk region) was appropriate and justified.  Mostly families with sick children come here.  For younger vacationers organize events, conduct a cultural program. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sayansk Irkutsk region" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/670594.jpg" width="550"></div>  Of the minuses, an unpretentious interior and a small dining room should be noted.  Nevertheless, this sanatorium in the city of Sayansk (Irkutsk region) receives hundreds of adults and children every year for up to 21 days.

There are several reasons for this popularity.  Firstly, it is nature, nature, and again nature.  The places are quite picturesque, quiet and calm.  No noise except the whisper of coniferous forest. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sanatoriums of the irkutsk region" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/670584.jpg" width="460"></div>  Secondly, it is a service.  As the owners promise, he is above all.  This consists in first-class medical care, and in a comfortable environment, and in an organized program for vacationers.  How good it is there can be judged from the reviews on the sanatorium's website: they write that it‚Äôs even better than at sea!  And finally, the prices, which also (according to the administration) are pleasantly surprising.

    <h2>  Sanatorium of a true family vacation </h2><p>  There are motels that are only called family.  In fact, there are neither proper conditions nor specially selected nutrition, and the parents have to deal with the child.  This situation is definitely not about the city of Sayansk.  Sanatorium "Cedar" is pleased with guests from the age of four, accompanied by their parents, as well as young tourists from seven years.  There is a system of benefits for children.  They will not have to get bored in the sanatorium, because there is a sports ground, a games room, and animators. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sanatorium cedar Sayansk prices" class="if" height="380" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/670612.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, a ticket to the sanatorium "Cedar" is a great gift for your grandparents.  For a minimal price, they can improve their health, calm their nerves, and gain energy.  And the picturesque views will evoke pleasant memories in them. </p><h2>  Who is in the sanatorium? </h2><p>  First, we note that before you go to the bosom of nature to the sanatorium, you need to get a spa card.  For her, contact your doctor.  So, rehabilitation in the city of Sayansk (sanatorium "Kedr") is offered for adults, families with children 4-15 years old, and for the summer period - from 7 years old unaccompanied.  It‚Äôs just that you can‚Äôt get to the sanatorium either. </p><p>  The health institution specializes in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, upper respiratory tract, problems of blood supply, bones and muscles, the endocrine system, central nervous system, as well as diseases of the urology and skin.  The sanatorium is engaged in weight correction.  Importantly, they help with occupational diseases associated with chemical production.  This can be explained by the fact that Sayansk is a chemical industry city, therefore skin injuries resulting from work with salts of heavy metals are common.  In total, the sanatorium "Cedar" can accommodate up to 270 people.  Settlement is on schedule. </p><h2>  Procedures </h2><p>  The resources used by the sanatorium are based on a microclimate and healing air.  In addition, balneological resources are used, in other words, mineral waters.  Sayan water "Ordai" is the basis of the procedures.  There are two types of it.  The first has a fairly broad specialization: heals blood, and skin, and the musculoskeletal system, and the problems of gynecology and urology.  The second is aimed at combating diseases of the digestive system. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="health resorts of Sayansk" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13530/670591.jpg" width="600"></div>  The set of physiotherapy procedures is quite wide.  However, pay much more attention to bathtubs.  They come here not only with mineral water, but also with turpentine and selenium.  Pay attention to your own sanatorium speleoclimatic chamber with potassium-magnesium salts.  Do not go past applications and wraps of peat mud.  As in all sanatoriums, there are many mental therapies, procedures for influencing the psyche (color, aroma and so on).

    <h2>  Entertainment and infrastructure </h2><p>  Even resting sometimes bothers.  Therefore, between procedures, get distracted by concerts, events and programs for adults and children, excursions, discos, film screenings, and walks.  Have you met in a sanatorium?  You can continue the conversation in the cafeteria.  If you are bored, then you can go to the library.  There are many sports activities: pool, ice rink, gym. </p><h2>  Sanatorium "Cedar" (Sayansk).
