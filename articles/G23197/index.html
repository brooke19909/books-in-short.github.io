    <p>  The reviews on Bon Repos are quite impressive.  Guests not only speak positively about the hotel, but also admire the resort itself.  The city of Calella is conditionally divided into two equal parts.  The left side resembles the old city, where narrow streets are located, on which it is incredibly pleasant to walk.  Located in tourist complexes on this side, the windows overlook the yards of local residents, old buildings and more.  Hotel Bon Repos is located on the right side of the resort, the streets around the hotel are quiet, filled with peace.  Rest here is very comfortable, you can have a good night's sleep and just enjoy the silence. </p><p>  The territory of the Bon Repos hotel, service, food, rooms - everything is commendable.  The area is not very large, but at the same time there are well-placed children's facilities, swimming pools.  Crown of trees create a shadow, giving the courtyard a special coziness. </p><p>  The rooms are clean enough.  They are small, but comfort is present here.  From the windows of the rooms are completely different types, it all depends on the category.  You can take apartments with mountain, sea or pool views. </p><p>  The staff is extremely polite, speaks many languages.  It is very comfortable.  Any whims are executed instantly, even some errors on the part of the tourist are forgiven, which many are even surprised at. </p><p>  Breakfast is buffet style or you can order a classic English breakfast.  Other meals are quite nutritious, the choice of dishes is good, but it can not be called very diverse.  There is very little baking, but there is always a lot of sweets, fresh fruit and ice cream.  In total, the food is quite satisfied.  It is a pleasure to relax in the hotel; this placement definitely deserves attention.  Even tour operators offering permits in the direction of Russia - Spain. Recommend the Bon Repos hotel. </p>
