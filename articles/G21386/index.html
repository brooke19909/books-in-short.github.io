    <p>  <span>Who are the collectors?</span>  How do they affect the client and what can be expected from them?  If possible, the article will examine in detail the collection agency VostokFin. </p><h2>  Who are the collectors? </h2><p>  There is such a company of collectors VostokFin.  How to deal with them, not everyone knows.  After all, many consider these collectors very serious. </p><p>  You can be calm - these are not bandits.  Collectors should only collect debts legally.  They convince debtors to pay off the full amount.  Very often, lawyers who know the laws, security guards, psychologists or financiers are invited to work at a collection agency.  That is, those people who can communicate with people properly. </p><p>  Banks cooperate with collectors on favorable terms.  Most often they pay a certain percentage of the debt.  It all depends on the complexity of the work.  This is done for the simple reason that agency employees are interested in working. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As a rule, collectors do not charge the debt in installments, but require full repayment.  After all, they are so profitable.  They do not think that a person is in trouble, and will not listen to problems.  For them, one thing is important - get your own. </p><h2>  Debt collection </h2><p>  Many people are interested in the actions of VostokFin collectors.  Each company requires a return of the debt in different ways.  It all depends on how experienced people work in the agency.  VostokFin collectors always try to influence the debtor in a cunning way.  They crush psychologically and are judged.  First, look for the weaknesses of a particular person. </p><p>  The collection agency VostokFin collects all the necessary information.  This is not only the address of registration or residence, they are also looking for relatives, friends, neighbors.  First of all, VostokFin agency employees communicate with the debtor himself. </p><h2>  VostokFin Collector Behavior Tactics </h2><p>  Employees of the company at first culturally explain what will happen in one case or another if the debt is not repaid.  As practice has shown, communication with the debtor rarely affects the situation.  After all, if a person could not pay, then there are good reasons for this, and he has no money. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, collectors often influence the situation with the help of close relatives or friends.  Simply put, they put pressure on people.  They call or come not only home, but also to work.  Regular calls and visits begin.  Reviews about this agency are mostly negative. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If the above methods do not help, then an application is filed with the court against the debtor.  A person is summoned and a specific monthly amount claimed in court.  It all depends on what kind of income the debtor has.  The percentage is calculated from them, and the person is obliged to pay by the deadline indicated by the judge. </p><p>  Remember that the law on collectors is small.  Basically, it prescribes the rules of cultural communication and tactics of behavior. </p><h2>  Collector Powers </h2><p>  If you are visited by VostokFin agency collectors, do not rush to talk with them and answer their questions.  To get started, see who they are and what their rights are.  Russian legislation does not have specific rights for collectors.  Therefore, they often improperly communicate with people and violate laws.  What can collectors do if you owe money? </p><p>  The collector has the right to call the debtor from 7.00 to 22.00.  Moreover, he is obliged to communicate culturally with a person.  An employee of the company recalls the amount of debt and the bank where you need to pay. </p>

    <p>  If the debtor claims that he does not have money now, the collector must offer an alternative and find a way out of the situation.  To do this, asks a person to offer their own schedule for paying debts.  After all, both sides benefit from a positive result. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Since the law does not indicate the number of calls and reminders about debt, collectors can very long and fruitfully remind themselves of themselves by any means.  Most often they call or come home.  It is VostokFin who often complains about people who are in an unpleasant situation. </p><h2>  Abuse of authority </h2><p>  VostokFin collectors communicate poorly.  How to deal with them in such a situation?  Many people claim that they greatly exceed their authority.  They use their power over man, and it comes to the point of absurdity.  They call at any time of the day or night and do not allow people to live in peace.  This is a violation of human rights.  Therefore, you can safely write a <span>statement to the prosecutor.</span>  Remember!  Collectors are not allowed to call after 22.00 to 7.00. </p>

    <p>  People often complain about the VostokFin agency, because they not only call, but also threaten the life of both the debtor and those close to him.  You have the right to sue them for such communication.  However, conversations of this nature must be recorded on the recorder.  After all, evidence in court is needed.  If you receive SMS from VostokFin, you do not need to respond to it.  If this happened at night, do not rush to delete the message.  Most likely, you will need it in court. </p><p>  VostokFin collectors love to threaten criminal liability.  Many people believe.  However, if a person has paid a loan at least once, then there is no intent to fraud.  Therefore, no one will call you to the police. </p><p>  VostokFin employees often persuade the debtor to take a loan from another bank in order to repay the debt.  They may also offer to buy equipment, real estate, etc. Do not succumb to provocation.  What can collectors do if you refuse to sell your property?  Lawyers say that they can‚Äôt do anything else since they have no right to do so. </p><h2>  How does a debtor communicate with VostokFin collectors? </h2><p>  Do not know what to do in such a situation?  The main thing is not to worry.  Are you tired of vostokfin collectors?  Lawyers know how to deal with them.  Remember!  It is necessary to communicate with collectors in a polite manner.  Do not try to be rude to them.  After all, they can record your conversation.  Therefore, avoid harsh words and utterances. </p>

    <p>  You should not show your weaknesses.  No matter what the employee of the agency tells you, try to be calm.  After all, if the collector understands where your weak point is, he will press on it until you agree to all the conditions. </p><p>  If, nevertheless, unwanted guests in the form of collectors have come to you, you have the right to demand: </p><ul><li>  A document in which employee data is indicated. </li><li>  Power of attorney.  It must be transferred by the bank to the agency.  The power of attorney indicates that the company has the right to collect loan debt from the debtor. </li></ul><p>  If employees refuse to provide you with the necessary data, you have the right to refuse to communicate with them until they provide you with documents. </p><h2>  Court and collectors </h2><p>  As a rule, debt collection companies try to solve problems on their own.  It is not beneficial for them to go to court.  After all, they will pay a lot of money.  What then would be the benefit of working with a bank if <span>legal costs</span> would be much more expensive ?! </p>

    <p>  When a person is unable to pay the debt, collectors sometimes try to intimidate the court.  Do not be afraid of it.  If the case has taken such a turn, you even benefit.  Agree to collectors sue you.  In the meantime, take an income certificate from your place of work. </p><p>  If you really find yourself in a difficult financial situation, the court will take your side.  You only need to provide supporting documents.  This can be a certificate of a serious illness, a death certificate of a loved one and other serious documents.  The court decides to pay the debt.  However, it will take into account your income.  Therefore, debtors are often prescribed small monthly payments. </p><h2>  VostokFin: the search for the debtor </h2><p>  They do not have the right to look for a person at work and even more so to talk about financial problems.  It is against the law.  VostokFin employees have the right to communicate only with the debtor himself.  If they call, and even more so threaten relatives, friends or parents, feel free to write a statement to the prosecutor. </p><p>  Now you understand who the VostokFin agency collectors are.  How to deal with them, you already know.  The main rule: do not be afraid and do not let yourself be intimidated. </p>
