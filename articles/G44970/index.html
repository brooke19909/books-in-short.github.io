    <p>  The fishing gained great popularity in the 19th century.  Boxes and spinning wheels from the Mezen River spread along Pinega and Onega.  Mezen painting is a <span>decorative and applied art.</span>  It starts in the days of Slavic tribes. </p><h2>  Mezen painting.  Source Discussion </h2><p>  What gave rise to such a painting is unknown.  Some historians say that the Mezensky painting comes from Komi, while others believe that the ancient Greeks with their drawings were the primary source.  This is currently difficult to establish, since hundreds of years have passed since its inception.  Art has gained wide recognition since the beginning of 1904.  <span>Academician Rybakov</span> found elements of Scythian culture in the painting.  Rock paintings of Zaonezhye were seen in it by Zhegalov S.K. </p><h2>  Familiarization of children with folk craft </h2><p>  Acquaintance of preschool children with the Mezen craft is an introduction to the culture and life of the northern peoples.  When applying patterns and mural ornaments, children's artistic taste develops, the vocabulary is enriched with the names of the ornament: rhombus, curl, zigzag, spiral, contour, etc. Children learn to draw simple geometric shapes, animals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="acquaintance of preschool children with the Mezen craft" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21280/568255.jpg" width="336"></div>  On the one hand, the patterns of the ornament, especially animals, are elaborate and abstract.  Preschoolers love to copy the deer or horse drawings proposed by the teacher.  Each image differs from another in the appearance of additional elements.  They are so attractive and understandable that children are happy to repeat them.  This once again confirms that this painting was born as a rock.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Mezen spinning wheel </h2><p>  Spinning wheels are the products of the Mezen masters, who were the first in ancient times to be honored with murals.  Their uniqueness consisted not only in the sophistication of the drawing, but also in form.  They were made from a single piece of wood, and the root served as their bottom. </p><p>  The face of each spinning wheel was painted the same way: the upper part depicted the sky, the middle part depicted the earth, and the lower part represented the underworld.  In the sky there should have been birds and a window for communication with higher powers.  Mandatory elements were deer, horses, and a tree with a bird.  Horses and deers were also shown in the last row, but they were black.  On the back of the spinning wheel there could be an inscription, for example, dedicated to a loved one, if the spinning wheel was a gift from a husband to his wife.  A spinning wheel was also a necessary attribute of every northern girl.  When girlish gatherings were going, each set her own spinning wheel so that her face was visible, which was individually painted.  When the girl got married and moved to live with her husband, the spinning wheel followed her and was called self-owned.  The spinning wheel in the house was in a special position and was treated with honor and reverence. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mezen products" class="if" height="274" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21280/568331.jpg" width="200"></div></h2><h2>  Mural technique </h2><p>  In those days, the exclusively male population was engaged in such a prestigious craft as the Mezen painting.  The tradition was to inherit it.  Two colors have always been present in the Mezen painting: red and black.  The first Mezen drawings were painted in red clay and black soot, which were dissolved in larch resin.  Drawings were written with a wooden stick, <span>feathers of birds</span> or a brush made of human hair.  The pattern was applied to untreated wood, then the product was covered with drying oil, and from this the tree became golden. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Since then, the technique of applying the Mezen painting has not changed, with the exception of the instrument for applying drawings.  Currently, the brush is preferred. </p><p>  The ornament was not arbitrary, but symbolic.  The interpretation of some characters has already been lost, but the technique has remained the same.  All elements of the ornament are static and only due to the fact that they are repeatedly repeated, dynamics and movement appear in the figure. </p><h2>  Mezen painting, symbolism, elements of ornament </h2><p>  Symbols go back to mythology and reflect the culture and <span>life values ‚Äã‚Äãof the</span> peoples of the North.  The drawings are characterized by multi-tiered patterning, which indicates a shamanic origin. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="wood painting mezenskaya painting" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21280/568253.jpg" width="298"></div>  Three levels symbolize three worlds: sky, earth and dungeon.  At the lower and middle levels are animals: horses, deer.  The upper level, heavenly, is filled with birds.  Animals are drawn in red and black colors, which can also be interpreted as a combination of the living and the dead worlds.  The horse among the peoples of the north is in a special position and the amulet is of importance.  It symbolizes the beginning of life and is also a source of well-being.  Each level is separated by a strip, which consists of repeating patterns.

    <p>  The land in the figures is indicated by a straight line.  If it is located below, then this is the earthly firmament, if above, then the heavens.  The earth in the Mezen painting is of great importance, since it is fertility, protection, and a mother's amulet.  The graphic image of the earth in the figures is a square. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Water in the figure can be indicated by oblique lines.  It has several meanings.  Heavenly water that irrigates the earth as rains.  This life-giving moisture can be hail.  It can be represented by a <span>wavy line,</span> located next to a straight line or near <span>waterfowl.</span> </p><p>  Wind.  The small short lines that accompany the ornament indicate wind or fresh air.  This element is associated with mysticism and has a divine beginning.  It is that which exists, but is invisible and intangible.  In addition to divine meaning, this symbol can denote demonic images and represent destructive power.  Like any wind, it can be light and pleasant, and it can carry fury and destruction, but without it earthly existence is impossible.  This is a creative beginning.  The Mezen painting depicts the wind as a conquered element in the form of dashes on crossed lines.  This composition is similar to <span>a windmill.</span> </p><h2>  The meaning of the symbol "spiral" </h2><p>  According to academician B. Rabakov, the spiral in the Mezen painting refers to mythology.  This is the sun that moves in orbit.  The Mezen painting is replete with many spirals that are present throughout the drawing.  They are everywhere: spinning around animals and are present in the ornament.  A spiral can denote not only the sun, but also tornadoes, whirlpools and is the most common element of decor.  Spirals are different.  If the spiral is compressed </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Mezen painting symbolism elements of the ornament" class="if" height="382" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21280/568172.jpg" width="236"></div>  it stands for energy ball.  Close to the circle symbolizes the cyclical change of seasons.  The combination of female and male energy means a double spiral.  A spiral tending upwards corresponds to the male energy, while tending downwards corresponds to the female.  The duality of the spiral may also mean childbearing.

    <h2>  Elements symbolizing prosperity in the painting of the Mezen craftsmen </h2><p>  The symbolism and elements of the Mezen painting, which symbolized prosperity, were depicted everywhere, wishing themselves well.  They were placed on dishes, which foreshadowed never to starve, on wedding dresses, which meant being prolific and having a complete family.  In general, the entire Mezen painting is devoted to abundance.  This is expressed in images of flowers, fruits, seeds.  Sometimes a double row was used, where the symbols were arranged in the order of the cells of a chessboard.  Rhombus as a symbol of abundance was often located in a continuous chain, which indicated the tree of life. </p><h2>  The meaning of the symbol "birds" </h2><p>  A bird is a popular sign that means gifts and a harbinger of good news, especially if it sits on top of a tree.  The bird is perhaps the most common symbol that is used in the drawings of craftsmen.  Northern peoples have a tradition of placing birds from a tree in the corner of their hut, which must certainly be red (suggests an imaginary tree).  Swans, geese, ducks designated deceased ancestors who protect and help living relatives in a difficult moment. </p><h2>  Animals in symbolism </h2>

Moreover, in the Mezen painting, the horses have an unusual color that is not characteristic of these animals.  Their masters painted in red and orange.  Sometimes they were shaded with bars.  Fancy feathers were often painted instead of hooves.  The horses' legs were unnaturally thin and long.

    <p>  In the drawings of horses, it is customary to place them opposite each other often with warring riders.  Around animals often depicted solar symbols. </p><h2>  The art of decorating with paints </h2><p>  Mezenskaya painting - arts and crafts.  In addition to spinning wheels, Mezenskaya painting was used to decorate household utensils (boxes, spinning wheels, caskets, bast baskets, chests, ladles, cups, spoons, sieves).  Mezen products painted in the spring.  Making them for sale was a great help in every household.  Boxes at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century were painted, unlike spinning wheels, by large sockets consisting of ovals and circles.  Inclined bands decorated hoops. </p><p>  Mezen products are still highly valued by lovers of folk art.  The art of painting to the master of the village of Selishche, Ivan Fatyanov, was inherited by his father.  He skillfully painted onions and successfully sold them.  The most ancient Russian dynasty of painting masters was Aksenovs.  Fedotovs, Novikovs, Shishkins, Kuzmins are also known for their craft.  The most outstanding master artist, whose painting did not leave anyone indifferent, because he put his whole soul into his work, was Vasily Klimmentevich Fedotov, whom his fellow villagers called Vasya Klimovich. </p><p>  Modern scholars studying Mezen products consider painting on them to be agricultural.  This is indicated by numerous rectangles that symbolize plowed arable land.  In animals such as the duck and the horse, the symbols of sunset and sunrise are recognized.  In northern peoples, these animals have always been associated with the sun: duck-salt marshes, horse-fire. </p><p>  Mezen products contain in their drawings an image of a ‚Äúchicken‚Äù, which also decorated the roofs of houses along with horses.  ‚ÄúThe hens and the horse on the roof are quieter in the house,‚Äù is a well-known Slavic proverb. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="products of mesen masters" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21280/568197.jpg" width="498"></div>

    <h2>  Butcher painting nowadays </h2><p>  Now in the North in such cities as Arkhangelsk and Severodvinsk, many souvenirs are made in the style of Mezen painting. </p><p>  Modern Mezen painting is somewhat different from the ancient.  She became not so graphic.  She is softer.  This is because the tool used to change the pattern has changed ‚Äî the feathers have changed brushes.  Mezen painting nowadays takes on a different meaning.  Now only symbols and images are used that do not speak so eloquently about the life of the northern peoples. </p>
