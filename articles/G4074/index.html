However, there is one natural attraction that will turn all travelers' ideas about a tropical paradise. </p><p>  An amazing corner with fantastic views resembling alien landscapes has become a popular tourist destination. </p><h2>  Cone hills </h2><p>  On the island of <span>Bohol (Bohol)</span> is a unique natural formation, about which the locals make legends.  The area, called Chocolate Hills, causes a lot of controversy among scientists. </p><p>  This unusual attraction is loved by travelers from all over the world who dream of enjoying magical beauties. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chocolate hills" class="if" height="295" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1271478.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is still difficult for many to believe that more than a thousand hilly geological formations, inside which there are no karst caves, are not the work of human hands.  Perfectly shaped brown cones were first named Carmen Hills, until one vacationer from America compared them to chocolate truffles, since then the name Chocolate Hills has taken root, and the island‚Äôs popularity has grown several times. </p><h2>  Ancient legends of sightseeing </h2><p>  The indigenous people keep several legends about how the Chocolate Hills actually appeared.  The Philippines was once a territory where the giants lived, staging a real battle for the right to be a winner.  For many days they threw enormous boulders at each other, competing who would throw next.  In the end, the giants reconciled without cleaning up, and on the island there were traces of their fierce battle in the form of a pitted surface on which mountains of sand and stones, covered with grass covered over time, rested. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chocolate hills philippines how to get" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1271457.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is another, very romantic legend about a strong giant who fell in love with an ordinary girl.  And when the young beauty died, the youth‚Äôs grief was so great that he cried without stopping, remembering how happy he was with his beloved.  His tears froze and turned into large mountains, reminiscent of a terrible loss. </p><h2>  Numerous versions of scientists </h2><p>  Geologists studying the Chocolate Hills also cannot clearly say about their origin.  The basic version is as follows: natural formations in the form of an ideal cone consist of solid limestone, which is not subject to weathering, and underneath lies a layer of clay that is resistant to groundwater. </p><p>  According to another theory, such hills were formed after the eruption of active volcanoes, and traces of their vital activity were covered with bark.  Some experts are sure that millions of years ago this territory was the bottom of the ocean on which calcareous deposits grew.  After draining the reservoir, heavy rains and strong winds made their contribution, honing the Chocolate Hills in the form of cones. </p><p>  Not the most popular, but taking place, the opinion of scientists says that the coral deposits in this place gradually rose under the influence of soil erosion, covered with vegetation and limestone bark.  But so far no one has come to the general conclusion about the appearance of amazing slides, the only thing all the experts agree on is the miraculous nature of the grassy hills.  It is believed that no civilization could have created such a magnificent creation. </p><h2>  Natural formations </h2><p>  The Chocolate Hills (Philippines) scattered in a chaotic manner, whose heights range from 50 to 150 meters, have a smooth shape without any protrusions.  Green growth grows on their surface, and after the hot sun's rays dry it, perennial grasses change their color to brownish, which gave the name of the local attraction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chocolate hills philippines pics" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1271511.jpg" width="600"></div>

For the first time tourists who visited the island can not even believe that this is a natural beauty, to which people did not put their hands. </p><h2>  Pride of the Government of the Philippines </h2><p>  One of the most breathtaking landscapes of the island nation is the undoubtedly charming Chocolate Hills.  The Philippines even applied for inclusion in the list of new wonders of the world.  Now natural formations are protected by UNESCO and are the pride of the islands.  And the government is opening new resorts for everyone who comes from the farthest corners of the globe to personally enjoy the stunning picture. </p><h2>  Beautiful landscapes </h2><p>  The landscape, of course, does not differ in particular diversity, but it does not always look the same.  At sunrise or sunset, the sun's rays fall on the dark mountains, giving them a gentle shade.  And in the light of the moon, an already incredibly beautiful sight seems an extraterrestrial landscape: mysterious long shadows lie on the hills, changing ideas about reality.  Geological formations illuminated in silver attract the eyes of all lovers who specially visit the romantic area. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chocolate hills philippines" class="if" height="414" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1271469.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In addition, Chocolate Hills <span>(Philippines), whose photos</span> really resemble mountains of finely grated cocoa, are loved by children who sincerely believe in the reality of what is happening. </p><p>  And from the height of a specially equipped viewing platform at any time of the day you can admire the picturesque panorama of an extraordinary miracle of nature. </p><h2>  Chocolate Hills (Philippines): how to get there? </h2><p>  Cone-like relief formations, recognized as a national monument, causing keen interest among scientists and ordinary tourists, are inscribed on the coat of arms and flag of the island of Bohol.  Independently, not within the framework of the tour, you can get to them on the highway from the administrative center of Tagbilaran to the village of Carmen, in which there is not only a local attraction, but also a luxury resort. </p><p>  There is always heavy traffic on the concrete road that crosses the island in half, and local buses run at intervals of 20 minutes.  The cost of an exciting excursion is 50 pesos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="chocolate hills philippines height" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1271460.jpg" width="600"></div>
