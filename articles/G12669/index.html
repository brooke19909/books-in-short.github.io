    <h2>  Location of the complex </h2><p>  The developer chose a very good location for the development of the residential complex "Yubileiny".  Khimki is one of the cities closest to the capital, located right outside the MKAD.  And at the very beginning of the city there was a whole new microdistrict ‚ÄúYubileiny‚Äù.  It is represented not by one building, but by a whole complex of buildings, including a school, two kindergartens, a hotel.  The construction does not stop there and the construction of the shopping center and underground parking continues at an intensive pace. </p><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  Only an incomplete kilometer separates the Yubileiny LCD from the Moscow main transport artery, the MKAD.  It is enough to get off at the roundabout onto Leningradskoye Shosse and after 500 meters turn onto Gorshina Street, as you can get into the microdistrict.  Numerous public transport will take residents of the complex home in 15 minutes from the metro station Skhodnenskaya, Planernaya or Rechnoy Vokzal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  In order not to stand in traffic jams on a busy highway during peak hours or not to get on crowded fixed-route taxis, there are electric trains at the complex's services.  They depart from the Leningrad station to the Khimki station. </p><h2>  Description of the complex </h2><p>  New buildings in Khimki are distinguished by the originality of solutions of real estate developers.  And the described <span>residential complex</span> is being built precisely in the declared quality - integrated.  This is an independent microdistrict, which includes ten different-height residential buildings, kindergartens, a school, underground parking.  Houses are built in height from seventeen to twenty-five floors.  All houses have apartments with a classic correct layout.  The apartment is from thirty-one square meters in one-room to one hundred and twenty-eight meters in three-rooms. </p><p>  Everyone will find housing in this complex that is suitable for him individually.  The Yubileiny residential complex offers economy class housing: the cost per square meter is from fifty eight thousand rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  LCD "Yubileiny" is located right at the very beginning of the city of Khimki, and therefore the whole rich infrastructure is at its disposal.  Nearby is the Khimki Indoor Market, the Liga Shopping Center.  Children living in the complex will not need to go far to school.  Near the complex, quite comprehensive schools and lyceums. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  For those who are sick, nearby is the Khimki Central District Hospital.  And you cannot count hypermarkets and stores near the house.  All facilities providing access to social services are offered on the territory of the city. </p><h2>  Ecological situation and the advantages of living in the complex </h2><p>  New buildings in Khimki and the inhabitants living in them can boast that the houses are located and people live in them in more favorable environmental conditions than the residents of the metropolis.  Though small, but remoteness beyond the ring road brings breaths of fresh air to the city‚Äôs houses.  What the capital cannot boast of.  In addition, to the north of the district there is a park square named after Maria Rubtsova.  And further north, the forest fills the air with oxygen.  On the south side, the complex pleases Butakovsky Bay.  Although it is not intended for swimming, it is good to take a walk along it or ride a pleasure boat in hot weather or in the evening. </p><p>  What are the benefits for residents of the Yubileiny complex?  Some distance from the capital can significantly reduce the cost per square meter of housing.  If in a megalopolis a one-room apartment costs more than three million rubles, then a similar one in the complex can be purchased at a price of up to two million rubles.  This will save a good family budget. </p>

    <p>  The location of the complex beyond the Moscow Ring Road allows its residents to breathe clean air more freely, which has long been inaccessible to Muscovites themselves.  The above square attracts you to walk along the alleys on a quiet evening or relax with your family on weekends. </p><p>  This residential complex has sold more than one thousand apartments provided to young families under a program to improve housing conditions.  This became possible due to the fact that two leading developers took part in the construction at once: Miel and Peak Region.  It was their leaders who contributed to the allocation of square meters to the younger generation of citizens to help them in acquiring living space. </p><p>  In all cases, the Yubileiny residential complex is the best choice for those wishing to change their place of residence, to move from a stuffy, gassed city to a new home for fresh air.  At the same time, do not change your usual way of life, be able to use all the benefits of civilization and all kinds of infrastructure.  Here, no one will have to give up their established habits. </p>
