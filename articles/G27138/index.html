    <h2>  About Dubai beaches </h2><p>  Most of the beaches belong to the largest fashionable hotels.  Dubai is a very expensive city, but public free beaches (including Al-Mamzar beach, located in the park complex of the same name) are, moreover, not bad.  Among them there are quiet, uninhabited areas, and more noisy, with a huge number of vacationers. </p><p>  One of the advantages of visiting free beaches is the ability to take pictures, while in paid areas there are signs prohibiting the use of video and cameras.  Also, there are almost no days forbidden for men to visit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The clear, blue water of Al Mamzar Beach, like many others in Dubai, and the clean, delicate white sand sparkling in the sun attract many vacationers almost all year round. </p>

The latter is especially attractive for lovers of water scooters and water skiing.  There is also a wooden fortress. </p><p>  The main attraction of Al Mamzar Park is its vast, cozy <span>green area,</span> which occupies approximately 55,000 square meters.  meters, with a wide variety of plants: 1,600 palm trees, approximately 300 coconut trees, other plant species (over 6,000). </p>

    <h2>  Features of a beach holiday in the complex </h2><p>  The territory of Al Mamzar beach in Dubai cannot be called very ideal, and there are no special differences from many other beaches.  Very rarely, but here you can also find garbage and sea urchins.  But they are cleaned constantly, and the bottom is cleaned within the area for bathing.  Vacationers on Al Mamzar, as a rule, are not very many.  There are sunbeds and umbrellas, but for a fee, there are well-trained lifeguards. </p><p>  The highlight of the coastline of this coastal section is a kind of bay, thanks to which the beach is protected from waves here, and this is ideal for families with children.  And the water here is for the same reason warmer than on other Dubai beaches.  The presence of a paid pool is an invaluable convenience for vacationers, especially when waves appear in the bay.  There are on the beach, in addition to all the above amenities, and air-conditioned houses, and toilets. </p><p>  The water of Al Mamzar Beach in Dubai, as in the entire Persian Gulf, is clean and very warm (about 30 degrees) water.  The hottest period is from mid-summer (July) to mid-September.  The air temperature in this period reaches 38 degrees.  It is noteworthy that to get to the water under the scorching sun on the sand you can only wear shoes. </p>

    <p>  In this park and beach area you can relax, which is what many tourists from Russia do. </p><h2>  Other entertainment </h2><p>  For lovers of more active pastime, there is the opportunity to take advantage of various attractions in the park.  Al Mamzar beach is attractive because it is located in this complex.  Vast green areas, lush flower beds, beaches with equipped swimming pools delight visitors.  For small children, among a large selection of entertainment, a special place is occupied by the children's railway and several playgrounds equipped with various slides. </p><p>  The convenient location of Al Mamzar beaches allows you to combine swimming and sunbathing on them with more active types of recreation.  Playgrounds for skaters, skateboarders, bike rental, volleyball and basketball courts, a football field - all this is at the service of all vacationers in the park.  Picnic corners are scattered throughout the territory (about 28), equipped with tables, grills and umbrellas. </p><p>  Cultural leisure is represented here, in addition to regular concert programs in the amphitheater, admiring the surrounding nature from the eight-meter observation tower.  Also on site you can rent bungalows and ride through the expanses of the bay on water motorcycles.  The complex is open daily from morning (8:00) to late evening (23.00).  On Wednesdays, only women with children are allowed to visit it. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Al Mamzar beach has been loved by many tourists.  According to vacationers, beach holidays in the complex are quite decent.  Locker rooms are indoor and showers are in good condition.  Only in a shower located in the open air, is the water very hot, due to the strong heating in the sun of pipes supplying water.  Therefore, it is almost impossible to use it in the hottest period. </p><p>  In general, the beach located in Al Mamzar Park is pretty good, affordable and convenient.  There is, as an option, the municipal free beach "Al Mamzar Open Beach", but its arrangement and infrastructure is much different from the paid zone. </p>

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Due to some features of the Dubai transport system, it is best to get to the beach by taxi.  You can hire it from any hotel with little effort.  There are a lot of beaches, but you should not spend time choosing the best, especially since the hotels are far enough from the bay. </p><p>  The beach "Al Mamzar Park" is beautiful, and it is not very far from the hotels.  You can get a taxi in 20-25 minutes.  And the cost of entering the park is 5 dirhams. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Dubai's beaches are a valuable resource, so the authorities of the emirate are making great efforts to create high-quality modern service on the beaches for the convenience and relaxation of guests coming here.  Especially in recent years, considerable financial resources have been invested in arranging and improving the service of recreation areas. </p><p>  Transforming Dubai's beaches and turning them into the best in the world is an important task for the state.  One of the main tasks in all this work is to improve the security system of all beach areas, which is very important in the world today. </p>
