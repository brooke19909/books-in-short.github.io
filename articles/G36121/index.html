The cost is significantly different.  But in the regions it is also different.  In order to understand how the price is formed, it is necessary to analyze the real estate market.  As a rule, the main factor is the development of a certain region.  Compare the prices of the Samara city of Togliatti, the Mordovian capital of Saransk, Nizhny Novgorod Sarov and Orenburg Orsk.  Cities of completely different significance, but one district - the Volga region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate market analysis" class="if" height="407" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1017780.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tolyatti: real estate market </h2><p>  Tolyatti is the capital of the Russian automobile industry.  The population is more than 715 thousand people.  The city is young, spacious, dynamically developing.  There are many factories, but the main one is AvtoVAZ OJSC.  It employs a large half of all city residents.  But after the crisis of 2009, an analysis of the real estate market showed that prices for residential and industrial premises fell sharply.  There is currently no way to stabilize them.  If the pre-crisis value for 1 square.  m in the primary market amounted to about 70,000 p., in the secondary - from 50,000 p., then after it formed almost the same prices - about 40,000-45,000 p.  This led to the fact that developers suffered heavy losses.  In 2014, the situation was also complicated by a sharp jump in the dollar.  Many people bought housing on a mortgage, and as the refinancing rate increased, the level of sales fell sharply.  This was due to the fact that banks lend at too high interest rates.  In this regard, new mortgage programs with reduced rates began to appear for those who purchased primary housing. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Analysis of the <span>commercial real estate</span> market shows a high leap in early 2000.  It was at this time that there was a great demand for production facilities, so the construction of such buildings began in large volumes.  The successful development of AvtoVAZ OJSC has contributed to the economic growth of this region.  In this regard, there was a sharp jump in other areas.  However, after the crisis, businessmen began to prefer leased commercial real estate.  This demand was mainly influenced by the abundance of offers with fairly low prices. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="commercial real estate market analysis" class="if" height="350" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1017771.jpg" width="588"></div>

    <h2>  Real estate in Saransk </h2><p>  The Mordovian capital Saransk is a small city with a low standard of living.  The population is about 300 thousand people.  There are many diverse enterprises.  Analysis of the real estate market in this city shows a direct dependence of prices on the number of people living.  In 2000, housing in the primary market was worth 50,000 rubles; in the secondary market, 35,000 rubles (per 1 sq. M).  There were practically no new buildings at this time.  However, since 2005, the picture has changed dramatically.  Saransk began to actively build up.  Now it is a very beautiful city.  Not only residential neighborhoods are being built, but also temples and parks are being improved. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Analysis of the real estate market of the region in 2015 showed a sharp jump in prices: </p><ul><li>  the primary market offers a cost of 65 thousand rubles .; </li><li>  secondary - from 45 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  In the field of commercial real estate, active growth is also observed.  Currently, many premises for this purpose are being built.  Prices for production facilities - from 20 million rubles. </p><h2>  Sarov: property prices </h2><p>  Sarov is the nuclear center of Russia.  It has the status of a closed city.  Very small both in area and population (about 100 thousand people).  90% of the people living here work at a nuclear plant.  There are many military personnel in the city.  The standard of living of citizens is above average.  There is economic stability, as it is well funded by the state.  After analyzing the Sarov real estate market, we can conclude: the cost is quite high. </p><ul><li>  In the primary market - from 70,000 p., Sometimes reaches 80,000 p. </li><li>  On the secondary - from 45,000 to 65,000 p. </li></ul><p>  Prices almost did not fall even in difficult crisis years. </p><p>  The same can be observed in the commercial real estate market.  For example, a production facility of about 2000 square meters.  m. will cost from 60 million rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="real estate market analysis" class="if" height="304" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1017768.jpg" width="590"></div>

    <h2>  Analysis of the real estate market of Orsk </h2><p>  The small town of Orsk is located in the <span>Orenburg region.</span>  <span>The population</span> is about 230 thousand people.  There are no large factories and significant facilities for the state.  In this regard, the cost of housing is low: </p><ul><li>  one square meter in the primary market is about 40,000 p .; </li><li>  on the secondary - from 27000 p. </li></ul><p>  Commercial property prices are also quite reasonable.  For example, an industrial building is more than 1,500 square meters.  m with warehouses and offices costs about 12 million rubles. </p><p>  After analyzing the real estate market of several cities, we can conclude that factors such as the level of development of industry, population and, of course, state funding influence the formation of prices. </p>
