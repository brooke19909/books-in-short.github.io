This French island has the name Ile de Re (or simply Re).  Of course, he himself is not so famous as a strait with a rich history: there were many naval battles.  From the time of Napoleon, the strait was well strengthened, and to this day it is proud of its Fort Fort Boyar. </p><p>  However, the island, which will be discussed in this article, deserves admiration.  This is one of the amazing places on earth. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City La Rochelle" class="if uuid-2550032" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550032.jpg"></div><h2>  A little bit about the name </h2><p>  This island is one of the most beautiful on the coast of France (west).  Centuries ago, it had the names Sea Flower and <span>White Island.</span>  Today, even among locals, there are different versions about the reasons for the appearance of such beautiful names. </p><p>  And yet, absolutely all of them emphasize the snow-white facades of low houses, beaches covered with snow-white sand, as well as the production of the world-famous "fleur de sel" (a special salt of the highest quality, hand-picked and of great value in gastronomy) for a long time in these places France). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.durindel.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The road connecting the mainland with Ostrov" class="if uuid-2550029" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550029.jpg"></div><h2>  Description of Re Island, attractions </h2><p>  The island is located at the mouth of the Charente River.  The largest settlement is the capital of the island of Saint-Martin-de-Re.  The city, built in the XVII century, has since practically not changed its appearance.  These are cobbled streets with two-story stone houses, lively vegetable and fish markets.  At the entrance to the port, an old mansion with an unusual facade attracts attention. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.claudelustier.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The capital of the island of Saint-Martin-de-Re" class="if uuid-2550063" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550063.jpg"></div><p>  The island is famous not only for centuries of history, but also for its unique sights, as well as long wonderful sandy beaches. </p><p>  Among the historical sights, travelers should pay attention to the following objects: the ruins of the monastery Des Chateliers (XII century), the ancient fort Le Fort de Pree (XVII century), Phare des Baleines (ancient lighthouse), the oyster farm L'Huitriere de Re, as well as du Marais Salant (museum), in the halls of which the history of salt production is presented. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.purefrance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Monastery Des Chateliers" class="if uuid-2550010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550010.jpg"></div><h2>  The bridge connecting the island to the mainland </h2><p>  The road to the island from the port city of La Rochelle lies through a three-kilometer openwork bridge built twenty years ago. </p><p>  It can be reached by transport in 3 hours.  Residents of Re long resisted the construction of this bridge, however a fantastically beautiful white bridge was built, and the island did not change at all: it remained just as magnificent and clean.  This is possibly due to the fact that crowds of tourists did not rush here, which is most likely due to the fact that there are practically no hotels on the island.  There are only fishing huts and old houses, acquired by the old bourgeoisie fifty years ago. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.larochelle-17.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bridge Ile de Re" class="if uuid-2550023" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550023.jpg"></div><h2>  Holidays on the island, services </h2><p>  On a wonderful island in the Atlantic Ocean, tourists can enjoy a wide variety of entertainment and other services.  You can take advantage of cycling and horse riding, as well as take part in sea fishing. </p><p>  There are wonderful beach areas where you can simply sunbathe on the amazing sandy beach and swim in the amazingly clear water, as well as go kite surfing.  Tennis, picnics, skydiving, roller skating, thalassotherapy and much more - all this is available for vacationers. </p><p>  Horseback riding on Re Island takes place during sunset, at the end of the day.  This allows you to observe how the disk of the sun slowly falls over the horizon of the ocean, painting the space of the sky in all shades of bright pink. </p><div class="photo" data-original="posttimeline.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The beaches of the island of Ile de Re" class="if uuid-2550065" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550065.jpg"></div><h2>  Features of the life of the islanders, their activities </h2><p>  In addition to the unique monuments of culture and nature, as well as ancient history, the life of the islanders should be especially noted.  Residents of the island pay great attention to the cleanliness and preservation of nature. </p><p>  270 thousand species of migratory birds live on the protected territory of Re Island.  And in order not to interfere with them, it is customary to move around by car on the island only in order to move to the mainland.  The main transport of these places is bicycles.  For them, special paths are laid along the coast. </p><p>  The most popular and favorite entertainment of the French beau monde, who chose the island of Re several centuries ago, are walks interspersed with tastings of oysters.  Therefore, local residents right by the water, on tables set up here, serve fresh seafood for them.  And it is customary to drink them with white homemade wine. </p><p>  In these places, or rather, in the waters of the Bay of Biscay opposite La Rochelle, they were always engaged in collecting the very famous sea salt and raising oysters, which was a profitable business.  The inhabitants of the island themselves ate oysters, and delivered these products to Paris.  Oyster planters of the island themselves raised oyster "fry" for many other regions of France, since the water in this part of the Atlantic Ocean has exactly the temperature that is suitable for oysters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amusingplanet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Symbol of the island of Re" class="if uuid-2550062" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/2550062.jpg"></div><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thanks to the fortifications on the island, designed and built by the famous military engineer Sebastian de Vauban, the island of Re was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  In France, there are relatively few (about 33), including the islands of Arles, San Michel and Carcassonne. </p><p>  The symbol of Re is still a donkey in his pants.  For many centuries, these animals lived among people who showed great concern for their smaller brothers.  Either because of chastity, or to protect against mosquitoes, these animals were sewn pants, and they flaunt them even today. </p><p>  The most popular souvenirs of shops and trading stalls are ceramic magnets with images of Fort Boyar and island landscapes, as well as donkey figurines. </p>
