    <h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  Tourists from around the world have long had time to fall in love with the <span>Sai Gon</span> Suoi Nhum Resort (Vietnam).  A huge number of positive reviews only confirms the good reputation of this hotel: </p><ul><li>  at night, the hotel and its entire territory looks very beautiful thanks to the spectacular illumination with LED bulbs and garlands; </li><li>  the hotel staff is very polite and friendly, and it is especially worth noting the work of the reception staff, who quickly and without unnecessary delays solve all issues related to check-in; </li><li>  despite the fact that the hotel is located far from the city, and there are no catering facilities nearby, the restaurant prices are not too high; </li><li>  and at the pools and on the beach there are always many free sunbeds, even at a time when the hotel is completely full. </li></ul><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  In addition to the positive comments, tourists also leave a number of negative feedback regarding their stay at Sai Gon Suoi Nhum Resort.  Traveler reviews contain the following negative information: </p><ul><li>  it takes almost 7 hours to get to the hotel from Kamran International Airport, which is simply unbearable after a long and tiring flight; </li><li>  the beach is rarely cleaned, and therefore it is constantly bombarded with bottles, plastic dishes and other garbage that tourists and fishermen throw out; </li><li>  breakfast menu, although quite extensive, but the dishes are prepared very poorly and tasteless (even stale products come across); </li><li>  it is very difficult to communicate with the hotel staff, as they do not speak not only Russian, but do not even speak English; </li><li>  very inconvenient location - away from city infrastructure, as well as entertainment and retail outlets. </li></ul>
