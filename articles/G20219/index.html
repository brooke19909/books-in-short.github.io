Useful tips and tricks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Probably, every person at least once in his life dropped a phone into the water.  In most cases, such an incident ends in failure.  I have to go to the store for a new device.  But is everything so bad as it might seem at first glance?  Professionals give practical advice that will help rehabilitate the device. </p><h2>  Tip number 1 </h2><p>  What to do if wet touch phone?  First turn it off immediately.  The less time he spends in the water, the greater the chance that he will continue to work.  Do not turn on the wet phone - a short circuit may occur. </p><h2>  Tip number 2 </h2><p>  Once the phone has been removed from the water, it is advisable to disconnect all removable parts whenever possible.  We are talking about the battery, port plugs, slots (in smartphones), etc. If the case is easy to disassemble, then you can remove it.  This will prevent moisture buildup on internal circuits. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ubergizmo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wet phone tips" class="if uuid-2595663" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2595663.jpg"></div><h2>  Tip number 3 </h2><p>  Do not forget about SIM and memory cards.  Before putting the device on drying, they must be removed.  It is important to wipe all parts with napkins or a soft cloth.  After lay them out on a paper towel in a well-ventilated place. </p><h2>  Tip number 4 </h2><p>  What to do if the speaker on the phone is wet?  Some users advise drying it with a vacuum cleaner.  Blow out the part for approximately 20 minutes.  This will help remove residual water if they have already seeped in.  However, you must be prepared for the fact that the speaker will have to be replaced with a new one.  Most often, after getting wet, it begins to hiss and wheeze. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="technospirit24.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="they didn‚Äôt turn on what to do" class="if uuid-2595658" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2595658.jpg"></div><h2>  Tip number 5 </h2><p>  In no case should you use a hairdryer to dry the gadget.  Even cold air can be harmful.  He simply pushes water drops deeper, so they can easily penetrate the microcircuit.  And this will lead to the failure of electronic parts.  After that, the phone cannot be rehabilitated. </p><h2>  Tip number 6 </h2><p>  The beneficial properties of rice cannot be underestimated.  This is not only a nutritious product, but also moisture-absorbing.  Wondering what to do if your phone is wet?  It is necessary to prepare a container of such dimensions that the apparatus fits there.  Pour rice into it.  Immerse the device for at least 2-3 days.  There is no need to rush.  Rice absorbs moisture slowly, but efficiently.  The only thing to do is periodically flip. </p><p>  If there is no rice or just can‚Äôt believe in its properties, then you can use silicogel.  This absorbent material is placed in shoes to absorb moisture.  This gel does better than rice.  You will need to turn the phone over every hour, checking to see if water droplets have accumulated on its surface.  If they are, you will have to re-wipe the case with a paper towel.  After this procedure, the phone is re-immersed in silica gel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="bachlongmobile.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if your phone is wet" class="if uuid-2595657" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2595657.jpg"></div><h2>  Tip number 7 </h2><p>  What to do if your phone is wet?  First of all, comply with the requirements described above.  After that, you can put the device on the windowsill, where the rays of the sun penetrate.  This is necessary in order to dry deep holes.  However, it is important to ensure that the phone does not overheat.  This may damage some parts. </p><h2>  Tip number 8 </h2><p>  When disassembled, the phone should dry for at least 24 hours.  After this, it is necessary to carefully examine it, especially the connectors, compartments and other recesses.  After making sure that there is no moisture, you can install the battery in place and turn on the device.  It is advisable to listen to whether extraneous sounds, such as crackling or hissing, appear inside the case.  This suggests that some details are not functioning properly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gocellphonerepair.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if wet speaker on the phone" class="if uuid-2595662" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/2595662.jpg"></div><h2>  Tip number 9 </h2><p>  Wet your phone?  Doesn't turn on?  What to do?  All the methods described above have already been tried, but this does not help?  The main thing is not to lose your temper.  The most common reason is a dead battery.  Before connecting to the network, make sure that the phone is completely dry.  Re-enable it should be no earlier than 5-10 minutes.  If the device does not show signs of life, then only to the service center. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So what to do if you wet your phone has already been told.  Now, in conclusion, a few recommendations: </p><ul><li>  It is advisable to purchase a special ‚Äúrescue‚Äù kit for devices that have got moisture inside. </li><li>  If the phone is "plunged" into salt water, then be sure to wipe the contacts, for example, with alcohol.  You can use pure fresh water for these purposes. </li><li>  In no case, after getting wet, the phone can not be connected to the charger. </li><li>  The battery must not be exposed to prolonged heating. </li><li>  It is undesirable to disassemble the device without skills.  You ask what to do if you wet your phone?  Entrust this matter to professionals. </li></ul>
