    <h2>  Hotel for toddlers </h2><p>  In Bulgaria, it was always good to heal children.  The Sunrise Hotel continues this wonderful tradition.  There are three separate, quite spacious children's pools up to 60 cm deep. Two of them are equipped with fungi with trickling water, and small water slides are installed.  Between the buildings there is an outdoor playground and a trampoline, and in the central building there is a mini club.  With kids, they spend all day animating, there are water rides.  In the rooms you can order the provision of a cot, and for older children, folding beds.  For a child under 12 years of age, payment is not made, and for a child from 13 years of age and for adults when placed on folding beds, the payment is 40 euros per day. </p><h2>  Leisure at the hotel </h2><p>  The nearest place with entertainment facilities is Obzor.  Some guests go there on foot, which takes about 40 minutes.  You can also drive into the city by bus.  But the bulk of the guests, especially those who came with small children, spend their leisure time at the hotel.  There are three large pools with free sun loungers and umbrellas.  Sports enthusiasts can entertain themselves in the billiard room, on the darts board or at the tennis tables.  For wellness, the hotel built a wonderful wellness center with a fitness room, sauna, bathhouse, massage room, and a beauty salon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sunrise All Suites Resort 4 Bulgaria reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1517829.jpg" width="501"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Obzor has long been known as a wonderful Bulgarian resort on the Black Sea coast.  Hotel Sunrise is located at a distance of 300-500 meters from the sea, depending on the building number.  The fact that the coastline is not nearby can be considered a plus, since near the sea from the afternoon there is strong wind almost every day, and the weather is always acceptable on the territory of the hotel.  You need to go to the beach through the meadow, along a rocky path.  The beach at the Sunrise Hotel is private, sandy, very wide and always clean.  The only drawback is cigarette butts that irresponsible smokers (smoking is allowed throughout the hotel) are buried in the sand instead of being thrown into bins all over the place.  The sea in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis beach is clean, off the coast shallow, which is very convenient for children and their parents.  The disadvantage of a beach holiday in this region is the almost constant winds that raise high waves.  Because of this, rescuers often display a red flag. </p><h2>  Leisure outside the hotel </h2><p>  Guests of Sunrise All Suites Resort 4 * can not only relax, but also improve their health.  The overview is famous for its climatic conditions.  On the one hand, it adjoins the Black Sea coast, and on the other, it is surrounded by a forest where rivers murmur, the air is saturated with volatile plants, flowers and berries grow among the trees.  In addition, in the vicinity of the city there are hydrogen sulfide sources.  There are also entertainment centers in Obzor, but not as many as youth would like.  Everyone who loves night clubs and noisy discos needs to go to Varna or to Burgas.  It is also wiser to go to large centers for shopping lovers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="); Sunrise All Suites Resort 4 Overview" class="if" height="331" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1517830.jpg" width="501"></div>  The hotel has a gift shop where you can cheaply buy many interesting things, but the choice of clothes, bedding, jewelry, wines, shoes and other goods is small.  Another popular excursion is trips to the town of Nessebar.  Here there are not only interesting sights, but also a pretty good water park.
