Men give a present to any woman once a year - on International Women's Day.  On March 8, the stronger sex, trying to please its weak half, cooks dinner, washes dishes, and vacuums the floors.  On the evening of the same day, every man slowly thinks that it‚Äôs good that such a wonderful holiday is one in a year. </p><p>  You can imagine anything, but German inventors created <noindex>  <span>vacuum cleaner k√§rcher</span> </noindex>  that crawls like a huge beetle all over the room and "sucks" dirt and dust from all angles.  Gathers garbage, then goes to its base and throws it into the garbage container.  During long-term work, the tireless cleaner becomes charged: the built-in battery recovers the lost power, and the bypass procedure starts again.  The vacuum cleaner finds its way to its base, which plays the role of a drive for everything that the electric janitor has put together;  and at the same time - it charges the battery.  They ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with the help of a navigation beam operating in a straight line.  The distance between them is no more than 30 meters. </p><p>  When quantity turns into quality ... </p><p>  I can‚Äôt say for sure that we are dealing with the present, as in science fiction films, thinking ‚Äúhardware‚Äù: the robot is far from a robot vacuum cleaner to a real robot.  He crawls for a very long time around the room, moving like a toy lunar rover: if he stumbles upon an obstacle, he will go round.  This form of passing the entire distance does not guarantee that it moves only along a new route. </p><p>  The ‚Äúhome lunar rover‚Äù can go through the same sections twice.  Sometimes it can just get lost, since the beam works only in a straight line and in the zone of visibility.  These two misunderstandings quickly become invisible, since the device works tirelessly for hours until the receiving garbage container of the base is full.  This "tidy bug" creeps for a long time and in any case will go through all the corners of the room.  Another advantage is the quiet inaudible mumble of the engine, which in volume resembles the murmur of water in a tap.  Therefore, let it work - it does not bother anyone.  A person‚Äôs duty to clean the room is that sometimes you need to press the power button and take out the filled garbage, because the Karcher robotic vacuum cleaner does not yet know how to do this. </p></div></article>
