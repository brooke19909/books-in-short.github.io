    <h2>  Description of Bavaro </h2><p>  A quarter of a century ago, these places were completely deserted.  Bavaro (Dominican Republic) then was sections of impregnable rainforest with wild beaches.  And now it is all built up with luxurious tourist complexes.  But the forests of coconut palms, despite the abundance of civilization, now stretch along the coast for many kilometers.  In addition, you will not be bored at this resort.  Golf courses, tennis courts and horse races - traditional entertainment for aristocrats - will surely appeal to you.  And in the evenings you will be whirling to the brim in the rhythms of salsa and merengue, as well as dozens of national versions of these dances.  Shops here are expensive, and sell mainly Dominican or Haitian souvenirs.  But if you liked something, it is better to go to Punta Cana for shopping - there it will all be several times cheaper.  The cuisine of the <span>Dominican Republic</span> (Bavaro is no exception) combines the traditions of Europe and Africa, using local products.  Many praise the local rum "Imperial."  Bavaro has its own dress code - in churches, casinos, some restaurants and discos will not let you in in clothes with short sleeves or in shorts.  And women can go to temples only with their heads covered. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Trip to the Dominican Republic price" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1719612.jpg" width="600"></div>

The beaches are surrounded by a coral reef.  He made the water very calm, protecting the lagoon from the waves of the ocean.  There are no sharks or other dangerous inhabitants of the sea.  But a lot of colorful bright fish.  No wonder diving enthusiasts come here.  By the quality of the sand, any Bavaro beach <span>will give odds</span> to any other Dominican resort.  The water here is amazingly clean and clear.  Fish and marine animals can be seen even at a depth of several meters.  And the sand is very fine, soft and silky.  You probably will not need special <span>sunshades</span> because the coconut palms growing literally everywhere create a very comfortable shady zone.  There are plenty of water activities on the beach.  However, in no case do not swim in the open sea - the currents are so strong that you will be carried into the ocean. </p>

    <h2>  Reviews for Bavaro </h2><p>  Tourists note that this resort is ideal for spending a romantic vacation or a family vacation.  No wonder the Dominican Republic, Bavaro in particular, is a popular destination for travelers who travel to the Caribbean.  Travelers praise not only beaches, hotels, the sea, but also the local cuisine, especially seafood.  True, at first they are somewhat discouraged by the way the locals communicate, because, speaking English and Spanish, they often use Native American words, so even knowing these languages, you will not always understand what it is about.  Still the inhabitants of Bavaro often carry firearms with them - they are allowed here.  But you should not be afraid of this, since life here is completely safe.  By carrying weapons, locals simply emphasize their high social status. </p>
