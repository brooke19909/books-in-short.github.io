This is key.  The role of Russian culture cannot be overestimated.  Thanks to the reforms of Peter the Great, <span>an absolute monarchy was</span> established in the empire <span>,</span> as well as the legislative formation of the bureaucracy.  In particular, this was reflected in the "golden age" of Catherine II. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/542599.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <h2>  Events of the beginning of the XIX century </h2><p>  The century was marked by the ministerial reform of Alexander I. In practice, it was carried out in order to strengthen the feudal-absolutist order.  At the same time, the influence of the new ‚Äúspirit of the time‚Äù must be taken into account.  First of all, the reflection of the Great French Revolution on the whole of Russian culture is traced.  The love of freedom is one of its archetypes.  She is praised by all Russian poetry, starting from Tsvetaeva and ending with Pushkin.  After the ministries were established, there was a further bureaucratization of management.  In addition, the central apparatus of the Russian Empire was improved.  The establishment of the Council of State is an essential element of Europeanization and modernization of the entire system.  Its main functions are: ensuring uniformity of legal norms and centralization of legislative affairs. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Golden period </h2><p>  Russian culture of the late 19th - early 20th century developed very intensively.  Strong influence on this process was exerted by advanced Western European thoughts and world revolutionary progress.  The close relationship of Russian culture with others also affected.  This was the period when French <span>utopian socialism</span> and <span>German classical philosophy</span> developed <span>.</span>  These ideas have become very popular in the state.  Russian culture of the early 19th century was heavily influenced by the legacy left over from previous generations.  New sprouts of creativity in literature sprouted precisely thanks to him.  This also applies to the fields of culture, painting and poetry.  The works of F. Dostoevsky, P. Melnikov-Pechersky, N. Leskov and N. Gogol are permeated with the traditions of ancient Russian religious culture.  Also, one cannot fail to note the work of other literary geniuses, whose attitude to the Orthodox movements was more controversial.  We are talking about A. Blok, L. Tolstoy, A. Pushkin and so on.  In their work, an indelible press can be traced, which testifies to their Orthodox roots.  Also, one should not forget the skeptical I. Turgenev.  In his work "Living relics" presents the image of national holiness.  Also of great interest is the Russian art culture of the time.  We are talking about the paintings of K. Petrov-Vodkin, M. Vrubel, M. Nesterov.  The origins of their work lie in the Orthodox iconography.  Ancient church singing became a vivid phenomenon in the history of musical culture.  The later experiments of S. Rachmaninov, P. Tchaikovsky and D. Bortnyansky can also be included here. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the role of Russian culture" class="if" height="241" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12054/543775.jpg" width="228"></div>

At the same time, she did not lose her identity.  In addition, a significant impact on the development of other cultures.  As for the history of European peoples, it left a considerable mark.  First of all, we are talking about religious Russian thought.  It was formed under the influence of the West.  In turn, Western European culture was influenced by theology and philosophy.  This is especially true in the first half of the 20th century.  A significant contribution to the development of Russian culture was made by the works of M. Bakunin, N. Berdyaev, P. Florensky, <span>S. Bulgakov,</span> V. Solovyov, as well as many others.  We must not forget about the "thunderstorm of the twelfth year."  This is a strong impetus to the development of Russian culture.  World War II is inextricably linked with the growth of <span>national identity</span> and the formation of "Decembrism."  It also influenced the traditions of Russian culture.  V. Belinsky wrote that that year shocked the whole country, and at the same time aroused popular pride and consciousness. </p><h2>  Features of the historical process </h2><p>  His pace was noticeably accelerated.  This is due to the above factors.  Differentiation of different areas of cultural activity was in full swing.  This is especially true in science.  The cultural process itself was also complicated.  A greater mutual influence of various spheres was noted.  In particular, this applies to music, literature, philosophy, and so on.  It should also be noted that the processes of interaction between the constituent elements of national culture have intensified.  This is its official part, which was taken care of by the state, and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe masses (i.e. the folklore layer).  The latter is a native of the East Slavic tribal unions.  This layer was formed in Ancient Russia.  It fully existed throughout the entire history of the country.  As for the bowels of the official state culture, the presence of an ‚Äúelitist‚Äù layer can be traced here.  She served the ruling class.  This primarily refers to the royal court and the aristocracy.  This layer was quite susceptible to foreign innovations.  In this case, it is advisable to mention the romantic paintings of A. Ivanov, K. Bryullov, V. Tropinin, O. Kiprensky and other famous artists of the XIX century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian culture of the early 20th century" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/542601.jpg" width="296"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  18th century influence </h2><p>  In its first half, intellectuals-raznochintsy appeared.  Towards the end of the century, a special social group stood out.  We are talking about serf intelligentsia.  It included poets, musicians, architects and painters.  If at the beginning of the century the leading roles belonged to the noble intelligentsia, then at the end - to raznochintsy.  The composition of this layer began to pour in immigrants from the peasants.  This was especially felt after the abolition of serfdom.  To raznochintsy could be attributed educated representatives of the democratic and liberal bourgeoisie.  It could not be said that they belonged to the nobility.  Rather, they can be attributed to the peasantry, merchants, middle class and bureaucracy.  This confirms such important features of Russian culture as the beginning of its democratization processes.  Their essence lies in the fact that not only members of privileged classes became educated figures.  However, the leading place still belonged to them.  The number of scientists, composers, artists, poets, writers from unprivileged strata increased.  In particular, this applies to the serfs, mainly from the circle of raznochintsy. </p><h2>  The fruits of the XIX century </h2><p>  The art of Russian culture continues to develop actively.  Literature is becoming its leading field.  First of all, the influence of a progressive liberation ideology is traced here.  In fact, many works of that period are filled with revolutionary, military appeals, as well as political pamphlets.  In this lies the crucial importance of Russian culture.  She was very inspired by advanced youth.  The reign of the spirit of struggle and opposition was felt.  He permeated the works of progressive writers.  Thus, literature has become one of the most active forces in society.  You can take, for example, the richest world classics and make a comparison of Russian culture.  Even against its background, literature of the last century is an exceptional phenomenon.  Tolstoy's prose and Pushkin's poetry can be called a real miracle.  It is no coincidence that Yasnaya Polyana became an intellectual capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="features of Russian culture" class="if" height="492" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/542602.jpg" width="314"></div>

    <h2>  Contribution of A. Pushkin </h2><p>  It is difficult to say what the culture of Russia would have been without him.  A. Pushkin - the founder of domestic realism.  Suffice it to recall "Eugene Onegin."  This novel in poetry was called the famous critic by the encyclopedia of Russian life.  This is the highest expression of realism in the works of a genius.  Also, the novels ‚ÄúDubrovsky‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Captain's Daughter‚Äù, and the drama ‚ÄúBoris Godunov‚Äù can be attributed to outstanding examples of this direction of literature.  As for the world significance of Pushkin, it is inextricably linked with an understanding of the universal significance of the tradition that he himself created.  He paved the literary path for A. Chekhov, L. Tolstoy, F. Dostoevsky, I. Turgenev, N. Gogol, M. Lermontov.  She became a full-fledged fact of Russian culture.  In addition, this road represents a crucial moment in the spiritual development of mankind. </p><h2>  Lermontov's contribution </h2><p>  He can be called the successor and junior contemporary of Pushkin.  First of all, it is worth highlighting the ‚ÄúHero of our time‚Äù.  It is impossible not to note its harmony with the novel "Eugene Onegin."  Meanwhile, ‚ÄúThe Hero of Our Time‚Äù is the pinnacle of Lermontov‚Äôs realism.  His work represents the highest point in the evolution of poetry after the Pushkin era.  Thanks to this, new paths were opened for the development of domestic prose.  Byron's work is the main aesthetic landmark.  Russian romantic individualism implies the existence of a cult of titanic passions.  Also here can be attributed lyrical expression and extreme situations, which are combined with philosophical self-deepening.  Thus, Lermontov‚Äôs attraction to the lyric epic poem, romance and ballad becomes clear.  A special place in them is love.  Also, do not forget about the "dialectic of feelings" - the Lermontov method of psychological analysis, which made a significant contribution to the subsequent literature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Russian art culture" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/542603.jpg" width="225"></div>

    <h2>  Gogol's research </h2><p>  His work developed in the direction from romantic forms to realism.  Gogol's creations contributed a lot to the development of Russian literature.  As an example, take ‚ÄúEvenings on a Farm Near Dikanka‚Äù.  The concept of Little Russia is embodied here - a kind of Slavic Ancient Rome.  He is like a whole continent on the map of the universe.  Dikanka is its peculiar center, the focus of national destiny and spiritual specificity.  In addition, Gogol founded the "natural school".  It's about critical realism.  Russian culture of the 20th century was marked by the worldwide recognition of Gogol.  From that moment on, he became an active and growing element of world literary progress.  His work has a deep philosophical potential, which is indicated gradually. </p><h2>  Tolstoy's contribution </h2><p>  His ingenious work deserves special attention.  It became a new stage in the development of world and Russian realism.  First of all, it is worth highlighting the power and novelty of Tolstoy's creativity.  Here, a lot depended on the democratic roots of his activity, moral quest, and world consciousness.  Tolstoy's realism is distinguished by a special veracity.  Also, one cannot fail to highlight the directness and frankness of the tone.  The consequence of this is a sharp discovery of social contradictions and a crushing force.  "War and Peace" is a special phenomenon in world and Russian literature.  This is a unique phenomenon of Tolstoy‚Äôs art.  This is a brilliant combination of multi-figured epic "fresco" and a psychological novel on a grand scale.  The first part of the work was published a very long time ago.  During this time, several generations of readers have been replaced.  Nevertheless, ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù continues to be a relevant work for all ages.  <span>Yu. Nagibin, a</span> modern writer, called this work an eternal companion of man.  It is dedicated to the disastrous war of the 19th century.  It affirms the moral idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe triumph of life over death.  Russian culture of the 20th century betrayed this colossal significance. </p><h2>  Researches of Dostoevsky </h2><p>  It remains to marvel at their titanic character.  Dostoevsky is a great Russian writer.  His moral research is somewhat different from Tolstoy's.  First of all, this is manifested in the absence of analysis of epic proportions.  That is, there is no description of what is happening.  We have to "go underground."  This is the only way to see what is really happening.  Thanks to this, it is possible to look at ourselves.  Dostoevsky had an amazing ability, which was to penetrate the very essence of the human soul.  As a result, they were given a description of modern nihilism.  This mood of mind was characterized by him indelibly.  Readers are still fascinated by inexplicable accuracy and depth.  As for ancient nihilism, it was inextricably linked with epicureanism and skepticism.  His ideal is a noble serenity.  This also applies to achieving peace of mind before the vicissitudes of fortune. </p><p>  Alexander the Great was deeply impressed by the nihilism of Ancient India.  His surroundings felt the same way.  If you take into account the philosophical attitude, then this is somewhat similar to the position of Pirron from Elis.  The result is the contemplation of emptiness.  As for Nagarjuna, for him and his followers nihilism was the threshold of religion. </p><p>  The modern current is somewhat different from the past.  Its foundation is still intellectual conviction.  This is not a blessed state of equanimity or philosophical impassivity.  Rather, it is an inability to create and establish.  This is not philosophy, but a spiritual flaw. </p>

    <h2>  The main stages of the flowering of musical art </h2><p>  The 19th century was marked by the intensive development of literature.  Along with this, the musical culture of Russia flashed brightly.  At the same time, she was in close interaction with literature.  So, Russian art culture was intensely enriched.  There were completely new images.  The aesthetic ideal of Rimsky-Korsakov is the basis of his musical creativity.  The beautiful in art is an absolute value for him.  His operas are filled with images of a highly poetic world.  This clearly shows that art has a dual power.  It transforms and conquers a person.  In Rimsky-Korsakov, this function of art is combined with his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe quality of means for moral improvement.  This cult is inextricably linked with the romantic affirmation of the Creator Man.  He is involved in a confrontation with alienating trends of the past.  This music exalts everything human.  Its purpose is to bring salvation from the ‚Äúterrible deceptions‚Äù that are inherent in the bourgeois age.  This is another significance of Russian culture.  Thanks to it, society benefits and a great civic goal is acquired.  The work of P. Tchaikovsky made a huge contribution to the heyday of domestic musical culture.  He has written many wonderful works.  The opera Eugene Onegin was experimental in nature.  In addition, the author himself interprets it as "lyrical scenes."  The pioneering essence of opera is to reflect the new cutting-edge literature. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="traditions of Russian culture" class="if" height="259" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/3530/542605.jpg" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Russian culture of the early 20th century </h2><p>  It should be noted that at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries.  rather complicated historical and political events took place in the country.  Thanks to them, Russian culture of the early 20th century was enriched by a variety of forms and directions.  She found new trends that required understanding of the social and moral problems that arose.  It should be said that by the beginning of the 20th century, Russia was a country with a large number of illiterate people.  The educational system included three levels: higher, secondary and primary.  The development of the latter began thanks to the initiative of a democratic group of society.  As a result, schools of an updated type began to emerge.  Russian culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a great influence on the development of education and improving the literacy of the population.  Among the leading educational institutions, working educational societies and courses, as well as people's houses, should be noted.  Russian culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had an impact not only on life inside the state, but also beyond. </p>
