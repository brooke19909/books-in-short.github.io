    <p>  However, the indisputable advantage of this hotel is the presence in all rooms of kitchens with all necessary equipment and utensils.  Tourists can cook their own food and fresh seafood on their own, because local food is not very acceptable for our taste, not everyone likes it.  Yes, and food in a cafe here can not be called cheap.  The hotel chef can prepare a family dinner or lunch delivered to your room.  There are many food options, and the choice is for vacationers. </p><h2>  Hotel infrastructure </h2><p>  At Surin Park Service Apartments, everything is designed to make guests feel comfortable.

Wi-Fi is excellent throughout the hotel and in the rooms. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Surin Park Service Apartments does not have a beach.  From the hotel to the coast no more than 600 meters.  Guests at the complex can access the two nearest public beaches.  Each of them is well equipped and has sunbeds with umbrellas. </p><h2>  Phuket Attractions </h2><p>  Relaxing in The Park Surin 4 * (photo is given in the article), you can visit many excursions to see local attractions.  Phuket is not only a comfortable stay and beautiful beaches, but also the most beautiful ancient architecture in the Sino-Portuguese style, which is a mute witness to the island's rich historical past. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="surin park service" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470695.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The most interesting for tourists are sea voyages to neighboring islands and mainland provinces, which are famous for caves and rock formations, an abundance of small islands that rise above the water surface, wide beaches and coral reefs with colorful fish.  A little north of Phuket is the Similan Marine Reserve, which occupies several islands that are among the top ten best places for scuba diving in the world. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Those vacationers who are far from diving, but want to see the marine life, can visit the <span>Phuket Aquarium.</span>  Several hundred underwater inhabitants and fish live here. </p><p>  One of the favorite places of all tourists is Sirinat Park.  On its territory there are three beaches, wild tropical forests, not touched by civilization.  In addition, here vacationers can visit the largest water park on the island called the "Jungle Splash."  The park has all kinds of pools, slides and children's attractions. </p><p>  Phuket has the largest Buddha statue.  She guards the temple.  The statue is very large, and therefore visible from almost anywhere in the island.  Pilgrims come to her, asking for health and well-being. </p><p>  The female half of vacationers, as a rule, tries to visit local pearl farms.  Guides talk in detail about the technologies for growing such a miracle of nature.  And on the farm you can see with your own eyes the whole process - from the birth of a pearl to the manufacture of jewelry.  Farmers show finished products that you can buy. </p><p>  Vacationers are no less interested in visiting the orchid garden, here you can see one and a half thousand varieties of these beautiful flowers.  And after the tour, tourists can buy seedlings. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="surin park phuket" class="if" height="367" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470696.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  For those who crave bright and colorful impressions, Fantasy Park should be a must-see place.  The atmosphere of celebration and fun reigns in it.  Here you can visit many attractions, eat, watch enchanting shows with the participation of elephants. </p><p>  There are many other places worth visiting on the island: Wat Chalong Temple, Promtep Cape, Thalang National Museum. </p><h2>  Surin Park 4 *: reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I would like to refer to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit here.  Surin Park (Phuket) has a very good location.  Nearby there are two beaches, which is very important, since the main goal of all vacationers is a beach-sea vacation.  In addition, there are many shops, cafes and restaurants in the area.  And lovers of martial arts will like a gym with classes in Thai boxing. </p><p>  The rooms in the hotel are very spacious with nice new furniture.  French windows of the apartments give a unique feeling that you are in the jungle.  Each room has a large furnished terrace where you can not only sit and admire the exotic nature, but also eat in a pleasant atmosphere.  The apartment is very clean, completely free of any insects.  The kitchen and each room has its own air conditioning. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="he park surin 4 pics" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470697.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  Absolutely all rooms are equipped with kitchens.  This is a significant plus Surin Park Service Apartments 4 *.  In addition, there are dishes and all necessary equipment: stove, microwave, kettle, refrigerator, pots and pans, blender.  According to guests, this is very convenient and practical.  At any time, you can cook yourself everything you need.  The nearest shops sell a large number of seafood, which are incredibly tasty. </p><h2>  General impression of the complex </h2><p>  Resting in the hotel, a complete feeling of comfort and carefreeness is created.  Since the hotel itself is small, a small number of families rest in it.  You can not hear and see neighbors so often, so silence and calm reign.  In general, it seems that you are not in a hotel, but in a separate villa. </p><p>  According to tourists, everything is very thought out in the hotel: kitchens, a relaxation area on the terraces and on the roof of the penthouse, furniture and furnishings of the rooms, children's bedrooms even have toys. </p><p>  Only breakfast is included in the room bill.  For lunch and dinner, you can order dishes from the restaurant's menu, or you can ask to cook food and bring it to your room.  In addition, there are an incredible number of cafes near the hotel, which can also deliver your order to the apartment if you do not want to leave your room.  However, it is simply a sin not to take advantage of the presence of a kitchen, so tourists very often cook themselves, especially those who come with small children. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="surin park service apartments 4" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470698.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  As for the continental breakfast at the hotel, it is quite simple.  As a rule, serve eggs, omelet, croutons, cheese, fried eggs, sausage, coffee.  In principle, breakfast can also be prepared in the room. </p><p>  When booking rooms, the administration warns that the apartments are cleaned once every five days.  Why such rules are here is not very clear.  Cleaning really happens in the specified schedule.  If you need to clean up once again, then this is a paid service.  The room has a vacuum cleaner and a broom, so if necessary, you can do everything yourself.  So that there are no problems with cleaning. </p><p>  The territory of The Park Surin * (Phuket) is small, but very clean and beautiful, like the hotel itself.  There are few vacationers, and therefore no one bothers anyone.  There is no annoying loud music, noise and din.  In the courtyard there is a small but very clean pool.  Although, when near such a beautiful sea, it is a pity to waste time on artificial ponds. </p><h2>  Beach Reviews </h2><p>  Many tourists who are traveling to Phuket for the first time choose this hotel because of its proximity to the coast.  There are two beaches near the complex: Surini Beach and Bang Tao Beach.  It is closer to Surini Beach, about three hundred meters, however, the road runs along the roadway.  But to Bang Tao Beach is a little further (500 meters).  Walking to the shore is not difficult, and on the way you can look into local shops and tour agencies. </p><p>  Surin is a beautiful beach, but this year all cafes were completely eliminated on it, sunbeds and umbrellas were removed.  In summer there are big waves, swimming is not very convenient.  But in BangTao, the water is much calmer.  Here you can rent an umbrella and deck chairs.  Two sun loungers and a canopy will cost one hundred baht.  There is a grove of conifers on the beach, so you can comfortably sit on a sand in its shadow if you do not like to stay in the hot sun. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the park surin 4 phuket" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1470699.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The hotel has a gym, but its equipment is not diverse.  Although, not everyone has time to get into it.  As a rule, vacationers spend most of the time on the coast or explore local attractions.  The only thing that is not in the hotel rooms is the washing machines.  However, a laundry service is available at the hotel for a fee.  Knowledgeable tourists are advised to take things to the laundry room, which is located on the way to the beach, the prices are three times cheaper than in a hotel. </p><h2>  Leisure tourists </h2><p>  Phuket has a rich history.  According to tourists, relaxing on the island, you definitely need to visit at least a small part of those interesting places, of which there are a lot of.  Of course, all excursions and events are not cheap, but they are worth it.  Sea trips to neighboring islands are very popular among vacationers.  Such a trip is a great opportunity to admire the beauty of the sea, to see the endless white beaches, untouched by civilization. </p><p>  Fishing enthusiasts can arrange local guides and go fishing by boat.  A walk will allow you not only to have a good time, but also to bring a catch with you, which can be a wonderful dinner. </p><p>  Perhaps one vacation will not be enough to see everything you want.  Experienced tourists are certainly advised to go to the fantasy park.  Everyone who visited it is full of unforgettable impressions of the feeling of a holiday. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Can Surin Park 4 * (Thailand, Surin) be recommended to vacationers?  Phuket is a beautiful exotic place to stay, in which there is a wide selection of a variety of hotels.  Hotel The Park Surin 4 * (Phuket) can be the best place to spend a vacation if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing holiday by the sea surrounded by nature. </p>
