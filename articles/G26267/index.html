However, for this it is worthwhile to purchase a model that makes a high-quality recording that allows you to correctly restore the events that have occurred.  This review is about the <span>low-end DOD LS430W</span> registrar.  It combines low cost and satisfactory quality.  After reviewing the main characteristics and user reviews, you can add up a complete opinion on this gadget. </p><h2>  Briefly about the model </h2><p>  This DVR was released back in 2013, but has not lost its relevance.  The fact is that already at that time he acquired a functional that can be considered modern even now.  The Tiotech A8 processor developed for it is able to interpolate the image to a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, despite the small physical matrix.  As a result, the picture on the video is clear, the numbers are distinguishable even at night.  The installed matrix transmits an image with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. </p><p>  For ease of use, the manufacturer installed a narrow display with a diagonal of 2.7 inches.  The design of the gadget is unremarkable and can be considered standard.  A compact body that is almost the same size as the display, in front of which is a small lens with a wide-angle lens, capturing the maximum number of surrounding parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="minkara.carview.co.jp" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DOD LS430W recorder packaging" class="if uuid-2263107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2263107.jpg"></div><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  In the factory box, you will not find a large number of additional accessories.  For the DOD LS430W recorder, there is a mount with a suction cup that hangs on the windshield behind the rearview mirror.  In this position, the recorder is invisible and does not interfere with the driver.  To connect to the power supply, a special adapter is designed that can be inserted into the cigarette lighter socket.  The cord is enough to lay it behind the casing and it does not interfere in the cabin. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The power is connected via the Mini-USB connector.  It is intended for charging only and cannot be used to upload finished video to a computer.  If you need to save recorded videos, you will need an additional card reader for a micro-SD memory card.  For more details, the process of setting up and using the device is described in a brief paper manual for the DOD LS430W, which can also be found in the factory packaging. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dod-tech.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mount DOD LS430W" class="if uuid-2263109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2263109.jpg"></div><h2>  Additional functionality </h2><p>  I would especially like to note the presence of a GPS receiver in the device, which is capable of recording the location and speed of the vehicle.  Thus, in the final video there is information about how fast you were driving, which may allow you to prove compliance with traffic rules.  In addition, there are clear coordinates that can also be useful, especially if the recording was made at night and it is not possible to clearly identify the area. </p><p>  Another useful feature is the ability to configure the output of the current speed in full screen mode while driving.  Especially this option may appeal to drivers of old cars that have not very accurate speedometers.  The accuracy of GPS indicators on the DOD LS430W is much lower than the standard measuring instruments of the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù, which can help to avoid unnecessary fines for exceeding.  If you wish, you can turn on a notification about exceeding the speed limit, but the cards are not entirely accurate, so you should not definitely trust them. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoso.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="DOD LS430W Menu" class="if uuid-2263105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2263105.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  In order to understand whether this device is suitable for you, you should get acquainted with the opinion of drivers who could test it in the field.  Among the main positive factors in the reviews of the DOD LS430W, they identified the following: </p><ul><li>  Reasonable cost.  The price of the DOD LS430W is only about 5,000 rubles.  For a model with GPS, this is more than a reasonable offer. </li><li>  High quality recording.  Many parts do not go unnoticed, and in the daytime car numbers can be disassembled even at a considerable distance. </li><li>  The presence of a speed meter.  For many drivers, the built-in speedometer turned out to be a significant plus, allowing you to prove your innocence if necessary. </li><li>  Record a route.  After the trip, you can transfer the full route to the map, with data on the direction and speed of movement. </li><li>  High reliability.  Since the model is quite old, the drivers had the opportunity to operate it for a long time.  Many note that their registrar is more than 4 years old, and he continues to fulfill his functions impeccably. </li><li>  Easy to set up.  The quality of the translation of the menu items and its availability make it possible to configure the parameters even for those who hold such a gadget in their hands for the first time and do not know how to use it.  And the instructions included in the kit explain in detail the remaining questions. </li></ul><p>  As can be seen from these reviews, the model is popular and is able to work for a long time without repairs and interference with settings by the user.  However, she has some disadvantages, which are also worth remembering. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dod-tech.ca" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="The appearance of the registrar DOD LS430W" class="if uuid-2263106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2263106.jpg"></div><h2>  The negative sides of the model </h2><p>  Among the main disadvantages of the <span>DOD LS430W</span> model, drivers note a frequent overexposure of numbers at night.  If the light falls directly on the number, then on the video it is displayed as a white rectangle, no characters are visible at all.  However, if the car was in the next row, no problems. </p><p>  Another negative point is the need to disassemble the device to replace the battery.  This aspect is relevant in view of the fact that for many users the gadget is not the first year, and the battery could fail. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zoso.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Office DOD LS430W" class="if uuid-2263108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43973/2263108.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The presented model is a good representative of technology, which, despite its age, remains relevant in our time.  If you are looking for an inexpensive recorder with a GPS module, then definitely pay attention to the DOD LS430W.  He has an impressive list of advantages and at the same time is deprived of the frequent problem of his brothers - failures during work and freezes at a crucial moment.  At the same time, its cost can be called ultra-budgetary, since in its price category in terms of parameters it is noticeably ahead of competitors. </p>
