    <p>  Other models also deserve your attention and have their own list of advantages along with disadvantages. </p><h2>  Advantages of Sony models </h2><p>  All closed-type headphones from the venerable company are distinguished by excellent ergonomics and a high level of comfort.  After the gadget is on your head, in a couple of minutes you completely forget about its existence - you will find only clear sound and complete immersion in virtual reality.  This is especially true for the MDR line. </p><p>  Even inexpensive models are distinguished by high-quality sound, and the ranges of high and low frequencies are brought, if not to the ideal, then very close to it, and listening to music with such headphones is a pleasure. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth noting the ideal ratio of price and quality models.  Decent closed headphones can be bought in the range of 20-50 dollars. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It will be useful to mention the appearance of the models.  Almost all the lines have an outstanding, interesting, stylish and catchy design.  If you want to stand out from the crowd - please: full-size gadgets in white or tattered colors are created as if specially for you.  Love conservatism - black and dark colors are always in the assortment of the company. </p><p>  You can also notice the competently implemented compactness of Sony models.  There were no problems with carrying or operating in the reviews.  Another significant plus of the company's gadgets is their durability, they will last you a very long time, and, judging by the statistics, people change the closed headphones from Sony to similar ones just because they are tired of them. </p><h2>  The disadvantages of gadgets from Sony </h2><p>  Numerous reviews on the assortment of the company revealed a number of shortcomings.  Most owners complain that the cords are too short - a little more than a meter, while competing products have a length of almost two meters. </p>

    <p>  Also, some are not satisfied with the mediocre connection of the wire and the plug, especially for early models in the MDR line: breaking flat wires is a real scourge for most models.  The glossiness of the design is a bit upsetting: against the background of all elegance and beauty, spots and small scratches begin to appear over time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Is it worth buying? </h2><p>  Closed on-ear headphones from Sony are the best option, a kind of middle ground between price, quality and return.  The models have enviable ergonomics, comfortable and movable ear pads, a convenient design, in some cases a control panel and an additional headset. </p><p>  One of the strengths of the gadget, in addition to sound and convenience, is appearance.  Elegant design will appeal to any music lover, especially since there is plenty to choose from.  The lineup is extremely diverse: open-closed <span>headphones, in-channel, in</span> - <span>ear</span> , and each type has its own version of the emitter.  Therefore, even the most picky buyers will find for themselves what they really need. </p><h2>  Sennheiser </h2><p>  Company founder Fritz Sennheiser made a good name for himself on headphones, and the company's products occupy leading positions in many specialized exhibitions.  The price of the lineup, although high, but, judging by the reviews of the owners and the opinions of experts, it is quite justified. </p>

    <p>  The closed Zennheiser overhead headphones do not have such a rich assortment as the Sony ones, but they have their indisputable advantages.  Among the vacuum gadgets, the brand's products are in the lead by a large margin.  In addition to excellent sound, attractive design and high-quality design, the headphones are completely isolated, which for some music lovers is a critical moment when choosing this kind of device. </p><p>  The <span>Sennheiser HD 202</span> model (about $ 40) was especially distinguished, having won the hearts of many music and sound quality lovers.  For a relatively low price, the owner receives an extremely high-quality sound, excellent design and excellent comfort.  Many owners respond very warmly about the model, admiring the characteristics of the gadget at such a low cost.  Some owners of this model complain about too high-quality vacuum and leather covering of ear pads, which is why you have to periodically remove the headphones to ventilate your ears.  Otherwise, this is a very successful and perfectly balanced model. </p><h2>  Advantages of the Sennheiser model range </h2><p>  The company has always made and is emphasizing sound quality, and it succeeds with enviable constancy from one model to another.  Many owners in their reviews note quality functionality.  Also in most models you can see the control panel and built-in microphone. </p><p>  Another important factor characterizing Zennheiser products is durability.  Do not think about scratches, stains or, worse, cracks: the brand's headphones eliminate such problems.  In addition, gadgets are relatively lightweight, allowing a long time to work or relax in them. </p>

    <p>  Design is also worth mentioning.  The appearance of gadgets is very attractive, although not for all models (excessive conservatism).  Almost all the lines abound with some interesting distinctive features, so even picky music lovers can find something. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the Sennheiser line </h2><p>  As for the shortcomings, no critical comments were noted in specialized forums.  The only thing that potential buyers sometimes pay attention to is the poor range of closed and overhead headphones, and the rest is a music lover's dream. </p><h2>  To take or not to take? </h2><p>  Headphones from the Sennheiser are a very good candidate to choose from.  The strengths of the models are manifested in literally every position: a pleasant and truly deep sound, ergonomics and convenience, beauty - all this makes the headphones from Sennheiser extremely popular, and not only for fans of the brand. </p><h2>  AKG </h2><p>  <span>AKG K27i</span> is a popular closed-type model from this brand.  These are cute headphones, the color of which is in perfect harmony with iPods (white in combination with light gray).  The K27i are very compact: they fold and take up very little space.  Headphones provide a certain degree of sound insulation, but this mainly concerns the upper part of the sound spectrum.  There is a small <span>volume control</span> on the cable <span>.</span>  This is very convenient if you do not like the player to be in sight. </p><p>  The K27i has a very wide frequency response, but the <span>low frequencies</span> were significantly stronger than the rest of the sound spectrum.  In addition, the bass extends deep down with virtually no attenuation. </p><p>  According to reviews, the sensitivity of this model is very high.  Even paired with a small player, you can achieve a high volume level, however, sometimes with a little distortion.  Sensitivity is approximately 110 dB / V. </p><p>  The only thing users find fault with: when playing songs that are sensitive to the overall balance of frequencies, the sound was a little dull.  The benefits noted by the reviews are deep bass and volume control on the cord.  These headphones will definitely appeal to those who love strong bass.  Some will think that there are too many of them.  So decide for yourself. </p>
