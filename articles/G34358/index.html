Among other things, this is a young, but already quite famous resort, which, however, is not yet popular among Russians.  Most likely, this is due to insufficient advertising by the travel agencies of the benefits of Fanrang among domestic lovers of relaxation in tropical latitudes. </p>

    <h2>  A few words about the city </h2><p>  Phanrang Resort (Vietnam) is located on the shores of the South China Sea, somewhere in the middle between Nha Trang and Mui Ne.  At the moment, its population is about 180 thousand people.  The official name consists of two words “Fanrang” and “Thapcham”.  Of these, the first, the official part is of historical origin, and the second is Cham, and is associated with the indigenous people, who since ancient times inhabited the local places. </p><p>  By the level of development of urban infrastructure, Fanrang is not inferior to even more densely populated settlements of Vietnam.  You can always call a taxi there, there is Wi-Fi, beautiful roads, and in recent years many beautiful modern buildings have been built. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  Before telling in detail about historical monuments and other interesting objects that are worth seeing for tourists coming to these places, it is worth telling briefly about its history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Fanrang <span>(Vietnam),</span> which is described below, reached its heyday in the 13th century, when it was the capital of the state of Panduranga.  Subsequently, he moved to the Vietnamese, which invaded these lands and enslaved their indigenous population.  During the Second World War, an airfield was built by the Japanese invaders in Fanrang.  It is a landmark of the city, however, tourists are unlikely to be able to see it.  Later, this field airfield was used by France, and then became part of the US Air Force base.  After the end of the <span>Vietnam War, the</span> Americans left the country, and since 1975 this military facility was transferred to the VNA Air Force.  In the 90s of the last century, tourism was proclaimed one of the main areas that should help create an economically strong Vietnam.  Fanrang, the attractions of which are presented below, has been turned into a beach resort, where tourists from many countries come with pleasure today. </p>

    <h2>  Poklongarai </h2><p>  The main attraction of the resort and its environs are the <span>Chama towers.</span>  The first of these religious complexes is called Poklongaray and is located seven kilometers northwest of Fanrang.  The construction is an ensemble of three towers built in the 13th century by the Cham people.  Poklongarai got its name in honor of one of the Chama rulers, who, according to legend, did a lot for his people, including organizing the construction of a progressive <span>irrigation system</span> at that time <span>.</span> </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The towers are located on Chau Hill.  According to historians, in ancient times they were used for sacrifices and prayers.  The Gate Tower was most likely the guest house, and the Fire Tower was used as a kitchen.  These structures are of modular construction.  They are made of brick made from local blood-red soil glued with a special vegetable gel.  Over the 7 centuries of its existence, structures have collapsed to half, and in the last century they were restored. </p><h2>  Thap Ba or Hoa Lai </h2><p>  The second tower complex is located off Highway N 1A, 14 km north of Fanrang.  Previously, it also included 3 towers, but the main tower collapsed.  The building is ancient, Poklongaray, since it exists from the 9th century and, from an architectural point of view, is built in a completely different style. </p>

    <h2>  Porome Tower </h2><p>  This building is much younger than others and was built only in the 17th century.  According to researchers, during this period there was a decline in art, so Porome is less picturesque and has a more modest decor than other Cham towers.  In general, tourists interested in architecture are advised to inspect all such structures located in the vicinity of Fanrang to represent the evolution of this art form in Vietnam over 6 centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Ethnographic tour </h2><p>  15 km from Fanrang is a craft village.  Its inhabitants have been known for more than one century for the manufacture of ceramic dishes.  It is believed that this village is the oldest center for the production of such products in Southeast Asia.  At the same time, the ceramics created there are not at all like dishes from other regions of Vietnam and differ in both shape and decor. </p>

    <h2>  Church </h2><p>  At Hải Thượng Lãn Ông, Đông Hải Vietnam, Fanrang, the resort has a Catholic church.  It is active and stands out against other structures of the city.  The church was built in the 19th century in the French style, and in front of its entrance you can see a painted statue of Christ with outstretched arms. </p><h2>  Vineyards Fanrang </h2><p>  The natural attraction of the resort are the vineyards.  In general, this berry is practically not cultivated in Vietnam because of its humid climate, but Fanrang is an exception.  They make grape wine, and in the middle of summer they hold the Ninh Thuan festival dedicated to this drink.  So, before those who come to Vietnam in the middle of summer, Fanrang will end up in the status of the wine capital of Southeast Asia.  This means that they will become spectators of various holiday processions, tastings and festivities. </p>

    <h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Fanrang is quite far from the beach line, so tourists who settle in hotels located in the city itself will have to travel about 3.5 km to get to the city beach of Ninh Chu.  They can walk there, rent a bike or a car, or use a taxi.  In the first case, the journey will take about 20 minutes.  However, all the inconvenience will more than pay off for a pleasant stay <span>on the</span> Ninh Chu <span>beach</span> , which stretches along the entire coastline.  It is one of the attractions of Fanrang and will especially appeal to lovers of a secluded and relaxing holiday.  The beach is covered with fine white sand, it has a gentle slope into the sea and you can’t even see crowds of tourists on it even in the “high season”.  As for the infrastructure, it is much more modest than in the more hyped resorts in Vietnam.  It offers vacationers, several cafes and restaurants where you can eat and quench your thirst.  There are no other entertainments for children or adults. </p><h2>  Ny Chua National Park </h2><p>  40 km north of the resort center is Vinhi Bay, closed to the sea.  The water in the bay is clear and has a blue tint.  The beach itself is sandy and very picturesque.  Not far from it lies the border of Ny Chua National Park.  You can fish there, so lovers to sit with a fishing rod, it is worth renting gear and going for a catch, best of all, by renting a boat.  In addition, the reserve is a good place for diving, and for tourists regularly organized boat trips with a transparent bottom, so you can enjoy the underwater world.  It should be noted that from August to December in Vinha Bay it is quite windy, therefore it is better to go windsurfing or kiting there during this period. </p>

    <h2>  Fanrang (city), Vietnam: reviews </h2><p>  The first thing that tourists come to this resort is the beach.  As already mentioned, it is clean, well-groomed and comfortable.  Judging by the reviews of the guests of Fanrag, at first they are scared by the color of the water in the sea, but all doubts disappear when they see that it is transparent and clean.  Tourists are also pleased with prices in shops that may seem ridiculous, as well as an abundance of fish restaurants where you can enjoy freshly caught seafood.  As for the negative reviews, they are relatively few and they relate to the lack of entertainment facilities in the immediate vicinity of the hotels. </p><p>  Fanrang is a resort where most of the year you can organize a wonderful beach holiday, and the historical monuments and unique natural sites located there will make it even more interesting. </p>
