Such an original gift can be presented to any woman or mother on March 8 or a birthday instead of the usual bouquet of flowers. </p><p>  It is not difficult to do it, you just need to purchase in advance all the components of the future gift.  They use not only fruits from trees, but also berries, gourds - watermelon and melon in a fruit bouquet made by themselves.  Often, designers include in the components of such delicious bouquets also branches with leaves or flowers, but this is an optional element, rather, they play the role of decor. </p><p>  You also need to think in advance how the gift itself will be made, where it will be placed.  We will consider all the points necessary for making a bouquet of fruits with our own hands in this article.  After reading, you can easily make yourself such a beauty, as in the photo in the article. </p><h2>  Fixtures </h2><p>  To compose a composition, you need to select fruits and berries of bright colors, which for a long time can be sliced ‚Äã‚Äãand not lose their appearance.  Slices or figures are cut out from dense fruits with the help of a usual sharp knife or special devices for figured slicing.  This is a slicer or a slider knife, special curly graters or Thai knives for cutting various patterns.  On sale you can find whole sets for cutting. </p><p>  Those professionals who are fond of carving (art cutting from fruits) can transform any material.  And we, simple lovers, will learn. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.groupon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bouquet of fruits" class="if uuid-2272849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2272849.jpg"></div><p>  To place the fruit in a vase or basket, you will also need a stand and skewers on which berries and fruits are worn.  So that the wooden sticks are in the right position and do not fall to the side, they must be fixed.  Therefore, a special stand is made for a fruit bouquet with your own hands.  Let's consider in more detail what it can be made of. </p><h2>  Stand for bouquet </h2><p>  If you decide to simply present a fruit composition, decorated in the form of a bouquet, then you can wooden skewers on which fruits are attached, tightly tie with twine and hide this knot under a beautiful wrapper. </p><p>  If a fruit bouquet is made out in a basket or a wide vase, then you will need a special stand in which wooden sticks with slices will be stuck.  What can be used in this case: </p><ul><li>  A piece of durable foam.  At the bottom of the vase, you first need to lay a beautiful colored napkin or cloth so that the stand is not visible.  Then a piece of polystyrene with a minimum height of 5-7 cm is cut out clearly to the size of the diameter of the vase. Then, decorated skewers are stuck completely into the polystyrene at the right angles so that the composition looks like a bouquet. </li><li>  <span>Floral sponge.</span>  This is a dense plastic foam that is used by florists to make bouquets of flowers.  It can be bought at any flower shop. </li><li>  You can knead a tight salt dough.  To do this, you need to take equal proportions of fine Extra salt and white wheat flour - one glass each, add 125 grams of cold water to such a mixture.  The mass is thoroughly mixed to a dense consistency.  You can put a ball of salt dough in the refrigerator for another 10 minutes.  Then the dough is placed on the bottom of the container for a fruit bouquet and then wooden rods are stuck into a tight mass. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.strong4life.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Different variants of fruit bouquets" class="if uuid-2272850" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2272850.jpg"></div><ul><li>  Also, instead of the stand, you can use a large dense fruit, such as pineapple, as in the photo above. </li></ul><h2>  Figure cut </h2><p>  Next, we describe how you can cut beautiful shapes with your own hands for a bouquet of fruits.  See photo and step-by-step description of actions later in the article.  First, any fruits and berries should be thoroughly washed under running water.  If the fruit contains seeds, seed or a central hard part, then they must be cut with a sharp knife.

If they are not there, do not worry, you can do this either by eye, or by a paper template, or by cutting out the first element. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.instructables.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to cut fruit figurines" class="if uuid-2272847" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2272847.jpg"></div><p>  You can use any shapes: hearts, flowers, tulips, stars, crescent and others.
