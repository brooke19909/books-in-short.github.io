The assault and shelling of the white house in Moscow</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Even in ancient times, the leader was the head of any tribe.  He obeyed, obeyed him.  The will of the leader was irrefutable and the only true.  This management path helped get rid of anarchy and atrocities.  Since then, a lot of water has flowed, but so far, only one leader has been at the head of many countries. </p><p>  The path to the top of power can be different (from seizing power and democratic elections to transferring the throne by inheritance), but the goal is the same - to protect your state and the interests of citizens living on its territory.  There is a special residence for the residence of a monarch or president in the territory of a country.  In the United Kingdom (Great Britain) and Northern Ireland, this place is Buckingham Palace.  In the USA and the Russian Federation - the White <span>House.</span>  <span>Moscow has</span> been the capital of our country for a long time.  However, the city became the center of the modern state at the end of 1991.  Prior to this, it was the capital of a great and mighty power called the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  New country - new power </h2><p>  In <span>1993, the</span> government of the newly autonomous Russian Federation was headed by Boris Yeltsin.  Before he came to power, the role of the supreme governing body of the country was performed by the Supreme Council.  The "Old King" did not want to help the new leader.  The shelling of the White House in Moscow and the bloody assault on the Ostankino TV tower were the outcome of the confrontation between the two political forces.  The city was shrouded in smoke and stunned by a volley of guns.  How did it all happen and what caused the practically heated Civil War?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Constitutional crisis </h2><p>  In the Soviet Union, all <span>authorities</span> were obliged to act within the framework of a single law, the name of which is the Constitution.  Based on this legal act, the Supreme Council of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was the most important governing body.  After the collapse of the USSR, this apparatus of power still had a huge amount of rights.  At that time, numerous corrections and amendments had already been made to the last version of the Constitution.  They directly related to the differentiation of powers of public authorities. </p><p>  However, the newly-minted president was not prepared for the fact that the Constitution, which had been adopted under Brezhnev, would so severely restrict his rights.  The main act of state regulation did not give Yeltsin the legal power that would allow him to make important decisions on his own.  Therefore, the <span>first president of Russia</span> tried to immediately change the Constitution, which was fiercely opposed by representatives of the Supreme Council who occupied the White House.  Moscow in the early years of Boris Yeltsin‚Äôs reign was mired in scandals and civil strife.  This lasted from 1992 to 1993. The confrontation between Boris Yeltsin and his supporters on one flank and the Supreme Council, headed by Ruslan Khasbulatov on the other, was called the ‚ÄúConstitutional Crisis‚Äù. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Upholding positions </h2><p>  It would seem that to divide people who want to lead their people to a brighter future?  But no.  It turns out that each side had its own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "shade" of this future.  They differently represented the further development of a great country.  The biggest controversy marked the adoption of economic reforms.  Neither side wanted to compromise their principles by one iota.  No one wanted to find common ground and create compromise conditions for all further cooperation. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Open conflict </h2><p>  The peak of aggravation of such a complicated relationship was the appeal of President Boris Yeltsin to the people.  In it, he notified citizens about the adoption of the reform of the authorities, in accordance with which the abolition of the Supreme Council and the Congress of People's Deputies was announced.  The decision of the leader of the state was supported by the current mayor of the capital, <span>Yuri Luzhkov,</span> and the country's full cabinet of ministers (Council of Ministers), headed by <span>Viktor Chernomyrdin.</span> </p><p>  However, in accordance with the Constitution of 1978, the president did not have the authority to accept such a reform.  The head of the Supreme Council, <span>Ruslan Khasbulatov,</span> spoke very categorically about the actions of the president, calling them an attempt at a coup.  Regarding the statement by Yeltsin as an excess of permissible powers, it was decided to declare the termination of power of the current president. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  The climax of the confrontation </h2><p>  The severity of the conflict increased.  Gradually, the actions went beyond the framework of civilized measures to resolve the conflict, and the warring parties took to the streets.  Members of the Supreme Council were directly imprisoned in the fortress, which became the White House.  Moscow has become a war zone.  The main residence of the government was de-energized, there was no light, water or telephone.  Opposition ring guarded the White <span>House.</span>  <span>Moscow was</span> divided into two parts.  The threat of the Civil War was brewing.  Of course, the split of power into two camps could not last long.  Someone had to give in.  While the power shared the chair, the lost and disappointed citizens expressed their helplessness in anarchist atrocities and riots.  The shooting of the White House in Moscow became one of such illegal actions. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Opposition steps </h2><p>  The opposition movement was also supported by vice-president of the country Alexander Rutskoi.  Being on the side of the Supreme Council, he called on the protesters for unity.  A crowd of opposition gathered in Oktyabrskaya Square advanced to the White House and unblocked it.  Inspired by victory, they headed for the assault on the city hall building and quickly gained access to it.  The next item was the Ostankino TV tower.  Here the protesters were met by <span>special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</span>  The fighters strictly fulfilled their task of holding the defense.  The explosion that thundered in the ranks of the special forces was the last straw, and the military opened fire on the protesters.  A huge number of people died, including ordinary citizens, journalists, demonstrators and special forces.  This happened on October 3rd. </p>

    <h2></h2><h2>  Actions of Boris Yeltsin </h2><p>  The next day, troops of supporters of the president launched an assault on the White House in Moscow.  In a dense ring, the tanks marched along Red Square, advancing to the place where the Supreme Council met.  The building was surrounded by a military armada and fired from three sides.  Due to the shells inside the residence, a fire started.  A sad picture turned out: The White House in black smoke. </p><p>  The military operation was deemed successful.  Gradually, supporters and members of the Supreme Council began to leave the building, and by the evening of that day all power passed into the hands of President Boris Yeltsin. </p><p>  The capture of the White House in Moscow, the assault of the city hall and the bloodshed at Ostankino were called the October putsch.  The separation of powers claimed the lives of more than 150 people.  About five thousand were injured.  The result was the entry into force of the new Constitution and equal elections to the State Duma and the Federation Council. </p>
