    <p>  The artificial structure consists of three islands that look like palm trees.  Among them are <span>Palms Jumeirah, Palms</span> Jebel Ali, as well as Palms Deira.  These islands, and to be precise, the peninsula (due to their connection with the coastline), have the shape of a date palm, which is very revered in Islam.  The crown of each of these islands is a crescent moon, which seems to creep along the top.  It was conceived as a breakwater and at the same time to perpetuate Muslim symbolism.  Around the islands are unique barrier reefs.  So, Palm Jebel Ali is protected by quotes from the poems of Mohammed bin Rashid - the ruler of Dubai.  By the way, on his initiative this grandiose construction was carried out.  Protective reefs made of sand and rocks. </p><p>  Palm Islands in Dubai is a territory inhabited by local millionaires.  Between the islands and the mainland, communication is via a monorail.

    <p>  Each of the attractions of the water park is made in a certain theme related to the adventures of the navigator Sinbad.  Travelers fall into the world of waves, the height of which sometimes reaches 2.5 m, tropical showers, surfing, downhill (up to 80 km per hour) and waterfalls.  All this can be found at 23 attractions of the water park. </p><h2>  Emirates Mall </h2><p>  This shopping complex must be on the list of places that a traveler has chosen for himself, trying to find the answer to the question of what to visit in Dubai.  After the Emirates Mall lost its leadership position, losing first place to the Dubai Mall, management tried to incorporate something special into the Centre‚Äôs work.  And he did it superbly.  Today, the Emirates Mall is well known to tourists due to its ski resort.  Especially it attracts those who are tired of the hot sun and want to cool at least a little.  Such tourists are invited to visit the shopping complex by a snowy descent, whose length is 400 m. Of course, visitors to the Emirates Mall are also waiting for many other pleasures.  In addition to shopping, there are restaurants and cinema, attractions and a theater. </p>
