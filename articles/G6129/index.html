Well, if you live in Moscow and have been renting real estate for several years, the housing issue is especially acute for you.  We strongly recommend that you revise your expenses as early as possible, evaluate the possibilities and even in the absence of the required amount, purchase square meters on credit.  Another question: which residential complex to give preference?  Indeed, Moscow is currently being actively built up; not just new buildings are appearing, but residential complexes of impressive size with their own infrastructure.  LCD "Atmosphere" (Lublino) is not the most popular project, but it definitely deserves special attention.  As part of this material, we will evaluate it from all sides, and we will back up the information with reviews of real interest holders and photos from the construction site. </p><h2>  about the project </h2><p>  A two-section residential building from 14 to 16 floors, being built in one of the most developed areas of the capital - all this is the Atmosphere residential complex (Lublino).  The best traditions of modern architecture are combined with innovations and high-quality materials, which guarantees the strength, reliability and durability of the building.  Thoughtful planning decisions, developed infrastructure of the district, supplemented by our own solutions, create their indescribable atmosphere of comfort, which is reflected in the name of the new building.  The project claims the maximum evaluation, has already found approval in the hearts of many buyers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="msk.stroykontrol.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd atmosphere" class="if uuid-3058378" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3058378.jpg"></div><h2>  Developer </h2><p>  You can rest assured: Atmosfera (Lublino) houses are solid, durable, which is guaranteed by the impeccable reputation of the builder Zheldoripoteka JSC.  Few people know that this is a subsidiary of Russian Railways, which has been operating in the construction market since 2001.  The developer has accounted for dozens of successfully completed projects in more than 15 cities across the country.  The use of advanced technologies, high-quality materials, attention to detail and the desire to create the most comfortable living conditions are what are common to all projects of Zheldoripoteka JSC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd atmosphere lyublino apartments" class="if uuid-3058393" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3058393.jpg"></div><p>  The developer of the Atmosphere residential complex (Lublino) has created a really worthy comfort class housing project that meets all the criteria and ideas of even the most demanding and demanding customers. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  So, for the construction of the Atmosphere residential complex (Moscow, Lublino), an area was selected in the southeast of the capital.  Until recently, it was not popular among developers and buyers due to the accumulation of industrial enterprises.  Agree, the Moscow residence permit and the gorgeous view from the window are unlikely to recoup the unpleasant smell, and the presence of harmful chemical compounds in the air could.  But the measurements made proved that the area is suitable for living, the developer, for his part, put a lot of effort into additional landscaping and landscaping. </p><div class="photo" data-original="onovostroykah.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD atmosphere Moscow Lublin" class="if uuid-3058818" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3058818.jpg"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  If your family does not have personal transport, you travel exclusively by metro and buses; for you, Atmosphere (Lublino) will be an excellent, even win-win option.  Customer reviews confirm that the nearest metro station, Lyublino, is really only 10 minutes in a calm step.  The new building is located in close proximity to the largest highways of the capital, so you can easily reach any point of the city with your personal car, choosing from several options.  This is certainly not the case when your road rests exclusively on one highway, and you have to face traffic jams every day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Atmosphere residential complex (Lublino) is being built in the area with the existing infrastructure: within walking distance, kindergartens and schools, clinics and modern medical centers, shops, pharmacies, laundries - all that is needed for a comfortable life.  The developer provided for additional improvement, albeit a small area, represented by a children's and sports grounds, recreation areas, walkways.  And, of course, all car owners can count on a parking space in the underground parking lot. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.urbanus.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd atmosphere" class="if uuid-3058945" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3058945.jpg"></div><h2>  Apartments, layouts </h2><p>  No matter how attractive the project, in whatever area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital it may be, in the end you will live in the apartment you choose.  That is why many are so attentive to the choice of the complex, paying special attention to the proposed planning solutions.  So, a choice of one-, two- and three-room apartments from 36 to 100 square meters.  Here you will find the European layout so popular today, which implies the combination of a dining room and a living area.  Reviews of the first buyers focus on spacious bathrooms, the presence of an additional bathroom and wardrobe in three-room apartments, as well as high ceilings, which make it possible to translate any design decision into reality. </p><h2>  Finish </h2><p>  All apartments in the new building are for rent with a rough finish: the necessary communications have been installed, plastic windows and heating radiators have been installed.  Be prepared for the fact that there is no screed on the floor, and the walls are not aligned. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.cian.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd atmosphere lyublino reviews" class="if uuid-3058379" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3058379.jpg"></div><h2>  Issue price </h2><p>  Many believe that apartments in Moscow are an impermissible luxury, therefore they do not even consider such options, preferring the region.  But through the use of advanced technologies and state co-financing, it was possible to make the apartments of Atmosphere (Lublino) residential complex as accessible as possible.  A one-room apartment of 36 square meters can be purchased for just 5.2 million rubles.  The developer offers favorable conditions for mortgages, installment payments for the duration of construction work. </p><h2>  Customer opinion </h2><p>  Buyers call the location of the project the main advantage: indeed, without a car, you can get to anywhere in the city in the shortest possible time.  The choice offers the subway, numerous bus routes and minibuses. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.zdi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd atmosphere" class="if uuid-3058398" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44171/3058398.jpg"></div><p>  The completion of construction is scheduled for the first quarter of 2019, but judging by the available results, the house will be commissioned with a slight delay.  At the same time, the quality of work does not cause any complaints: the first owners regularly visit the facility, monitor all stages.  Ecology is not the strongest side of the project, but you must admit that it is hardly possible to find the ideal area within the MKAD in this matter.  The measurements showed that there are no deviations from the norm, and the proximity to the industrial zone is compensated by the forest. </p><p>  The buyers were pleased with the variety of really thought-out planning solutions that make it possible to use every square meter of the area, as well as the gorgeous view that opens from the windows of the new building.  If you have not had time to personally familiarize yourself with the project, we strongly recommend visiting it in order to evaluate all the advantages and disadvantages. </p>
