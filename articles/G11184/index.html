Here you can perfectly relax for quite affordable money, see many interesting places and even chat with some marine inhabitants. </p><p>  Choosing a resort on the Black Sea is a very difficult task, because each of them is attractive in its own way.  Sochi, the famous Olympic resort, which includes not only Central Sochi itself, but also various microdistricts, is very popular with many tourists.  Each of them has its own characteristics, but the Black Sea welcomes guests of any of the resorts. </p><p>  There is a place in Big Sochi called Lazarevskoye.  This is one of the great places to relax, because the local climate and infrastructure will please absolutely all vacationers.  The choice of places for housing here is very diverse: you can either stay in a boarding house or take advantage of the numerous offers of the private sector.  Those who prefer to enjoy their holidays and enjoy all sorts of additional privileges are recommended, of course, to choose a hotel.  For example, for such a holiday, Lake Divnoe is perfect - a 3 * hotel (Sochi, Lazarevskoye), which, in addition to marine entertainment, will also offer wonderful views of the real lake. </p><h2>  Fairytale vacation in Lazarevsky </h2><p>  Lazarevskoye resort is a beautiful and hospitable place, one of the largest <span>areas of Sochi.</span>  It is located a little north of the central part of the Olympic city, at a distance of only 70 km.  But, of course, this does not in any way worsen its climate and sea, thanks to which you can enjoy a wonderful beach holiday from mid-May to October.  Getting to the resort is not at all difficult: the Lazarevskaya railway station is located here, at which all trains coming to or from Sochi make stops. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  All the beaches of Lazarevsky, whose length is approximately 7 kilometers, are covered with pebbles.  At the bottom, the stones are quite small, so here you can safely enter the water anywhere in the area.  Also, due to pebbles, the sea here is always clean and transparent, and vacationers do not have to worry about the fact that fine sand can stick to them. </p><h2>  Entertainment for every taste </h2><p>  However, you should not think that rest in Lazarevsky is limited only to the sea.  The developed infrastructure of this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGreater Sochi will be able to satisfy the needs of even the most demanding tourists, who often lack some spectacles and impressions.  There are as many as two dolphinariums where you can admire beautiful dolphins, walruses and white whales.  Slides located on the territory of two water parks will certainly cheer up not only children but also adults.  There is a beautiful place in Lazarevsky with beautiful butterflies called ‚ÄúButterfly House‚Äù, as well as a penguinarium, where visitors will have the opportunity to look at penguins and various birds, exotic animals and even insects. </p><p>  History buffs can visit the Ethnographic Museum, while those eager to get involved in contemporary art can visit the cinema or local concert hall.  You won‚Äôt be bored here either, because a variety of discos, <span>foam parties,</span> billiards and bowling <span>alleys</span> are also available. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Do not also forget that on the territory of this region of Greater Sochi there is Lake Divnoe.  Lazarevskoye is one of the few resorts where, along with sea water, you can enjoy the purest fresh water, and it will not be from the pool at all. </p><h2>  Rest near the lake </h2><p>  Such a magnificent place like a lake could not be ignored.  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that a hotel called ‚ÄúWonderful Lake‚Äù (Lazarevskoye) arose on its shore.  This is a great place for a family vacation, because here guests will receive not only accommodation and meals, but also a wide variety of additional services.  Of course, they come here primarily for the sake of the Black Sea, but it‚Äôs always nice to realize that relaxation can offer other entertainments as well. </p>

    <p>  Describing this hotel, it is worth noting that most of its guests were satisfied with their stay.  Of course, some note the disadvantages, but there are far fewer of them than the advantages that the eco-hotel Lake Divnoye (Lazarevskoye) has.  The reviews contain information that there is a living area with various animals in the territory, but there are not very many playgrounds in the whole large space. </p><h2>  How to get to the ecohotel </h2><p>  The path to the eco-hotel, located on the Black Sea, is uncomplicated.  For those who prefer to travel by their own transport, it is enough to get to the resort along the Dzhubga-Sochi highway.  Hotel "Divnoe Lake" (Lazarevskoye) is located at: Sochi highway, 2G. </p><p>  You can also get to Sochi from the airport of Sochi by bus or minibus.  First you need to use public transport under numbers 106, 105k or 105 and come to the bus station on them.  Here you will have to transfer to a bus or minibus with numbers 155 or 141 and follow to the stop "Branch" Seagull ".  Train lovers can use the Lazarevskaya railway station.  It‚Äôs not too long to travel by public transport or taxi to the Lake Divnoe Hotel. </p><h2>  A variety of rooms to stay </h2><p>  You can enjoy a comfortable holiday on the Black Sea coast both in large hotels, and in small guest houses or even private houses or rooms.  There are many such offers in any resort place, and Lazarevskoye cannot be called an exception to this rule. </p><p>  ‚ÄúLake Divnoye‚Äù is an eco-hotel, which largely wins the private sector not only due to its service.  Due to the spacious rooms located in real wooden buildings and cottages, there are always a lot of guests here, even though the price of hotel accommodation is higher than any offer of a private trader. </p>
