Hotel Cedriana 3 * (Tunisia / Djerba Island): photos and reviews of tourists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Tunisia is one of the leaders in the tourism market of North Africa.  Pleasant climate, warm Mediterranean Sea, large flat beaches, rich spa - these are good reasons to want to spend a vacation in Tunisia.  In addition, there is such a diverse cultural heritage, before which even Egypt and many European countries take off their hats.  The fact is that a piece of the Earth, which is now trampled upon by the inhabitants of Tunisia, has always been tried by anyone to conquer, and many even succeeded.  So, in ancient centuries, the city of Carthage flourished, which was founded by the Phoenicians.  Then it was destroyed by the Romans.  Tunisia has long been under French rule - until then, when the Arabs did not take up public administration.  Naturally, each conquest left a significant imprint on the culture of the country.  And in our time, almost every “imprint” has become a popular tourist attraction.  The most notorious tourist attraction of Tunisia is the ruins of the ancient city of Carthage, and in El Jem there is an ancient amphitheater, which in size and grandeur is not inferior to the Roman Colosseum.  Other interesting objects, such as the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Cathedral, the Hammamet History Museum, the Gazi Mustafa Fortress, La Goulet, etc., also annually receive their portion of international tourists. </p><p>  For Russian tourists, vacation in Tunisia is not overshadowed by almost any formalities.  Citizens of the Russian Federation do not need to go through the visa pre-registration procedure to enter Tunisia, and even upon arrival at the airport a visa stamp is put on for free. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Tunisia is a wonderful resort, but in a classic beach holiday it can hardly compete with industry leaders - Egypt and Turkey.  But there is one thing in Tunisia that makes it especially attractive for tourists, or rather, for tourists - thalassotherapy.  This is a set of procedures for the treatment of various diseases and cosmetic defects.  The main component and the main active ingredient of thalassotherapy is sea mud.  In qualified clinics, there are programs for the successful treatment of serious illnesses, the consequences of injuries and operations with sea mud, but tourists mainly try thalasso to improve the appearance, tightening or expelling of hated cellulite. </p><h2>  Tunis Hotels </h2><p>  Although Tunisia is focused on the European tourist audience, the standards of service in this country are far from ideal.  The approach to serving tourists in many institutions is quite archaic, and the hotel sector is developing randomly.  On the one hand, several first-class prestigious hotels have already been rebuilt in the country, and even for economical tourists several worthy options have appeared, but most hotels in Tunisia are still quite old and dull. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When choosing a hotel in Tunisia, you should pay attention to the region, listen to the opinion of the manager in a travel agency, if he had to go on an advertising tour, and to the reviews of tourists.  But the star classification of the hotel sector in Tunisia is a controversial criterion.  Sometimes a three-star hotel may not be inferior in all respects to a five-star hotel. </p>

    <p>  Each room has: balcony, TV, telephone, hairdryer, air conditioning, bath / shower, minibar. </p><p>  Rooms are cleaned, including towels and bed linen, daily at the Cedriana Djerba Hotel.  Guest reviews contain a lot of praise regarding housekeeping.  Travelers recall that it is very high-quality and thorough, that the maids are polite, not greedy for tips, they kill mainly when there are no guests in the room. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cult of modern gluttony under the auspices of the All Inclusive system is carefully maintained at the 3 * Djerba Sedriana Hotel.  In fact, it is hard to imagine that such a large and multifunctional hotel complex would work on a different food concept.  As you know, in every country and every hotel has its own “all inclusive”, there are no fixed postulates in the system.  So, checking into a specific hotel, you need to make sure that it is “included” in it. </p>

    <h2>  Bars </h2><ol><li>  Beach bar (free for bracelet owners: soft drinks, water, beer, juices). </li><li>  The poolside snack bar offers snacks, cool drinks, wine, beer, water, juices, and local alcoholic drinks. </li><li>  Lobby bar in the building of the hotel Cedriana Djerba 3 *. </li><li>  Moorish cafe.  In the cafe you can order a hookah (for an additional fee).  As part of the "all inclusive": coffee, tea, soft drinks. </li><li>  After 23:00 a disco bar is open.  It serves alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.  All for an extra charge.  Entrance to the disco is free for hotel guests.  And all drinks and snacks are ordered on the menu and paid separately. </li></ol><h2>  Service </h2><p>  Service in hotels where tourists spend most of the day is of particular importance.  In this case, it is much easier for hotels in which tourists only spend the night and have breakfast.  And in such huge resort complexes as Cedriana Djerba (Tunisia, 3 *), tourists have fun all day, eat, spend time on the beach, in rooms, in bars, etc. On all fronts, quality control of service should be good adjusted.  After all, a tourist evaluates the work of the staff at the reception, and the cleaning of the rooms, and the work of bartenders, waiters, animators, instructors, etc. </p>
