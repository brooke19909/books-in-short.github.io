    <p>  It should be noted right away that the reviews about this hotel are very controversial.  Someone was completely satisfied with their stay here, while someone was literally outraged and insisted that he would never return here again.  We will deal in order. </p><p>  First of all, the vast majority of tourists were very disappointed with the fact that the hotel does not have its own beach, although it is indicated in the brochures of all tour operators that there is one at a distance of one hundred meters.  However, in fact, no beach "Sun Princess" does not have.  Therefore, going to the sea, you can settle down on a municipal beach or the beaches belonging to neighboring hotels.  As a rule, you will have to pay extra for renting sun loungers and umbrellas. </p><p>  As for the hotel itself and the rooms, then, according to many guests, the repair here was clearly carried out for a long time.  So, the walls are ragged in some places, the furniture in the rooms is not new, sometimes some tourists leaked taps or there were problems with the air conditioner.  Otherwise, the rooms in Sun Princess Marmaris 3 * turned out to be quite good: they are quite spacious, clean, and the balcony offers a pleasant view of the mountains, neighboring hotels or the sea.  As for cleaning, here the opinions of tourists differ.  So, someone claims that cleaning and changing linen and towels was carried out regularly.  Other guests assure that similar procedures in their room were carried out no more than once a week. </p>

    <p>  Another controversial issue was the food in the hotel.  Some tourists found the menu monotonous, the dishes are not very tasty, and the fruits and salads are weathered.  According to them, it is necessary to come for lunch and dinner at the very opening of the restaurant, otherwise you may simply not have enough main meat dishes.  They were also very unhappy with the fact that for the food mentioned above, which the cooks laid out in plates of guests in portions, they had to stand in long lines.  Another part of the vacationers found the menu quite acceptable for a three-star hotel. </p><p>  Perhaps the overwhelming majority of our compatriots considered its location to be the main indisputable advantage of the Sun Princess Hotel.  So, the sea can be reached in just five minutes, nearby there are a lot of restaurants, shops, souvenir shops and tour agencies.  Also, the hotel daily organized a free shuttle service to the famous street of bars in Marmaris, which all lovers of nightlife are simply obligated to visit. </p>
