Sberbank - all loans</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Loans are a common service in modern life.  According to statistics, most people used them at least once.  Buying an apartment, car or household appliances on credit is a service that everyone knows about and uses it successfully, not to mention credit cards or inappropriate loans.  Despite this, the population constantly arises about this or that issue.  And the main thing for everyone is still this: "Is it worth taking loans in 2014?" </p><h2>  Pros and cons </h2><p>  In order to give an objective assessment and answer the question of whether to take loans in 2014, you need to understand the mechanism for setting interest rates on bank loans.  Its primary and main component is the Central Bank refinancing rate.  The interest on loans at the bank cannot be lower than this amount.  Therefore, when <span>the inflation rate</span> is at the same level as the refinancing rate, credit funds partially depreciate, which becomes beneficial for borrowers while increasing incomes in proportion to or more than the Central Bank rate. </p>

    <p>  Lending becomes unprofitable in those cases when there is a possibility that their own financial stability may be shaken in the future.  Long-term planning is peculiar only to the state, which annually adopts the budget for next year, based on forecasts and calculations of certain indicators. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Is it worth taking loans in 2014? </h2><p>  The situation in our country is relatively stable, despite forecasts of a possible crisis after the Olympic Games in Sochi and the accession of new territories.  The only thing that a potential borrower should take into account is their own stability in finances and their receipt. </p><p>  It is important to understand that in any case, the currency of the loan must coincide with the income.  Then, fluctuations in exchange rates will have little effect on the conditional cost of a loan for you (with a decrease in the value of the ruble). </p><p>  The following is meant: if money was given in debt in euros or dollars, and the income is transferred to you in rubles, then with an increase in the exchange rate, the cost of the loan increases.  For the borrower, this means an extra overpayment. </p><h2>  What does Sberbank offer for borrowers? </h2><p>  Sberbank loans in 2014 are numerous.  For the summer period - vacation time - Sberbank offers a new product with a reduced interest rate (from 14.5% per annum).  In 2014, these consumer loans can be obtained at Sberbank branches.  They are issued both without collateral (then interest rates will be higher - from 15.5%), and under the guarantee of individuals.  If there are guarantors, the loan amount can be a maximum of 3 million rubles for a period of up to 60 months. </p>

    <p>  Is it worth taking loans in 2014, for example, mortgages?  The current year in mortgage lending remains equally profitable.  Lower interest rates are not expected, as the cost of housing is constantly growing.  A mortgage can be considered as a kind of installment plan with an eye on the future value of real estate.  Yes, the overpayment is significant, but by the time you repay the mortgage you will not feel it.  If you analyze the price increase over the past 14 years, you will see that the cost of apartments has doubled.  Therefore, at the time of repayment of the mortgage, your apartment will be worth the funds that you paid. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Mortgage to young families </h2><p>  Sberbank has developed a special mortgage program - a youth loan for an apartment.  2014 made minor adjustments to its conditions.  Until the end of June 2014, lower interest rates from 10.5% per annum are in effect.  The basic <span>interest rate</span> on a loan from Sberbank is 12% per year for accredited new buildings, that is, developers conclude an agreement in advance for servicing their facilities with Sberbank.  Such cooperation is beneficial for everyone - the bank receives borrowers, and those, in turn, lower mortgage rates.  And the developer sells all the apartments in the new house as quickly as possible. </p>

    <p>  The main feature of such a mortgage product is: </p><ol><li>  Spouses are less than 35 years old. </li><li>  The family may be on a state list to improve housing conditions.  The government pays for them part of the cost of the new apartment. </li><li>  Spouses must have sufficient income to pay mortgage installments. </li></ol><p>  Approval from the bank will be much more likely if you take into account the incomes of not only families, but also their relatives.  Attracting co-borrowers is possible.  Their maximum number is 4 people.  If the family has children, or a ‚ÄúMaternity Capital‚Äù certificate is issued, then this will increase your chances of a mortgage. </p><h2>  Other loan products </h2><p>  What about <span>car loans?</span>  <span>Should I</span> take a loan in 2014 to purchase a car?  The arguments in favor of this loan are not so strong.  Machines, unlike real estate, only become cheaper over time.  Interest rates on car loans are not so high and on average range from 8 to 15%.  An eight-percent loan can be obtained for the purchase of a new car at certain car dealerships, since such an offer is stimulating demand. </p>

    <p>  And the maximum 15% interest rates at Sberbank are paid under the standard car loan program.  Her conditions are more loyal.  So, you can buy a car from a private person, that is, a used one, or buy a new one, but from the category of expensive brands.  The price of the car should be more than 750 000 rubles. </p><p>  Therefore, a <span>loan for the purchase of a car is</span> best to draw up a short-term - up to three years.  Then the overpayment will not be significant compared to the reduction in the cost of the car during this period.  Each year the use of the machine takes about 10% of its sales value.  Real estate, on the contrary, only rises in price over time.  Analysts do not foresee a decrease in its cost. </p>
