How to choose a voltage converter?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The automotive voltage converter 12-220V is a fairly simple device that opens up great opportunities for the driver.  Previously, it was impossible to use various household appliances in the car.  The problem was the <span>alternating current</span> that needed to be converted.  Modern models are able to boast of high power and stable voltage.  In addition, they are comfortable to use. </p><p>  You can make a 12-220V voltage converter from an uninterruptible power supply absolutely independently.  The first thing to do is install the cable to connect the device.  Next, you need to equip the uninterruptible power outlet.  It is important to understand that the power of such a converter will be extremely small.  Use it for a long time will not work.  Given the low cost of the device on the market, it is much more advisable to think about purchasing it. </p>

    <h2>  Parksity Converters Reviews </h2><p>  Converters of this brand have rather strong cases.  Partially they are made of steel.  At the same time, the sockets in them are securely fixed.  Power cables can be disconnected if desired.  It should also be noted the high quality of fuses.  In general, the protection system is working properly and will not fail consumers. </p><p>  The only drawback is the loud operation of the inverter.  This is largely due to the cooling system.  Almost all models have two fans.  After a while, they begin to wear off a little on the axis, and then make noise.  This problem in the service center can be solved by replacing the cooler.  The characteristics of the converters are pretty good.  The average power of the devices is 120 watts, and the output current of the port is 2 A. The efficiency is at a high level.  AC voltage reaches 240 V. </p><h2>  Inverter "Parksi AC22" </h2><p>  This 12V-220V (automotive) voltage converter, for the most part, has bad reviews.  Despite the good power, the device often overheats.  In some cases, fuses may fail.  At the same time, a high-quality protection system has been installed.  It allows you to cope with network jumps and reverse polarity.  The average duration of the inverter is three hours. </p><p>  The inverter power cable is disconnected if necessary.  The cigarette lighter plug is installed by the manufacturer.  You can connect directly to the car‚Äôs battery, but there is only 1 meter cable.  In some cases this may not be enough.  Separately, mention should be made of a quality display system.  The input DC voltage is exactly 20 V, and the operating frequency ranges from 47 to 52 Hz.  This unit costs 2300 rubles on the market. </p>
