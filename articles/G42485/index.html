Adults are also very happy when they receive such an unusual and original gift.  However, in order to relate a conceived character, it is important to have special skills.  Which are absent in beginning masters.  Therefore, in the article we propose to study the technology of crochet the bear cub. </p><h2>  Where to begin </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen say that knitting toys is a very fruitful activity.  And not only because it allows you to engage in creative work.  It is much more important that as a result it is possible to get an amazing and original creation that will delight all family members and, first of all, the needlewoman herself.  Therefore, those who once dared to make a knitted toy forever fall in love with this technique. </p><p>  Professional craftsmen note that it is much more convenient to carry out various crafts using a hook than knitting needles.  They also say that knitted bears are the most popular.  However, in order to make a really beautiful craft, you need to prepare.  The first step is to decide which bear you want to tie.  It can be a Teddy bear, a Soviet Olympic Bear, Umka or even a talking bear from the American comedy "The Third Extra".  In the material presented below, we will analyze in detail <span>how to crochet a</span> Teddy <span>bear cub</span> .  After all, he is the most sought after toy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.jemome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted bear step by step" class="if uuid-3012649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012649.jpg"></div><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  Knitted toys are made using the amigurumi technique.  Features we studied in detail below.  In the meantime, consider the most suitable knitting threads for work.  Experienced craftsmen are convinced that acrylic yarn is best suited to complete the craft.  If the product is being prepared as a gift to a child, it is wiser to consider children's yarn.  Among which it is easy to choose the right color.  In this case, we need gray - the main one, white - for the muzzle, blue - for the nose, black - for stitching parts.  It is better to choose skeins of one company.  But fluffy or multilayer yarn is better not to use.  At least novice needlewomen.  Working with her is uncomfortable.  In addition, a crocheted teddy bear may turn out to be too perforated.  That is, a filler will be visible through a knitted fabric.  The product will look messy and, accordingly, ugly. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Hook search </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen advise with particular thoroughness and scrupulousness to approach the choice of the tool that will be used to knit the intended product.  Traditionally, for various things, knitters use a hook equal to the thickness of the thread.  However, the amigurumi technique has its own characteristics.  And the size of the hook refers to them.  The craftswomen who knit toys professionally say that crocheting a teddy bear should be done so that the knitting is as dense as possible.  Therefore, it is wiser to consider a finer instrument.  You need to focus on the selected yarn.  Also, do not purchase a hook that is too long.  The ideal one that lies well in the hand. </p><h2>  Additional items </h2><p>  Many beginner needlewomen, having decided to make a knitted toy, think for a long time about which filler to choose for stuffing their crafts.  Experienced craftswomen are convinced that a crocheted little teddy bear or a big one is best filled with holofiber.  This will allow you to wash if necessary and dry it without any problems.  Cotton wool or batting is better not to use.  This material will dry for a very long time, draining, leaving reddish-brown marks on the toy.  In addition, the bear will be quite heavy. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="teddy bear crochet description" class="if uuid-3012652" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012652.jpg"></div><p>  It is also worth noting that professional knitters purchase bulk filler in a specialized store.  Because they need to fill a lot of toys.  If the reader just wants to learn a new skill or try his hand at the technique of interest, you can use it as a stuffing inside the gutted pillow or an unnecessary blanket.  You can also put crocheted teddy bear trimming fabric.  But in this case, the craft can also turn out to be difficult.  In addition, washing it will not be very convenient. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Amigurumi's magic ring </h2><p>  Perhaps the reader heard about the term that we formed in the title of the current paragraph?  If not, we will explain that the amigurumi ring is another feature of this technique.  From it begins knitting any crafts.  Including our teddy bear.  However, it does not imply any difficult actions.  Further, we invite readers to study the detailed instructions for performing the amigurumi ring: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we take prepared yarn. </li><li>  And wrap the index finger and middle finger with a thread. </li><li>  The result is a loop. </li><li>  Which must be carefully removed. </li><li>  And tie with six single crochet posts. </li><li>  Connect the first and last loops. </li><li>  And then gently pull off the middle of the resulting circle. </li><li>  To do this, pull the beginning of the thread. </li><li>  So we started crocheting an amigurumi teddy bear. </li><li>  In the next row, we need to double the number of loops.  To do this, we knit out two new ones from each column of the bottom row. </li><li>  Then we knit three rows according to specific instructions. </li><li>  And we turn the circle to ourselves on the other side.  Thanks to what, the initial thread will be inside the teddy bear. </li><li>  We carry out further work, also moving in a circle, but in the other direction. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet teddy bear" class="if uuid-3012418" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012418.jpg"></div><h2>  Base torso </h2><p>  Having carried out competent preparation and having analyzed all the features of the studied technique, you can start crocheting a teddy bear.  The work begins with the implementation of the largest part - the body of the bear.  To do this, take the main yarn and carefully study the sequence of actions described below: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  We make a loop, forming an amigurumi ring, and we tie with six single crochet columns. </li><li>  In the first row from each loop of the lower row we knit two new ones. </li><li>  In the second, we increase through one single crochet, in the third - after two. </li><li>  In the fourth row, we knit two single crochet from one loop of the bottom row, maintaining an interval of three columns. </li><li>  We knit the next five rows without changes, just moving in a circle. </li><li>  In the tenth row we carry out the first decreases.  We knit two single crochet and fasten them with a single loop.  The interval is one bar. </li><li>  A further description of the teddy bear involves a simple crochet of the current number of loops.  Therefore, we knit five rows without increases and decreases. </li><li>  In the fifteenth row, we make a decrease, maintaining an interval of five columns. </li><li>  Then we stuff the torso of the bear with the prepared filler. </li><li>  We knit the sixteenth row, making a decrease through one column. </li><li>  Work is done! </li></ol><h2>  Teddy bear head </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.jemome.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet teddy bear" class="if uuid-3012646" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012646.jpg"></div><p>  In the next part of the instruction on how to crochet a teddy bear, we will analyze the technology for performing the most important part of our craft.  To do this, prepare yarn in two colors.  As we begin work with a nose, we take a white knitting thread.  Then we plunge into the creative process, following the description: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we form an amigurumi ring. </li><li>  In the second row we make an increase every three columns. </li><li>  We knit the third and fourth row in a circle without changes. </li><li>  We turn to gray yarn. </li><li>  In the fifth and eighth double the number of loops, knotting out two new columns from each loop of the previous row. </li><li>  In the sixth, we make an increase through one column. </li><li>  In the seventh - through two columns. </li><li>  We knit the next four rows unchanged. </li><li>  Next, we begin to reduce the loop.  In the thirteenth row, we decrease through three columns. </li><li>  The fourteenth and fifteenth row are simply knit. </li><li>  In the sixteenth, we decrease through two columns. </li><li>  In the seventeenth - through one column. </li><li>  We knit the next row without changes. </li><li>  In the nineteenth we reduce half the loops. </li><li>  Twentieth we knit without changes. </li><li>  Break the thread and pass through the remaining loops. </li></ol><h2>  Ears for a bear </h2><p>  Experienced needlewomen say that it is not necessary to crochet a Teddy bear cub.  Beginners can use the described technology to do any other white or brown fluff.  If desired, you can even tie a panda.  It is only necessary to choose knitting threads of the corresponding colors.  Of course, not a single teddy bear can do without ears.  Therefore, further we will find out how to complete this detail: </p><ol><li>  Work begins with knitting amigurumi rings. </li><li>  After we divide the number of loops by three. </li><li>  We knit 2/3 of the ears in increments through two columns. </li><li>  The remaining 1/3 of the connecting posts. </li><li>  Repeat the last two steps one more time. </li><li>  Next, 2/3 of the eyelet we knit three rows without changes in simple columns, and 1/3 - connecting. </li><li>  According to the instructions described, we are preparing two parts. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3012333" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012333.jpg"></div><h2>  Upper legs </h2><p>  If you look closely at the crochet cubs, you will notice that the upper and lower legs are different in size.  Therefore, you should knit two parts, not all four of the same.  First of all, we study the technology for making the upper legs or arms: </p><ol><li>  We form an amigurumi ring. </li><li>  We make an increase through two columns, and in the next row - through three. </li><li>  After four rows we knit without changes. </li><li>  In the seventh row, we decrease through two columns. </li><li>  From the eighth to eleventh row, we make decreases with an interval of three columns. </li><li>  We knit the twelfth and thirteenth row without changes. </li><li>  In the fourteenth, cut half the loops. </li><li>  Break the thread and pass through the remaining loops. </li></ol><h2>  Lower paws </h2><p>  At this point, we study the technology of making the legs of our teddy bear: </p><ol><li>  First of all, we form an amigurumi ring. </li><li>  We make an increase through one column, and in the next row - after two. </li><li>  After six rows we knit without changes. </li><li>  In the seventh row, we decrease through two columns. </li><li>  From the eighth to eleventh row, we make decreases with an interval of three columns. </li><li>  We knit the next three rows unchanged. </li><li>  In the fifteenth row, we decrease through three columns. </li><li>  Then we knit two rows without changes. </li><li>  In the eighteenth year, we cut half the loops. </li><li>  Break the thread and pass through the remaining loops. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to crochet a teddy bear" class="if uuid-3012655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012655.jpg"></div><h2>  How to make a bear that can stand </h2><p>  Many needlewomen prefer to crochet such toys as cubs who "can" stand.  If desired, the reader can also do a similar craft.  To do this, you just need to tie the legs differently.  For some novice masters, this option seems much simpler and more convenient.  However, everyone must decide for themselves.  We can share instructions with readers.  Which consists in the following actions: </p><ol><li>  Work begins with the formation of the amigurumi ring. </li><li>  After knitting a circle of the right size. </li><li>  Having reached the desired, we knit the part in height.  We simply move in a circle without increases and decreases. </li><li>  Then gradually reduce the loop.  Professional craftsmen say that it is better to fix the initial addition of loops and complete the part in the same way.  That is, to make a decrease instead of an increase. </li></ol><p>  If the reader likes this description more, it can be used when knitting the upper legs.  But we would like to remind once again that the lower legs should be larger than the upper!  It is also important to mention that no matter which option the reader prefers, the paws will need to be well packed. </p><h2>  Collect the little bear </h2><p>  When all the details are ready, you can proceed to the final part of our instructions.  On it we have to use a needle with a thread and sew the upper and lower legs and head to the body.  Ears should be attached to the last part.  It should also be supplemented with eyes.  And for these purposes, you can use simple black beads or finished eyes.  You can buy them at any needlework store.  Also, if you wish, you can make "live" eyes yourself.  Experienced needlewomen prefer to knit them, starting with the amigurumi ring and continuing to add to the desired size of the circle.  Beginners glue colored cardboard eyes.  Then both options are covered with a thick layer of Moment glue.  Dried and used as intended.  The nose for the teddy bear can be knitted, embroidered or made in the same way as the eyes.  In any case, it is important not to forget to supplement the finished crafts with eyebrows and tails representing fingers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted bear" class="if uuid-3012419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/3012419.jpg"></div><h2>  The highlight of the teddy bear </h2><p>  We presented to your attention a master class: ‚ÄúWe crochet a teddy bear‚Äù.  However, in the end it is important to note: those who decided to tie the Teddy bear, can not do without one more step.  Striped patch patches on the side, paws, or teddy bear head.  For its implementation, it is best to use a piece of felt in a contrasting color.  Although it is also possible to knit square patches. </p><p>  Knitted toys every day are becoming increasingly popular.  They are performed easily.  But if the needlewoman has the imagination and the necessary knowledge and skills, it turns out to create a real masterpiece. </p>
