It belongs to the resort city of Sochi.  Thousands of tourists come there every year to relax. </p><h2>  Where is Makopse located? </h2><p>  Makopse (Krasnodar Territory) is located on the very coast of the Black Sea.  It is here that the mouth of the river of the same name is located, thanks to which the microdistrict got its name, which everyone in Russia knows today.  From the district center Lazorevskoe Makopse is located only 8 kilometers to the north-west.  The distance to the center of Sochi is greater - about 65 kilometers.  About 130 kilometers to Krasnodar. </p><p>  The village has good transport accessibility, as the Dzhubga-Adler <span>federal highway</span> passes through it, as well as the railway line that belongs to the North Caucasian Railway.  Directly in the village itself is the Makopse railway station.  In the Krasnodar Territory, the village borders with the settlements of Nadzhigo, Kalinovka, Vishevka and Sovet-Kvadzhe. </p>

    <p>  The average altitude at Makops is approximately 50 meters above sea level, the absolute - not more than 500. There is also its own small hill.  This is Tamurdere Mountain, located in the north-eastern part of the village.  The top of the mountain is 518 meters above sea level. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In the village itself there are many small rivers and even streams that directly flow into the Black Sea.  The climate in Makops (Krasnodar Territory) can be characterized as subtropical and humid.  The average temperature in July reaches 24 degrees, and in January - only +6.  About one and a half thousand millimeters of precipitation falls annually, mainly in the winter. </p><h2>  Name origin history </h2><p>  Makopse village in the Krasnodar Territory, whose photo is in this article, got its name from the river of the same name.  It is located at its mouth.  In general, ‚Äúmakopse‚Äù is an Adyghe word.  In literal translation, it translates as "hay river."  Part of the word "meku" means "hay", and the remaining "dogs" means "river."  There is a legend that when flood occurs, a lot of dry grass floats along the river, which gets there from the coastal meadows in the area. </p>

    <p>  The Makopse River itself is relatively small, with a length of about 12 kilometers.  Despite its modest size, it somehow played an important role in world history.  This happened in 1919, after the Sochi conflict intensified at the Paris Conference.  The Georgians then began to insist on restoring the historical borders of their state, which belonged to the reign of Queen Tamara.  According to them, the Tuapse and Sochi districts were to become part of Georgia.  These historical evidence was supported by the UK.  According to them, it was precisely along the Makopse River that the border should have passed. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  History of Makopse </h2><p>  Makopse village in the Krasnodar Territory is not only a great place to relax, but also an ancient settlement that keeps a centuries-old history.  The first people began to live in these areas back in the Stone Age.  Initially, the Zikhov tribes lived there, and then their later descendants - Ubykhs and Adygs.  When the Caucasian War ended in the vicinity, and Circassia was officially annexed to the Russian Empire, almost the entire local population did not want to swear allegiance to the Russian Tsar.  Therefore, it was evicted to the Ottoman Empire.  In the 1870s, Turkish Greeks from the regions of Asia Minor began to actively move here.  This happened after the Russian emperor donated the land on which the village of Makopse is located to the Greek Anastas Apostolov. </p>

    <p>  Officially as a village Makopse was first registered already under the Soviet Union.  This happened in 1923.  The settlement became part of the Tuapse district of the Kuban-Black Sea region.  In 1935, the village became the administrative center of the local village council and became part of the Shapsug district.  The latter, in turn, was renamed Lazarevsky in 1945.  Only in 1965 the village was finally included in the resort city of Sochi.  It remains in this legal status today.  Today, about two thousand people live in the microdistrict.  Mostly these are Greeks, Russians, Circassians and Armenians. </p><h2>  Advantages of Makopse </h2><p>  In this village, almost everything is provided for a good rest.  Several comfortable guest houses have been built.  All of them are located within the boundaries of a residential neighborhood.  At the same time, visitors mostly stay in the private sector.  For example, in apartments or extensions to cottages and country houses.  In addition, many specially build guest houses, hostels and mini-hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Makopse village, Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14834/1991803.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  On the territory of Makopse there is a children's recreation <span>camp "Friendship",</span> which almost all year round send teenagers from all over the country.  An array of residential high-rise buildings appeared in the 80s of the last century.  One-story buildings are typical for Caucasian villages.  A low-cost vacation includes vacation in Makops (Krasnodar Territory).  Rest in these places can cost you quite a reasonable amount, which can afford the middle class.  At the same time, you will meet a fairly high level of service and maintenance. </p><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  Most of the mini-hotels and guest houses are located on the territory of <span>Nizhny Makopse of the</span> Krasnodar Territory in close proximity to the water.  Coming here is not difficult.  For example, if you travel by plane, it is most convenient to land at Adler Airport.  From there, to the destination there is a direct train.  There are several railway stations belonging to Makops along the coastal line.  So consult in advance which one will be more convenient for you to go out. </p>

    <p>  Of the long-distance trains, only a few stop directly in the village.  Most go to Tuapse.  From there, Makopse can be reached by the same train. </p><h2>  Leisure at the resort </h2><p>  About Makops (Krasnodar Territory) reviews from tourists come mostly positive.  There is not only beautiful nature, but also there is something to brighten up your leisure time.  The main attraction of the village, which is worth seeing for any tourist, is Laura's Tears Waterfall.  Before him, about 10 kilometers from the village itself.  A legend is associated with him, similar to that described by Alexander Green in his famous extravaganza "Scarlet Sails". </p>

    <p>  A little further you can see the magnificent cascades of waterfalls.  They are well known to everyone under the name Serenade of Love.  If you prefer a vibrant nightlife, then from Makops you can get to Tuapse or Lazarevsky.  There you will find bars, night clubs and discos. </p><h2>  Beach in Makops </h2><p>  The length of the beach line of the village is approximately 6 kilometers.  Mostly it is covered with pebbles.  But there are also small sandy islands.  The beaches are divided between resorts.  Each of them is responsible for its part and maintains it in proper condition.  The level of service is quite high, tourists say in the reviews. </p>
