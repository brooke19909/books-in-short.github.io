Almost every year, new streets appear on her map.  However, there are also ‚Äúveterans‚Äù in the city.  These are the streets along which the ancestors of the native Muscovites moved 200-300, and maybe more years ago.  Among them is Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya.  It has a long history, and buildings that make the unique architectural appearance of the Russian capital preserved on it. </p>

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street is located in the CJSC of Moscow on the territory of the district, which relatively recently gave its name.  It starts from the <span>Borodino bridge</span> near the <span>square of the Kiev railway station</span> and passes by T. Shevchenko embankment to Kutuzovsky Prospekt.  Second Bryansk Lane and ul.  Mozhaysky Val, on the right - Ukrainian Boulevard and Pervaya Borodinskaya Street. </p><h2>  Dorogomilovsky district </h2><p>  The area with this name has been known since the 13th century.  It was the estate of the boyar Ivan Dorogomilov and was originally located in another place, on the left bank of the Moscow River.  In the 16th century, a Yamskaya settlement was founded opposite it.  Its name - Dorogomilovskaya - was soon transferred to the area located in the bend of the Moscow River.  As part of the capital during the Soviet period, it with territorial courtyards belonged to the Kiev region. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  After the administrative reform carried out in 1991, Kutuzovsky and Dorogomilovsky municipal districts were created.  After 3 years they were combined.  Later, in 1995, as a result of the adoption of the relevant law, the Dorogomilovo district was formed. </p>

    <h2>  History until the 20th century </h2><p>  Since the end of the 16th century, Dorogomilovskaya Street was the main one in the settlement of the same name.  It acquired particular importance when in 1742 they built the Kamer-Kollezhsky shaft, which performed customs functions.  At that time, Dorogomilovskaya Street ended at the gates of the same outpost, which is the ‚Äúgateway‚Äù to the Mozhayskoye Highway.  Soon, the epithet ‚ÄúBig‚Äù was added to its name.  Its appearance was due to the fact that as a result of the development of the adjacent territory a parallel street appeared, called Malaya Dorogomilovskaya. </p><p>  For a long time, the area, which today is limited by the Third Transport Ring, Berezhkovskaya and Taras Shevchenko embankment, was the outskirts where the poor settled.  Over the course of decades, no improvement works have been carried out there, although across the river a few hundred meters was a well-maintained and ‚Äúfront‚Äù Moscow. </p><p>  Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya street, built up by poor peasant huts, was repeatedly flooded during floods.  The most devastating happened in 1879, when the waters of the Moskva River rose by 3 arshins, which is 213 cm. All basements were flooded, and residential buildings were also damaged in the lowlands.  Some even ended up completely in the water and, after its descent, were not suitable for recovery. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  At the beginning of the 20th century </h2><p>  In the mid-19th century, the sunset of the coachmen era came.  It was connected with the fact that Moscow connected the railway with Europe and with cities located in the eastern provinces of the country.  In the summer of 1899, the Bryansk (now Kiev) station was opened.  This event led to the fact that Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street in Moscow became one of the busiest in the capital, as it drove passengers all day on the railway.  Soon, intensive development of the surrounding area began, mainly with 2-story wooden houses. </p><p>  In 1908, the territory of the modern Dorogomilovsky district again suffered from devastating floods.  It was so powerful that the Bryansk station had to be closed, and trains were forced to leave from Brest. </p>

    <p>  Although since the end of the 19th century it was possible to get to the center of Moscow from Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street to the horse-drawn carriage, it could not provide the public transport needs of the population of the region, which reached 100 thousand people.  As a result of the appeal to the City Duma in 1909, a new tram line was launched from the Dorogomilovskaya outpost.  In addition, kerosene-glow lamps, which were then a novelty for Russia, were installed along the route of the cars. </p><p>  In 1912, in preparation for the celebration of the centenary of the Patriotic War of 1812, the city authorities began to discuss the issue of renaming Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street into Kutuzovskaya.  However, the idea had opponents, and in the end the old name was retained. </p><h2>  In the Soviet period </h2><p>  In the first half of the 1930s, the street was reconstructed, and the second trolleybus route in the capital was launched along it.  At the same time, the tram line was transferred, and the Epiphany Church, which existed there from the 16th century, was destroyed.  Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street itself was significantly expanded.  Before the start of World War II, only buildings N 1 and 5 were commissioned from the buildings whose construction was planned according to the district reconstruction project. The remaining structures that can be seen today mainly appeared in the 1950s and 60s and even later. </p><h2>  Obelisk "Moscow - Hero City" </h2><p>  This is the main decoration in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street appeared there in 1977.  The obelisk "Moscow - Hero City" 40 meters high is lined with gray hewn granite and crowned with a large five-pointed gold star with a wings spread of 2 meters.  It is set on an artificial hill, poured in the center of the oval platform.  At the foot of the obelisk, on separate pedestals, there are 3 granite 5-meter sculptures depicting a worker, soldier and worker, who embody the unity of the front and rear. </p>

    <h2>  Noteworthy architectural objects on the street.  Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya </h2><p>  Moscow is a city where there are many residential buildings that are associated with the names of famous cultural figures, politicians, scientists and military leaders.  For example, Alexander Tvardovsky once lived in house <span>No. 1</span> .  In 1977, a memorial plaque was erected on its facade in memory of the poet.  The building itself is also noteworthy, since it was with its construction that reconstruction began, thanks to which Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street in Moscow acquired its modern look. </p><p>  House N 6 is also of interest. It has an original silhouette and stands out among other buildings with unusual architectural elements in the constructivism style. </p><h2>  House N 5 building 2 </h2><p>  As already mentioned, in the 1930s, Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya Street began to radically change its appearance.  That is why, although its history spans more than one century, you can hardly see the buildings of the pre-revolutionary period on it.  One of the few survivors is building No. 5, building 2. The four-story building was built of brick in 1914 according to the project of architect A. M. Gurzhienko as an apartment building for 8 apartments. Today it houses the Kocherga anticafe. </p>

    <h2>  House No. 9 and the building at <strong>10 Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya</strong> </h2><p>  The street in question over the years has been the place where such famous figures of Soviet cinema as actress <span>V. Telegin,</span> film directors Mikhail Kalatozov, S. Gerasimov and A. Stolper lived.  All of them were neighbors in the house N 9, which was built in 1954, and did not suffer from star disease at all, like modern movie figures.  In particular, they could often be seen in shops located in the neighborhood, for example, in the building at 10 Bolshaya Dorogomilovskaya (building 1).  There are still many retail outlets, consumer services and financial organizations there, which is very convenient for residents of nearby houses, and the School of the Embassy of the Republic of India in Moscow operates in the second building. </p>
