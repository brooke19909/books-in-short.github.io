  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comfort and safety are Eilat hotels</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Vacation time is right, but there is still no exact vacation plan?  Then it is definitely worth thinking about a vacation in the Israeli resort city of Eilat.  <span>This enchantingly</span> beautiful place is located in the southernmost point of the state of Israel on the shores of the tropical Red Sea.  <strong>Holidays in Eilat are</strong> possible not only in the midst of the hot season, but also at any convenient time of the year - the climate is tropical and always has summer and sea of ‚Äã‚Äãsunshine!  Tourists from all over the world plunge here headlong into the arms of the bliss and experience unearthly bliss.  The city itself is relatively young, its history dates back a little over forty years, but the history of Israel for several thousand years is a very ancient ‚Äúpromised land‚Äù and Holy for many generations of Christians, Muslims and Jews.  She has something to show and how to hit. </p><p>  The territory of Israel is relatively small, so the <strong>hotels of Eilat</strong> , in addition to traditionally <span>beach vacations, also</span> offer sightseeing tours of the country's sights, which are within 1-2 hours by bus, always equipped with air conditioning and on very high quality roads.  It offers tourists sightseeing tours to Jerusalem and Bethlehem (where, according to legend, Jesus Christ was born), climbing the sacred Mount Sinai, as well as trips to the <span>Dead Sea</span> and the Jordanian Peter.  The <strong>hotels of Eilat</strong> themselves were originally built taking into account the most modern standards of comfort and safety, which they offer fully to all arriving guests.  They are classified according to the generally accepted five-star system and you can be sure that the <strong>Eilat hotels</strong> correspond to the declared number of stars.  Such, for example, is the 5-star <strong>Dan Panorama Hotel Eilat</strong> .  Tourists who have left reviews about Eilat hotels unanimously report that it really has the highest level of service.  The list of amenities that Thai has, would probably take more than one page.  And if you need a quality vacation, you can find it here.  The hotel is located two hundred meters from the beach. If you need a simpler vacation, you can stay in the <strong>"ASTRAL BRIZA HOTEL EILAT 4 *"</strong> or three stars <strong>"ADI HOTEL EILAT"</strong> and <br>  <strong>"ARCADIA SPA</strong> " (with a medical bias). These hotels have also earned a positive reputation for reviews of vacationers there.  In Israel, there is not a large amount <span>of minerals</span> and the authorities are well aware that tourism is the only "gold mine" for their economy.  The order in this area is monitored by the whole Ministry of Tourism of Israel and they carry out their work conscientiously. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Its favorable geographical position allows combining <strong>vacations in Eilat</strong> not only with excursions inland, but also with tours to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, with a trip to which you can turn around in one day, as they are literally at arm's length.  But that is not all.  For lovers of safari, <strong>Eilat hotels</strong> can offer special jeep tours to the desert areas of the city's environs. </p><p>  The Red Sea itself not only meets everyone with the gentle embrace of its warm waters, but also hides in its depths a fabulously beautiful underwater world.  Here is just a paradise for diving enthusiasts.  In the coastal zone, shallow depths, well warmed by sunshine.  This provides fertile ground for the growth of <span>coral reefs,</span> on the tops of which the underwater animal world especially shines with a wealth of colors and fantastic diversity.  Many Eilat hotels specifically for diving are staffed by experienced instructors, accompanied by whom even a novice in the world of diving will feel.  On the <span>coast of Eilat</span> there is a landmark underwater park, near which the <strong>Isrotel Yam Suf (4-star)</strong> hotel is located.  He specializes in providing such services.  He even has a diving club ‚ÄúMenta‚Äù. In terms of safety, the fact that there are no large sharks in these waters and that you can not be afraid of a sudden attack, which have recently increased in other resorts, plays a positive role. </p><p>  In addition to daytime life, the tourist city of Eilat is in full swing at night. When fast tropical dusk falls, the city streets are illuminated by the plentiful neon light of numerous nightlife venues.  Many Eilat hotels have their own restaurants and cafes, but nothing prevents the tourist from visiting any night club that he will like.  Of course, it is necessary to observe basic precautions, but in general, the level of security is at a very high level, which creates a well-deserved reputation for the city, attracting even more guests.  In terms of comfort and safety, reviews about Eilat hotels from those who have already spent their holidays there are mostly positive. </p>
