    <p>  Appearance <span>"Lenovo A606" is</span> quite ordinary and lost among the brothers.  The manufacturer does not pay much attention to the design of state employees, but in general this is not upsetting.  The emphasis of the company is on productivity, and appearance goes by the wayside. </p><p>  The smartphone is made of plastic, and quite good quality.  Despite the cheap material, the device has <span>an oleophobic coating.</span>  The owner does not have to worry about fingerprints and dirt on his gadget. </p><p>  External details took their usual places.  On the front of the device is a display, speaker, sensors, logo, touch buttons, front camera and, of course, the logo.  The bottom end sheltered only a microphone, and the top - a 3.5 jack and a USB connector.  The back side acquired the brand of the company, the main camera, speaker and flash. </p><p>  Actually, no change happened, which is even better.  Every detail takes the most optimal place.  The volume and power buttons, located very close, are a little confusing, but this does not affect the work. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition to the mediocre appearance, the variety of colors also does not delight.  Only black and white versions of the device are available to the user.  More colors would significantly dilute the grayness of the design. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The large <span>Lenovo A606</span> display is pretty poorly implemented.  Despite a full five inches of diagonal, impressions are not the best.  The reason for this was the low resolution, namely 854 by 480, which is not enough for this size.  Pixels appear on the screen, in fact, this is not surprising at 196 ppi. </p>

    <p>  Sharp corners are slightly smoothed by the IPS matrix.  In addition to improving quality, the technology added a viewing angle to the device.  Now the picture is not distorted, and the behavior in the sun is much better. </p><p>  Another unpleasant moment will be the operation of the sensor with just two touches.  Considering that the overwhelming majority of public sector employees support as many as 5 points at a time, this parameter looks disappointing. </p><h2>  Hardware </h2><p>  Equipped the phone <span>"Lenovo A606"</span> powerful "stuffing."  The installed MTK processor not only ensured the performance of the device, but also significantly reduced the cost.  The smartphone has as many as four cores with a frequency of 1.3 GHz each.  Among the competitors, the phone clearly stands out for its power. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Savings on the processor allowed to increase the number of RAM.  The device has acquired a whole gigabyte of memory. </p><p>  The device was equipped with the familiar Mali-400 MP video accelerator.  It is enough for all the needs of a smartphone. </p><p>  The worst situation is with the built-in memory.  The smartphone has only 8 GB, and only 4.7 GB will be available to the user.  A significant part of the memory is occupied by Android and its built-in applications.  Only the ability to install flash cards up to 32 GB in color. </p><h2>  Camera </h2>

    <p>  They equipped Lenovo A606 with their favorite eight megapixels.  Almost the entire series A has similar cameras and, accordingly, the quality of the pictures.  Resolution 3264 by 2448 pixels is not bad for an inexpensive smartphone, but the photos are mediocre.  The device has subtle settings and autofocus.  Unfortunately, one should not expect much from the Lenovo A606. </p><p>  The smartphone is capable of shooting video, moreover, in HD.  The resulting video has a resolution of 1280 by 720. Few state employees will be able to boast of such a feature. </p><p>  The device has got two megapixels of the front camera.  Naturally, this is not enough for a full-fledged self-portrait, but a lot for video communication.  The manufacturer could well install a normal eyelet of 0.3 and improve another parameter. </p><h2>  System </h2><p>  The gadget works on the "Android" is not the latest version - 4.4.  However, it is worth paying tribute: the system is playful and functioning properly.  The interface works without braking and errors. </p>

    <p>  The manufacturer‚Äôs shell is installed on top of the system.  The already familiar Vibe UI comes with installed programs.  Some will be useful, while others will hang dead weight.  As in the predecessors, it is impossible to remove many applications without root rights. </p><p>  If necessary, the new <span>Lenovo A606 firmware</span> is available for installation via FOTA.  Difficulties with a wireless installation should not arise.  Another upgrade option will be the installation of <span>custom firmware.</span> </p><h2>  Equipment </h2><p>  Together with the device, the user will receive an adapter, a headset, a USB cable, a battery, instructions and a protective film.  In some cases, the package includes a cover for Lenovo A606.  This will be a nice addition that can protect the gadget from damage. </p><h2>  Communication </h2><p>  A curious feature in the A606 was the presence of LTE.  A small number of middle-class devices can boast of working in 4G, and for a state employee this is generally unbelievable. </p><p>  In addition to new technology, the smartphone also works in the more familiar 2G and 3G networks. </p><h2>  Price </h2>

    <p>  For its characteristics, the cost of the device is quite democratic.  You can become the owner of the device for only 6 thousand rubles.  Naturally, some models have a lower cost, but they do not have LTE and high performance. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The hardware is the strongest side of the Lenovo A606.  A review of the characteristics of the "filling" allows you to make an impression of its performance.  The hardware installed in the A606 goes beyond the usual framework for budget employees. </p><p>  A pleasant surprise for the user will be the availability of 4G.  Perhaps this network will not come in handy, but the supply pocket does not pull. </p><p>  The successful implementation of the system is also noteworthy.  All minor flaws arising in the predecessors are corrected and finalized.  Even the issue of updating itself disappears. </p><p>  One of the most compelling reasons to choose the A606 is its cost.  Even by the standards of budget devices, the price is more than acceptable. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  First of all, the screen is striking.  The large diagonal is corrupted by low resolution, and even the IPS-matrix does not fix this. </p><p>  Praise and design cannot be honored.  Naturally, you don‚Äôt have to wait for an incredible appearance from a cheap gadget, but a variety of colors would not hurt. </p><h2>  Total </h2><p>  The A606 model clearly showed the lack of the Lenovo company.  Improving one characteristic, the company lowers another.  So, due to savings on the display, an upgrade of the "filling" was made.  In general, the impressions of the device are pleasant, but minor miscalculations upset. </p>
