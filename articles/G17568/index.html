    <h2>  Tourist paradise </h2><p>  The mild Mediterranean climate reigns on the island of Cyprus.  Protaras, whose beaches are distinguished by extraordinary grooming, cleanliness and comfort, has become a resort village relatively recently.  Before the conquest of the neighboring resort town of Famangusta by the Turks, this place was just a small fishing village.  Now Protaras is an ideal place for a calm and measured family vacation.  It is very beautiful and comfortable here.  Despite the scorching sun, the village has a lot of greenery and flowers.  Wide streets filled with cafes, restaurants, souvenir shops, car rental points and other attributes of the tourism business stretch along the coast.  Smaller streets flock to the coast itself.  They contain a variety of hotels, the price of a stay in which varies depending on proximity to the sea.  Protaras hotels with a private beach are the best option for your stay. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Beach at Cannos Bay </h2><p>  This picturesque place can only be reached by car and taxi.  However, the stunning beauty of the beach more than compensates for your transportation costs.  Here sheer cliffs descend to the sea and form a narrow strip of land with clean white sand, washed by the waves of the sea.  The road to the beach deserves special attention.  It forms a steep mountain serpentine, which winds between tall Mediterranean pine trees.  It is worth getting out of the car and breathing in the sweet tarry air, drunk with the salty sea wind and the heat of the sun!  Near the beach, in the shade of the trees, there is a small cafe.  Sitting at the table of this establishment and admiring the sea is a separate pleasure.  The beach has everything that is needed for a civilized vacation: a rescue station, a shower, a dressing room and various water attractions.  The only drawback of this place is the inconvenient parking.  You will have to go down directly to the beach on foot.  Two tourist routes have been laid from the coast.  One leads to Cyclops Bay - a place where diving enthusiasts gather.  Otherwise, you can get to the picnic site.  However, in the summer heat, these walks can be a difficult test. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Fig Tree Beach </h2><p>  Protaras is a village where all the conditions for a comfortable family vacation are created.  The most famous beach in these places got its name in honor of a fig tree growing on its territory.  According to legend, this plant is almost three hundred years old.  The beach is located in the center of the village, in a small bay, so there is a very calm sea.  It is covered with golden yellow sand, small and soft to the touch.  Here, even, without sudden changes, entry into the water.  The sea is rather shallow, so on this beach it is good to relax with young children.  The sun in Cyprus is quite aggressive, so to protect against it is worth renting a <span>beach umbrella</span> and sunbed.  The Fig Tree beach is always very clean - staff clean several times a day.  There are free showers so that vacationers can wash off sand and salt.  Directly by the sea is the four- <span>star Capo Bay Hotel,</span> near which there is a small pond where colorful koya carps swim.  These colorful fish, like pigeons, flock together, noticing a man on the shore.  Vacationers here like to take pictures for memory. </p>

    <h2>  Flamingo beach </h2><p>  Drowning in lush greenery and fragrant flowers you will remember the village of Protaras.  The beaches in these places have lawns overgrown with emerald grass, which is surprising, because in a hot climate, and even under the salty splashes of sea waves, it is very difficult to keep at least some greens intact.  However, the locals take great care of the beaches, because they bring most of the income on the island of Cyprus.  One of the best in Protaras is Flamingo Beach.  Here, vacationers can enjoy traditional beach activities: water rides (parachuting, banana and skiing), a massage parlor with beautiful sea views, cafes and restaurants located on the beach.  Flamingo beach has its own highlight: a pier, from which pleasure steamers regularly depart.  One of them has a transparent bottom so that tourists can observe the inhabitants of the deep sea without interference.  The second is called the "Black Pearl" and is designed as a <span>pirate ship</span> with the corresponding attributes and symbols. </p>

    <h2>  Green Bay Beach </h2><p>  Protaras, whose beaches are described in this article, is a good place for diving.  Green Bay has a beautiful scuba diving beach.  It is small but clean and well maintained.  It even has its own jetty for pleasure boats.  A convenient approach to water, a rugged coastline, an abundance of pitfalls, algae and marine life make this place attractive for divers.  Swimming with flippers and a mask is very interesting here.  You can find yourself in a flock of tiny fish, enveloping you in a silver cloud, or see the octopus rocks in the crevice.  Here you can see a slowly floating flute fish and meet an exotic sea bream.  Divers brought and flooded the statues of Apollo and Aphrodite in the Green Bay in order to make this place even more attractive. </p>
