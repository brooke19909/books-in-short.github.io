If you do not get into the wilds regarding the quality of the mobile gadget itself, then the most objective indicator responsible for fulfilling the above requirements is the sound pressure, which directly depends on the characteristics of the acoustic path of the gadget. </p>

    <p>  Russian standards consider a figure of 70 decibels, which is akin to a typical noisy street.  In order to <span>choose a phone</span> with good sound in dynamics, we will focus on data exceeding this value.  It should be noted immediately that the concepts of ‚Äúsound‚Äù and ‚Äúsound‚Äù should not be confused, because the latter is responsible precisely for the quality of the playback of the output tracks with all bits, kilohertz and new-fangled technologies such as Hi-Res Audio.  In our case, we will consider exactly the top phones with good sound and not sound (although one does not interfere with the other). </p><p>  Rating of models with good (loud) sound: </p><ol><li>  "Xiaomi Mi4c". </li><li>  Meise MX5. </li><li>  LG X Power K220DS. </li><li>  <span>Samsung Galaxy J7</span> (2016). </li><li>  Sony Xperia XA Ultra. </li></ol><p>  The main purpose of the rating / review is to acquaint the reader with models that are distinguished by good indicators of maximum volume, and without any cacophony at the extreme levels.  All gadgets can be easily bought in Russian stores for a relatively low price. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Xiaomi Mi4c </h2><p>  Interestingly, many manufacturers for gadgets with a similar filling, like Xiaomi, do not hesitate to ask for twice as much money from their customers.  The only reason a Chinese phone with good sound fell into the budget category is the polycarbonate case.  Although, if you look at similar devices in this segment, then this element looks very decent, and the variety of gamma to some extent compensates for the lack of "solidity" of the gadget. </p>

    <p>  Xiaomi's budget Mi4c <span>phone</span> with good sound easily delivers sound pressure of 81 decibels.  It may not be a record, but for its price and feature set it is very good. </p><h2>  Device Features </h2><p>  As for the other components of the smartphone, there‚Äôs nothing to complain about: a good screen on an intelligent matrix, a smart platform and a good set of gigabytes on board.  Modern gaming applications will run without problems on the device and annoy the owner with friezes, subsidence by the FPS and other lags will not (on average graphics settings - for sure). </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, this cell phone with good sound has one, and for some, a critical drawback.  The gadget has only 16 GB of internal memory, and alas, it does not support any memory cards, so video and gamers should better look at the older models of the brand. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features of the device </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that a new generation USB interface is used to charge the device.  On the one hand, it seems to be convenient, because the plug can be attached on either side, and on the other, you will have to carry either an adapter or a standard charger to power the device at work or at a party. </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  excellent performance for a budget model; </li><li>  really fast wifi; </li><li>  good sound; </li><li>  smart screen and matrix; </li><li>  attractive price tag. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  there is no possibility of working with memory cards; </li><li>  The gadget does not support all LTE bands. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 8000 rubles. </p><h2>  Meizu MX5 </h2><p>  Another representative of the Celestial Empire, who will help us answer the question: ‚ÄúWhich phone has the best sound?‚Äù  The model appeared on the market of mobile gadgets about a year ago and fell significantly closer to the new year 2017.  As for the indicators we are interested in, the dynamics of the device can give out a pressure of 78 decibels, which is a very good indicator for smartphones. </p>

    <p>  Regarding the other characteristics of the device, everything is up to standard here.  The company's engineers were not only able to develop phones with the best sound, but provided a high-performance gadget due to the Helio X10 single-chip system.  The capabilities of this technology are enough to run any demanding applications, so even the most "heavy" toys, as they say, "fly" without any lags and friezes.  In addition, due to a single-chip chip, the case of the device (metal) is absolutely not heated. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  Samsung‚Äôs modern AMOLED matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãresponsible for the picture quality, therefore, the output quality is corresponding: good viewing angles and ‚Äútrue‚Äù colors.  Some owners complain about the excessive juiciness of the picture and the lack of built-in profiles for adjusting the gamma, but this point cannot be called critical, although sometimes this display causes some inconvenience. </p><p>  In addition, the MX5 series gadgets are not only phones with the best sound, but also devices with an excellent branded camera from Sony itself.  The only fly in the ointment, which affects almost all the Celestial devices, is a partial incompatibility with the LTE bands of our mobile operators. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  juicy, contrasting and bright picture from the AMOLED matrix; </li><li>  multifunctional external interface, including a fingerprint scanner; </li><li>  excellent front and main cameras; </li><li>  good sound. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  partial support for domestic LTE bands; </li><li>  non-removable battery; </li><li>  you can not build memory; </li><li>  there are no screen profiles for working with the color scheme; </li><li>  too slippery body. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 17,000 rubles. </p><h2>  LG X Power K220DS </h2><p>  The main advantages of the Power line are two.  The first, as you probably already understood, are the phones with the best sound: the speaker easily produces a volume of 83 decibels.  And the second, no less important quality is indicated in the name of the line itself - this is a capacious and powerful battery, which provides the gadget with an extremely enviable autonomy for competitors. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the relatively weak (by today's standards) filling and modest screen resolution on a mediocre matrix helps to extend the life of the smartphone.  The latter, as it turned out, greatly affects comfortable work on a sunny day - the maximum brightness of the display is clearly not enough.  Nevertheless, viewing angles are quite acceptable, as well as color reproduction. </p><h2>  Gadget Features </h2><p>  If you want to choose a phone with good sound, then the K220DS model is a good option, but keep in mind that you won‚Äôt be able to play modern toys comfortably, you will have to reduce the quality of the graphics to a minimum.  As for the rest of the tasks, the capabilities of the current chipset are quite enough.  In addition, the owner of the smartphone becomes the owner of some of the company‚Äôs signature features, such as the original selfie shoots and various modes for watching videos and reading books (suppressing blue spectra, turns, etc.). </p><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  capacious and powerful battery; </li><li>  Ideal for ardent selfie fans; </li><li>  eyes do not get tired during prolonged work with the gadget (reading books). </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  it is not clear why the combined memory card and SIM card slots; </li><li>  non-separable type case; </li><li>  insufficient display brightness; </li><li>  average set of chipsets. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 16,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016) </h2><p>  The J7 series is not only phones with the best sound, but also a real paradise for selfies.  Nevertheless, the gadget also has other advantages.  First of all, this, of course, is sound - about 78 decibels at the output.  The next obvious advantage can be called an expensive appearance, which appealed to many owners of the smartphone. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the device received a good screen on a modern AMOLED matrix.  It is not clear why, but the manufacturer deprived the gadget of an ambient light sensor with all of the above heaps of advantages.  This is done, apparently, in order to emphasize the belonging of the device to the budget segment, therefore, the user will have to manually adjust the brightness of the backlight. </p><h2>  Features of the device </h2><p>  It is also worth noting that the brand's engineers have excelled in terms of energy efficiency of the gadget.  Even if you take into account the not-so-gluttonous platform, coupled with an average screen resolution, the battery life of the device on a 3300 mAh battery is very impressive. </p><p>  Pluses of model: </p><ul><li>  a very good indicator of battery life for the Android device; </li><li>  high-quality and rich picture with a good margin of brightness; </li><li>  support for absolutely all frequencies relevant for Russia in 4G networks; </li><li>  the presence of an NFC interface; </li><li>  separate slot for a third-party memory card. </li></ul><p>  Minuses: </p><ul><li>  There is no light sensor and notifications. </li></ul><p>  Estimated cost - about 18,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia XA Ultra </h2><p>  Surely many people will answer the question about which phone has the best sound without hesitation: ‚ÄúOf course, Sony has it!‚Äù  Xperia models have always been distinguished not only by high-quality sound, but also by an enviable maximum volume.  In our case, it is about 83 decibels. </p>

    <p>  In addition, the model can be called extremely successful for selfie lovers.  In general, it would be strange to expect otherwise from the device, where the manufacturer did a great job on the front camera, giving it a lot of bells and whistles and enviable characteristics.  Optical stabilization, improved autofocus and a resolution of 16 megapixels allow you to work wonders even in the most difficult conditions. </p><p>  The only thing that this model really disappointed was the battery life.  Here, you don‚Äôt even need to be a specialist to understand that a 2700 mAh capacity is clearly not enough for a six-inch screen, and even more so with a non-removable battery. </p><h2>  Model Features </h2><p>  The next, maybe not such a critical moment, is connected with extremely thin frames.  Of course, the design in this case clearly wins, but only such a design practically guarantees constant random touch of the screen, as well as false positives of the display.  Due to these two unpleasant moments, the model was not able to get to the top of our rating, even if it is noticeably ahead of the rest of the respondents in terms of volume. </p><p>  Advantages of the gadget: </p><ul><li>  the front camera has many frills; </li><li>  a separate place for a slot for a memory card; </li><li>  good filling, as well as overall performance; </li><li>  excellent screen with a juicy, bright and contrasting picture. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  too weak battery for all of the above bells and whistles; </li><li>  no fingerprint sensor; </li><li>  non-removable battery; </li><li>  not quite a good speaker location for fans to play; </li><li>  the price is a bit overpriced. </li></ul><p>  Estimated price - about 28,000 rubles. </p>
