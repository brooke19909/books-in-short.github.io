    <p>  The combination of these characteristics of the walkie-talkie is recognized by experts as one of the most competitive relative capabilities of device analogs in the same price category.  Very few brands are ready to offer the same functionality with a comparable device cost. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><p>  In the factory box of the brand manufacturer Baofeng UV-5R - instructions, the device itself, antenna, battery, headset with PTT support, a strap and clip for easy use, a charger.  In general, this set is quite typical for devices of the category to which the radio station belongs. </p><h2>  Design, appearance </h2><p>  What can be said about the design solutions used in the studied walkie-talkie, and about its appearance?  According to many users who have left feedback, Baofeng UV-5R looks pretty ordinary.  But at the same time, there are no elements in the design of the walkie-talkie that would look useless.  The appearance of the device is quite strict, without frills, the case is rectangular.  The location of the control keys and the antenna is quite common for devices of this type.  The body is made of plastic, the features of its structure are such that the device is comfortable to hold in your hand, it does not slip out. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Opportunities </h2><p>  The device works, as we have already noted in the specifications, in two ranges at once, namely VHF and UHF.  The Baofeng UV-5R walkie-talkie can also function through two channels.  That is, for example, its owner can receive an incoming signal from one interlocutor and at the same time transfer the outgoing to another.  You can switch between channels using convenient device controls on the display.  Another noteworthy feature (reviews are useful): Baofeng UV-5R is equipped with an FM radio.  The maximum signal radius when using a radio station thanks to the 4-watt transmitter power is 10 km.  This is enough for a comfortable solution to most of the tasks that are relevant for the main groups of users of the walkie-talkie. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baofeng UV-5R instruction" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/608784.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  Using the built-in memory cells in the walkie-talkie, you can store the frequencies of the channels used.  There is support for VOX technology - voice communication without pressing the appropriate transfer button.  As many reviews indicate, Baofeng UV-5R has an effective noise reduction function.  Comfortable use of the device is possible with significant external interference. </p><p>  The radio station has convenient control tools.  In its design, elements of design personification are noticeable: for example, the user can select the screen backlight with the color he wants.  You can also set the optimal time interval for turning off the backlight.  There is <span>a key lock</span> function - it can be implemented in both automatic and manual mode.  Using the backlight makes using the walkie-talkie comfortable in any lighting conditions.  There is a LED flashlight that can always come in handy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Walkie Talkie Programming </h2><p>  Among the most remarkable features that characterize the device are Baofeng UV 5R programming.  It is carried out using a fairly simple and understandable to most users algorithm.  What are the highlights of this process?  You can program a walkie-talkie using a branded program or a product such as CHIRP.  Many owners of the device prefer to use the second option, noting its convenience and simplicity.  To program a walkie-talkie, you need to run the CHIRP program, then select the radio station of the brand we are considering in it and specify the COM port.  After we set the optimal values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the Memory Range, then we optimize the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the LPD and PMR channels.  After we load the result of work into the memory of the radio station and reboot the device. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The Baofeng UV 5R radio station is equipped, as we noted above, with a 1.8 thousand mAh battery.  Is this indicator optimal?  According to many experts in the field of the corresponding type of electronics, portable radios with such a battery capacity indicator are fairly standard solutions for the market.  Some experts consider the battery with the indicated capacity to be quite powerful, capable of providing autonomous operation of the device in terms sufficient to solve most of the urgent tasks for the main groups of users of the radio station. </p><p>  The battery with which the walkie-talkie is equipped is removable, that is, if necessary, the owner of the device can purchase one or more additional ones and carry them with him, charging and using them in turn.  Note that to save battery, the radio provides a remarkable function of putting the device into <span>sleep mode,</span> which is activated if a person does not transmit or receive voice messages for some time. </p>

    <p>  The function of regulating the signal strength of a radio station can also help save battery power.  In addition, you can control the inclusion of a sound signal that accompanies a button press.  The corresponding function also uses the battery resources a little - turning it off will slightly increase the battery life of the device. </p><p>  How effective can the device‚Äôs battery be in practice?  The average battery life that the device users and experts were able to identify in practice is about a day.  But this is with active use and without frequent use of options to save battery.  When you use the device in standby mode, the battery life will be longer.  There is, by the way, the ability to purchase and install a compatible battery of larger capacity on the device.  In particular, samples are produced with a resource of 3.8 thousand mAh. </p><h2>  Price competitiveness </h2><p>  Some experts believe that the device in question is among the most competitive, if we consider the ratio of price and functionality.  Also, according to many owners of the device, leaving reviews on thematic portals, Baofeng UV-5R is a device with excellent quality, despite the fact that it is sold in the budget segment.  How much does the appliance cost?  Now in the catalogs of Russian retailers in which there is Baofeng UV-5R, the price of the device is about 3 thousand rubles.  At the same time, the pricing policy of different dealers may differ due to exchange rate fluctuations of the ruble and the corresponding marketing priorities of sellers.  Experts recommend looking not only at the price, but also at the terms of delivery of the goods - however, this rule is true for all types of online purchases. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Firmware Baofeng UV-5R" class="if" height="425" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19663/608781.jpg" width="425"></div>

    <h2>  Typical tasks </h2><p>  What are, in fact, the very typical tasks for which the device is optimized?  They can be conditionally classified into two types.  Firstly, this is the solution of tasks related to the performance by certain groups of specialists of their professional tasks.  As we noted above, the categories of users among whom the Baofeng UV 5R radio station is popular are truckers, special services and other government departments performing their functions in mobile mode.  Builders, engineers, shift workers, employees of departments involved in forestry activities can also use the capabilities of the radio in terms of solving professional problems.  Secondly, travelers, backpackers, climbers can also use the device.  For them, portable radios are an indispensable assistant, especially in conditions where other means of maintaining communication are not available. </p><p>  To a lesser extent, the walkie-talkie is adapted for solving military tasks - the army requires a completely different level of device.  At the same time, if we are talking about, say, training procedures for fighters within the framework of the theory, training cadets or instructing in civil defense school lessons, the Baofeng UV-5R radio station may well come in handy.  Radios of this type are also actively used by hunters, fishermen, researchers of natural landscapes, and cycling enthusiasts. </p><h2>  Voice transmission </h2><p>  What are the features of the main function of Baofeng UV-5R radio - voice transmission?  The device, as we have already noted, can function in two basic modes: voice transmission with a keystroke, as well as through VOX technology.  The quality of communication is rated by users and specialists as excellent.  The interlocutor's voice is clear, the main speaker of the walkie-talkie transmits it at a sufficient volume level.  If necessary, you can connect a headset, which also supports the function of voice transmission with the click of a button. </p><h2>  Practice use </h2><p>  Note that the instruction supplied with Baofeng UV-5R adequately describes in detail the nuances of using the device.  However, it will be useful to study some basic features of the operation of the device.  For example, if we are faced with the task of switching from one communication channel to another, you can do this by simply pressing the A / B key.  A quick transition, for example, from the VHF band to the UHF, is carried out using the BAND button.  There is a convenient function that Baofeng UV-5R firmware provides - receiving a signal at once at two frequencies simultaneously.  In turn, the VFO / MR key allows you to switch between different modes of using the radio - frequency and channel. </p>

    <p>  On the Baofeng UV-5R walkie-talkie, the frequencies can be adjusted in a wide range - from 2.5 to 50 kHz.  In addition, there is an interesting function that allows you to change the frequencies during the operation of the walkie-talkie with repeaters.  There is also an option to prohibit voice transmission at an already used frequency.  There is a function designed to monitor the subtones.  The noise reduction option can be flexibly adjusted - you can set values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 0 to 9 on the established technological scale. </p><h2>  Menu navigation </h2><p>  The instructions that come with the walkie-talkie generally contain everything you need to help resolve the issue of how to set up Baofeng UV 5R.  However, it will be useful to consider the basic nuances of using the radio station in terms of navigation in the program menu of the device.  Knowing the features of its structure will help to quickly learn the setup procedures, to choose their optimal combination. </p><p>  On the right side of the display is an indicator that reflects the frequency value.  For example, 188. Nearby, as a rule, a substep is displayed - for example, 75/25.  If the letters CT are displayed, this means that the device is operating in CTCSS mode.  If, in turn, the letters DCS are visible, this means that another mode is active - DCS.  If the radio operates through a repeater, then the signs ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù indicate the presence of the corresponding indicator for the shift.  If the letter S is displayed on the screen, this means that the device is working by scanning two different channels. </p><p>  The abbreviation VOX on the display means that the corresponding type of voice control is functioning.  The letter R on the screen indicates the active reverse option, N - that the device is operating at a wide modulation frequency, L - in the low power mode. </p><h2>  Radius of action </h2><p>  What are the practical results achieved by specialists and owners of the radio in terms of identifying the real range of the device?  Adjusted for the fact that the use of the radio station takes place in very individual conditions, the following guidelines can be designated based on user and expert feedback.  In the city, surrounded by dense residential buildings, the owner of the radio station has the right to expect reliable signal reception within a radius of about 2 km.  If you go up, for example, to the 5th floor, you can actually increase the corresponding figure to 3 km. </p><p>  When using a walkie-talkie in nature, it all depends on the specific conditions of the landscape environment.  If the speakers are in the forest, then the likely radius of reliable reception will be about 2 km.  If the connection is organized in the steppe, field, on a wide river or, for example, in the open sea, the corresponding figure can reach 10 km. </p><h2>  Features of working with the antenna </h2><p>  Some experts, as well as users, believe that in order to fully utilize the capabilities of the walkie-talkie it is advisable to purchase an additional antenna.  This will allow to achieve the highest efficiency of the device at large distances between speakers. </p>

    <p>  Recommended by many users, the optimal external antenna for Baofeng UV-5R is the Nagoya NA-771 brand. </p><h2>  User reviews </h2><p>  What do the owners of the Baofeng UV-5R radio station say?  The prevailing degree of sentiment users' radios is positive.  People speak of her as a convenient, practical, functional device.  Many praise the device also for a reasonable price.  There is no problem with that, users note, in order to master the Baofeng UV 5R functions - the device setup is very simple, the instruction in the attached manual is understandable and logical. </p><p>  Some note an interesting trend - despite the fact that the device belongs to the budget category, there are factories that fake it and sell it even cheaper.  The functionality of such copies, as well as the quality of their work, can be much inferior to the original.  Users recommend that those who are going to purchase a device, carefully read the product description in the electronic catalog or on the window.  The brand may sound very similar to the original, but at the same time not match it.  It is recommended, in order not to be mistaken, to look under the walkie-talkie battery - there should be a factory print of Baofeng company there. </p><p>  Many owners of the device praise him for the quality of the FM-receiver, as well as the convenience of using this option.  Radio channels, users note, are caught quickly, stable communication is maintained with them. </p><p>  Among the shortcomings of the walkie-talkie, users note some problems with the compatibility of the device with products from some other brands.  In particular, when using a channel with a specific number.  If you activate it on a radio station issued by another brand, the Baofeng UV-5R walkie-talkie may not recognize the corresponding signal correctly.  At the same time, many users did not observe such problems at all with similar schemes for connecting devices of other brands to the walkie-talkie. </p>
