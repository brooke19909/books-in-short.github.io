    <p>  To reach the NPF, you can dial the number 8-800-200-44-04.  Many people notice that the <span>Non-State Pension Fund for</span> Electricity is 100% not fraudulent.  Indeed, on the organization‚Äôs official website you can see the location and contacts of all the fund‚Äôs branches in a particular city.

They play an important role in shaping the overall impression of an organization.  For example, many potential customers are interested in what rating NPF has in the electric power industry. </p><p>  This company is among the top 10 Russian Pension Funds.

But in any case, customers very often turn to this company and leave positive feedback about it. </p><p>  This means that there is every reason for trust.  Typically, the top 10 NPFs in a country are places that actually help maintain retirement savings and ensure a good life in old age.  Every citizen should know about this. </p>

    <p>  Despite some ambiguity in the data, NPFs in the electric power industry have a very high rating.  And it pleases.  It‚Äôs enough to remember that this is one of the top 10 organizations in Russia that offer pension insurance services. </p><h2>  The trust </h2><p>  An important point is the so-called level of trust.  He indicates how much potential and real customers trust a particular organization, being a kind of indicator of the company's reliability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The non-state pension fund of the electric power industry has a high level of trust.  If you believe the statistics, then the trust is held at A ++.  Or, as is sometimes indicated, on AAA.  This is the highest level of trust. </p><p>  It follows that the organization is sustainable.  You can easily entrust her with retirement insurance.  This is the opinion held by many potential and real customers.  In any case, if we take into account everything that has been said before, we can conclude that the NPF of the electric power industry is a stable, reliable and safe corporation.  It will not close, the license will not be taken from her.  And this is enough for many to start cooperation. </p>

    <h2>  Profitability </h2><p>  But there is one more important point.  The fact is that the plus of non-state pension funds is the so-called profitability.  Non-state pension funds offer to slightly increase the available pension savings.  And this indicator is extremely important for many customers.  Especially if the main task is to increase the accumulations rather than preserve them. </p><p>  The profitability of NPFs in the electric power industry, as customers say, is not too high.  But at the same time higher than many competitors offer.  The reviews do not provide any significant picture that would allow us to evaluate the real return on deposits.  Why? </p><p>  Many show dissatisfaction with cooperation precisely because of profitability.  Initially, customers are offered a high level of return - about 12-15% per annum.  But in practice, JSC NPF Electricity provides only about 5-7% of the return.  This difference does not suit many.  Therefore, some directly say that they feel cheated. </p><p>  In fact, this phenomenon is easily explained by inflation.  It is also worth paying attention to the fact that all non-state pension funds have similar discrepancies between real and promised returns.  This is not necessary to be surprised.  No one will deceive future retirees.  The actions of the Electric Power Fund are absolutely legal and honest. </p>

    <h2>  Service </h2><p>  What do they say about service?  It is also difficult to find a common opinion here.  The quality of customer service is different.  Much depends on the city in which cooperation takes place.  Everywhere their employees, everyone behaves differently. </p><p>  The good news is that you can not only personally contact the Non-State Pension Fund of the Electric Power Industry.  "My Account" is an opportunity that attracts many.  This is a way to work with the Pension Fund online. </p><p>  This function works, as many have noticed, with some failures.  But not too critical.  If you wish, you can easily ask a consultant a question directly via the Internet.  Also, "My Account" allows you to easily manage your account and order extracts from it. </p><p>  On a personal visit to offices, visitors, as a rule, also try to pay due attention.  And it pleases.  Nevertheless, the Non-State Pension Fund of the Electric Power Industry earns mixed reviews for customer service. </p><p>  On the one hand, attention is paid to everyone.  And they answer the questions that visitors ask.  On the other hand, the speed of service is poor.  Sometimes consultants do not answer questions, but only confuse clients.  Fortunately, there are not many such complaints.  There are no significant complaints about service, but NPFs have drawbacks in this area. </p><h2>  Conclusion of an agreement </h2><p>  Special attention is paid to such a factor as the conclusion of the contract.  Despite the fact that the Electric Power Fund is one of the ten leaders of pension insurance organizations, some negative aspects of cooperation are still emphasized by the population.  More precisely, we are talking about small flaws.  They pop up mainly at the conclusion of contracts. </p>

    <p>  The fact is that some indicate the impossibility of cooperation with the company if a person is already 43 years old.  It is this age that is emphasized.  Visitors assure that after the specified restriction in the conclusion of the contract refuse. </p><p>  The agreement is made in duplicate, which pleases.  Basically, all the conditions are clear, but some points may raise questions.  They will be answered quickly by employees. </p><p>  There are no further significant complaints.  If necessary, you can terminate the contract with the NPF at any time.  And the money should be transferred to another organization.  Cash is not issued here until retirement.  And this condition is spelled out in the contract.  It is worth paying attention to.  Some customers notice that it is imperative to look at the losses incurred in terminating the contract before the end of a year.  Otherwise, you might think that the <span>Non-State Pension Fund of the</span> Electric Power Industry is operating in bad faith and appropriates the money of depositors. </p><h2>  Payouts </h2><p>  The last nuance that we recommend paying attention to is the payment of pension savings.  This question raises a double opinion about the company.  Why? </p><p>  The non-state pension fund of the electric power industry (Moscow, 11 Frunze St., building 13 - the address of the head office of the corporation) makes payments, but with some delays.  That is why you can see mixed reviews about the company.  Some say that pensions are not paid.  At the same time, some customers claim the opposite.  So who to believe? </p><p>  To everyone.  As already mentioned, payments are made, but quite often there are a variety of delays.  And you just need to be prepared for this.  Pensioners still get what they are supposed to.  Even if not on time.  NPF is trying to establish work in this area.  But he does not intend to deceive his customers. </p>

    <h2>  Summary </h2><p>  What conclusions can be drawn?  It is clear what constitutes the Pension Fund of the Electric Power Industry.  This is a company that is large and widespread in Russia.  She has been fulfilling her functions for a long time.  It offers good returns.  But, most importantly, stability and reliability. </p><p>  Many point out that if you want to get a high return on deposits, you should not pay attention to a non-state type fund.  But when stability and retirement are the priority, then the organization should be considered as a possible place for concluding a pension insurance contract. </p>
