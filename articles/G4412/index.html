  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The education system in Russia</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The education system in Russia is federal, centralized.  Today, the Russian education system is quite similar to the German one, but nevertheless it is a more simplified version of it.  It consists of the following structural elements: </p><p>  1. <span>Preschool education.</span>  It allows children to gain basic knowledge, but it does not amount to schooling.  Children begin to attend kindergartens mainly from one and a half years and are there until six years. </p><p>  2. Elementary school.  Responsible for educating children from six to ten.  The difference from the German counterpart is the ability to receive <span>primary education</span> also in high schools. </p><p>  3. Incomplete secondary education in secondary schools, lyceums and gymnasiums has been received for five years.  At the end of nine classes in these educational institutions, young people have the right to receive a document on general secondary education. </p><p>  4. Full secondary or <span>industrial and technical education</span> entitles you to college, technical school and other vocational training institutions.  After completion of education, graduates of grades 10 and 11 of a gymnasium, school or lyceum have the right to receive a document confirming full secondary education, followed by its submission upon admission to the university.  <span>The</span> education <span>system</span> in Russia gives such a <span>right</span> to any person who has graduated from a professional educational institution (this is not allowed in Germany). </p><p>  5. Higher education is associated with obtaining a <span>bachelor's degree,</span> specialist <span>diploma</span> or master's degree. </p><p>  In 1992, after the adoption of the relevant Law of the Russian Federation, the reform of domestic higher education began.  With the help of this legislative document, a modern education system in Russia has been formed. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Another Law of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for obtaining higher education, since 1996 defines three stages of obtaining it: </p><p>  - <span>incomplete higher education,</span> for which you need to study for two years; </p><p>  - basic higher education (bachelor's degree) with a term of study of four years; </p><p>  - Specialist (term of study is five years) and Master (term of study is six years). </p><p>  So, let us dwell in more detail at each level of higher education.  The bachelor is a graduate of a university that has been trained for four years and received fundamental training in general specialization.  Moreover, he has the right to already hold positions, the requirement for which is the availability of higher education. </p><p>  The education system in Russia provides for an increase in the level of the bachelor with the help of additional training (one more year) and the qualification of ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù.  However, the best option for a bachelor is to obtain a master‚Äôs qualification (two-year training with a master's thesis). </p><p>  Particular attention is deserved today by the system of continuing education in Russia.  On the one hand, this system reflects the objective needs of society.  On the other hand, with the help of such a training system, the knowledge of a basic level is constantly updated and special skills are acquired that are so necessary in the conditions of a modern economy.  It can also be said that <span>lifelong education</span> is a kind of teaching on the continuous improvement of a person and the lifelong development of his abilities. </p><p>  From the standpoint of the concept of continuity, the education system in Russia should be ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù with new steps that would be designed for all periods of human life.  As the main goal of management in this training system, the constant development of creative thinking and human potential should be considered.  And at the center of this system should be the man himself, his desires and, of course, the development of his abilities. </p>
