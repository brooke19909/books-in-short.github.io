One of the most popular resort cities in our country is Adler.  Every year, hundreds of trains bring vacationers here from all over the country.  Recently, many trains have been converted to branded ones, and traveling in them has become somewhat more convenient. </p><h2>  We buy tickets </h2><p>  Traveling to the sea is always a pleasure.  In order for a good holiday mood not to be spoiled, you should take care of purchasing tickets in advance.  There are more than enough people who want to get to Adler by train during the holiday season, and there may simply not be any travel documents for the scheduled day at the box office.  Book tickets better at least a month before the trip.

    <p>  At the time indicated in the travel document, you should arrive at the station, not forgetting to bring your passport with you.  He will need to be shown to the conductor along with the ticket.  Passengers without a passport are not allowed into the car. </p><p>  If we talk about the level of comfort, it can be different in different trains.  Recently, Russian Railways has purchased many new cars.  But there are plenty of old ones - half-rotten.  If you want to get to Adler by train in comfort, get a ticket for the company staff.  There are no special guarantees that you will reach your destination without hassle in this case, however, there are still much more chances. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Train 102 Moscow - Adler </h2><p>  Passengers have very good opinions about this comfortable train.  The guides in it are polite, and the conditions are pretty good.  The shelves in the cars are soft and upholstered not with dermatine, but with fabric.  Each compartment has a TV and private radio.  Headphones to listen to the latter gives the conductor.  There are connection points on both the upper and lower shelves. </p>

    <p>  It can also be considered very convenient that the cars are equipped not with simple toilets, but with bio.  This means that they do not close at stops.  In addition, such latrines are usually clean.  In the hallways to everything else there are signs that indicate whether the toilet is empty or not.  So passengers who decide to get to Adler by train 102 will be completely spared the need to stand in line. </p><h2>  Train 104 Moscow - Adler </h2><p>  Under this number goes the composition, not so long ago aroused the interest of the whole country.  The fact is that this train is not ordinary, but a double-decker.  Of the positive aspects, passengers of this train note primarily the presence of free Wi-Fi (which even sometimes works), outlets in the compartment and clean dry closets.  The disadvantages of the train include crowding in the compartment, walkways and stairs.  The upper shelves are cheaper, but they do not differ in special comfort.  For example, sitting on them will fail.  The fact is that there are no third luggage shelves in this compartment.  The distance from the surface of the second to the ceiling is rather small.  Especially on the second floor.  Here, the ceiling is also slightly slanted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  This train Moscow - Adler, reviews of which are more or less positive and negative on the Web, apparently, are not very convenient, but you can travel in it without any problems and difficulties. </p><h2>  Train 014 Saratov - Adler </h2><p>  Passengers' reviews about this composition are rather contradictory.  The level of ride comfort in it depends on the wagon and the competence of the conductor.  Some note that the service on this train is very good, the conductor always meets the wishes of the passengers.  Others consider the 014C staff to be rude and lazy. </p>

    <p>  Apparently, Saratov - Adler - the train is not particularly comfortable in terms of equipment.  For example, people who can‚Äôt tolerate the heat will feel themselves not too pleasant in it.  Conductors in wagons, according to some Internet users, are forced to close windows because the air conditioner is working.  However, since the speed of the train is not too high, it is of little use.  Depending on the carriage and composition, the train can have either dry closets or regular toilets. </p><p>  Of the positive aspects, passengers note very comfortable mattresses and pillows.  Also, many people like the fact that a duvet cover is included in the set of linen. </p><h2>  Train 38 Minsk - Adler </h2><p>  Despite the fact that this structure is declared as branded, it is unlikely to be able to ride in it with special comfort.  Toilets in wagons are ordinary, and the guides do not even close them in the <span>sanitary zone.</span>  In general, in this regard, the Minsk - Adler train is similar to all old domestic trains with a traditional lack of service.  Some passengers are also very unhappy with the linen provided in the wagons.  The fact is that it is covered with some kind of white powder remaining on the clothes and in the hair.  Everything else, this fast train is often late. </p>

    <h2>  Train 035 Saint Petersburg - Adler "Northern Palmyra" </h2><p>  ‚ÄúNorthern Palmyra‚Äù received very good reviews from passengers.

Despite the fact that the train is branded, it also has <span>reserved seats.</span> </p>

    <p>  The only thing that can cause some complaints is that it is very difficult to buy tickets for the Petersburg - Adler Severnaya Palmira train.  But in this case, everything is explained precisely by the popularity of the composition.  Selling travel documents to him just instantly.  Therefore, those who want to get to the sea with comfort about tickets should take care in advance (45 days before departure). </p><h2>  Train 087 Adler - Nizhny Novgorod </h2><p>  This composition is pretty comfortable.  The ticket price includes bed linen, viewing licensed video programs, magazines, a brush for linen, board games, a hygiene kit, food.  The cars are equipped with 220 V sockets and dry closets. </p><p>  The Adler - Nizhny Novgorod train is new (it was launched for the first time in October 2014), and therefore it is still impossible to find information on the level of service in it.  Maybe this summer someone will write about their impressions of the trip.  But in any case, everything in it should be new and modern. </p><h2>  Prices </h2><p>  Next, let's figure out how much it will cost to get to Adler by train.  The fare for different trains may vary.  The table shows the approximate cost per shelf in different trains (in rubles for the spring of 2015).  You can find out exactly how much a trip to Adler from a city will cost by calling the Russian Railways ticket office or on the company's website. </p><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><caption>  Train tickets to Adler </caption><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="164"><p>  A train </p></td><td valign="top" width="157"><p>  Coupe </p></td><td valign="top" width="148"><p>  NE </p></td><td valign="top" width="169"><p>  Reserved seat </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="164"><p>  102 Moscow - Adler </p></td><td valign="top" width="157"><p>  4685 </p></td><td valign="top" width="148"><p>  27380 </p></td><td valign="top" width="169"><p>  4014 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="164"><p>  104V Moscow - Adler </p></td><td valign="top" width="157"><p>  3500 </p></td><td valign="top" width="148"><p>  9500 </p></td><td valign="top" width="169"><p>  - </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="164"><p>  014 Saratov - Adler </p></td><td valign="top" width="157"><p>  2900 </p></td><td valign="top" width="148"><p>  - </p></td><td valign="top" width="169"><p>  2200 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="164"><p>  035A Saint - Petersburg-Adler </p></td><td valign="top" width="157"><p>  7300 </p></td><td valign="top" width="148"><p>  - </p></td><td valign="top" width="169"><p>  4500 </p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" width="164"><p>  087G Nizhny Novgorod - Adler </p></td><td valign="top" width="157"><p>  4800 </p></td><td valign="top" width="148"><p>  - </p></td><td valign="top" width="169"><p>  4500 </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  What is worth knowing? </h2><p>  There are some traveler rules that are worth observing: </p><ul><li>  You should not take perishable products with you on the road. </li><li>  It is customary for pregnant women, passengers with small children and elderly people in domestic trains to give way to a lower shelf. </li><li>  It‚Äôs not too decent to change clothes in a compartment with other passengers, even if they are of the same sex as you.  Ask the neighbors to go out into the corridor for a couple of minutes. </li><li>  Men usually help women pick up their luggage on the third shelf or remove it from there.  It is also customary to bring luggage to single ladies before leaving the car. </li></ul><p>  Well, hopefully, our article will be useful for those who gathered in the summer to the sea.  Most importantly, buy tickets on time.  Temporary difficulties on the road - even if they are - are nothing in comparison with a pleasant rest under the gentle southern sun.  Have a nice trip! </p>
