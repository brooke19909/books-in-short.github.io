    <h2>  Peasant Reform </h2><p>  Its implementation required an urgent restructuring of the local government structure.  In the process of reform, the government intended to create conditions that would ensure the preservation of power among the noble landlords.  The conservative part of the class insisted on creating significant and open privileges.  Liberal-minded groups oriented toward the capitalist path proposed the formation of omnipresent organizations.  The final draft of the Regulation on the <span>Zemsky authorities</span> and provisional rules for their work were prepared only by the end of 1863. </p><h2>  Formation of new institutions </h2><p>  In 1864, on January 1, the Regulation was signed, introducing county and district authorities.  It was supposed to extend the document to 33 districts.  Subsequently, the government planned to put the Regulation into effect on the territory of the Astrakhan, Arkhangelsk and 9 western provinces, Bessarabian, Baltic regions, and the Kingdom of Poland.  All institutions that until 1864 managed cases of public contempt, zemstvo duties, and national food were abolished. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Zemstvo meetings and councils" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1273496.jpg" width="396"></div>

The elections were held at 3 congresses - from three curiae: </p><ol><li>  County landowners.  It consisted mainly of noble landowners.  The owners of the qualification of real estate or land or a certain turnover of capital per year could vote at the congress.  The latter was established in the amount of 6 thousand. The land qualification was determined for each province individually, based on the state of landowner ownership.  So, in Vladimir it was 250 acres, in Moscow - 200, in Vologda - 250-800.  The price of real estate was set at 15 thousand. Those landowners who did not have sufficient funds participated in the vote through representatives. </li><li>  City Curia.  It consisted of persons possessing merchant certificates, owners of commercial and industrial institutions, whose turnover was not less than 6 thousand rubles.  / year., and having a certain amount of real estate. </li><li>  Rural Curia.  She also suggested property qualifications.  However, a three-stage election was introduced in this curia.  The peasants who were gathering for the volost gathering elected their representatives and sent them to the meeting.  It was already selected voters from the area. </li></ol><p>  It should be said here what the members of zemstvo assemblies were called.  They were called vowels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="provincial and district zemstvo meetings" class="if" height="373" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1273497.jpg" width="600"></div>

This excluded the participation of persons who were not members of rural society.  First of all, representatives of the intelligentsia were not allowed.  At landowning and city congresses, participants could only select vowels from their curia.  At the same time, rural communities were allowed to vote for landowners who are not members of the curia, as well as local clergy.  Those who have not reached the age of 25, who are under trial or criminal investigation, defamed by a public sentence or a court decision, were deprived of suffrage.  Foreigners who did not swear allegiance to the tsar also did not participate in the elections. </p><h2>  Creation of provincial and district zemstvo assemblies </h2><p>  The second component of the system was formed at election congresses.  Elections were held every three years.  Zemsky meetings were held once a year.  In extreme circumstances, they convened more often.  The chairman, as a rule, was the <span>leader of the nobility.</span>  Provincial and district zemstvo assemblies formed a certain hierarchical structure. </p><h2>  Functions </h2><p>  County and provincial Zemstvo meetings consisted of representatives selected from three curiae at congresses.  The former were subordinate to the latter, but they could independently solve a number of issues.  In particular, Zemstvo meetings: </p><ol><li>  They gave permission to open bazaars and tenders. </li><li>  Provincial and state fees were distributed within the county.  This function was assigned to institutions by regulation or law. </li><li>  Provided provincial organizations information and conclusions on household items. </li><li>  They decided on the maintenance of shorelines. </li><li>  We transferred country and field roads to the category of county roads and vice versa, changed their directions. </li><li>  They issued orders and supervised on the instructions of the council on the arrangement of communication lines, <span>mutual insurance, and</span> provided a report on the work done. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="creation of provincial and district zemstvo assemblies" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/1273498.jpg" width="265"></div></li></ol><p>  Higher zemstvo meetings carried out: </p><ol><li>  The division of buildings, communications, structures, duties, institutions of charity into categories.  The classification involved 2 groups: one related to the county, the other to the province. </li><li>  Case management on the organization of new fairs, change / rescheduling. </li><li>  Sending through the chief of applications for transfer of road constructions to the category of state for good reasons. </li><li>  Conducting business on the organization of new marinas on the rivers and the transfer of existing ports. </li><li>  The layout between the counties of state fees. </li><li>  Mutual insurance of property against fire. </li><li>  Consideration and resolution of issues and difficulties that could arise when approving layouts and estimates for fees. </li><li>  Analysis of complaints about the actions of the authorities. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="county and provincial zemstvo meetings consisted of" class="if" height="329" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1274880.jpg" width="440"></div></li></ol><h2>  List of occupations </h2><p>  It should be noted that in the Regulation of 1864 in Art.  2, a list of cases that the Zemstvo meetings could carry out was given, but they were not binding on them.  These included, in particular: </p><ol><li>  Managing property, cash collection and capital, managing charitable institutions. </li><li>  Care for the development of the system of national food, industry and trade. </li><li>  Mutual property insurance management. </li><li>  The layout of government fees. </li><li>  Participation in the development of economic support for public health and education. </li><li>  Charging and spending fees. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what were the members of zemstvo assemblies called" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13198/1274878.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ol><h2>  Zemsky councils </h2><p>  They acted as executive bodies.  Their composition was formed by Zemstvo meetings at the first meeting of the new convocation.  Officials from the treasuries, state chambers, and clergymen were not part of the executive institutions.  The provincial administration had 6 members and a chairman.  The body was elected for 3 years.  The county government was attended by 2 members and a chairman, whose candidacy was approved by the highest local official. </p>
