But still, she is known more as a resort town on the shores of the gentle warm Mediterranean Sea in the summer season.  The population at this time, according to statistics, increases by more than three times.  But there is enough space for everyone, and the hospitable city is glad for everyone.  And tourists not only rush to the beach, but also explore Javea, it is so interesting for its cultural traditions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.happyholidayhomes.net" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.happyholidayhomes.net/blog/28-destination-in-focus:-javea-(costa-blanca),-spain"><img itemprop="image" alt="Javea, Spain, attractions" class="if uuid-2553725" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2553725.jpg"></div><h2>  Unforgettable walks </h2><p>  The city is divided into three zones.  It: </p><ol><li>  The part where many historical monuments have been preserved is called the Old Town, and if we turn to historical documents, little has changed here in recent centuries.  All the same winding streets with neat houses, because the property of Javea (Spain) is decorated with carved handles and locks, with wrought-iron balconies, which are decorated with flowers in pots, and always shows off the weather vane at the top. </li><li>  Port.  Although there are plenty of shops and entertainment venues in this part of Javea in Spain, it is mostly intended for fishermen.  From here, every morning they go fishing, and thanks to their work, you can taste unique fish dishes in the city in elite restaurants and small cafes.  There are magnificent yachts here, and if you agree with the owner, you can make an unforgettable trip on one of them.  By the way, there are many catering establishments near the port, from solid restaurants to small bars. </li><li>  Beaches.  Perhaps this is the main attraction, since the numerous coastal areas in the summer are full of crowds of holiday fans who come here. </li></ol><h2>  sights </h2><p>  The most famous sights in Spain (Javea) are, first of all, the ancient monastery of Nuestra Secora de los Angeles, the church of San Bartolomu, which was destroyed during the civil clashes, but is still a special holy place for residents, and Santa Maria de Loreto with unusual architecture.  In honor of the Mother of God, the sailors built a church so that everyone would return home after going to sea alive and with a catch.  It can be seen near the port.  The building itself resembles a ship captured by an octopus. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Ancient lighthouses, windmills and watch towers are also the pride of the city.  The connoisseurs of fine jewelry are invited to their jewelry museum, and those who want to relax on vacation must visit wine shops to enjoy the amazing taste of real wine, the components of which are local grape varieties grown in the country.  It is produced mainly using the prestigious Tempranillo variety.  They know how to cook wine here, since it has been producing for more than three thousand years, passing on the secrets of production to children.  Wines aged in oak barrels are most valued, but they are more expensive than young.  You can get to Javea by flying to Alicante or Valencia, and local transport will bring tourists to the city in an hour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marlinmag.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Javea, Spain" class="if uuid-2553741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2553741.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach season </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of Javea (Spain), the town is not as impressive in size as its neighbors, but its good location has earned the sympathy of many vacationers.  You can find it on the shore of the bay, which is protected by rocky capes.  This is Cabo de la Nao, by the way, the easternmost point in the country, because dawn comes to the inhabitants of the city first of all, and San Antonio. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Due to its location, nature has created a special microclimate, and even in winter the icy winds do not penetrate the city, and the average temperature in the summer, when the country is exhausted from the heat, does not rise on average above 30 degrees. </p><p>  The coastal zone of the city is more than 25 kilometers.  Numerous beaches are equipped with sun loungers and umbrellas, while on more solid beaches, mainly within the city, you can enjoy sports such as windsurfing and water skiing.  In small bays - the best conditions for exploring the underwater world. </p><h2>  When the beach season is in full swing </h2><p>  The only beach on which is not pebbles, but soft and white sand is Playa de Arenal.  The swimming season is very lively here.  But since its length is more than 550 m and its width is 80 meters, there is enough space for everyone.  The beach is very well equipped, there are umbrellas and sun loungers, there are showers and cabins to change clothes.  There are playgrounds for ball games. </p><p>  But you can not only swim on the beach, but also rent various equipment for a fun pastime.  For example, a catamaran.  It is possible to ride a jet ski or boat, do parasailing or diving. </p><p>  They come here mainly with children because of the always clean beaches and water.  The descent to the water is gentle, and even a considerable distance from the coast is shallow.  On the shore there are special playgrounds for children for games.  Along the promenade are numerous eateries, <span>restaurants, bars, and</span> pastry shops.  Especially they are filled in the evening, because it is better to book a table in advance.  In two adjacent bays is Cala Blanca.  This beach with a total length of 300 m draws to itself thanks to the calm sea and a gentle slope into the water.  But nature itself worked hard, creating numerous caves, grottoes and bays with very unusual shapes in this place. </p><p>  Some of the disadvantages of the place are the small parking and the lack of a cafe.  Playa la Granadella, according to vacationers, the beach is very beautiful and picturesque, although it occupies a small area surrounded by cliffs.  There are many people here, despite the fact that the coast is rocky, and after a few meters it is very deep in the water, as well as for parking there is not enough space, sunbeds, umbrellas and a toilet are paid. </p><p>  But for divers there is full scope, fishing is excellent, and restaurants delight with gourmet food, especially fish.  Not far from the shore there is a pontoon, from which many people dive into the water with pleasure.  You can rent a kayak, go to explore the caves.  A rescue team works on the beach. </p><div class="photo" data-original="hiveminer.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Javea, Spain, reviews" class="if uuid-2553729" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2553729.jpg"></div><h2>  Cala cap negre </h2><p>  Cala Cap Negre also always has clear and transparent water, and, as tourists note, with emerald-turquoise hues, because many, before plunging, long admire the sea surface.  The only drawback is the rocky bottom, but bathing slippers come to the rescue.  After water procedures, you can continue your vacation in a restaurant located above, not far from the lighthouse. </p><div class="photo" data-original="tripkay.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Javea, Spain, real estate" class="if uuid-2553732" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2553732.jpg"></div><h2>  Cala de portixol </h2><p>  The beach is located in a bay surrounded by hills.  There are not many people here, the bottom is rather rocky, but the water is always very clean and clear.  Nearby is a row of fishing huts in white and blue, which makes this place more poetic. </p><div class="photo" data-original="javeapuebloblanco.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Javea, Spain, shops" class="if uuid-2553746" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/87864/2553746.jpg"></div><h2>  Ambolo </h2><p>  Ambolo Beach is considered a nature reserve beach.  He was lost among the rocks, and it is believed that nudists rest here, although vacationers come here to stay in silence and enjoy the pine trees, the wild beauty of nature.  To get to the beach, you have to work hard, going down the steep stairs.  But the pleasure of staying here can be just huge. </p>
