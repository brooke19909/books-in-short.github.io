  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the best washing machine?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, thanks to a wide range of household appliances, various washing machines are on the market.  What is the <span>best washing machine?</span>  It is rather difficult to answer this question without a preliminary analysis of operational properties. </p><p>  The choice is varied - if you want, buy a unit with the option of front loading, and if you want - with a vertical one.  The market also offers products of the choice of the buyer with manual or automatic control.  And these are just a few of the distinguishing characteristics, there are actually quite a lot of them. </p><p>  Which washing machine is best?  It is necessary to pay attention to the dimensions of the acquired assistant.  <span>The size of the washing machine is</span> preferably selected based on the availability of free space at the installation site, as well as the number of people whom the equipment will ‚Äúwash‚Äù. </p><p>  The loading volume on each washing machine is indicated based on the weight of the clothes that fit in the drum without tamping.  Today, units with a loading weight of 4 to 7 kg are on the market.  Accordingly, the more you can load the laundry into the machine, the less often the need for washing will arise and, accordingly, the laundry will cost less.  Remember that when washing ordinary fabrics, the drum can be completely filled, while washing synthetic ones - only half, but wool - one third.  In principle, for a family of 4 people, a machine with a maximum load of 5 kg is enough.  Also, from personal experience I want to say that it is necessary to buy a <span>washing machine with dryer.</span> </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What is the best washing machine?  If we talk about the type of loading laundry in your future assistant, then we have gained distribution as units with the possibility of front loading, and with vertical loading of linen.  It all depends on your preferences and features of the location for washing.  For example, frontal washing machines have an attractive appearance, they are easier to integrate into the necessary furniture.  Devices in which laundry is loaded from above in size are more compact, although now there are models with front loading that have caught up with vertical machines by this parameter.  The advantage of frontal washing machines is that you can add laundry without stopping the washing process.  <span>Which washing machine to choose</span> based on size and load volume is up to you. </p><p>  What is the best washing machine?  As for the functions, when acquiring such an assistant in one price segment, there is not much difference between washing programs, since this is far from an innovation, but a routine of modern life.  In this connection, it makes sense only to pay attention to the spin speed after washing.  In the arsenal of the purchased unit there should be a spin with a drum rotation speed of 800-1000 rpm.  Otherwise, the laundry will remain quite wet and will have to be thoroughly dried. </p><p>  What is the best washing machine?  When buying, pay special attention to the class of energy and water consumption.  By purchasing a class A or B car, you will be able to save money on electricity and water.  Other classes indicate a large cost of electricity and water when washing. </p><p>  What brands of washing machines are better?  This is a very delicate question.  Now all the companies that produce household appliances, including Indesit, Ariston, Zanussi, LG, Sumsung, Bosch, produce high-quality and reliable appliances.  The question may concern only a specific model, but in general, a washing machine is a quality product.  Also, do not forget that all ‚Äútouch panels‚Äù, ‚Äúdelicate modes‚Äù and the like, by and large, are just dust in the eyes.  Do not forget that nothing has changed in the design of washing machines over the past twenty years.  Maybe they have become more beautiful, but after all, such an aggregate is needed only in order to wash your things. </p>
