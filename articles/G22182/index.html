    <h2>  Type of rest </h2><p>  One of the most expensive cities in Crimea for recreation (which is why wealthy and active tourists mainly rest here), but travelers with modest income can also find a profitable accommodation option, for example, Zarya - a boarding house (Yalta), located in the central part of the resort places. </p><p>  Rest here will be incendiary and interesting, it is not suitable for those who want to come and sit in their hotel.  There are a lot of ancient sights, a magnificent promenade with stunning sea views, a myriad of cafes, restaurants and expensive world-famous boutiques.  It is worth knowing that in the central part of the city there is a problem with beaches: almost throughout Yalta there is a promenade, and the shores themselves are rocky and small, so it‚Äôs better to go to neighboring villages for sunbathing and swimming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  "Dawn", boarding house (Yalta) </h2><p>  The small hotel is located in a beautiful park area, in which in the evening you can enjoy walking or just sitting on a bench while admiring the sunset.  One of the features of the boarding house is its location on the land, which used to belong to the great architect who created the Livadia Palace (the imperial summer residence) known to everyone - N. Krasnov.  It was here that Nicholas II spent his time - on the Crimean peninsula (Yalta). </p><p>  Pension Zarya is located just 500 meters from the luxurious promenade, which takes 7-10 minutes of walking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dawn boarding house Yalta" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/1179266.jpg" width="517"></div>  Thanks to the park surrounding the building, one cannot hear the noise of the big city, day or night - it creates a sense of location in a quiet and secluded place.

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The boarding house cannot boast of a large number of rooms - only 116 pieces, which are located in comfortable summer cottages or in the main building according to the block system.  The situation is rather modest. </p><ul><li>  Cottages (12-18 square meters).  A usual one-room room with two twin beds, a refrigerator, a TV and a full set of necessary utensils.  A private bathroom is also provided without fail. </li><li>  Suite (12-18 square meters).  Two-room rooms with a double bed and a sofa bed as an extra bed.  Its atmosphere does not differ from the previous version, except for the presence of two air conditioners. </li><li>  Block type cottages (12-18 square meters).  A convenient accommodation option for large families, the main difference from ordinary cottages is the presence of one shared bathroom for two rooms. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="boarding house dawn yalta reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/1179268.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  In winter and summer, guests await Yalta.  Pension "Zarya", the price of accommodation in which is from 3680 to 6600 per day, offers tourists free rental of beach equipment, water sports for an additional fee and a playground in the complex for younger guests. </p><h2>  Features </h2><p>  "Zarya" is a <span>boarding house (Yalta),</span> which has several undeniable advantages over many other economy class hotels. </p><p>  Firstly, the presence of its own pebble beach half a kilometer from the complex with awnings that protect from sunlight.  It is worth knowing that there are steps to the beach, so you need to carefully offer it to accommodate older travelers. </p><p>  Secondly, the cost of living in absolutely any category of rooms includes three meals a day: breakfast, lunch and dinner. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yalta pension dawn prices" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/25179/1179274.jpg" width="600"></div>  It will be very convenient for families with children who do not have to constantly think about the place of snacks.

    <p>  Thirdly, the Zarya boarding house (Yalta) - reviews on the official website of the complex confirm this - is literally 50 meters from the popular supermarket, so you can buy everything you need at any time, day or night. </p><p>  Fourth, the number of rooms undergoes cosmetic repairs every year, so it is always pleasant to be in the rooms. </p><p>  "Dawn" - a boarding house (Yalta), which gives a unique opportunity for inexpensive accommodation in the most popular and interesting city of the Crimean peninsula! </p>
