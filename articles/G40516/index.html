    <h2>  What is it? </h2><p>  Let's start with the fact that we will try to understand why the tariff plan is popularly called anti-crisis.  What's so big about him?  The thing is that with this <span>tariff for Megafon</span> all of Russia can be in touch with you.  And this is without extra spending.  For this reason, today's tariff plan is called "anti-kyriz". </p><p>  You can talk for free for 20 minutes a day with all Megafon subscribers in your home region.  But in Russia, calls will come out for a fee, and then a small one.  <span>There is no subscription fee</span> in this tariff.  And this means that we do not have to think hard about replenishing the account.  Let's look at "Go to 0" on the "Megaphone". </p><h2>  We call in Russia </h2><p>  Of course, we‚Äôll start with what was already discussed ‚Äî calls within Russia and within your home region.  After all, this item occupies a very important place when choosing a tariff for a cell phone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As already mentioned, when connecting to the tariff plan considered today, you can make free calls and talk with other Megafon subscribers for 20 minutes a day.  After that, you will have to pay 60 cents per minute.  Not very high price.  Especially if you have all the environment on the "Megaphone".  Calls to all other operators also cost 60 kopecks per minute.  True, this is only if you connect yourself an additional package ‚ÄúAll mobile‚Äù.  Otherwise, you will have to pay 2 times more for a conversation - 1 ruble 20 kopecks.  It is still relatively small compared to other operators that require 1.5 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone whole russia" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870939.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At "Megaphone" minutes do not extend to city numbers.  For this reason, it is important to know how much 1 minute of dialogue will cost.  This is only 1.5 rubles.  To talk on a home phone is also not so expensive.  After all, most operators charge 3 rubles each.  And just such an amount will have to be paid back if you call to other regions of Russia.  Of course, if the subscriber has Megafon.  For all other operators, as well as to city numbers, calls will cost you 12.5 rubles.  But let's find out with you other points that should be considered when choosing a tariff plan. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Messages </h2><p>  The second point, important for any modern client, is the cost of messages.  After all, it is they who come in second place in relevance and intensity of use after calls.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out what ‚ÄúGo to 0‚Äù to ‚ÄúMegaphone‚Äù can offer us here. </p><p>  If you have additional functions connected (in particular, SMS XXS), then all messages to any numbers will cost 0 rubles.  That is, they are sent for free.  But this feature applies only within the home region. </p>

    <p>  The second option is the lack of a connected option.  In this case, you will have to pay 1.6 rubles per message within the home region.  Not much, right?  But regardless of the additional connected features, you will pay 3 rubles for SMS throughout Russia, as well as 7 rubles for MMS.  Pretty good offer. </p><p>  As you can see, with the tariff plan under consideration from Megafon, all of Russia can stay in touch with you.  And all this without unnecessary expenses and overpayments.  As a rule, this is very pleasing to modern customers.  But there are a few more points that are important for the current generation.  Of course, after mentioning conversations in Russia, as well as writing messages.  What is it about?  Let's get it right. </p><h2>  For travelers </h2><p>  Further, we will talk about the fact that "Go to 0" to "Megaphone", as a rule, is great for travelers.  And modern customers are real adventurers.  Now, after all, everyone wants to travel (for example, to go on vacation) and stay connected with all this without unnecessary overpayments.  And Megaphone allows us to take this opportunity. </p><p>  You will pay 35 rubles for calls to South Ossetia, Georgia, Abkhazia, the CIS, the <span>Baltic countries</span> and Ukraine.  In fact, this is not so much as it might seem at first glance.  In Europe, a minute of conversation will cost 55 rubles, and in other countries - 75 rubles.  When compared with other mobile operators, then "Go to 0" to "Megaphone" - this is the most advantageous offer for travelers.  After all, most ask about 100 rubles per minute of conversation outside of Russia.  And this is a significant difference. </p><p>  Nevertheless, this is far from all the positive aspects that are present in the tariff.  What else is in store for us?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone tariff 0" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870941.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  the Internet </h2><p>  Megafon (tariff "0") also offers its customers an interesting profitable opportunity.  It is about providing access to the worldwide network from mobile devices.  This tariff plan differs from many others. </p><p>  The thing is that when you connect the additional function "Internet XS" you will not pay for the Internet.  It will be unlimited for you.  You will already pay the entire subscription fee (150 rubles) for this package of services.  But in the absence of thereof, you have to fork out a little.  For 1 megabyte of downloaded data, 9.9 rubles will be taken from you.  Unlike other operators, this is not such a big amount.  For example, Beeline requires about 15 rubles for 1 MB of data.  For the modern user, this is a huge amount.  Let‚Äôs now see what Megafon has collected reviews. </p><h2>  What do they say? </h2><p>  The first point that many pay attention to is, of course, calls within Russia and within the home region.  Many users note that for the most sociable person, today's tariff plan is a real treasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="megaphone minutes" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/870942.jpg"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  In addition, calls outside the country are also quite sparing.  And the call quality is excellent.  The conversation will not be interrupted in the middle, as with some other operators.  But the Internet does not please some.  In particular, those who did not connect additional functions for the tariff.  Such clients literally live on the Internet, which makes them pay a tidy sum.  However, those who have already used the "Internet XS", note that everything is in order with the Internet connection.  Now you know the reviews.  Megafon, as you can see, is trying to please its users in everything. </p>
