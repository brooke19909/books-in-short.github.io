    <p>  It is advisable to purchase a complete machine.  It provides more opportunities for creating original models, and most of the ideas can be realized only thanks to the large-sized machine.  Useful and Y-shaped slingshot.  The set can include many additions, such as clips and all kinds of decorative elements.  With the help of clips it is more convenient to connect the details of the product and count the rows. </p><p>  A hook is required for operation.  Since you need to weave a gum wallet with a little pressure, it is better to use a metal tool.  The plastic hook is not so reliable and can break. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Having decided on the color and size of the product, you can safely get to work. </p><h2>  Weave on the machine </h2><p>  How to weave a wallet on the machine?  Work begins on two rows located at the edges.  It is advisable to remove the middle so that it does not interfere. </p><p>  The row should be laid in the form of eights, which are located diagonally.  When you reach the edge, you must turn the machine over.  Another row is made in the same sequence, but unoccupied columns are used. </p>

    <p>  Now you need to make two vertical rows, they are closed at the extreme columns of the machine.  Then the bottom layer of elastic gently rises up, and two more parallel rows are performed.  The bottom layer rises again.  Gradually adding new elastic bands, you weave the product walls. </p><h2>  Color palette and design fantasy </h2><p>  Creating a wallet, the master must plan in advance the number of shades and the placement of the color gamut, since its appearance will depend on the colors woven into the product.  You can play on contrasts or smooth transitions from one shade to another.  And someone wants a wallet made of plain rubber bands.  There are so many possibilities to decorate the surface - with beads, rhinestones, small original buttons. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the required size is ready, the right row should be removed from the machine.  The remainder is needed to form the valve so that the wallet can be closed.  Leave a hole in it - in this place there will be a loop.  To do this, wear gum while working in the form of eights. </p><p>  Before the finished product is removed from the machine, you need to secure the upper edge with a connected chain.  The button is sewn last. </p><h2>  Another way to weave </h2><p>  Masters offer one more option how to weave a purse from elastic bands.  It consists in the fact that, making the first layer, you twist the elastic bands in two turns, and you need to put them on the columns located diagonally.  The row will look like the intersecting letters "X".  Then the gum is laid around the perimeter of the machine, and the bottom layer rises up.  When the desired size is ready, you must secure with a chain of rubber bands from one row.  It remains to make a valve-cover - and the wallet can be used in everyday life. </p>

    <p>  We looked at how to weave a gum wallet on a loom.  Now you can delight your friends by presenting them with unique and beautiful accessories.  Each time, you can select new, more complex and sophisticated models - and bring them to life.  Design is limited only by your imagination. </p><h2>  How to weave a wallet on a slingshot? </h2><p>  A simple tool for weaving is a plastic slingshot.  She may have two or more cloves.  Everyone can learn how to create unique objects in this way. </p><p>  First, the zero row is made, the two extreme right rows of the slingshot are applied: an elastic band is put on them, twisted twice, and the second end is put on the second column from the inside.  So you should throw six gum diagonally. </p><p>  The following gum is twisted two turns.  They are thrown on the columns in the same way, they only change direction. </p><p>  Gum is hung on the extreme posts, and gum from the zero row is thrown inside.  Such actions are repeated up to about eight times - it all depends on the size of the wallet. </p><p>  When the rows are ready, the first two gum of the second row must be thrown on the first column and tie the entire row.  It is necessary to ensure that the last gum is located a row below. </p><p>  Before you remove the finished wallet from the slingshot, you need to fix the edges with another rubber and make a knot. </p><h2>  Crochet weaving: getting started </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to weave a gum wallet on a loom" class="if" height="465" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46192/1820754.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><p>  With only a crochet hook, you can also create a unique and no less beautiful wallet.  This type of needlework is quite simple.  So, we will figure out how to weave a purse out of rubber bands using a hook. </p><p>  Work begins with a circle.  It is created in this way: a loop is made, then the elastic is twisted, and the other end is thrown onto the hook.  To make the bottom more durable, two mugs are used at a time. </p><p>  Now you have to complete 10 links, doing double twists at the same time.  All elastic bands are put on and also stretch through the first one used in the base.  The remaining two loops are also pulled through the hook. </p><p>  The next few gum should be grabbed through four rows.  Such manipulations are repeated until 10 links are formed.  The next two links are performed using one elastic band. </p><h2>  Last steps </h2><p>  Now knitting will change a little - it will go in a circle.  The last three loops from the hook are counted, marked, and a hook is inserted into the hole from above - through the two sides of one elastic band.  Use the ring through which two loops extend, and the other side should be worn back. </p><p>  Carefully stretch the first loop through all the others.  After this, the strap should be stretched through the whole link.  Each link should subsequently be completely knitted - to the end of the row. </p>

    <p>  At the end, two loops should remain, and only then a hook is threaded through them.  Then put on the iris, which is pulled through the strips on the opposite side.  A hook is pulled through the last loop, and in this way new rows of irises are intertwined and new circles are added. </p><p>  It is necessary to ensure that the last loop passes through all the remaining ones.  The bottom will be ready when the three rows of the wallet are woven. </p><p>  Now you should prepare a clip or pin for convenience.  The center should be noted so as not to stray.  Weaving continues in the same way, but only one circle is used. </p><p>  The beginning of each row must be marked so as not to stray during weaving. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  Multi-colored small elastic bands made a splash, turning into decorative elements that decorate clothes and even complement it.  From gum make jewelry and toys. </p>
