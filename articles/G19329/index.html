    <h2>  Geographical position </h2><p>  First you need to decide where the Vaigach island is located.  Between the Barents and Kara Seas, this <span>northern land is located.</span>  Vaigach Island is separated from the continent by a small strait called the Ugra Shar, and from the Novaya Zemlya - the Kara Gate strait. </p><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe territory is 3.4 thousand square kilometers.  Basically, the surface is flat, having two parallel ridges up to 157 m high. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where is vaygach island" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/700714.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  History </h2><p>  The discoverers of Vaigach Island are representatives of the peoples of the north - the Ugra and Samoyed (or Samoyeds).  Later Russians came here, however, there is no documentary evidence of their first visits to this land.  Only at the end of the XVI century were published the testimonies of European sailors who met in these places Pomors (Russians) and Nenets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  At the end of the 15th century (1594), an expedition from Holland was looking for a new, shorter route to India and China.  Mariners explored the island of Vaigach and found more than 400 idols on the cape.  He later received the name "Cape of Idols." </p><p>  Before the revolution, the first polar station was built on the island, and a radio station appeared a little later.  In Soviet times, several Nenets families moved to Vaigach island. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="vaigach islands" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700244.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In 1931, exploration and development of lead-zinc ore, the main wealth of Vaigach Island, began.  At this time, lead and zinc mines functioned here.  In the south of the island, the remains of water-filled mines, rusted rails and trolleys are still preserved today. </p><p>  And more recently, archaeologists discovered unique finds (which, by the way, date back to the 3rd century BC), testifying to the life of a person in this territory, although this was much earlier than the settlement of the island by the Nenets. </p><h2>  On the origin of the relief of Vaigach island </h2><p>  This territory is characterized by a calm relief, which is disturbed at the Kara Gate, where there are basins of tectonic origin.  Basically, the relief of the plateau is flat prepared surfaces that are composed of strong pre-Quaternary rocks.  They are practically devoid of loose cover. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Rocky <span>rocks of the</span> main base are mostly shallow.  On the territory of the flooded lake-alluvial and zandra plains, in bays and troughs they are overlain by loose sediments several tens of meters thick. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Vaigach Island is an absolutely unique geographical feature.  Here are more than 400 lakes, picturesque waterfalls and rocks, ancient sanctuaries of the Nenets.  Mountain and flat tundra, coastal meadows, marsh, valley and aquatic vegetation are widely represented on this territory.  This is directly related to the geographical position of the land, various forms of landscapes and terrain, which is rugged, sometimes mountainous. </p><p>  The rivers, as a rule, have a stony bed, often flow in deep rocky canyons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="shrines of vaigach island" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700247.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Climatic conditions </h2><p>  The climate on the island is transitional between the arctic and the tundra climate.  The northern part is colder than the south.  This is due to piercing winds blowing from the Kara Sea.  Winter is long and rather cold, with a strong gusty wind, with snowfalls and snowstorms.  Frosts in the north of the island reach -20 ... -25 ¬∞ C.  In summer, the air temperature does not rise above 11 degrees. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Population </h2><p>  Vaigach island has only one small settlement - the village of Varnek.  It is located on the shores of the bay of the same name, in the south of this land area.  The village is named after the Russian hydrograph and polar explorer A.I. Varnek.  It was founded in 1930 to house the administration and guards of convicts working in mines.  After their closure, the village was desolate for some time, but then was again reborn to life by the Nenets families resettled here. </p><p>  Today, the total population of Varnek is just over 100 people.  All of them are Nenets.  The village of Varnek belongs to the Yushar Village Council, located on the mainland. </p><p>  Vaigach island is a border zone, and there is a border control regime in its territory. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the climate of Vaygach Island is quite severe, therefore lichens and mosses are most common among plants here.  Vascular plants grow in the southern regions, mostly creeping and stunted.  In the south you can find <span>dwarf birch trees</span> and annual low grasses. </p><p>  There are not many fish in rivers and lakes.  Nelma and <span>Arctic char prevail.</span> </p><p>  <span>Waterfowl</span> nest on the island of Vaigach <span>.</span>  These lands were chosen by Arctic butterflies, a <span>polar owl, a</span> small swan.  Humpback whale, Atlantic walruses, the northern blue whale and other endangered inhabitants of the northern seas live here. </p><p>  The fauna of the island is represented by mammals characteristic of these latitudes - reindeer, arctic foxes.  There are not very many polar bears here, they are mainly found in winter. </p><p>  On the coast there are huge colonies of walruses, <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãhares</span> and seals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="about the origin of the relief of the Vaigach island" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700246.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Shrines of Vaigach Island </h2><p>  Today, many researchers believe that the only sacred island of Vaigach is very important for the indigenous northern peoples.  On this earth they worshiped their gods, asked for their help and protection, and asked permission to catch animals and fish.  Nenets name the island "Hebidya-I", which means "sacred memory." </p><p>  The legend of the Nenets says that before the Samoyeds appeared on the island, there was nothing on it, but soon a cliff appeared on the seashore, which grew and gradually took on the shape of a man. </p><p>  The islands were considered sacred.  Women could not step on this earth without an iron plate sewn into shoes. </p><p>  In the northern part of the island stood one of the two main idols - Hodako (Old Man), in the south - Vesako (Old Woman).  As for the latter, the seven-figure statue is now hidden on the island of Zinkovy, on the west coast.  Despite the fact that Vaigach was protected by the Nenets from the invasion of aliens, and next to his sanctuaries it was impossible not only to hunt animals, but even pluck flowers, in the middle of the 19th century not one hundred idols were destroyed. </p><p>  Until the 20s of the XX century, people did not settle on the island.  The natives were convinced that only deities were allowed to be here.  They believed that people who violated their peace, awaiting an early death. </p><p>  There is evidence that the Nenets prevented the appearance of strangers on the lands we are considering.  Perhaps that is why a church was not built on Vaigach, although temples have existed on the nearest <span>island of Kolguev</span> since the 18th century. </p><h2>  Vaigach Island today </h2><p>  The island received the status of a specially protected zone of the Nenets okrug in 2006.  Today it is inhabited by 106 people - these are reindeer herders, specialists of municipal enterprises, meteorologists. </p><p>  The inhabitants of the island say that the days when people lived in poverty long passed.  Today, almost in every house you can see <span>satellite dishes,</span> people get freezers and other modern appliances. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sacred island vaigach" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/700245.jpg" width="600"></div>
