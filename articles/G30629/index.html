It is one of the ten best and largest zoos in the world and is the second largest in China. </p><p>  The Shanghai Zoo contains more than six hundred varieties of the most diverse representatives of the animal world of the entire planet. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Shanghai residents come to the zoo not only to look at the animals.  On its territory, the atmosphere itself is pleasant: a lot of greenery (flowers and other vegetation).  It is very cozy and you can have a wonderful time with your family as a family. </p><p>  Shanghai Zoo (see photo in the article) is part of a huge national zoo, covering an area of ‚Äã‚Äã743 thousand square meters.  meters.  Walking on it is almost always included in the excursion routes of various travel agencies.  You can visit it yourself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.thousandwonders.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful flamingos" class="if uuid-3263272" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3263272.jpg"></div><p>  The conditions for keeping a huge number of pets and the infrastructure here are constantly being improved and developed.  In a beautifully maintained park there is a swan lake with small islands (only 3), where migratory birds and swans live.  The Butterfly Pavilion presents an extensive collection of these magnificent vibrant insects.  The inhabitants of huge aquariums are a variety of types of fish with unexpected and original colors.  There is also a children's zoo in the park. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In total, more than 600 species of shrubs and trees grow in the park, the total number of which is more than 100 thousand.  They try to create natural landscapes that best resemble the natural habitat of animals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.forkstochopsticks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Butterfly park" class="if uuid-3263268" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3263268.jpg"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  Visitors to the Shanghai Zoo are offered a variety of extreme entertainment, including those that you rarely see with your own eyes.  For example, the fights of roosters and bulls.  The highlight of the program in Shanghai Zoo Park are the good and big "dancing" elephants, as well as pandas, eating more than 20 kg of bamboo per day.  The family of rather funny gorillas also captivates visitors. </p><p>  Usually in the wild pandas have a rather slender physique, and in this zoo their weight sometimes reaches 125 kg.  And their life expectancy is longer.  Watching their actions and habits is very funny and fun.  They raise their mood one hundred percent.  For all animals living in the cleaned spacious enclosures, excellent living conditions are created, almost similar to natural conditions. </p><p>  A very interesting point is that, at certain intervals, training sessions for some animals take place here.  Vacationers in the park can observe all this with their own eyes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="steemit.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dancing elephants" class="if uuid-3263274" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31656/3263274.jpg"></div><h2>  Recommendations for walking </h2><p>  Locals visit the Shanghai Zoo even to just take a walk.
