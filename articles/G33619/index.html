Payment by credit card: how to make a payment?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes it happens that you can‚Äôt keep track of the balance of your mobile phone.  Few will constantly check it, and many operators have a notification service when they approach zero.  MTS was no exception.  Paying with a bank card is the fastest and most convenient way to prevent yourself from becoming a minus.  But how to do that?  We will analyze several ways, choose which one is right for you. </p><p>  If you have already decided that you want to replenish MTS via a bank card, it remains to figure out which method is more suitable for you.  It all depends on whether your card is associated with a phone number, whether Mobile Bank is connected. </p><p>  In addition, it may be necessary to replenish not only your own balance, but also the account of a friend or family member.  Or your phone is down and you have access only to a computer, in which case you can pay for MTS via a bank card. </p><h2>  The card is tied to the phone to be recharged </h2><p>  For MTS, payment via bank card via SMS to 900 short number is the best option.  It is suitable for you if you want to recharge your number from your own card. </p><p>  The service "Mobile Bank" can be connected to any.  There are two types of them.  Both tariffs ("Economy" and "Full") allow you to make a recharge of MTS through a bank card. </p><p>  To do this, you need to go to the SMS menu and send a message to 900 indicating the amount that you want to put on the balance.  For example, if you want to recharge your phone by 300 rubles, send an SMS with the number 300. Without additional words and characters. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In response, you will receive a debit notice.  The second SMS will be from your operator that the balance is replenished.  You do not need to confirm the payment, you will not need to enter a code.  Therefore, it is very important to be careful when sending such a message.  Look, do not make a mistake in writing.  And that is, it is likely that you will not top up the balance at all by the amount you were thinking about. </p><h2>  Top up phone number of friend or relative </h2><p>  If you have activated the Mobile Bank service, and you need to recharge another MTS phone, payment via a bank card is also possible.  Only in this case, the SMS that will need to be sent to the bank will be longer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pay by credit card" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30095/828767.jpg" width="600"></div>  So, the first step - as in the previous case - we open SMS from the bank (from number 900) or just create a new SMS for the bank.  We write in the message text without signs and with any letter - Payment.  Next, put a space and dial the phone number on which we want to put money.  It should be entered without a figure eight.

      <p></p>
    <p>  After the number, put a space again and write the amount that we want to transfer.  As a result, SMS becomes such - Payment 9001234567 300. We do not put a point at the end of the message. </p><h2>  Enhanced protection </h2><p>  In the event that you want to replenish the balance of your phone, the bank must check whether you really want to replenish someone else's balance.  There are times when such an SMS was sent by accident or a child indulged in a phone.  You never know what could happen. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In any case, in response to an attempt to replenish someone else's account from your card, you will receive a message from the bank.  It will contain a secret code - six digits.  They should be sent in a reply message.  No extra <span>punctuation</span> or spaces. </p>

After sending the code, you will receive a message about debiting funds from the card.

    <h2>  If the "Mobile Bank" is not connected to the card </h2><p>  In this case, the MTS website will come to your aid.  Payment via a bank card will take a little longer than via SMS, but this option is the only one if you do not have Mobile Bank connected to the card with which you were going to pay. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS replenishment through a bank card" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/30095/828768.jpg" width="300"></div>  We go to the site mts.ru, on the right side of the screen we see the section ‚ÄúOften required‚Äù.  In the list of links we find ‚ÄúTop up account‚Äù and select the item ‚ÄúPayment from a bank card of MTS number‚Äù.

Carefully rewrite everything in the necessary framework.  <span>The CVV2 / CVC2 code</span> is the three digits on the back of your card.  This is not a PIN code that you enter at the ATM, it is a security code for purchases and payments on the Internet. </p>

    <p>  After completing the "Email" field, go to the next page.  You only need to enter the security code that will come to your phone within a minute.  Some cards may pay without a security code, but this is rare. </p><h2>  Information Security </h2><p>  Before you replenish the balance of your phone through the operator‚Äôs website, make sure that you are on the official website.  Often scammers fake pages on the Internet, using typos when entering the address. </p><p>  And on the payment page, when you enter the card number and other information, a green lock must be drawn in the <span>address bar</span> before http - this indicates that the site is safe. </p><p>  If you are worried about your data and the safety of money on the card, get a special card for online payments.  You will put on it exactly as much money as you are going to spend.  And you will not only have access to a calm replenishment of your phone balance, but also the convenience of online shopping. </p>
