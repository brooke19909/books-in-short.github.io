    <h2>  Azhek Falls: a brief description </h2><p>  It is located on the river Azhek, which flows into the beautiful water stream of Sochi, flowing in the Khostinsky district (Krasnoyarsk Territory, Russia).  It is here that there is a large national park, which is called Sochi.  Next to it is the village of Orekhovka (the distance is 6.5 kilometers).  Anyone who wants to enjoy the views of falling water needs to come to this area, where Azhek (waterfall) is located. </p><p>  The poetic name in translation from the Ubykh language means "snow son".  Near the waterfall, on the southern slope of the Sugar Mountain, the river Azhek, with an equally beautiful name - ‚Äúborn of snow‚Äù takes its sources.  With heavy snowfall, a huge white cap forms on the top of the mountain, which was the reason for the name of the water stream.  It is worth noting: this view is amazingly beautiful. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How was the waterfall formed? </h2><p>  Azhek (Sochi) waterfall owes its formation to shale rocks.  Its history begins more than 40-50 millennia ago.  A powerful water jet falling from the peaks reaches a height of 9.5 m. The width of the stream is one and a half meters.  At the foot of the cliff there is a pretty beautiful, picturesque lake.  It is small - about 7 m in diameter. </p><p>  The gorgeous jets of the waterfall formed a canyon with steep horseshoe-shaped banks.  The walls of the canyon are high, up to 20 m, densely covered with thickets of ivy, boxwood. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Azhek waterfall how to get" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134463.jpg" width="333"></div>

    <h2>  Flora and fauna </h2><p>  The sun illuminates little Azhek, the waterfall is more in the shade.  This feature gives the flow a certain phantom and mysterious mystery.  The water jet falling from a 9.5-meter height is mesmerizing.  Backlit through dense thickets of rays of the bright sun, the lake will not leave anyone indifferent. </p><p>  The rich flora has 130 species of plants.  Many are listed in the Red Book.  This yew, boxwood, and also there are numerous vines, shrubs, conifers.  There are many winter flowers, these are primroses - snowdrops, cyclamens.

Moving past the Orekhovsky Reserve, a small village is to be passed, after which a picturesque forest opens.  On the way there are numerous streams with fairly strong walkways.  You can‚Äôt get to the waterfall zone along the upper path, since the descent is very steep.  It is better to go through the jumper and carefully go down.  The further way can be chosen from two options: swim through the river or along a metal cable attached to the rock.  All difficulties are overcome - and here he is - Azhek.  The waterfall immediately impresses with its picturesque landscapes.  Wildlife, silence and amazing beauty of the falling stream of water compensate for all the difficulties of the transition.  For the sake of what is seen, it is worth doing this way. </p><p>  However, these are not all the pleasures that await tourists.  Here you can swim, and this is truly a fabulous pleasure. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="waterfall azhek sochi" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1134462.jpg" width="500"></div>
