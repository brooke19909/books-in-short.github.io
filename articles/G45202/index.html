However, he gained immense popularity not only for his talented playing on stage, but also for helping those who suffer from serious ailments.  This happened when he joined the ranks of lyceum-philanthropists, which include: <span>Dina Korzun,</span> Chulpan Khamatova, Ksenia Rappoport, Mikhail Porechenkov, Maria Mironova, <span>Ksenia Alferova</span> and many others. </p><p>  Today, the <span>Konstantin Khabensky</span> Foundation helps a huge number of children who fall ill with oncology and have dangerous brain damage.  And its initiator is ready to talk for hours about the activities of his brainchild.  Moreover, he plans to expand the scope of charity work, so there is every reason to argue that the Konstantin Khabensky Foundation is, fortunately, for a long time.  Undoubtedly, many will be interested to know how it all began, which served as an impetus for the well-known and highly paid actor to turn into a benefactor and philanthropist. </p><h2>  Personal tragedy </h2><p>  And this happened after Konstantin Khabensky experienced personal grief - his wife died from oncology, who, shortly before the development of the disease, gave birth to a child. </p>

    <p>  The actor did his best to help his wife get out: he identified her in expensive clinics, spending all his fees on treatment.  He sold housing, crawled into a debt hole and all this in order to save his wife.  However, even treatment at the Los Angeles Medical Center did not help to overcome cancer, and in 2008 Anastasia Khabenskaya passed away ... Today, the actor lives in an ordinary apartment and donates almost all of his earnings to charity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How did it all start? </h2><p>  Once Kostantin got a call from a medical center specializing in treating people with leukemia.  The woman on the other end of the wire begged to help her grieve: her son lacked two hundred thousand rubles for the operation.  The actor‚Äôs phone was given to her by doctors.  And Khabensky immediately responded to the mountain and brought the missing amount.  The boy had surgery on time. </p><p>  After this incident, the actor continued to engage in <span>charity work:</span> from phone calls, the phone simply heals.  It is noteworthy that Konstantin not only gives money for treatment, but also agrees with doctors to receive patients from the most remote regions of our country.  Many can not afford not only the operation in the capital, but also the purchase of round-trip tickets. </p>

    <p>  If not for the help of this sympathetic person who had lost his spouse, then not all lives would have been saved. </p><h2>  Creation of a charitable structure </h2><p>  In 2008, the actor decides to create the Konstantin Khabensky Foundation.  Initially, its staff consisted of two people: directly the founder and his assistant.  The actor had a hard time: he constantly thought about how to solve the financial issue, went to appointments with officials, knocked on doctors' offices ... The Konstantin Khabensky Foundation provided targeted assistance at the beginning of its activities, and its organizer did not advertise its activities.  Only after some time, the actor decided to present his project to the general public. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The debut action of the brainchild of Khabensky took place in the capital's Gorky Park on the day of the celebration of Maslenitsa.  The actor invited his friends to go ice skating in the park with their children.  There were more than enough people who wished: his colleagues in the shop came to support Konstantin: Ingeborg Dapkunaite, Chulpan Khamatova, <span>Alexey Kravchenko.</span> </p>

    <p>  And the famous skater <span>Irina Slutskaya</span> willingly agreed to teach several people, including Khabensky, to everyone.  In general, everyone with great pleasure had fun and received a large positive charge.  This holiday was remembered by all guests.  The charity event brought its organizer more than 600 thousand rubles. </p><p>  These funds were transferred to <span>the</span> Konstantin Khabensky <span>Charitable Foundation</span> for the treatment of cancer patients. </p><h2>  Who is funding the fund? </h2><p>  Over the years of its existence, the above organization has saved the lives of more than a dozen children.  Most of the investments in the Konstantin Khabensky Assistance Fund, which is 16 million rubles, were made by the actor himself, as well as his stage colleagues, friends and private companies. </p><p>  The founder of the charitable structure emphasized that in the future the size of monetary assets will increase, but for this he needs to move to a different level in his work, and he is almost ready for this. </p>

In some cases, financial assets are allocated to treat children abroad. </p>

    <p>  Unfortunately, parents do not always turn to a charity fund on time, so not everyone can help. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Friends of the actor and his colleagues on the floor have repeatedly stated that he is engaged in a "big deal".  Parents of sick children are also gratefully talking about the Konstantin Khabensky Foundation.  The reviews of mothers and fathers who had to endure severe trials only confirm that the actor, possessing spiritual nobility and able to have compassion, does truly ‚Äúgreat‚Äù. </p>
