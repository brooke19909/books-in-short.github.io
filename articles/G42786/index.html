The latter is better known for the style and beauty of products, while the Korean company produces, rather, budget, but practical devices.  So, forget about these stereotypes.  If there were any claims to the latest model - the flagship Galaxy S5, then most of them should disappear when working with the phone, which will be discussed in this article.  And we are talking about ‚ÄúSamsung Galaxy Alpha‚Äù - the device, which is deservedly called one of the most beautiful and stylish in the entire line of the Korean manufacturer.  We will find out what is so special about the new product, and what it is ready to offer the buyer. </p><h2>  Model positioning </h2>

    <p>  So, to begin with, we‚Äôll see how the developer, Samsung, positions its device.  It is known that shortly before its release, the long-awaited flagship Galaxy S5 model was introduced, which, in theory, was to ‚Äúcollect‚Äù all the demand for itself.  A little later, we see the presentation of another smartphone, which is called "Alpha", and is referred to in commercials as "thin" and "stylish."  In principle, the features of the S5 model and aluminum elements can be seen in it, which makes the device similar to Apple's flagship.  But it may seem only at first glance (especially if it is Samsung Alpha gold).  In fact, a mobile phone is significantly different from competitors and only slightly - from the "older brother" of the 5th generation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Interestingly, while the Alpha hardware cannot be compared with the 5S, the phones are almost identical in cost.  It seems that Samsung is increasing the price due to style.  Perhaps the move is justified if you look at the experience of Apple.  Again, you need to understand the characteristics of the device in order to talk about what the buyer pays for. </p><h2>  <span>Appearance</span> and design </h2>

    <p>  The Samsung Alpha phone is presented in an aluminum case, even advertising slogans speak of this.  Due to this, the model looks really elegant, especially in combination with a narrow metal frame around the display.  As for the back cover, it is removable and made of plastic, which by touch resembles leather.  Thus, holding the phone is convenient and pleasant. </p><p>  With navigation, the Samsung Galaxy Alpha is doing great.  Traditionally for the manufacturer, the model comes with a central button for minimizing programs, two side buttons "Properties" and "Back", as well as another mechanical screen lock button located on the <span>side panel.</span>  It is made of metal, so it‚Äôs nice to use it.  In addition, she decently acts, which allows you to press it without much difficulty. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Samsung Galaxy Alpha Case Assembly </h2><p>  Again, there is a stereotype that the installation class of mobile phones of the Korean concern is an order of magnitude lower than that of Apple products.  Probably, this model is designed to destroy this myth and prove that the manufacturer is able to make not only stylish, but also a high-quality ‚Äúshell‚Äù of the phone. </p><p>  The metal frame that surrounds the Samsung Galaxy Alpha smartphone has not only a decorative meaning, but also a rather practical function of giving the case rigidity.  If you try the phone to bend, push it well, then no backlash is felt.  It seems that the smartphone is monolithic, although this is not so - even a cover for Samsung Alpha is not needed thanks to such a case. </p>

    <h2>  Protect your phone from water and dust </h2><p>  Since we already mentioned the Galaxy S5, it should be said about its important quality - complete protection against water and dust.  The manufacturer mentioned this ‚Äútrick‚Äù more than once in its advertising campaign, and, in fact, due to it, the Korean model was positioned as more developed than the iPhone 5S. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  This is not the case with Samsung Galaxy Alpha.  The model is not equipped with a protection in the form of a rubberized cover and tight joints in the housing.  In principle, if you think logically, this approach is justified by the fact that the phone is positioned as stylish due to the thin body;  the practicality of its use in everyday life is achieved through a metal panel and strong glass on the sensor, and in principle, it does not need a waterproof case.  Again, technically isolating such a thin model as a Samsung Alpha phone would probably be impossible. </p>

    <h2>  Display </h2><p>  Interestingly, the Alpha model does not have the huge display that Samsung loves so much.  The phone is equipped with a 4.7-inch screen, built on the basis of Amoled technology.  If we talk about operating it as a whole, we can say that the display transmits a high-quality picture, preserves color reproduction at different viewing angles, and in general, Samsung Alpha (the live review confirmed this) is quite acceptable for the ‚Äúnon-flagship‚Äù. </p><p>  On the other hand, if you criticize the model as being sold at the cost of the most advanced smartphone lineup, you can mention PenTile pixel placement technology.  Due to its use in the phone screen, the image may not seem so high-quality, especially if you work with Alpha closer than at a distance of 20 centimeters.  Simply put, if you bring the display closer to your eyes, you can see pixels. </p>

    <h2>  Samsung Alpha Platform </h2><p>  If we talk about the platform on which the device is developed, it should be said that this is Exynos 5 Octa, which consists of as many as 8 cores.  Of these, 4 have a <span>clock frequency</span> of 1.3;  and 4 - at 1.8 GHz.  With such a basis, of course, the novelty responds quite quickly and dynamically: no slowdowns or freezes in the work with the device were noticed (and it‚Äôs difficult to make the Samsung Galaxy Alpha smartphone buggy).  According to the test from the AnTuTu app, the device is even faster than the S5 (which is amazing). </p>

    <p>  As for the graphics engine, the device uses the Mali-T628 MP6, which is capable of transmitting FullHD graphics.  The image quality of the smartphone is up to par. </p><h2>  Alpha Mobile Phone Memory </h2><p>  Revealing the characteristics of the model, it is also necessary to mention this characteristic of the device.  According to reviews, Samsung Alpha is not equipped with a card slot;  instead, the manufacturer endowed the model with 32 GB of internal memory.  Of these, by the way, only 25.4 GB can be used for filling.  Is it a lot or a little?  Hard to tell.  In fact, considering how high-quality image transmission is in a smartphone, how bulky photos taken with a camera can be, you can complain that 25 gigabytes is not enough for a smartphone of this level.  However, on the other hand, captured photos can always be downloaded to a computer, and the phone will again get a bunch of free space.  Perhaps the developers are right, and more than 32 GB on the phone is not required.  Moreover, a fixed amount of memory allows for more accurate optimization of the use of space on the device, which is also important.  Another plus - at Samsung Alpha the price will be the same, while a competing company sets a different cost based on the amount of device memory. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Users also leave feedback about it.  Samsung Alpha has two devices for capturing images: a <span>front camera</span> with a resolution of 2 megapixels and a rear <span>camera</span> designed for 12 megapixels.  However, the value is not so much the number of pixels as the optimization of the matrix used to create images.  And, as a series of photos taken with the Galaxy Alpha shows, everything is fine with the smartphone.  Pictures come out great;  perhaps the phone can be called one of the most advanced in the market from this point of view. </p><p>  Alpha, of course, is equipped with a flash.  In addition, as in the case of the Galaxy S5, there is a heartbeat sensor next to it, which encourages users to a healthy lifestyle and fitness. </p><h2>  Battery and endurance </h2><p>  The battery capacity of Alpha is, according to official figures, 1860 mAh.  If this is not enough, you can purchase a special case for Samsung Alpha, in which an additional battery is built-in to recharge the device.  The fact that developers use this particular battery is explained by the small size of the device and, of course, the limited free space under the phone cover. </p><p>  In general, due to the austerity of charge consumption, as well as due to the optimization of all processes that take place in the device during active operation, according to reviews, Samsung Alpha can last about 11 hours of active use.  If we compare, for example, with the iPhone 5S, which has <span>a</span> 1560 mAh battery, then for Samsung such a technical solution is a kind of success.  A battery with a capacity of 2800 mAh was installed in the S5, but the processes there are probably less optimized, because the charge keeps the device an order of magnitude less (than Alpha with the same battery could).  And so - the phone has a small vertical battery, which, according to the classical scheme, is placed under the cover.  You can get it, in fact, at any time. </p><h2>  Model price in the domestic market </h2><p>  The phone has been on sale in the domestic market since September 12 last year.  And then, and now it is offered at a price of 24,990 rubles.  For this amount, a person gets a stylish, well-balanced business segment phone that can compete in performance with the advanced models of the Korean giant Samsung.  It is possible that in small online stores on Samsung Alpha the price will be slightly lower. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, considering all the factors, the Alpha as a whole leaves a pretty good impression.  It is simpler than S5, but not inferior to it in matters of build quality, performance and functionality.  Moreover, we can say that the style of the device is ahead of the flagship model.  The same is confirmed by the reviews.  Samsung Alpha, quite possibly, will become the next round in the history of the development of the Samsung mobile department due to a completely new format - a stylish metal phone of the highest segment.  And this, obviously, confirms the high demand for the model, despite the fact that the presentation of the new product has been held for a long time. </p><p>  If you need a phone that is practical enough for continuous use, but has a stylish look, then this is clearly Samsung Alpha.  A review of the device proves this claim! </p><h2>  Who should use Alpha? </h2><p>  The phone is universal in nature.  Yes, it has a stylish metal case and a lid, clearly defined as an ‚Äúelement of luxury‚Äù due to plastic resembling leather.  However, at the same time, the model is equipped with a heart sensor, and this is confirmed by reviews.  Samsung Alpha can be safely called a universal device that is suitable for both sports and business. </p><p>  Thus, the device is suitable for young, energetic people who care about their health;  and those who are busy with their own affairs and need a productive phone that allows them to control the situation on their own. </p>
