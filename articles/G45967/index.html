They are the second largest in Arkhyz, located between the Kizgych and Psysh valleys.  The top of the mountain is covered with glaciers that feed the waterfalls.  Several streams of cold water break off from a height downward, uniting among themselves in a single stream and forming a mountain river.  Water falls at high speed, creating a noise that is heard throughout the district.  Sofia River flows to the valley of the river.  Psyche, and then carries its water to the source of the river.

    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Sofia waterfalls and the village.  Arkhyz is a peculiar place of ‚Äúpilgrimage‚Äù for many tourists, a center of mountaineering and <span>mountain tourism of</span> Karachay-Cherkessia.  Thousands of travelers come to these places every year who want to visit a picturesque place.  Many tourist companies conduct excursions here.  Most of the visitors are climbers, others are interested in the unusual treasures of nature and want to see the Sophia Glacier with their own eyes. </p><p>  To make the way to the waterfalls, you need to leave Pyatigorsk in a westerly direction, along the Circassian highway.  Having reached the administrative capital of the republic (Cherkessk), you need to turn towards the city of Khabez, and from there drive to the village of Zelenchukskaya.  Here fir forests begin.  From the village of Arkhyz to the foot of Sofia there is a <span>country road</span> 17 km long.  In the valley of the river is Glacier Farm, where the route to the mountains begins. </p><p>  There are several ways to get to the waterfalls themselves.  In summer, under good weather conditions, you can get to them by SUV.  The road runs along the river, you have to cross the riverbed several times, sometimes sections of the road are poorly visible.  Another option is a horse ride.  In the village of Arkhyz and the glade of Taulu, it is possible to rent horses and book an excursion to the waterfalls along with the huntsman. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sofia glacier" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1360825.jpg" width="600"></div>

The route begins in the glade of Taulu, near the bridge over the river.  Crazy.  The trail runs along the river, among picturesque places, fir and pine forests, birch groves and meadows with tall grass. </p><p>  Fir forest is a unique site of Arkhyz.  The Kizgych fir, typical for this region, can reach 60 m in height, and the trunk girth is 1.5 m. Some trees are 700 years old.  Also, relic species of vegetation can be found along the way to the waterfall: Caucasian plane tree, yew tree, pine, etc. Above there is a section of undersized birches, and closer to the waterfalls the groves are replaced by subalpine meadows that have grown to the very border with the glacier. </p><p>  On the way, you can meet representatives of the fauna of this region: a wolf, a fox, a lynx, a wild boar, a round, a bear and a Caucasian deer.  All wild animals live far away in the thickets of the forest and rarely approach hiking trails leading to such an object as Sofia Falls.  About 150 species of birds live in Arkhyz and its forests, the most popular are chamois, black grouse, and ular.  Also in the forest you can meet the largest representatives of the feathered family: white-headed vulture, brown neck, vulture and lamb. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sofia waterfalls how to get" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1360828.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Arkhyz and its mountain peaks, including the city of Sofia, from which the Sofia Falls fall, were once pilgrimage sites.  Previously, the Alanian kingdom was located on this territory, which is known for spreading Christianity throughout the territory of the Long Caucasus.  Near Sophia waterfalls and the surrounding area are three Christian churches built in the X century. </p>
