At the same time, the little thing will look unique, since the craftswoman herself can choose the size, shape, pattern, color and design.  You can make an item using various additional elements. </p><h2>  What threads should be used for creative activity </h2><p>  For the manufacture of wallets, it is worth choosing the appropriate threads to make the product look attractive. </p><p>  It is advisable to use these types of yarn: </p><ol><li>  An ideal option would be pure cotton yarn.  The wallet will look neat.  The threads will not form spools, fade or rub. </li><li>  Knitted threads with a small thickness are very often used to make bags, and wallets are also included. </li><li>  Flax and hemp threads may be used for certain models.  Eco-friendly models will be a great addition to the summer look. </li><li>  You can use high-quality acrylic, it is better to choose a smoother and denser texture. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="original crochet wallet" class="if uuid-3125988" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3125988.jpg"></div><p>  Products from such threads will look very non-standard.  Thanks to the soft texture of the threads, the finished thing holds its shape well, but is easily deformed if necessary. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Children's knitted wallets </h2><p>  Not only girls and women need wallets.  Children also love a simple product with a clasp in which you can store all sorts of little things.  Girls can use a knitted wallet as a handbag. </p><p>  Plus, products can be knitted from the remains of the thread without spending extra money.  A child can choose a design; a soft texture will not be traumatic for him.  The needlewoman can herself choose a clasp suitable for the age and skills of the child. </p><p>  Children will really like a knitted wallet in the form of: </p><ul><li>  Favorite cartoon characters. </li><li>  Images of your favorite sweets. </li><li>  The muzzle of animals. </li><li>  Beautifully decorated paintings with colored stripes and appliqu√©s. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="option for children's wallet" class="if uuid-3125952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3125952.jpg"></div><p>  The fastener can be a loop and a button, Velcro, zipper, button, bow, magnetic rivet, pin. </p><h2>  Crochet baby wallet </h2><p>  Learning to crochet takes a minimum of time, so beginner needlewomen should start with this tool.  The easiest way to make a children's wallet will be two circles, which will be sewn together with zipper. </p><p>  It is necessary to make a loop and tie it with six double crochets (ssn).  The next row knit scs, but do three additions through one loop.  To do this, knit two sts in one loop. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.earlgreycrochet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="making the basis for a children's wallet" class="if uuid-3125923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3125923.jpg"></div><p>  In the next one, make four additions according to the previous principle.  It is enough to knit 5-6 rows.  Then make another circle.  Measure the circumference and select the appropriate zipper.  Sew the product.  On the canvases of circles, you can embroider or place textile stickers. </p><h2>  Sketch Options </h2><p>  Knitted wallets can take many forms.  The most popular are square, rectangle, circle.  With the help of a hook, you can knit an exact copy of any purse, recreating every little thing. </p><p>  Clasp products and purses-bags look unusual.  But such options do not differ in usability.  As a fastener, you can use diverse decor items, starting with a zipper and ending with magnets from the refrigerator. </p><p>  Decorating with additional elements is of great importance.  Elegant clasps, beads, beads, sequins, glass stones, brooches - everything can become the perfect complement. </p><h2>  Crochet Option </h2><p>  Knitted purses in retrostyle, which have a clasp clasp, are relevant.  To recreate the shape of the canvas under the clasp, it is better to use a hook.  It is necessary to prepare cotton threads and a tool that will correspond to the thickness of the yarn. </p><p>  Crochet wallet scheme that will be attached to the clasp: </p><ol><li>  Make an amigurumi ring.  The loop is tied with eight columns with a crochet (ssn).  The last column will be connecting. </li><li>  In the second row you need to double the number of loops.  First, knit the air loop (VP), and then knit two PRSs in each PRS.  The result should be 16 loops. </li><li>  The third row start with VP, and then alternately knit 2 PRS in one, and 1 PRS in 1 loop.  It should get 24 loops. </li></ol><p>  Each subsequent row must be knitted by adding as in the third row, but the alternation is determined by the following scheme: </p><ul><li>  2 ssn, 1 ssn, 3 ssn; </li><li>  2 ssn, 1ssn, 4 ssn. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="gmhstl.us" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wallet knitting pattern" class="if uuid-3125979" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3125979.jpg"></div><p>  Make such additions until the volume reaches a diameter suitable for the clasp.  Crocheted wallet with a clasp looks very original and attractive.  The product can store money, jewelry, checks and other trifles. </p><h2>  Knitted wallet </h2><p>  A women's zipped wallet with standard shapes can be knitted using knitting needles.  Since the basis of the product will be two paintings that will be stitched together, the original design will be the perfect decoration. </p><p>  A beautiful zipper wallet, knitted with needles, will work out if you have minimal skills and perform such actions: </p><ol><li>  Dial 25 loops.  The quantity may vary.  Much depends on the thickness of the yarn and the desired size of the product. </li><li>  Knit with a garter stitch.  It is enough to make 30-35 rows.  You can increase the number of rows so that the wallet resembles a small clutch. </li><li>  Close all loops.  Link another part according to the same principle as the first element. </li><li>  Sew together two fabrics.  Functional zipper is sewn on one side. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="pepperboxcouture.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted wallet" class="if uuid-3125889" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3125889.jpg"></div><p>  Additionally, you can decorate a knitted wallet with various elements, which will make the accessory more original and attractive.  The owner can be sure that no one has such a second. </p>
