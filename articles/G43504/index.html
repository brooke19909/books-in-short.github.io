The central direction of development of such systems is communication capabilities, the range of which is regularly updated with new options.  In particular, manufacturers endow the equipment with compatibility with mobile devices and their applications, which opens up possibilities for broadcasting music from Internet radio stations. </p><p>  Along with this, the promotion of sound quality characteristics at different frequencies does not stop.  One of the most successful developments of the last time was the Alpine CDE-178BT car radio, the creators of which did a good job on its internal filling and did not forget to take into account the nuances of operation in conjunction with the car.  The main advantages of the system are in its options and functional content.  The filling cannot be called revolutionary, but in combination with a clear and uncomplicated interface and high-quality sound, it looks especially attractive. </p><h2>  Model Overview </h2><p>  Alpine has recently released many interesting head units that are distinguished by ease of use, versatility and good sound quality.  The upper segment of the company is represented by several models, but the Alpine CDE-178BT can play the role of the flagship.  The processor radio provides synchronization capabilities with Android and iPhone smartphones, supports working with the Alpine TuneIt App, etc. 24-bit DAC and BassEngine Pro are responsible for the sound quality. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  With regard to compatibility in terms of interface, the CD-receiver is organically combined with the standard interface remote control buttons on the steering wheel and on-board display.  Another aspect is interesting in relation to interaction with the machine.  Unlike many car radios, the Alpine CDE-178BT does not stop its operation even when the car stops.  For the price, this model also looks decent, given the wealth of internal equipment and ergonomic advantages.  You can buy this receiver for 16-17 thousand rubles.  This price level refers to the middle segment, however, the functionality and overall quality of the device put it to a higher position. </p><h2>  Radio specifications </h2><p>  The model has standard dimensions, but it compares favorably with standard radio tape recorders with wider means of communication, installation and connection.  The manufacturer endowed the <span>head unit with an</span> FM tuner, a USB connector and Bluetooth technology.  This significantly increased the operational comfort of the Alpine CDE-178BT model, an overview of the characteristics of which is presented below: </p><ul><li>  The device size is 1DIN. </li><li>  Weight - 1.5 kg. </li><li>  The output voltage is 2 V. </li><li>  The permissible inclination angle during installation is 35 ¬∞. </li><li>  Dimensions - 17.8 cm in width, 5 cm in height and 16.2 cm in depth. </li><li>  Output power - The total maximum rating is 4x50 watts. </li><li>  The mono sound sensitivity is 0.7 ŒºV. </li><li>  Signal to noise ratio - 65 dB. </li><li>  The initial frequency level is 5 Hz. </li><li>  The upper frequency level is 20,000 Hz. </li></ul><p>  In addition to technologies that have improved sound quality, a whole range of auxiliary solutions is provided, aimed at the optional expansion of the capabilities of the Alpine CDE-178BT during operation.  This group of add-ons includes a high-pass filter, automatic time synchronization, decoders, an attenuator, <span>a spectrum analyzer,</span> and sound source settings. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Features </h2><p>  To begin with, it is worth highlighting the possibilities of working with tuners.  The main place in this direction is occupied by a radio receiver with automatic recording of frequencies into memory.  Several search modes for stations are provided, among which one can scan local channels and connect maximum sensitivity.  In addition, let's talk about RDS technology, which is also endowed with Alpine CDE-178BT.  Car audio can be adjusted using the Bass Engine Pro system, which allows you to adjust the subwoofer levels and switch phases.  Equalizer operation is also provided.  And you can choose the mode of operation of this function according to musical genres - from Pop to Classical.  Using the 9-band parametric equalizer, the user gets the opportunity to conveniently and efficiently adjust the sound with the necessary corrections for the frequency spectrum. </p>

    <p>  Bluetooth technology has also contributed a lot to the performance of the head unit.  A motorist can use several profiles to his taste.  For example, the HFP mode of operation will free your hands from the need to directly control the functions of the device.  For operation against the background of combining with other devices, the HSP mode is provided.  Alpine has a CDE-178BT and an advanced A2DP audio profile for audio transmission.  If you need remote control of multimedia functions, you can refer to the AVRCP profile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Menu and interface </h2><p>  In the radio, the Setup menu is implemented, through which you can control the basic settings and select the modes of visual presentation of the interface.  So, in General mode, elements are available for setting the clock, selecting a sound source, a calendar presentation format, as well as some playback options.  In Display mode, the user can customize the characteristics of the text displayed on the display, adjust the backlight and brightness of the Alpine CDE-178BT.  The instruction notes that the ability to scroll through the text that accompanies reproduced musical compositions may not be available in some parts of the screen.  Especially for the general settings of the sound played from the FM receiver, Tuner mode is provided. </p>

    <p>  A separate format for operating the head unit is also intended for USB.  In this case, the user's work is facilitated when selecting folders with music files.  For example, you can assign the option to skip files or folders by several units.  In general, I must say that the menu with the interface is implemented quite well - both the visual part and the controls are ergonomic, which is very important for complex multifunctional head units. </p><h2>  Installation and Connection Instructions </h2><p>  Installation begins with the introduction of the mounting basket into the dashboard.  Further, the workflow depends on whether it is possible to use a bracket to secure the device.  If the car has such a possibility of fixation, it is necessary to fix the unit by means of a screw with a rubber cap.  In other cases, you will have to use a special plate for installation.  After that, the position of the locking pins is checked - if they are located correctly, then you can connect the Alpine CDE-178BT through special leads. </p>

    <p>  Each device has its own type of connector - it can be USB, an input for an iPhone, AUX interface cable, etc. You should also consider a place for installing a microphone.  The problem with its connection is due to the fact that you can use it only if the driver‚Äôs voice is available.  In this case, the fixation should not imply making adjustments to the position of the microphone - so as not to distract the user from driving. </p><h2>  Setup Instructions </h2><p>  The volume can be adjusted for each source separately.  The same applies to the rest of the sound parameters, although there are special options thanks to which you can adjust individual parameters of the Alpine CDE-178BT.  Tuning through the Media Xpander function, for example, is responsible for playing vocal parts.  In this case, the source can be a player, a radio, or a disk.  Due to the optimal settings, it is possible not only to increase the purity and softness of reproduction, but also to minimize the impact on the broadcast of the track of external noise, which is inevitable when the car moves. </p><p>  The Spatial function is intended for playback settings against the background of a changing acoustic field.  The option provides two different effects, each of which makes its own sound shades.  For example, the car owner can drown out the sound of the front speakers, which will expand the overall playback range.  Conversely, a delay in the signal of the rear speakers provides the effect of distancing the sound while maintaining its clarity and intelligibility. </p>

    <p>  The need for some corrections is also due to the non-standard arrangement of the Alpine CDE-178BT speakers.  The sound setting in this case aims to create a positive effect of equidistance of devices reproducing the signal.  The fact is that the speakers can be at different distances from the listener.  To optimize and smooth out this difference, use the time correction function.  Its essence lies in the fact that the speaker signal comes with a certain delay, as a result, organically entering the rest of the acoustic ensemble. </p><h2>  Positive reviews </h2><p>  The manufacturer is known for his responsible approach to the implementation of devices that provide a clean and balanced sound.  And users of this model confirm this.  Moreover, high-quality playback is attributed not only to the direct function of the music player, but also to work with related equipment.  There is a stable and legible broadcast via Bluetooth, as well as a good study of streaming audio tracks when working with connected mobile devices. </p>

    <p>  Separately, owners praise a lot of settings, due to which it is possible to minimize the negative factors of reproduction during the movement of the car and, as a whole, to adjust the radio tape recorder for individual requests.  In addition, the build quality of the Alpine CDE-178BT is emphasized.  Reviews, for example, highlight the strength of the materials used, thanks to which both the pleasant appearance of the head unit and its reliability during operation are achieved.  It is also worth noting a convenient interface.  Largely thanks to a well-thought-out menu, most users do not have problems in the process of setting up the car radio and its connection to other gadgets and multimedia. </p><h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  The model received not so many negative reviews, but not without them.  Still, the audio preparation is positioned as a flagship company, therefore, the requirements for it are relevant.  So, among the negative opinions, it is worth highlighting problems with the operation of the Bluetooth module, failures and interruptions in the synchronization process and the lack of Russification in some functions and applications of Alpine CDE-178BT.  Reviews of this kind are quite rare and may be associated with the presence of marriage in the radio. </p><p>  One way or another, the majority of users of this device are, rather, a positive experience.  This is the rare case when the device practically does not cause open rejection in terms of sound characteristics, functionality, and quality of menu implementation.  The only minus of the system can be attributed only to its cost, but not everything is clear here, if you pay attention to products from other companies. </p><h2>  Market competitors </h2><p>  A rather successful combination of functions and sound quality pushed many representatives of the price segment 15-20 thousand rubles into the background.  Nevertheless, fans of Alpine brand devices out of habit turn to her long-standing rival in the market - Pioneer.  And in this case, the question can be asked which model is preferable - Pioneer DEH-80PRS or Alpine CDE-178BT?  It should be noted right away that the comparison is not entirely correct, since the first option is available on the market with a price tag of 24-25 thousand rubles.  If we compare by other parameters, the difference will not be so obvious. </p>

    <p>  In terms of sound, Alpine's advantage is observed, however, with skillful installation and the condition of supplementing the head unit with suitable acoustics, the DEH-80PRS version also provides a good result.  By the way, among the strengths of this device in terms of sound, you can highlight the exact and complete study of the bass. </p><p>  In practice, it has been noticed that this model also benefits due to the high read speed from USB.  But the option from Alpine differs in a more ergonomic menu, a wide range of audio settings and high-quality assembly.  Therefore, for lovers of good sound, stylish design and functional richness, it is worth recommending an offer from Alpine. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  On the market you can find more solid models that offer a ton of modern options and communication capabilities.  Against their background, the Alpine CDE-178BT will look like a device with rather mediocre characteristics.  If we consider the line of premium processor car radios, then the presence of Bluetooth, additional settings and the ability to interact with gadgets will become a basic condition.
