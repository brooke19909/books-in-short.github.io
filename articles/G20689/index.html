Today, about 305 thousand people live here permanently.  The life of the vast majority of Murmansk people is connected with the sea.  In 2012, the monument “Waiting” was unveiled in Murmansk, dedicated to all women escorting their men to the sea.  Today it is one of the most romantic and popular attractions in the city. </p><h2>  As the Murmansk "Waiting" 30 years have waited ... </h2><p>  In the 1970s, the northern poet Viktor Timofeev wrote the poem Sentimental Watch.  It is in the lines of this work that the image of “Waiting” first appears.  It is worth noting that the author himself, before devoting his life to creativity, was a sea navigator. </p>

    <p>  In 1984, Viktor Timofeev turned to the city executive committee with a proposal to erect a monument to the residents of Murmansk, dutifully waiting for their husbands, fathers and brothers during long sea voyages.  As it turned out, the idea is not entirely fresh - in many port cities, such monuments existed.  And this means that it is absolutely necessary to erect the “Waiting” monument in Murmansk.  After all, this city appeared only thanks to the ice-free sea waters.  In the 90s, a competition of sketches was held, and even a winner was determined.  But at such a difficult time for the country, the idea simply could not be realized.  Only in 2011 the project was unfrozen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Grand opening of the monument </h2><p>  The “Waiting” monument in Murmansk is a nationwide project.  About 15 million rubles were raised for the manufacture and installation of the sculpture.  Investors are legal entities of the region and ordinary <span>residents of Murmansk.</span>  In the fall of 2011, a new sketching competition was held, in which architects from Smolensk - Yu. Anushko and I. Chumakov won. </p>

    <p>  In mid-November 2012, residents and guests of Murmansk were able to attend the opening ceremony of the new monument.  The event was attended by the governor of the region and the mayor of the city, as well as many other honored guests.  The monument "Waiting" in Murmansk was opened to the verses of Viktor Timofeev and the melody of the Beatles band performed by a brass band.  After the solemn speeches of dignitaries, ordinary Murmansk residents were able to examine the sculpture, lay flowers at its foot and take pictures for memory. </p><h2>  Photo and description of the monument </h2><p>  “Waiting” is a monument, which is a sculpture of a woman at whose feet is a bollard on which a seagull sits.  The growth of the figure is about three meters.  "Waiting" froze in a welcome gesture, and her gaze was directed towards the Kola Bay.  The woman is dressed modestly enough - in a long dress and an open coat.  Her hair flutters in the wind, and shoes flaunt on her legs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The monument “Waiting” in Murmansk, whose photo you can see in our article, is installed on a granite pedestal.  At the bottom of the monumental base is a bas-relief with sea waves.  On the pedestal there is an inscription in golden letters: "To those who know how to wait."  On a separate board fixed at the base of the monument, you can read the lines from the poem of Viktor Timofeev.  Around the new <span>sights of Murmansk</span> today, a landscaped square is laid out.  The monument offers an excellent panoramic view of the <span>Kola Bay.</span> </p><h2>  Where is the “Waiting” sculpture located? </h2><p>  The place for the installation of the monument was chosen long enough.  In other cities, sculptures with a similar meaning are usually installed on the embankments.  However, in Murmansk, the entire coastline is a closed zone of special regime.  Is it possible to put such a national monument where they pass only by passes?  The search for the ideal place for a new attraction stopped at the final stop of the shuttle bus number 18.  Be sure to visit the “Waiting” monument during a visit to Murmansk.  Attraction address: the intersection of Kovalev and Chumbarov-Luchinsky streets.  The nearest public transport stop is “ul.  Sasha Kovalev "(bus number 18). </p><h2>  The attitude of residents and visitors to the new attractions </h2><p>  Most Murmansk residents like the “Waiting” monument.  It is a beautiful and romantic image reminiscent of devotion and love.  The Murmansk monument compares favorably with many others.  Most often, port cities pose sculptures dedicated to the <span>wives of sailors.</span>  The image of “Waiting” is more multifaceted.  In Murmansk, almost the entire female population is waiting for someone.  And this is not only about grooms and husbands.  Here, the sisters of the brothers escorted to the sea, and the daughters of the fathers. </p>

    <p>  Many citizens also like the choice of the place on which the monument "Waiting" is installed in Murmansk.  Where is this attraction, today everyone knows.  Newlyweds come here, many Murmansk people from time to time visit the square and just for the sake of relaxing in a picturesque place.  Waiting has its own detractors.  According to some residents of the city, the monument is outdated. It looks out of date due to too strict architectural forms.  And yet, most people really like the sculpture, and some sailors admit that it reminds them of their own wives in their youth. </p>
