He is often called the cradle of the nation, for some time he was even the capital of the state.  Guimaraes in Portugal can be called a real open-air museum.  Almost the entire city consists of buildings dating from the 15th-19th centuries, old streets and squares.  The historical center was recognized in 2001 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.travel-in-portugal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History Center" class="if uuid-2961326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2961326.jpg"></div><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  Soon after the emergence of the Portucale county on the Iberian Peninsula in 868, a new city was laid down.  Its founder is Vimara Peres, who named the city of Vimaranish, which means the City of Vimara. </p><p>  In 950, the territory of the modern city passed to Countess Mumadone Diash, who founded a monastery here.  To protect the monks from the constant raids of the Moors, a castle was laid nearby, the construction of which was completed by 968.  It is from this date that the history of Guimaraes begins in Portugal. </p><div class="photo" data-original="commons.wikimedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guimaraes Fortress" class="if uuid-2962212" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962212.jpg"></div><p>  At the end of the XI century, the county of Portucale passed to Henry of Burgundy, who fought with King Alfonso VI and in 1085 conquered Toledo from the Moors.  For excellent service, Henry not only received land, but also married the illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso Teresa of Leon.  In 1109, Afonso Enriques was born to them.  After the death of Heinrich of Burgundy, power passed to Theresa, but already in 1128 Afonso defeated his mother‚Äôs troops and imprisoned her in a monastery.  A number of victories allowed the young count not only to defeat the Moors, but also gain independence from Castile. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 1139, he declared himself king of Portugal, and in 1143 signed a peace treaty with Alfonso VII, according to which Afonso was officially recognized as king of Portugal, and the city of Guimaraes became the first capital of the state. </p><h2>  Guimaraes in Portugal: what to see </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Guimaraes is a small city, many attractions are concentrated in it.  Tourists can enjoy the picturesque parks and medieval architectural structures.  The centerpiece, of course, is San Miguel Castle, also known as Guimaraes Castle, within the walls of which Afonso Enriques, the first king of Portugal, was born. </p><h2>  San Miguel Castle (Guimaraes) </h2><p>  The powerful medieval castle of San Miguel is located on a high hill and is considered to be the main attraction of Guimaraes in Portugal.  The first building was erected in the X century, later during the reign of Afonso I there was the residence of the king, and the castle was significantly expanded. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.globtroter.pl" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guimaraes Fortress" class="if uuid-2962210" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962210.jpg"></div><p>  By the XIV century, the fortress walls surrounded the whole city, the castle had 8 towers 28 meters high and 8 gates.  In the XV century, the castle completely lost its defense significance and began to be used as a prison, and later - for agricultural purposes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Most of the structures were demolished back in 1420, and so far only a small area in the eastern part has been preserved.  Its length is about a kilometer.  Guimaraes Castle became a historical monument in 1881. </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, the castle was completely renovated and open to many tourists.  The complex consists of a square central tower and fortified walls and resembles a heraldic shield in shape.  A suspension bridge is thrown from the central building to the walls, and towers with sharp stone teeth rise in the corners of the complex.  On the territory of the castle you can see the ruins dating back to the XIV century. </p><p>  Tourists are invited to climb the stone walls to the ramparts, which offers beautiful views of the city and its surrounding forests. </p><div class="photo" data-original="svguidinglight.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Battlements of the fortress" class="if uuid-2961504" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2961504.jpg"></div><p>  You can visit the castle any day from 10:00 to 18:00, entrance to the territory is free. </p><h2>  Palace of the Dukes of Braganza </h2><p>  The building dates back to the 15th century.  The first owner of the palace was Don Alfons, the founder of one of the most notable names in Portugal.  Later, the palace was inherited by his grandson Fernando II de Braganza.  He began large-scale work to change and expand the building, which were not completed.  The duke and his family moved to Alentejo, and the palace in Guimaraes was abandoned for several centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the 19th century, the building housed military barracks and by the beginning of the 20th century the palace was almost completely destroyed. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pumpkin.pt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of the Dukes of Braganca" class="if uuid-2961509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2961509.jpg"></div><p>  Restoration work began in 1937.  The reconstruction was led by the architect Rogerio de Azevedo and on June 24, 1959 the palace opened its doors as a museum for the first visitors. </p><p>  The architecture of the palace resembles a well-fortified castle built in the French medieval style.  The building is square in shape with powerful towers in the corners.  In the center of the palace is a courtyard surrounded by a gallery in the Gothic style. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imagenesorr.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of the Dukes of Braganca" class="if uuid-2962146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962146.jpg"></div><p>  39 brick pipes in the form of cylinders located on the roof give a distinctive look to the palace.  Among the numerous exhibits of the museum, the most valuable is the collection of tapestries.  They depict scenes of battles involving the Portuguese in North Africa.  In the halls there is a rich collection of porcelain, dishes, interior items and furniture.  The largest room of the palace is the banquet hall.  Its ceiling, as in other rooms, is made of wood, and its design resembles the inverted bottom of the ship. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.europeosviajeros.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Palace of the Dukes of Braganca" class="if uuid-2962163" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962163.jpg"></div><p>  Interestingly, the premises of the second floor are used as the residence of the President of Portugal in the north of the state. </p><h2>  Piazza Largo da Oliveira </h2><p>  This is the central square of Guimaraes, named after an olive tree, which, according to the inhabitants of the town, is several hundred years old.  This is a quiet pedestrian square where you can plunge into the atmosphere of the city.  Here is the church of Nosa Senhora da Oliveira. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.visitportugal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Piazza Largo da Oliveira" class="if uuid-2962178" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962178.jpg"></div><h2>  Church of St. Francis </h2><p>  The main cathedral of the city has interesting architecture.  Outside, the building does not stand out and looks like an ordinary house built in the Gothic style of the 15th century.  Inside, the Church of St. Francis is considered the most beautiful in Guimaraes.  The decoration is made of gilded wood and traditional blue and white tiles, the paintings on the walls depict scenes from the life of the ministers of the Order of St. Francis. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.europeosviajeros.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Francis" class="if uuid-2962167" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962167.jpg"></div><h2>  Pe√±a Hill Park </h2><p>  You can get to this mountain park by cable car.  Many winding paths are laid between huge boulders scattered throughout the territory and covered with moss.  All this creates a unique fairytale atmosphere.  Numerous caves can be explored in the rocks. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allaboutportugal.pt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pe√±a Hill Park" class="if uuid-2962193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962193.jpg"></div><p>  A picturesque view of the city comes up from the height of the hill.  The whole park is created exclusively by nature. </p><div class="photo" data-original="boacamaboamesa.expresso.sapo.pt" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Pe√±a Hill Park" class="if uuid-2962207" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962207.jpg"></div><h2>  Guimaraes in Portugal: tourist reviews </h2><p>  According to the reviews of numerous tourists who have visited Guimaraes, this city does not leave a feeling of complete immersion in the past.  Guimaraes still seems to live in the Middle Ages. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imagenesorr.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Guimaraes City" class="if uuid-2962148" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111171/2962148.jpg"></div><p>  Many people say that the soul of the city is not primarily in historical monuments, but in its unique, well-preserved streets.  Travelers should move a little from the historical center and take a walk along the houses of local residents.  Photos of Guimaraes sights in Portugal will beautify any family album. </p><p>  Reading reviews of Guimaraes, one can often find a comparison with the set of a movie about the Middle Ages. </p>
