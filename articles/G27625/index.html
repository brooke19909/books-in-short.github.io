Ohrid, who will not let anyone get bored</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Many travelers who meet the <span>Balkan country,</span> declare their love to her.  This fairy tale gives all vacationers not subject to the influence of time Macedonia.  Ohrid, which is considered its main pearl, is a tourist Mecca, protected by UNESCO.  Travelers who have been here once will certainly return. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  The first mention of a settlement located on the shores of Lake Ohrid occurs in the 5th century, but scientists believe that people lived here much earlier.  The modern city was built on the site of the ancient Greek colony Lichnidos, captured by the Romans.  After a strong earthquake, it was completely rebuilt by the conquerors. </p><p>  At a time when Macedonia was part of the Byzantine Empire, Ohrid, which received this name in 879, was the main shopping center located on the Egnatius road leading to Constantinople.  In the IX century, the city, inhabited by Slavs, is part of the <span>Bulgarian kingdom,</span> and a century later it is recognized as its capital. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ohrid macedonia reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1541272.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  At the end of the 14th century, Ohrid was ruled by the Ottoman Empire, gradually losing its greatness.  In 1913, after the end of the First <span>Balkan War, the</span> settlement, where more than 15 thousand people live, leaves Serbia, and since 1991 it has been part of Macedonia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  When to hit the road? </h2><p>  Tourists who have visited a fabulously beautiful city admit that even a week is not enough to get acquainted with all its sights.  It is best to come here in May - June, but in July and August in Ohrid, located in the subtropical zone, it is too hot and the temperature exceeds 30 degrees. </p><p>  Located in the south-west of the country, its spiritual center lives off tourists, and at the height of the high season, prices bite here.  Those who want to save money, can be advised to go on an exciting journey in September - early October.  But even in winter, when the temperature fluctuates between 3-4 degrees, vacationers from different countries of the world rush to Ohrid. </p><h2>  The main spiritual center of the country </h2><p>  In a small and comfortable city, famous for its huge number of churches, there are important religious sights, which everyone who comes to the Republic of Macedonia must visit.  Ohrid, called "Slavic Jerusalem", has preserved many monuments of ancient Byzantine-style architecture. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Macedonia Ohrid" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1541260.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The current church of St. John the Evangelist, built in the 15th century, delights with its unique beauty.  The cross-shaped structure was rebuilt several times.  Decorative facades, Byzantine frescoes, a new iconostasis, portraits of Jesus Christ and John the Evangelist evoke a feeling of awe. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Church of St. Sophia is one of the most significant religious <span>attractions of Macedonia.</span>  The exact date of construction was not preserved in the manuscripts, it is only known that in the XI century an important monument was restored.  Over the centuries, the appearance of the church has changed.  After the Turkish capture of the city, it turned into a mosque, Orthodox frescoes were painted over, and a minaret appeared above the main dome, which distorted the harmonious architectural appearance of the attraction. </p><p>  And only in the 50s of the last century a large-scale reconstruction of the church was carried out, and it was given its original appearance.  Purified frescoes with portraits of the leaders of the patriarchate appeared in the central part of the religious building. </p><h2>  Ancient fortress </h2><p>  It is impossible not to mention the oldest historical attraction, which has become a popular tourist attraction.  The fortress of King Samuel is a massive building with 18 towers that rise one hundred meters above the city and the lake. </p><p>  The powerful citadel was repeatedly destroyed, but was immediately restored again.  <span>Ancient Macedonia is</span> incredibly proud of its calling card <span>.</span> </p><h2>  Ohrid: rest </h2><p>  I must say that the main natural attraction is <span>Lake Ohrid,</span> which received the name from the city.  The miraculous object is protected by UNESCO and is characterized by clear water, in which you can see the inhabitants of the bottom, listed in the Red Book.  The deepest lake in the Balkans, Ohrid (Macedonia) has retained its unique ecosystem.  Its beauty was admired by the ancient Greeks, Romans and Slavs. </p><p>  The border between Albania and Macedonia runs along the lake, and both states are sincerely proud of the landmark that appeared more than five million years ago as a result of geotectonic deflection.  In the south and north of the reservoir there are various centers, restaurants and other objects for tourists in a hurry to enjoy the soothing beauty of a natural pearl. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ohrid Lake Macedonia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1541271.jpg" width="600"></div>
