An egg stand is decorated with a red or yellow paper flower on the side. </p><p>  For Easter, with your own hands you can make a pot with natural grass.

    <p>  A good option is the craft from the inner tube remaining from toilet paper.  If you paint it, glue the ears, nose, bow, you can get a pretty funny egg stand for Easter.  With their own hands, even a preschooler can easily make it.  He will be terribly proud and pleased that he took part in such an important event - preparation for the meeting of the Resurrection of Christ. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Easter Bunny" with an egg on the back </h2><p>  Of course, there are other ideas for paper egg stands.  Using the described algorithm, you can make many interesting crafts on the holiday table.  For example, you can complicate the work by the fact that you will have to do not only the head of the rabbit, but the whole animal. </p><p>  To do this, a ring is glued or a cut-off part of a cardboard tube from toilet paper is taken, on which the animal's head is glued on the front.  She protrudes slightly above the upper cut. </p><p>  From below under the head, you need to glue the front paws.  They protrude from under the workpiece and lie on the table.  The back legs are also cut out of paper or cardboard.  Only they need to be fastened directly to the side of the workpiece, having shifted a little back. </p><p>  The tail is made from a piece of cotton and glued to the back.  So, it’s quite easy to make an egg stand with your own hands. </p><h2>  "Chickens" - bags with butterflies </h2><p>  Sometimes an original Easter stand with your own hands is made not for one, but for several eggs at once.  In this case, the option of "chicken-bags" is suitable. </p><p>  Strong enough <span>plastic bags</span> will imitate the chicks' tummies.  They should be folded krashenki and tie them tightly with beautiful large bows. </p>

    <p>  The bags are glued to the cardboard legs.  From the sides, wings are attached to them.  The head is made in the form of pompons from threads and tied to the top of the bags, hiding the place of attachment under the bow.  Glue button eyes and a paper beak onto the chicken head. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Such easter egg holders can be used in cases where the painted eggs act as decorations, rather than treats.  After all, no one wants to spoil the beauty created with their own hands.  Therefore, instead of real eggs, it is recommended to put imitation bags. </p><h2>  Box with colored eggs "Chickens" </h2><p>  From yellow cardboard, you can glue the box, attaching <span>red triangles</span> in the place where the lid is in contact with the main part <span>.</span>  They will mimic the chicken’s popping beak.  Paws are glued from below, wings on the sides, tail feathers on the back.  All these details are made of colored paper.  On the lid draw or attach eyes. </p>

    <p>  Inside the box, <span>colored eggs are laid,</span> which are removed as needed.  Instead of a chicken, you can make a chicken or cockerel.  And if you fantasize, then a cute rabbit can come out of an ordinary cardboard box. </p><p>  By the way, it is not necessary to glue the container yourself from scratch.

    <p>  And you can also weave the egg cups for Easter with your own hands from newspaper tubes.  The schemes for making crafts in this technique are different.  Usually they begin to weave with the design of a “braid”.  This is laying crosswise from six or more tubes. </p><p>  The next part is already woven round, making either a flat bottom, or slightly curved, rounded.  If the bottom is not planned to be separated from the walls, then the weaving algorithm is repeated until the end of the work.  So make plates, miniature baskets. </p>

    <p>  Cylindrical cup holders can be made without a bottom.  In this case, the master works according to the circular vertical weaving scheme.  Then the vertically arranged tubes are glued to the lower ring.  It is made either from cardboard, or from a finished tube. </p><p>  You can try and make a curly stand with a recess in the center, designed for Easter cake or curd Easter.  This is already more difficult, so you should turn to the master class in which step-by-step photos are given.  But with some patience and diligence, you can get a wonderful Easter stand for eggs and Easter from newspaper sheets. </p><h2>  Making salt dough </h2><p>  This modeling material is impossible to buy in handicraft stores.  But salty dough is easy to make at home.  It is enough to take the flour and small salt in equal weight proportions, mix in a bowl and, adding a little water, stir.  You should get a substance very similar to a steep dumpling dumpling. </p><p>  The difficulty here is that the specific gravity of salt is higher than that of flour.  It is easier to say this: if the ingredients are measured in volume, then to make the dough you need to take 2 times less salt.  That is, 200 ml of flour is used per 100 ml <span>of sodium chloride</span> .  Everyone knows that NaCl is a common cookware. </p>

    <h2>  Crafts for Easter from salt dough using a microwave </h2><p>  In this technique, you can make glasses for eggs, which are installed either on a round flat cake or on a leg. </p><p>  In both cases, a circle is first cut from the rolled formation.  Then, sharp corners form it at the edges.  Sometimes, when they plan to make a glass with a smooth edge, this stage of work is omitted.  Now you need to place the workpiece in the microwave for a minute, setting the defrost mode.  The egg that served as the template during sculpting should first be removed from the workpiece. </p><p>  Then form a stand and strengthen the bottom of the workpiece.  The baking process is repeated.  If the master detects cracks on the surface of the product during removal of the workpiece from the furnace, it covers them with a mass slightly moistened with water. </p><p>  The baking process should be done several times until the product acquires the required hardness.  Having achieved this, you can proceed to coloring the crafts. </p><p>  You can use watercolor or gouache to apply the ornament.  Although acrylic paints look very beautiful in the product.  After staining, it is recommended to cover the craft with clear varnish.  Even a means to fix the hair in this case will add shine to the product and make it more practical. </p><h2>  “Chicken” - egg stand <strong> </strong></h2><p>  A great idea would be to make a variety of figures from salty dough with rounded notches on the back.  It can be rabbits, chickens, hens. </p>

    <p>  A master class will help you learn the sculpting process, where a step-by-step detailed instruction in photographs is presented.  It should only be remembered that cardboard parts should be removed from billets before baking, as they can ignite even in a microwave oven. </p><h2>  Polymer clay and cold porcelain egg stands </h2><p>  Just as the <span>figures are made from salt dough,</span> they are also made from other materials.  Such can serve as polymer clay. </p><p>  This material is bought at children's handicraft stores.  During operation, you should only strictly follow the instructions that came with the kit. </p><p>  Cold porcelain is quite creative material today.  This material is easy to use and does not require baking.  Make it easy enough at home.  However, during operation, it should be remembered that during the hardening process, porcelain dries by almost a third.  Therefore, to make a recess for the egg should be "with an allowance" to reduce the volume. </p>

    <p>  To prepare the plastic mass, you need to mix 200 ml of corn starch, the same amount of PVA glue and 2 tablespoons of glycerin.  You can add a little baby cream.  Some masters recommend adding baking soda in the amount of 2 tablespoons to the mass for splendor.  But then, cracks may appear during the drying of the product. </p><p>  Do-it-yourself Easter egg holders will make the festive table original, beautiful and fabulous. </p>
