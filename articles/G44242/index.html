    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Kavkaz Hotel is characterized not only by positive aspects, but also by significant shortcomings.  Reviews of tourists contain a number of negative comments: </p><ul><li>  rather meager breakfast menu; </li><li>  some catering workers serve guests very leisurely; </li><li>  the lobby bar is open only in the evening; </li><li>  some maids are not very conscientious about cleaning the rooms; </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own adjacent territory, and therefore - there are no benches, no walking paths, or a playground; </li><li>  in the rooms, whose windows face the street, it is simply impossible to sleep from round-the-clock noise, which is heard even through tightly closed windows; </li><li>  on the site adjacent to the hotel there is a large pit with green foul-smelling water (there even frogs wound up); </li><li>  the hotel does not have its own beach, and on public beds and other equipment are very expensive (from 200 rubles per person); </li><li>  it was rather irrational to lay a light carpet in the room - it is very dirty, and apparently no one tried to clean it; </li><li>  in the rooms that are next to the restaurant, there is a buzz from the exhaust pipe; </li><li>  door jambs are located very low in interior doorways, which is inconvenient for tall people (you have to bend down all the time so as not to hit your head); </li><li>  very noisy air conditioning that keeps you awake at night (and turning it off is also not possible due to the extreme heat); </li><li>  hairdryer can be taken only on request at the reception; </li><li>  inflated transfer prices - it will be much cheaper to call a taxi; </li><li>  the TV shows only 9 channels (and those of poor quality); </li><li>  old and creaking baby cots; </li><li>  neither tables nor chairs are provided on the balconies; </li><li>  in the mornings in the lobby and some rooms of the hotel there is a strong smell of food from the restaurant; </li><li>  despite the fact that the furniture is quite new, it is already slightly worn; </li><li>  the staff does not respond in any way to guest comments on malfunctions and breakdowns in rooms and requests to eliminate them; </li><li>  Before laying out things in a closet, it is better to wipe it from the inside, otherwise there is a risk of staining your clothes. </li></ul><h2>  General impression </h2><p>  Tourists have long been fond of the Kavkaz Hotel in Adler.  Reviews note that its main advantage is its favorable location relative to the sea, urban infrastructure and tourist facilities.  The bay where the hotel is located is considered environmentally friendly, and the water in this area is the cleanest in the whole city. </p><p>  Speaking about the hotel itself, it is worth noting its novelty and attractive design.  Guests especially note the availability of an elevator, which is especially important for relaxing with young children and the elderly.  Nevertheless, the impression may be spoiled by the untidy adjacent territory, as well as the constant noise from the restaurant and neighboring establishments. </p>
