The suffocating heat was asleep, but the sea is still warm, and the weather pleases with the presence of sunny days.  This month's beach holiday is a great solution for families with children or the elderly.  Where to go to rest?  Of course, to Spain!  Indeed, in September the flow of Russian tourists traditionally decreases, which means that you can relax from your compatriots, and much cheaper than in the last months of summer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel esplendid" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34480/1989595.jpg" width="600"></div>

The only drawback was the interior of the rooms.  Despite the purity, it is made in the style of minimalism: simple and nondescript.  Therefore, it is very difficult to call such apartments cozy. </p><h2>  Talk about comfort </h2><p>  Each room at Hotel Esplendid (Spain) has a bathroom with a built-in shower and a furnished balcony.  They are also equipped with a TV, central air conditioning, hairdryer and safety deposit box.  Experienced travelers are advised to grab an adapter from the house to recharge gadgets, as the hotel provides it only for a fee.  Many rave reviews about the Esplendid Hotel were written about Russian-speaking staff.  Agree, this greatly facilitates the stay of our tourists.  In addition, the hotel provides its guests with luggage storage and, if necessary, the ability to order a taxi or rent a car. </p><h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  For younger guests, Hotel Esplendid offers a cot (on request), high chairs and a special menu.  On the territory of the hotel there is a children's pool, a playground, as well as a mini club with animators who will look after the child while the parents leave for excursions or do personal things. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="esplendid hotel 3 spain" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34480/1989558.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  If you intend to stay at this three-star hotel, do not forget to bring a beach towel, sun tanning products, as well as shower gels.  In the Mediterranean Sea, the water is salty, so after bathing it is recommended to take a shower so that the baby's skin (and yours too) does not undergo drying out and irritation. </p><h2>  Everyone to the beach! </h2><p>  All the beaches of the Costa Brava are municipal, and one of them is located just 500 meters from the Hotel Esplendid.  All hotel guests noted the convenient location and cleanliness of the area.  The beach will enchant lovers of ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù landscapes - like sharp teeth, rocks alternate with horseshoe-shaped bays.  The coast is guarded by long-legged guards in the form of pine-pines, and the sea air is so mixed with the smell of needles that it is sometimes difficult to understand whether you are in the forest or on the seashore. </p><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  Many tourists stay at this hotel to explore the local beauties.  And there is something to see here: </p><ul><li>  Water World Waterpark (7 km).  Due to the large number of different attractions, it is called the "city of entertainment."  For the most crazy tourists there is one of the highest towers for bungee jumping in the world (80 m).  For children, a separate island with slides and a pool is equipped. </li><li>  Tossa de Mar Fortress is for those who want to live a moment of history by touching medieval stones.  Be sure to walk along the narrow streets of the city, decorated with flowers.  According to travelers, these places with old residential buildings built in the style of traditional medieval architecture still retain their special flavor. </li></ul>

    <ul><li>  Gardens of St. Clotilde (4.7 km).  The area was designed on top of a cliff and is famous for its breathtaking views of the sea.  The park was created at the beginning of the 20th century and has been perfectly preserved to this day.  The forms, symmetry and filling of space accurately convey the image of the Renaissance.  In 1995, the Gardens of St. Clotilde were recognized as a national treasure of Catalonia.  If you want to bring with you not only a beautiful tan, but also photos, then you should definitely visit this place. </li></ul><h2>  Esplendid Hotel 3 *: guest reviews </h2><p>  The overall impression of the hotel, made by not the most sophisticated tourists, was positive.  The presence of two pools for many guests was the main attraction of the hotel.  The water in the indoor pool, according to guests, is very warm and has a relaxing atmosphere, especially since in the heat it is almost empty.  In the outdoor pool, the water temperature is slightly lower, so only those who want to refresh themselves in the sweltering heat go there.  In both reservoirs, the water is clean, the area around is equipped with sun loungers and ennobled by flowers and tropical plants.  In a word, tourists called this place a wonderful location for holding a siesta. </p><p>  But among the positive reviews, several nuances were found, which are worth mentioning: </p><ul><li>  Paid Wi-fi.  Despite the small fee (4 euros per hour of use), many guests considered this a drawback of the Esplendid Blanes Hotel 3 *. </li><li>  Despite the cleanliness of the rooms, they are not very comfortable and reminiscent of a hostel. </li><li>  The buffet is rich, but sometimes the quality of the food leaves much to be desired.  Some guests complained of sour juices in the apparatus. </li></ul>

    <p>  The rest of the Spanish hotel really liked our compatriots.  Judging by the reviews on the tourist forums, many of them want to settle in it during their next vacation. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Well, even if the Hotel Esplendid located in a quiet place and surrounded by greenery has only 3 * and does not impress guests with ostentation, it guarantees a relaxing stay, friendly Russian-speaking staff and has a special atmosphere inherent only to the spoiled Siesta of Spain.  After all, only here you can soak up the sun, sipping a cool cocktail, and enjoy the beautiful sound of Spanish from the lips of the emotional locals who also prefer to stay at this budget hotel. </p>
