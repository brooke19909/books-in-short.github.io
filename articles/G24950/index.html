Once it was a small town that was part of the Kazan and Astrakhan Khanates.  If it were not for the desire of the Russian Empire to expand its possessions to the Middle and Lower Volga region in order to have access to the Caspian Sea, the history of the region could develop according to a completely different scenario. </p><p>  Today the city of Astrakhan, whose sights have been perfectly preserved for 450 years, amazes travelers with its grandeur and beauty. </p><h2>  History of the city </h2><p>  The Russian history of the city began after Kazan fell in 1552 after the siege.  This decided the fate of the <span>Kazan Khanate, which had</span> lost its influence in this territory.  Astrakhan was taken in 1556, and this meant the end of the annexation of the Middle and Lower Volga to Russia. </p><p>  Due to the fact that the old location of the city was unsuccessful, since it was located on the steppes open on all sides, it was decided to build a new settlement on the left bank of the Volga on a high hill, which is a natural defense against raids. </p>

    <p>  Initially, the new city was built of wood and had an earthen rampart for protection, but since Ivan the Terrible was interested in a strong fortress in this territory, all funds were thrown here - people, money, materials. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The reason was the attack of the Crimean-Turkish troops in 1569, which was repelled, but showed the full significance of Astrakhan.  The construction of the new stone Kremlin marked the beginning of the construction of the city, which embodied the features of Orthodox settlements with all the diversity of nationalities that flocked here from central Russia. </p><p>  The construction of stone <span>Kremlin walls was</span> completed in 1589, and the construction of fortified towers was completed at the beginning of the XVII century.  In total, the fortress consisted of 8 towers, three of which were the entrances to the city from different roads. </p><p>  The thickness and power of the walls surprised everyone who entered the city.  Astrakhan, whose sights today begin with the Kremlin, has retained most of the buildings of that time.  The most significant buildings of the time were located behind the Kremlin walls - the arsenal, the cellar with gunpowder, the monastery, the tower of the local nobility and the church. </p><p>  Already in the first half of the 17th century, Astrakhan became a large city with a rapidly growing population, well-developed trade and crafts. </p><h2>  Kremlin </h2><p>  The construction of the Kremlin, begun under John the Terrible, was completed under the reign of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich in the Time of Troubles. </p><p>  Walls with a height of three to 9.5 meters and a thickness of up to three meters were an excellent defense against the creeps of the Crimean and Turkish Khanates to return to their former territory.  The main entrance to the city was the Prechistenskiye Gate, next to which the highest building of that time was located - the bell tower, which consisted of 4 tiers. </p>

    <p>  The oldest surviving since the construction of the Kremlin is Zhitnaya Tower, located on the south side.  Once in her yard there were buildings for storing supplies in case of a siege of the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The most powerful and reliably fortified tower was overlooking the Crimean roads and received the same name.  The raids by the Crimean Tatars were frequent, but the fortification always resisted them. </p><p>  Inside the Kremlin there were many military, civil and church buildings of that time, for example, the Assumption Cathedral. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  In place of the cathedral, which can be visited today, there were 2 churches at one time, one of which was dilapidated, since it was wooden, and the second became too small for a rapidly growing city. </p><p>  Built in 1710, the new cathedral of Astrakhan is a real masterpiece of architecture of that time.  The cathedral consists of 2 tiers, in the lower tombs are located.  The Georgian kings Vakhtang Six and Teymuraz II, as well as Metropolitan Joseph of Astrakhan the Holy Martyr and other representatives of the church hierarchy found their rest. </p>

    <p>  The upper part of the cathedral is a spacious and full of light temple with two tiers of windows.  If in 1702 he did not begin to sag the arch of the building, today the Assumption Cathedral would have one large dome.  Because of this incident, the talented architect from the Mineev‚Äôs serfs Dorofei changed the initial plan, and 5 domes were erected, which are today admired by city guests and local residents. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The consecration of the lower church was carried out in 1707, while in the upper one this event occurred only after the construction was completed in 1710. </p><p>  Being the main cathedral of the city for several centuries, it was badly damaged during the formation of Soviet power.  Only in 1992 he was transferred back to the church, and work began on its restoration.  Today it is an active cathedral, able to appear before the parishioners in all its pristine beauty. </p><h2>  Bishop's Compound </h2><p>  The city of Astrakhan is proud of many preserved architectural monuments.  Sights dating back to the time of the Kremlin‚Äôs construction have not survived to our time, but the Bishops‚Äôs Compound is a pleasant exception. </p><p>  The compound was located on the south side of the Assumption Cathedral and at the beginning of the XVII century consisted only of the bishop's house.  By 1677, real stone chambers were built near it, and in 1709 a new superstructure appeared, which included the Holy Cross Church of the Savior. </p><p>  After the bishop‚Äôs house was damaged by fire at the end of the 18th century, the 3rd floor was built in it, and in the 19th century another.  The Bishop‚Äôs Compound, as one of the oldest buildings in the city, is listed for reconstruction, according to the plans of which all later superstructures will be removed to restore the building to its original appearance. </p><h2>  Cyril Chapel </h2><p>  Another symbol of antiquity is the Cyril Chapel, located on the street.  Trediakovsky, 2 (Russia, Astrakhan).  The reason for its construction was a miracle revealed by the late rector of the Trinity Monastery. </p><p>  Cyril died in 1576 and was buried in the monastery, and a small wooden chapel was built over the grave.  It was built in violation of canonical Orthodox rules, since the entrance to it was not from the western, but from the eastern side. </p><p>  The remains of the first abbot of the monastery remained in its walls until 1677, but the image seen by the governor's wife and her servants, in which the elder Cyril stood on the tomb and illuminated the flame with a cross, saved Astrakhan from the fire. </p>

    <p>  In honor of this sign, the abbot‚Äôs remains were reburied near the monastery, and a stone chapel was erected above them according to all canonical rules.  In this form, she meets tourists and parishioners today. </p><h2>  White City </h2><p>  Historically, the districts of Astrakhan formed outside the walls of the Kremlin and consisted of several settlements. </p><p>  In 1631, residential and craft buildings, built on the eastern side of the fortress on a hillock, were surrounded by a powerful wall and began to be called the White City.  Although this area was twice as large as the Kremlin, it was clearly not enough for all the immigrants from Central Russia, so a new settlement called the Earth City appeared behind it.  The name is due to the fact that around the new areas an earthen rampart with wooden fortifications was built. </p><p>  The layout of the White City in modern Astrakhan has the same scheme as in the distant XVII century.  Of the buildings that have survived to this day, the Demidov Metochion and the Tent Tower, the only reminder of the Transfiguration Monastery, have survived.  Later buildings such as the houses of merchants from the East and mosques are also interesting. </p><p>  In addition to the old part, the city of Astrakhan has sights built at a later time, but which have become significant in the architectural ensemble of this place. </p><h2>  Puppet Theatre </h2><p>  Although the <span>Astrakhan Puppet Theater</span> is considered to be founded in 1986, the real house of artists and their young guests appeared after moving to the former possession of the merchant Bashkin in 1991. </p><p>  The two-story merchant building, built at the beginning of the 19th century, was bought in 1889 by the merchant Grigoryev and rebuilt.  It acquired its modern appearance only in 1910 after numerous additions.  Until 1917, it housed banks and expensive shops. </p>

    <p>  The magnificent building, which underwent reconstruction in the early 90s of the XX century, became suitable for showing theatrical performances.  The building of the puppet theater is included in the list of architectural monuments of federal significance. </p><h2>  Monument to Gabdulla Tukay </h2><p>  The national poet Gabdulla Tukai is the founder of classical Tatar literature. </p><p>  Tukai was born in Kazan in 1886, April 26, and died there from an illness in 1913, April 15, before he reached the age of twenty.

Reviews of tourists talk about one unique attraction, located 130 km from the city.  Here in 1965, excavations began, which opened the world to the capital of the Golden Horde, built by Batu in the middle of the XIII century. </p><p>  ‚ÄúSarai-Batu‚Äù became an open-air museum due to the fact that the film ‚ÄúHorde‚Äù (2011) was shot in it, after which the scenery remained as close as possible to the historical era of the Golden Horde. </p>
