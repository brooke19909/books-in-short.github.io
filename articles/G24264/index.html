Among them is the city of Yoshkar Olu, the capital of the Mari El Republic.  This unique city was founded in 1584, and since then many historical buildings have been erected on its territory, among which unique estates dating back to the 18th-19th centuries stand out.  The name of the city is translated as "Red City", an explanation can be found for this name, if we turn to historical events. </p><p>  Initially, the city was called Tsarevokokshaysk, since it was founded by Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich on the banks of the Malaya Kokshaga River, which is a left tributary of the Volga.  After the events of 18 years, in 1919, it was renamed Krasnokokshaysk and bore this name until 1927.  January 25, 1928 the city received the national name Yoshkar Ola.  Some also associate this name with the fact that you can see many red brick buildings in it. </p><p>  Today the city is attractive for tourists.  Easy to find <noindex>  <span>Yoshkar Ola hotels on the map</span> </noindex>  on the Internet and book one of them.  Often those who seek to visit Yoshkar Ola do just that.  Among the usual modern buildings in the city you can find many beautiful historical buildings worthy of admiration.  What is worth, for example, St. Nicholas Chapel, located on Assumption Street, or the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built not so long ago. </p><p>  The main attractions are the Tsarevokokshaysky Kremlin, the newest Kremlin in Russia.  It is made of red brick and was built in 2009.  It is also worth noting the monument to Tsar Fedor Ioannovich, located on the waterfront, the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, built on the site of the previously destroyed Cathedral.  The 12 Apostles Complex, which was built based on the Sheremetyev Castle and the Fountain Monument to the Orthodox patron saints of the family and marriage of Peter and Fevronia, is also worth a visit. </p><p>  Those who come with children will enjoy a trip to the Republican Puppet Theater, stylized as a medieval castle.  If you want to feel like in Europe, go to the Embankment of Bruges, the buildings on which are built in a typical Danish style.  Ministries and departments are located here, and numerous guests like to walk along the promenade.  This is only part of the attractions of the "Red City".  In fact, there are many more and they are all worthy of being seen. </p></div></article>
