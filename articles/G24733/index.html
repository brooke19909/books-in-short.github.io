Deposits are the easiest investment format.  All that is required of a person is to choose a suitable financial partner in the person of a large bank, take his savings and put into his account.  At the end of the cooperation period, the amount of capital will be increased.  The only question that needs to be solved on the eve of making a deposit is to determine what the most profitable deposit to the bank is at the moment. </p><h2>  General issues </h2>

    <p>  Focusing on the term of capital placement on the bank account, you can distinguish term deposits and demand deposits.  The latter format of programs provides the ability to withdraw funds from the account at any convenient time, but this advantage is to the detriment of the size of the interest rate.  It, as a rule, will be minimal among all offers available on the market.  We will indent and focus on the fact that the most profitable contribution to the bank involves the presence of large capital and a long term partnership with a financial institution.  Small deposits for short periods cannot provide such a percentage of profitability.  You should always take into account the rule: the more extensive access a bank customer has to his savings, the less he will have a level of profitability.  The most profitable are deposits for a period of one year or more. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The most profitable deposit formats </h2><p>  The most profitable deposits in banks can be both savings and savings.  <span>Savings deposits</span> cannot be replenished, and the initially assigned interest will be charged on the initial amount of capital.  The second format of the program allows replenishment of the deposit, while the percentage will be calculated on the amount that will be on the account at a certain point in time. </p>

    <p>  The maximum increase in funds on the deposit guarantees a <span>compound interest,</span> also known as capitalization.  Its essence lies in the fact that each month the base amount deposited on a deposit is recalculated taking into account interest, and in the subsequent period they are accrued not only on the size of the main deposit, but also on pre-accrued interest.  The process is repeated constantly until the term of the deposit expires. </p><h2>  Estimated, indexed and OMS contributions </h2><p>  For some categories of customers, profitable deposits in St. Petersburg banks and other cities are settlement.  The format of partnership with the bank provides for the possibility of topping up an account.  The client receives a debit card.  A prerequisite is the presence of the amount agreed upon when signing the partnership agreement on the account.  Another interesting deposit option is a <span>structured product.</span>  It can bring profitability several orders of magnitude higher than standard programs.  This category of investment is considered to be highly risky, but with a successful combination of factors, the yield on the deposit can reach up to 20% in a few months.  Another interesting and unconventional option to increase your funds is OMS (or depersonalized metal accounts).  They can be very highly profitable, and in some situations the most profitable.  Banks do not pay interest on such deposits, but a jump in the price of a precious metal in the international market during the deposit can provide a yield of up to 100% and higher.  There is already how lucky. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  What is the most profitable contribution, or to each his own </h2><p>  In order to clearly calculate what the most profitable contribution to the bank can be made, you need to build on your needs and goals.  Different people will have different preferences depending on their priorities.  For example, compulsory medical insurance will be an ideal solution for those who work for the future.  Gold, being an exhaustible resource, constantly rises in price, and in the next few years its price can not only double, but also triple.  The probable return is simply not comparable with typical deposits.  People who plan to make the purchase of expensive equipment will appreciate the deposits with replenishment, as they will have the opportunity not only to save some of the money, but also get a percentage on them.  Simple accumulation of capital will bring maximum benefits only with the capitalization of interest. </p><h2>  Interest rate - maximum attention </h2><p>  Profitable deposits with banks in Moscow and other cities are not those for which the maximum interest rate is offered.  It is important to know that the Central Bank of the Russian Federation tightly controls this indicator, maintaining it at a more or less stable level.  If a financial institution offers a rate several orders of magnitude higher than the average on the financial market, this is a signal that the financial institution has problems with liquidity.  The interim administration is introduced into those institutions that try to attract investors with atypically advantageous offers. </p>

    <h2>  Why is it worth giving up the biggest bet on the market? </h2><p>  Having chosen the highest possible deposit rate in the market, you can never see your money at all.  Big bets can be offered by small banks that are just building up their customer base.  The main thing here is not to miss and invest in an institution whose existence is in question.  After studying the issue of which banks have profitable deposits, it becomes clear that it is better to agree on the average interest rate in an average commercial bank, optimizing the ratio of profitability and risk.  The optimal amount of charges in 2015 varies from 10% to 12%. </p><h2>  Deposit currency matters </h2>

    <p>  The profitability of a particular deposit depends on its currency.  According to experts, you need to invest in the currency in which you plan to spend it.  Otherwise, as a result of rate hikes, you can not only lose interest, but also lose some of the funds.  For example, you can take recent depositors who have chosen the most profitable deposits in Moscow banks in rubles, planning to make a purchase later in time in dollars.  The choice of programs was made taking into account the fact that deposits in national currency came with a higher percentage.  As a result, the abnormal jump in the exchange rate over the past six months has not only ‚Äúeaten up‚Äù all income, but also most of the capital.  In order to return the lost in dollar terms, you need to make investments at 50% per annum, which is simply impossible for the domestic financial market.  The most reliable and profitable deposit is considered to be in dollars, since the currency is a reserve one.  Even with the fluctuation of the exchange rate, it is growing stronger, and against the backdrop of recent economic events there is practically no chance of its decline. </p>

    <h2>  What deposit can be classified as profitable? </h2><p>  Today, amid fierce competition in the financial segment, many banks offer profitable interest on deposits to all their customers.  Often, at a high rate, additional fees or harsh partnership conditions may be hidden.  Some financial institutions may completely deprive interest, and even impose a penalty for premature termination of the contract.  This probability is also worth considering.  Profitable <span>deposits in St. Petersburg banks</span> should be flexible.  Welcome: the choice of currency and several periods of deposit storage, the calculation of compound interest and uncommissioned partial withdrawal of funds from the account.  In order for the decision to be correct and the most profitable deposit to be selected, you need to go to the bank after carefully studying all the information. </p>
