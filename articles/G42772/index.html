It is difficult to argue with this, given the fact that over the past two decades, interest in events that took place several centuries ago has grown many times.  And archives help to shed light on many secrets of historical eras, thanks to which the picture of the past becomes as complete as possible.  But is there a person in our country who is the main custodian of the ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù of Russian history.  Of course, yes.  Over the past twenty-four years, he was the historian Sergei Mironenko.  It was he who managed the State Archive of Russia.  Being the author of a number of scientific monographs devoted to historiography, over the years of service in the status of ‚Äúchief archivist,‚Äù he developed his own point of view on certain events of the past, and often it has a radical color. </p><p>  Naturally, Sergey Vladimirovich Mironenko, who believes, for example, that the execution of Polish officers in Katyn was organized not by the fascist invaders, but by the Soviet "Chekists", is subjected to fierce criticism from some members of the public. </p>

    <p>  One way or another, but the former archivist of the country is not inclined to change his views on domestic history. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Curriculum Vitae </h2><p>  Mironenko Sergey Vladimirovich - a native of the city of Moscow.  He was born on March 4, 1951.  The mother of the future scientist worked as a physician, and his father, being a military pensioner, was fond of history and even taught it to students.  Sergei's interest in this science arose as a teenager.  He wanted to study the past of the country, and he was more interested in the pre-revolutionary period of Russia, while the young man did not want to delve into the history of the USSR. </p><h2>  Years of study </h2><p>  Naturally, having received a certificate of maturity, Mironenko Sergey Vladimirovich applied for the history department of Moscow State University. </p>

    <p>  It was not easy to do: preference was given to retired soldiers, representatives of the working class, applicants with "profile" recommendations ... Sergey had a good chance of admission, thanks to the fact that he had a "gold medal" in his hands, so he had to pass only one exam - history.  And he passed it by five points.  At first, learning was difficult for him: the level of knowledge was completely different than at school, but after some time Sergey Vladimirovich Mironenko, whose biography is not known to everyone, became involved in the educational process. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Career in science </h2><p>  Having received a diploma of a historian in 1973, the young man successfully passes exams to graduate school.  After graduating from it, Sergei Vladimirovich hardly finds a job at the Institute of History of the USSR at the USSR Academy of Sciences.  The fact is that there were simply no bets.  Within the walls of this educational institution, he gets acquainted with eminent scientists who have made a huge contribution to the development of Russian historiography.  After talking with them, Mironenko sits down for the candidate, and after - for the doctoral.  He successfully defends both dissertations.  In addition, he writes scientific monographs, publications, and articles. </p>

As he himself later says, he just got bored going there.  No, he did not lose interest in science, just by that time prominent scholars-historians who for him were a real "light" had passed away.  And the beginning of a new decade was for Mironenko a certain stage in rethinking life. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Teacher and expert </h2><p>  After parting with the Institute of History, the scientist continued to maintain contact with the native history department of Moscow State University.  Sergei Vladimirovich enjoyed lecturing to students, and after some time he was even offered to head the department of Russian history of the 19‚Äì20 centuries. </p><p>  In the first half of the 90s, Mironenko was the host of the television program Documents and Fates (ORT), and in the early 2000s he was invited as an expert to the series Archive Data (RTR). </p>

    <p>  On the channel ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù he was the host of the projects ‚ÄúDocumentary History‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Complicated History‚Äù. </p><h2>  Archive </h2><p>  In 1992, when the power had already changed in the country, Sergey Vladimirovich began to work in the archival service and in the past even managed to work a bit as an employee of the archive of the General Department of the CPSU.  In the spring of 1992, he became the country's chief archivist.  In this position, he will work until 2016.  Some are inclined to believe that a graduate of the History Department of SSU could continue to work in the same capacity, if not for his odious views on some events of the past. </p><h2>  Minister of Culture against a similar interpretation </h2><p>  A certain <span>public outcry was</span> caused by the statement that the historian made at the World Congress of Russian Press, held in Moscow in 2015.  What did Sergey Vladimirovich Mironenko say?  Children born in the era of the USSR, in his opinion, in a patriotic sense should not have been brought up on the ‚Äúfamous‚Äù feat of 28 Panfilov‚Äôs.  Why? </p>

    <p>  Yes, because there was no feat.  Say, they did not stop 50 fascist tanks.  And the legendary slogan: ‚ÄúRussia is great, but nowhere to retreat - Moscow is behind!‚Äù, Attributed to political instructor Klochkov, is just an artistic fiction born of the secretary of the newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda Alexander Krivitsky.  And the author of the feat of 28 Panfilov‚Äôs is just him.  The archivist substantiated his position with a document signed by the chief <span>military prosecutor</span> Afanasyev. </p><p>  The historian‚Äôs point of view was criticized by the head of the Ministry of Culture, <span>Vladimir Medinsky.</span>  The official advised the archivist not to ‚Äúlook for‚Äù inconsistencies in historical events, but to engage in his immediate duties.  In turn, Sergey Vladimirovich countered by the fact that he was not going to belittle the role of Panfilov‚Äôs division in the Great Patriotic War.  Its really hard to overestimate.  Naturally, if it were not for Panfilov with the soldiers, it is unlikely that we could firmly defend Moscow.  The historian only claims that there was no feat precisely 28 people.  He very much doubts that such a small number of soldiers, who had grenades and rifles with them, could disable 18 enemy tanks.  The entire division fell on the battlefield, so you can not exceed the role of some soldiers and belittle the importance of others. </p><p>  The archivist added that those who try to accuse him of anti-patriotism, let them think better about what real patriotism is. </p><h2>  Other controversial moments in the story </h2><p>  Also, Mironenko Sergey, whose biography is of particular interest to historians, shared his thoughts with the public about the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.  The historian insists that this document should be called the "Stalin-Hitler Pact."  At the same time, Mironenko regarded his signing by the ‚Äúleader of the peoples‚Äù as a crime, since the document weakened the strategic position of the USSR. </p>

    <p>  Sergey Vladimirovich also called into question some events concerning the Great October Revolution.  He believes that the coup in tsarist Russia, Vladimir Ulyanov, did not necessarily commit to the money of Germany.  The historian positioned the leader of the revolution as a man who was ready to use any methods to achieve his goal.  In other words, if financial assistance in overthrowing the regime would be offered to Ulyanov, for example, by the ‚ÄúAustrian court‚Äù or ‚Äúthe British kingdom‚Äù (which cannot be denied), then he would not disdain it. </p><p>  Naturally, such an odious interpretation of historical events could not remain without the attention of the press.  Suddenly, Mironenko Sergey Vladimirovich was in the center of media attention.  The photo of the historian immediately fell on the pages of the capital's newspapers and magazines. </p><h2>  Leaving a responsible post </h2><p>  In 2016, the historian became a member of the Higher Attestation Commission of the Russian Federation (Federal Archival Agency).  In addition, he is a member of the certification commission under the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia, and is a member of the Heraldic Council under the President of Russia.  But in the spring of 2016, Mironenko had to leave the post of head of the State Archive due to his reaching the maximum retirement age.  But the historian remained in the above institution as a scientific adviser. </p>

    <p>  We can safely say that Sergey Vladimirovich Mironenko is also happy in his personal life.  The historian's family is his wife, Maria Pavlovna, who, like him, is studying the past. </p><h2>  Regalia and rewards </h2><p>  Over the years of his professional career, the scientist has received several prestigious awards, including the ‚ÄúHonorary Archivist‚Äù badge, the honorary badge of the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, the distinction ‚ÄúFor Merits in Strengthening Cooperation with the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation‚Äù, and the <span>Order of Honor.</span> </p>
