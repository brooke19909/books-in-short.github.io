Who is this man?  The relationship and interdependence of what objective reality did he describe?  The astronomer, mathematician, theologian, philosopher, the smartest man of his time, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) discovered the laws of motion of the planets of the solar system. </p><h2>  The beginning of the way </h2><p>  <span>Johannes Kepler, a</span> native of Weil der Stadt (Germany), came to this world in December 1571.  A weak, visually impaired child overcame everything in order to win this life.  The boy‚Äôs studies began in Leonberg, where his family moved.  Later, he moved to an institution of advanced type - the Latin school, to learn the basics of the language, which he intended to use in future publications. </p>

    <p>  In <span>1589 he</span> graduated from the school at the Maulbronn monastery in the town of Adelburg.  In 1591 he entered the university in T√ºbingen.  An effective educational system was created by the dukes in the wake of the introduction of Lutheranism.  With the help of grants and scholarships for the poor, authorities tried to provide universities with applicants, from whom it was possible to educate well-educated clergymen who could defend the new faith in times of raging religious debate. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  During his stay at the school, Kepler fell under the influence of astronomy professor Michael Mestlin.  The latter secretly shared the views of Copernicus regarding the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe heliocentric (Sun in the center) of the Universe, although he taught students "according to Ptolemy" (Earth in the center).  A deep knowledge of the ideas of the Polish scientist aroused great interest in astronomy in Kepler.  So the theory of Copernicus appeared another supporter, who sought to personally understand the laws of planetary motion around the sun. </p><h2>  The solar system is a work of art </h2><p>  Oddly enough, the one who subsequently discovered the laws of planetary motion did not consider himself an astronomer by vocation.  Throughout his life, Kepler believed that the solar system - a work of art, filled with mystical phenomena, dreamed of becoming a priest.  The astronomer explained his interest in the theory of Copernicus by the fact that before drawing conclusions from his own research, he must study different opinions. </p>

    <p>  Nevertheless, university professors spoke of Kepler as a student with an excellent mind.  In 1591, having received a master's degree, the scientist continued his research in the field of theology.  When they were close to completion, it became known that a professor of mathematics had died at a Lutheran school in Graz.  The University of T√ºbingen recommended taking a talented graduate in every respect.  So, forgive the laws of planetary motion? </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  In the name of God </h2><p>  Johann, 22, reluctantly abandoned his original calling as a priest, but nevertheless set to work as a mathematics teacher in Graz.  While giving lectures in his class, the novice teacher depicted on the blackboard some geometric figures with the participation of concentric circles and triangles.  And suddenly he was struck by the idea that such figures reflect a certain fixed ratio between the sizes of two circles, provided that the triangle is equilateral.  And what is the ratio of sizes on the area between the two circles?  The thought process was gaining momentum. </p><p>  A year later, an unusual theologian published his first work ‚ÄúThe Secret of the Universe‚Äù (1596).  In it, he set out his creative views on the secrets of the universe, reinforced by religious beliefs. </p>

    <p>  The one who discovered the laws of planetary motion did this in the name of God.  Revealing the mathematical plan of the Universe, the researcher came to the conclusion: six planets are enclosed in spheres, between which five <span>regular polyhedra</span> fit <span>.</span>  Of course, the version was based on the ‚Äúfact‚Äù that there are only 6 celestial bodies.  Around the Earth‚Äôs orbit, Kepler outlined a perfect dodecahedron and a sphere touching the orbit of Mars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Perfect Polyhedrons </h2><p>  Around the region of Mars, the scientist depicted a tetrahedron and a sphere adjacent to the orbit of Jupiter.  The sphere of Venus perfectly fit into the icosahedron in the orbital sphere of the Earth.  Using the remaining types of perfect polyhedra, the same was done with the rest.  Amazingly, the ratios of neighboring planetary orbits represented in the nesting model of the Kepler spheres coincided with the calculations of Copernicus. </p><p>  Discovering the laws of planetary motion, a priest with a mathematical mind relied primarily on divine inspiration.  He had no real basis for argument.  The significance of the treatise ‚ÄúSecrets of the Universe‚Äù lies in the fact that this was the first decisive step towards the recognition of the heliocentric <span>system of the world</span> set forth by Copernicus. </p><h2>  Assumptions Against High Accuracy </h2><p>  In September 1598, Protestants in Graz, including Kepler, were driven out of the city by Catholic rulers.  Although Johann was allowed to return, the situation remained very tense.  In search of support, he turned to Tycho Brahe, a mathematician and astronomer at the court of Emperor Rudolph II.  The scientist was known for his impressive collection of planetary observations. </p>

    <p>  He knew about the work "The Secret of the Universe."  But when in 1600 its creator arrived at the Tycho Observatory, located outside the city of Prague, Braga, engaged in high-precision (at that time) research, greeted him as the author of a specific work, but not as his colleague.  The confrontation between them continued until the death of the Danish astrologer, which occurred a year later.  After the rival left for another world, Kepler was entrusted with guarding the treasury of his observations.  They greatly helped the researcher to become the one who discovered the laws of planetary motion around the sun. </p><h2>  Way of mars </h2><p>  Brahe‚Äôs latest research on creating a planetary motion table has not been completed.  All hopes were pinned on the successor.  He was appointed an imperial mathematician.  Despite the tense relationship with his late colleague, Kepler was free to pursue his own interests in astronomy.  He decided to continue his observations of Mars and describe his own vision of the orbit of this planet. </p><p>  Johann was sure: having opened a difficult Martian path, it is possible to uncover the paths of movement of all other "wanderers of the Universe."  Contrary to popular belief, he did not just use Brahe's observations to select a geometric figure that fits the description.  Yesterday's theologian directed efforts to discover the physical theory of motion of ‚Äúsisters living in an airless space‚Äù from which their orbits can be derived.  After the titanic research work, three laws of planetary motion appeared. </p><h2>  First law </h2><p>  <em>I. The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun in one of the tricks.</em> </p><p>  The law of planetary motion in the solar system has established that planets move in an ellipse.  It appeared after eight years of calculations using a base compiled by Tycho Brahe based on observations of the planetary motion of the Star of Mars.  Johann called his work ‚ÄúNew Astronomy‚Äù. </p>

    <p>  So, according to the first Kepler‚Äôs Law, any ellipse has two geometric points called foci (focus in the singular).  The total distance from the planet to each of the foci is always summed the same, regardless of where the planet is in the way of its movement.  The importance of the discovery is that the assumption that the orbits are not ideal circles (as in geocentric theory) brought people closer to a more accurate and clear understanding of the picture of the world. </p><h2>  Second law </h2><p>  <em>II.</em>  <em>The line connecting the planet with the Sun (radius vector) overcomes equal areas at equal intervals of time, while the planet moves around an ellipse.</em> </p><p>  That is, at any time period, for example, after 30 days, the planet overcomes the same area, regardless of what period you choose.  It moves faster as it approaches the Sun and slower as it moves away, but it moves at a constantly changing speed as it moves around its orbit.  The most ‚Äúnimble‚Äù movement is observed in perihelion (the point closest to the Sun) and the most ‚Äúpower‚Äù in aphelion (the point farthest from the Sun).  So judged the one who discovered the laws of planetary motion. </p><h2>  Third law </h2><p>  <em>III.</em>  <em>The square of the total period of orbit (T) is proportional to the cube of the average distance from the planet to the Sun (R).</em> </p>

    <p>  This principle is sometimes called the law of harmony.  It compares the orbital period of time and the radius of the orbits of the planets.  The essence of Kepler‚Äôs discovery is as follows: the ratio of the squares of the periods of motion and the cubes of the average distances from the Sun is the same for each planet. </p><p>  Again, the laws of motion <span>of the Kepler planets</span> were based on lengthy serious observations and mathematically processed.  Reflecting patterns, they did not reveal the conditioning of the phenomena.  Later, the famous discoverer of the law of gravitation, Newton proved that the solution was hidden in the physical property of bodies attracted to each other. </p><h2>  The shadow of my body is here </h2><p>  Despite his success, Kepler constantly suffered from financial troubles, lack of time for research, moving to find places where his religious beliefs were tolerant.  Several times he tried to get a teaching position in T√ºbingen, but was perceived as a traitor, a Protestant, and was refused. </p><p>  Johannes Kepler died on November 15, 1630 from an attack of acute fever.  He was buried in the Protestant cemetery.  In the epitaph, his legitimate son wrote: ‚ÄúI used to measure heaven.  Now I have to measure the shadows of the Earth.  Despite the fact that my soul is in heaven, the shadow of my body lies here. ‚Äù </p>

    <p>  Yes, initially, in the spirit of medieval concepts, the scientist believed that the planets move because they have souls, this is living magic, and not just lumps of matter.  He later realized that the scientific approach is more justified.  Well, the priest and astronomer, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, honestly walked the path of insight.  But we admit to ourselves: sometimes it seems that there is so much mysticism in the scientific universe through and through! </p>
