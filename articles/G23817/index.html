The bars poured beer of excellent quality.  Traditional drinks (fig vodka and date liquor) are for everybody. </p><p>  An assortment of fruits and vegetables is always available.  Especially delicious plums, peaches, grapes, pomegranates and dates.  Olives and olives are always available. </p><p>  Seafood often serves shrimp and squid.  But the main gastronomic advantage of the El Mouradi Club Selima 3 * hotel is unrealistically delicious ice cream and cream cakes.  Lose weight just does not work. </p><h2>  Beach vacation </h2>
