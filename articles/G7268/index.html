Rose - a flower of love</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Rose is a universal flower that is given to both women and men.  <span>This is a sensual</span> flower that reveals your nature.  With the help of roses you can show your sympathy for a person, your passionate impulses and tenderness.  A proud and beautiful rose is magnificent in any form, even in paper ... </p><p>  Do-it-yourself roses are often used to design solemn halls.  Artificial roses are made from different materials (fabric, plastic, etc.), but the simplest and most affordable is paper.  How to make an <span>origami rose</span> so that it looks like a real one?  We will definitely tell you about it. </p><p>  Many are convinced that the origami technique is incredibly complex and inaccessible to master, in fact, this is not so.  No special skills and talent are required to create such a work of art.  The process of creating origami <span>from paper "Rose" is</span> not only simple, but also exciting. </p><p>  To begin with, we will figure out which paper roses will turn out more beautiful.  For example, corrugated and crepe roses are surprisingly similar to real roses.  The paper is very soft and flexible, so in the process of creating the master will not have problems with the material.  Also, roses can be made from such an affordable material as a napkin.  Surely you have seen such masterpieces decorating a table in restaurants.  Even from plain paper for the printer, you can create a magnificent beauty product. </p><p>  Origami from Rosa paper was designed by Toshikazu Kawasaki.  For the first time about the art of origami in China became known in 105 AD, but it gained its popularity only in Japan, closer to the 10th century.  This <span>origami</span> rose <span>flower</span> is a simplified version of the famous Chinese rose.  The imitation of a slightly opened bud attracts attention and has an easy technique.  Any newbie can easily master a similar theory. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the manufacture we need: paper in the form of a square 15 * 15. </p><p>  Lay the material face down, bend in half horizontally, unfold the sheet.  The fold line should be exactly in the middle.  Then we fold the paper so that we get 16 equal squares.  Divide the resulting workpiece diagonally.  Then we determine the center of the future flower.  We bend the leaf in half, then at the place of the bend we fold upwards by 1/3 of the division of a small square (in fact, the division should be less than 1/3).  We do the same with the vertical bend line.  We also produce bends of diagonals.  The second stage of creating origami from paper is a rose no less exciting.  We bend the sheet along the center lines and mark the square in the center.  Now, with the help of auxiliary lines, we must bend the paper so that we get a small volume square in the center.  To create the volume of a flower, we need to combine the torsion bends.  There are 13 folds in the flower. Be sure to align all the bends so that the flower does not open and keep its shape.  We bend the edges from one side inward to get a full bud.  You can twist and straighten the petals with a cotton swab.  Thus, with the help of nesting and torsion, we get an origami rose flower.  If you men decide to surprise your lady, give her a million paper roses.  They will not only never fade, but will remain in the girl‚Äôs memory as the most original gift!  In addition, such a present will not affect your financial situation. </p><p>  In fact, such a technique is quite simple if you use photo and video materials for training.  Masters of paperwork, inspired by the work of oriental experts, are able to make not only banal origami from paper.  A rose or a frog from improvised materials, even real architectural ensembles and amazing works are within the power of professionals in their field. </p>
