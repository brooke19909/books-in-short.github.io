Spartak Square is the Third Ring district in Moscow. </p><p>  Nearby Streets: </p><ul><li>  Lane of the same name; </li><li>  Perevedenovsky lane and street with the same name; </li><li>  the railway line along which the Rusakovskaya overpass passes through the line of the Kazan direction. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="fotki.yandex.ru" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spartak Square, Moscow" class="if uuid-2238854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2238854.jpg"></div><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  Until 1919, the square was called Gavrikov Square and belonged to the Basmannaya settlement.  The name was given in honor of one of the capital's homeowners. </p><p>  The new name - Spartak Square - was given in honor of the revolutionary organization Spartak, which began its activities in 1916.  In those days, the street was the "core" of Marxist ideology.  Later, almost all members of this organization became representatives of the Communist Party in Germany.  Today, almost the entire area is occupied by railroad tracks, the rest - by sidewalks. </p><p>  Some 100 years ago, Spartak Square was large, paved with cobblestones.  The whole street was surrounded by tenement houses and offices.  Here Perevedenovsky forest yard was located.  After the appearance of steam locomotives, train beeps are already heard on the square, and in 1894 an elevator was erected (Spartakovsky Lane, a modern business center).  In fact, the forest yard is turning into a bread yard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="oldmos.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Moscow region - Spartakovskaya square" class="if uuid-2238845" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2238845.jpg"></div><h2>  Building </h2><p>  In addition to railways and sidewalks, a branch of the Moscow Railway, a freight station, enter the square.  Also, the drama theater under an interesting name is Modern (located in the former building of the Moscow Bread Exchange) and the Academic Symphony Orchestra, the administration of MMK-Trans, the Wedding Fashion Center and other administrative and municipal institutions. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.yamoskva.com" data-author=":  , "><img itemprop="image" alt="Spartak Square, Moscow" class="if uuid-2238820" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2238820.jpg"></div><h2>  Theatre of Drama </h2><p>  The main attraction of Spartak Square is a white-stone mansion.  In the old days, the Bread Exchange was located here, and the building itself was erected in 1911.  The architect of the building was Capitol Dulin.  Some elements on the facade of the walls have remained to this day. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the building was given under the House of Pioneers.  Immediately after the revolution, the institution was very pathetically named - the House of Communist Education, and already in 1935 it was renamed the Bauman Children's House of Culture.  The institution had many circles.  Here studied Lev Durov and Rolan Bykov.  But already in 1982, the Palace of Pioneers moved to a new building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Five years later, the building is occupied by a theater called Studio Theater on Spartakovskaya, which was created by <span>Svetlana Vragova.</span>  A little later, in 1994, the theater was already called Modern.  For some time he puts on quite successful productions.  However, time already requires a new attitude to theatrical productions, and in 2016 the director changes, who radically alters the repertoire and prefers modern drama.  The name is losing the prefix "b", and while theater tickets are snapped up. </p><p>  You can‚Äôt come here in sneakers and with a backpack, this applies even to media representatives.  Even the calls in the theater are copyright based on Dashkevich‚Äôs music.  Now the scene is perfectly visible from anywhere in the hall.  In the former grain warehouse, it is planned to erect a transformer scene for events. </p><h2>  Symphony Orchestra </h2><p>  The Basmanny District of Moscow, Spartakovskaya Square and the Academic Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Kogan P. It would seem that they have in common?  The first is the address.  The second is located in 1/2 house and was founded in 1943 - it is practically the oldest in the whole country. </p><p>  The first conductor of the orchestra was Leo Steinberg, but he died in 1945.  Then there were a few other well-known team leaders.  In 1989, Pavel Kogan became the main conductor, who practically breathed new life into the orchestra. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.photo-moskva.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="metro Spartakovskaya square, Moscow" class="if uuid-2238873" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2238873.jpg"></div><h2>  Subway station </h2><p>  Spartak Square in Moscow is closest to the Baumanskaya metro station.  It is located between the "Electrozavodskaya" and "Kursk", assigned to the Arbat-Pokrovskaya line.  The station was launched in 1944, and received the name in honor of the Bolshevik Bauman N.E. Although the project had two more variants of the name: </p><ul><li>  "Spartak"; </li><li>  "Walk around." </li></ul><p>  And they wanted to design the station itself in the ancient Greek style, with antique sculptures.  We can say that the project was practically put into practice, but instead of antique figures and gladiators, statues of contemporaries were erected. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.7776644" data-lng="37.67981110000005" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="15"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/3/5/1/351.png"></div><h2>  How to get there by car </h2><p>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSpartakovskaya Square, you should go to the alley of the same name, provided that the car moves along the inner side of the ring.  If you go along the outer side of the ring, the road will lead directly to Perevedenovsky Lane.  Coordinates: 55 ¬∞ 46'37 '' s.  w.  and 37 ¬∞ 40'50 '' in.  d. </p>
