This is a kind of world that you can plunge into during your vacation.  This country is located in the heart of the continent of Eurasia, south of the Ural Mountains.  The local culture is very reminiscent of Russian, but has its own unique shades.  Here, ancient oriental traditions and new trends intertwine.  Free steppes, huge forests, rivers and lakes - all this is in Kazakhstan.  Today travel agencies offer hobby routes, including eco-tours, hunting, fishing, treatment and mountain climbing. </p>

    <h2>  Northern Kazakhstan </h2><p>  It is this part of the country that the president chose to build the luxurious capital of Astana.  Fans of modern architecture will enjoy strolling through the beautiful young city.  But not only this is famous for Northern Kazakhstan.  Rest here you will remember for a lifetime ... </p><p>  The main rivers are the Irtysh and its tributaries, Yesil and Tobol.  The climate is sharply continental, in summer the temperature is more moderate than in other regions, and winters are much colder.  The land is rich in coniferous forests, the mountains of Kokshetau are indestructible, lakes and rivers beckon with their blueness, and the natural resources of the Kurgaldzhinsky nature reserve provide an opportunity to join the bosom of pristine nature.  What is worth only rest in Borovoy!  Kazakhstan truly knows how to surprise. </p>

    <h2>  Pavlodar region </h2><p>  Here is the national natural park “Bayanaul”.  It is a kind of oasis located in the center of the steppe: a number of picturesque lakes are surrounded by interesting, “pancake” rocks.  Low, decorated with small groves of Karelian pine, which does not grow anywhere else in the country, they are the best suited for leisurely family walks.  There are several camp sites on the shores of the lakes, there are camping sites. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  North Kazakhstan region </h2><p>  To enjoy the beauty of pristine nature, many tourists come to Kazakhstan.  Holidays in Borovoye are considered an alternative to visiting Switzerland, and its cost is very low.  The resort area is located between the cities of Astana and Kokshetau.  Just like Bayanaul, this luxurious area, abundant in lakes, is located in the middle of the feather grass steppe.  This is another gift of nature to the Kazakh people.  If you have not been here, be sure to stop (for example, on the way to Astana) to rest in Borovoy.  Kazakhstan is a hospitable country.  With a modest amount, you can have a great time.  So, the cost of living in the resort area will cost 2000 tenge (400 rubles), and with tents - and completely free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="blue lakes of Kazakhstan rest prices" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/462650.jpg"></div>

    <p>  <span>Borovoye resort</span> is famous for its reservoirs, not for nothing that they have a poetic name - Blue Lakes of Kazakhstan.  Rest (whose prices range from 400 to 1000 rubles per day) beckons with a heavenly shade of clear waters and healing mud, saving from dozens of diseases.  Having been here once, it is impossible to forget this fabulous journey to the land of majestic mountains and sparkling water surfaces. </p><p>  By the way, there are also less famous lakes of the same name.  In order to see them, you need to go to East Kazakhstan.  <span>Blue Lakes</span> (recreation, the cost of which is ridiculously small, will not hit your pocket, especially if you travel without a guide) are located in Gorny Altai, in the Chemal district. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  West Kazakhstan </h2><p>  This is a vast territory with an arid, sharply continental climate.  It was here that the Great Silk Road used to pass, today it is one of the most interesting tourist routes.  Wonderful landscapes, a variety of flora and fauna of the Ustyurt reserve is of great interest to tourists.  And the Caspian coast provides an opportunity to plunge into the gentle waves of the warm sea. </p>

    <h2>  The majestic Caspian Sea </h2><p>  This is a unique pool, which is closed, which is inherent in the lakes, but at the same time salt, for which it is called the sea.  The gray scallops of the waves create an interesting marine landscape and make it unlike any existing reservoir. </p><p>  The natural system makes vacation on the Caspian Sea very attractive.  At your disposal are mineral waters, sandy beaches, and healing mud.  But not too developed infrastructure reduces attendance of this resort area.  Although the Kazakh coast has great prospects for development, in contrast to Iran and Turkmenistan, where the isolation policy and Sharia law do not attract guests from abroad. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Caspian Sea vacation Kazakhstan" class="if" height="358" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/462061.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Today it is already possible to travel to the Caspian Sea with pleasure.  Rest (Kazakhstan in this case is not inferior, for example, to the Krasnoyarsk Territory with its well-known resorts) offers the health resort "Shagala" with health benefits.  This is a wonderful balneological hospital.  Near the city of Aktau there is a modern sports complex, which is equipped in accordance with international standards.  It is gaining popularity among active young people.  Finally, you will find the Kenderlik recreation center.  This is a whole complex of small, cozy cottages, which are located on a shallow, sandy shore. </p><p>  Another magnificent salt lake is located 140 km from the city of Uralsk.  At first glance, this is also a huge sea without coasts.  The water is salty and very warm, there is plenty of fish in it, but there is practically no infrastructure, like vacationers.  And why, if there is an opportunity to swim and sunbathe for fun?  We are talking about Lake Chelkar (Kazakhstan).  Rest here is very cheap, or rather, it is equal to the cost of gasoline spent and products taken with you.  One minus, but significant - the road to the lake is very broken. </p>

    <h2>  Famous places </h2><p>  <span>Western Kazakhstan,</span> or rather the Mangistau region, is the birthplace of the Silk Road.  And you can walk along it, look at the surviving caravanserais.  The guide will show you the legendary mountain of Sherkal, which resembles a lion.  Nearby is a necropolis, the remains of the fortress of the son of Chinchiskhan.  If you are attracted by the cultural heritage, then you should visit the underground mosques carved from the rock, as well as the Yeset-Batyr memorial complex famous for its beauty. </p><p>  Take the time to take another short excursion.  Not far from Aktau, 30 km from Fort Shevchenko, the wonderful Tamshaly Valley is located - its name sounds in the local language, in free translation it means "spring drops."  This is truly a paradise!  A huge valley overgrown with weeping willows, poplars and bushy glades.  A ring of mountains surrounds it, and in the center lies a picturesque lake.  The guide will tell the legend of weeping stones, which is especially well listened to the sounds of a drop.  These underground springs protrude from under the folds of the mountain and drum with drops on stones. </p><p>  Usursky National Nature Reserve is a real dream of a person who is fond of the flora of the region and archeology.  This is a huge territory of 70 thousand hectares, on which rare animals live - mouflons, cheetahs, gazelles and many others.  Here you can see the ancient city of Shahr-i-Wazir, Beliuli caravanserai and Allan fortress, many ancient cemeteries with majestic mausoleums, mazars and even more ancient Neolithic sites. </p><h2>  South Kazakhstan: rest for every taste </h2><p>  This is the territory from the Aral Sea in the west to the <span>Dzungarian gate</span> in the east.  From Lake Balkhash in the north to the southern border of the country, including part of the Kyzyl Kum desert.  It is amazing how great the diversity of terrain is.  Having allocated just one day for a special tour, you can visit various natural areas, ranging from deserts to alpine glaciers.  Want to see the unique Charyn Canyon?  Come to Almaty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Chelkar Kazakhstan rest" class="if" height="435" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/462063.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Here you can enjoy a beach holiday on the shores of the magnificent lakes Alakol, Balkhash, Sasykkol, Aral.  <span>Kolsai lakes</span> are considered the pearls of the Northern Tien Shan.  The harmonious combination of mountain slopes overgrown with pine trees and crystal clear lakes delights and fascinates.  To explore the entire Kolsai slope, you will need one day of horse riding.  A hiking or cycling tour takes 3 days. </p><p>  National reserves are noteworthy.  The oldest is Aksu-Jabagly.  This is a real treasury of rare and endangered species of animals and plants.  Snow leopards and mountain goats, bears and porcupines, martens and ermines live in the neighborhood ... The very air of this highland place is filled with life and health.  Rare butterflies circle above the flowers, and wonderful trills emerge in the branches of the bird.  Here is a singing dune that makes sounds similar to the melody of an organ.  It is curious that he does not roam the terrain, remaining in the same place. </p><p>  The second largest is the Altyn-Emel Nature Reserve.  A safari on its territory (460,000 hectares) will present an opportunity to meet a huge number of representatives of the local fauna listed in the Red Book: kulans, gazelles, argali, birds, insects. </p><h2>  Eastern Kazakhstan </h2><p>  This is an amazing region, most of which is occupied by the mountain systems of the Ore and Southern Altai.  Three large rivers flow here and a huge number of lakes are located.  The most interesting place to visit is Belukha Mountain - the realm of snow, rumbling avalanches and sparkling waterfalls.  Its height is 4500 meters. </p><p>  An amazing corner of nature - Markakolsky nature reserve - is located in these parts.  The central place is occupied by the fresh and soft Lake Markakol.  Picturesque rocky ledges are covered with forest, subalpine meadows are full of rare plants, and the wildlife of the reserve is rich. </p><p>  The Bukhtarma reservoir is the largest artificial reservoir.  The places here are truly beautiful, and the emerald endless expanse beckons tourists to spend at least some time on the shore.  And abroad, Kazakhstan is known for its reservoirs.  The recreation center "Blue Bay", as well as "Aina", "Ayuda" and others located on the reservoir, are visited every year by guests from neighboring countries. </p><h2>  Sanatoriums of Kazakhstan </h2><p>  The most famous are Zhosaly, in the Karaganda region, Rakhmanovsky keys in East Kazakhstan, Zeleniy Bor in Borovoye, and the Emerald Prophylactic Complex not far from Ust-Kamenogorsk.  In addition, you can visit the sanatoriums "Alatau", "Saryagash", "Merke", "Moyyldy" and many others.  In each of them you will find friendly, qualified staff, a wide selection of preventive and therapeutic procedures and excellent living conditions. </p>

    <h2>  Brief conclusions </h2><p>  As you can see, the country is very rich in attractions.  The article discloses only a small part of the unique beauties of Kazakhstan.  Even the indigenous people of the country often do not know what wealth their land holds.  The most popular holiday in Kazakhstan in the summer of 2014 is a car trip along a pre-planned route.  Look at the map of the area you are interested in, indicate where you will go on excursions, and forward to new horizons. </p>
