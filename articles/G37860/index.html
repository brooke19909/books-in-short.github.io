They are more likely to write about, talk and read about them, and they resort to their services more often than the services provided by others.  Of course, the Kalanchevskaya station is such an object in the capital of the Russian Federation.  Why?  There are plenty of prerequisites for such a statement, and today we will discuss the most obvious ones. </p><h2>  Station Kalanchevskaya.  general description </h2>

    <p>  The official name of the station is Moscow-Kalanchevskaya.  People call it easier - Kalanchevskaya.  This Moscow station is located on the Alekseevskaya connecting line.  It is part of the Moscow-Kursk region of the Moscow Railway. </p><p>  Today, three stations at once, Leningradsky, Kazansky and Yaroslavsky, are located near the passenger platform called ‚ÄúKalanchevskaya Station‚Äù.  How to get there  No problem!  It also borders on the Komsomolskaya metro station, and it is from here that the main stream of passengers arrives. </p><p>  And the reason for this demand is that trains of the Kursk, Gorky, Smolensk and Riga directions make their stops at this place. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  By the way, a frequently asked question: ‚ÄúWhat station is Kalanchevskaya?‚Äù  - incorrect.  Why?  Yes, because this is not a railway station at all in the usual sense of the word, it is a stop that is considered to be the final one for many of these transit trains. </p><h2>  Station Kalanchevskaya.

    <p>  Even before the station was built, it was decided that it was through it that the most important trains would pass, the passengers of which would be members of the government and other famous officials.  By the way, Emperor Nicholas II passed here, heading for his coronation. </p><p>  The design of the station premises was chosen accordingly.  It was built of facing bricks of extraordinary beauty, and decorated with Tarutino stone.  The domed roof and the tower with a spire looked luxurious and majestic.  The station was especially magnificent due to its rich interior decoration.  The carved roof covering the platform added elegance and originality to the building.  The square and the square surrounded the station building. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  But historical events unfolded in a completely different way.  The coronation train got to another station - Brest.  But still, sometimes the imperial family used its special station.  After the revolutionary events, the station building was used far from intended.  It was decided to place the district council of the Moscow Railway District there.  After some time, the station began to function as a passenger station intended for commuter trains. </p><h2>  Station Kalanchevskaya.  Features and reason for popularity </h2>

    <p>  The station includes 2 side platforms.  Turnstiles for passengers are mandatory on them.  Between the platforms, a single transition is organized, which is a flooring through the paths.  It is noteworthy that the northern part of the platform has a curved shape. </p><p>  From this railway station you can get to Kalanchevskaya, Krasnoprudnaya, Bolshaya Spasskaya streets, as well as go to <span>Komsomolskaya Square</span> and to Groholsky Lane. </p><p>  Another name for this station - Moscow-Technical-Kurskaya - arose because it is here that the preparation of long-distance trains with a southern direction is made. </p><p>  Immediately, station workers monitor the composition of long-distance trains of Moscow affiliation.  The equipment of restaurant cars with necessary products is also in the department of Kalanchevskaya employees.  They provide passenger cars with coal, bed linen and water. </p>
