In ancient times, the city acted as a Norman camp.  Starting from the 9th century, Leuven was the residence in which the counts of Flanders stayed, and then the dukes of Louvain. </p><p>  According to some reports, the name of the city comes from the Flemish words, which in translation mean "swamp lights". </p><p>  The period from the 11th to the 14th century is important for Leuven (Belgium).  At this time, it was a center of trade and production of cloth.  The development of the city was very active.  Unfortunately, wars at the end of the 14th century led to a decline in the production process and caused stagnation. </p><p>  Both world wars were a serious test for Leuven, since it was occupied by German invaders. </p><p>  The city has preserved a large number of buildings from the Middle Ages, which tourists from all over the world come to see. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  In the city of Leuven (Belgium) there are a huge number of attractions, historical places, museums, parks and gardens that tourists from all over the world seek to see. </p><p>  The city got its fame due to the fact that here is the oldest and most famous university in the country.  The Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium was founded in 1425.  Currently, 35,000 students are enrolled in it.  Given that 90,000 people live in the city, students make up a third of the city‚Äôs population. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.madeinvlaamsbrabant.be" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="University of Leuven" class="if uuid-2759592" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/100497/2759592.jpg"></div><p>  Educational buildings are dispersed throughout the city, but it does not take much time to move between them: mostly students and teachers use bicycles, a favorite means of transportation for all Belgians. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The visitors of the city are interested in the building of the university library and the bell tower.
