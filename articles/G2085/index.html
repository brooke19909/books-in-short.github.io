    <h2>  Maritime Museum in Safari Park </h2><p>  <span>A visit to this place will be an interesting pastime for both adults and children.</span>  <span>Here are more than two thousand exhibits that were raised from the bottom of the sea.</span>  <span>These exhibits include more than 600 coins that were collected from the seabed, as well as the remains of various underwater inhabitants.</span>  <span>Some species have long ceased to exist.</span> </p><p>  <span>As you can see, Gelendzhik is a very developed city, and tourists have something to do here.</span>  <span>But living in the city itself is expensive, so it‚Äôs better to find a place more distant from the center.</span>  <span>It could be Blue Cove.</span>  <span>The microdistrict is only being built, but now there are many hotels and cottages at affordable prices.</span>  <span>But the problem in Gelendzhik‚Äôs Blue Bay is where to go with the children.</span>  <span>Since the microdistrict has just begun to equip, and so far they cannot boast of a lot of entertainment for families with children.</span>  <span>Every tourist who did not know where to go with children in Gelendzhik left positive reviews after leaving.</span>  <span>Since the city is simply filled with all sorts of entertainment for little vacationers.</span> </p>
