    <p>  His father, Nikolai Vasilievich, a peasant of the landowner Brekhov of the <span>Nizhny Novgorod province,</span> having not received his freedom, fled to the <span>Astrakhan province</span> in 1791 <span>.</span>  In 1797, he was freed under conditions of compulsory residence in the region.  Since that time, Nikolai Vasilievich begins to master tailoring craft, enters the tailors workshop. </p><p>  Ilya‚Äôs mother, Anna Alekseevna Smirnova, was 19 years younger than her husband. </p><p>  At five, Ilya lost his father.  The whole burden of care fell on the elder brother of Ilya Vasily, who remained the only breadwinner in the family. </p><p>  And yet, the absence of his father was not a disaster for the boy, since Vasily fully replaced his parent.  From an early age, Ilya Ulyanov proved to be a capable student.  Having made an exception, he is admitted to the Astrakhan men's gymnasium, which he graduates in 1850, becoming the first gymnasium student in the history of the educational institution to receive a silver medal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Student years </h2><p>  Ilya Ulyanov, whose biography began with difficult events and facts (the absence of a breadwinner, a large family), still did not abandon his desire for knowledge. </p><p>  In 1850, he entered Kazan University at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics.  The young man was very lucky: the educational institution was headed by the outstanding scientist N. I. Lobachevsky, who was distinguished by progressive views on pedagogy, science and society.  Thanks to him, the views of young Ilya Nikolaevich were formed. </p><p>  As a student, the young man studied at the meteorological and astronomical observatory.  This contributed to the fact that Ulyanov I. N. received the degree of Candidate of Mathematical Sciences for his work ‚ÄúThe Olbers Method and its Application to the Determination of the Orbit of the Clinkerfus Comet‚Äù. </p><p>  In 1854, he graduated from the university. </p><h2>  The beginning of pedagogical activity </h2><p>  In mid-1855, a young scientist was appointed teacher of mathematics and physics at the Penza Nobility Institute. </p>

    <p>  In 1863 they moved to Nizhny Novgorod, where the head of the family received the post of senior teacher of mathematics and physics in the male gymnasium.  At the same time, he is conducting teaching and educational work in other educational institutions.  At the same time, he takes a creative approach to the educational process.  Gradually, he formed his own pedagogical system and views on education. </p><h2>  Ulyanov's activities in the field of public education </h2><p>  In 1869, Ilya Ulyanov was appointed the inspector of public schools of the <span>Simbirsk province</span> by the Ministry of Public Education <span>,</span> and after 5 years - the director of public schools.  The latter appointment has expanded the capabilities of an innovative teacher. </p><p>  Director Ulyanov first of all personally got acquainted with the state of schools.  It was deplorable: out of 421 schools, only 89 worked, and more than a third of the teachers were not professionals, they were replaced by parish priests.  Zemstvo power was demonstratively inactive. </p><p>  Energetic and selfless I.N. Ulyanov was able to win over the progressive circles of the province.  Soon, the Simbirsk province was among the best in the field of public education. </p><h2>  Achievements of I. N. Ulyanov in the field of public education </h2><p>  Ilya Ulyanov, whose achievements in the field of public education arouse deep respect for him among all progressive people of the past and present, carried out gigantic work to improve the education system in Russia. </p><p>  Under his leadership, in 1872, the Poretsky Teachers' Seminary was opened, which prepared a whole galaxy of Ulyanovsk teachers.  Professional teachers came to schools. </p><p>  In the Middle Volga region, for the first time, a whole network of schools was created for Mordovian, Chuvash and Tatar children.  Moreover, training was conducted in their native language. </p><p>  In the province, the number of educational institutions has increased.  Only the number of Chuvash schools was brought to thirty-eight.  There are more than two hundred new buildings for educational institutions. </p><p>  Archives confirm that Ilya Nikolayevich donated personal funds to new schools, the publication of textbooks. </p><h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  Ilya Nikolayevich could well have the surname Ulyanin, since the documents of the State Archives of the Astrakhan Region indicate that initially his father's surname was just that.  This fact is also confirmed by the State Archives of the Gorky Region, where documents were found about Ulyanov‚Äôs grandfather, Nikita Grigoryevich Ulyanin. </p><p>  But how did the surname Ulyanov?  As it turned out, at the whim of officials. </p><p>  As you know, Nikolai Vasilyevich, Ilya‚Äôs father, lived with his family in Astrakhan in his own house.  In 1823, for failure to pay taxes and other duties, he falls into the Vedomosti on the Astrakhan bourgeoisie, but already under the name Ulyanov.  From this time on, he is always referred to as Ulyanov. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  January 24, 1886 Ulyanov Ilya Nikolaevich died suddenly, whose biography is filled with noble deeds in the name of public education.  His memory is immortalized by a bust in Ulyanovsk. </p>
