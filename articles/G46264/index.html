Residents of the metropolis are in desperate need of housing, but its cost in the city itself is so high that it is quite problematic for many to buy an apartment even in the most prestigious area.  At the same time, in a new building, albeit on the outskirts, it is quite possible to find a suitable option, especially since developers working in conditions of fierce competition always try to make their own offer the most profitable for customers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD New Ohta" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1280915.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  General information about the complex </h2><p>  The review will focus on the LCD "New Okhta".  LSR Real Estate, a real estate developer, intends to build a whole microdistrict in the Krasnogvardeisky district of St. Petersburg.  "New Okhta" will be the first sign that will unite objects of social and trade-entertaining infrastructure, public and business buildings, high-rise buildings and equipped walking area. </p><p>  In total, it is planned to erect more than 40 buildings, in connection with which construction is carried out in several stages.  Moreover, its course is planned in such a way that the houses in which people have already settled are located at some distance from the sites on which work is being carried out. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The developer intends to build 27 panel houses of different floors.  In parallel, work is underway to improve the territory and the construction of infrastructure facilities.  The complex is located near the village of Murino, between the ring and the river Okhta. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD New Ohta LSR" class="if" height="324" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1280909.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  LCD "New Okhta": the progress of construction </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the process of creating a <span>residential complex</span> involves several phases of construction.  At the beginning of 2015, 16 houses were commissioned, in many of which apartments are currently sold out.  Work is being carried out in accordance with the schedule; in the third quarter of this year, the developer intends to commission new buildings.  As for the deadlines, the delivery of all objects is scheduled for the end of 2018.  To everyone, the developer offers the most truthful information about the construction progress and even organizes special excursions. </p><p>  During the inspections, no violations were revealed, which, in principle, is not surprising, since the LSR company has been operating in the real estate market for more than forty years and has more than one already completed project of such a plan.  As evidenced by the feedback on the Novaya Okhta residential complex, interest holders, no one had any complaints about the deadlines for commissioning the facilities. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Ecology </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Krasnogvardeisky district, on the territory of which construction is underway, cannot boast of a good environment.  There are many industrial enterprises and zones.  This is not to say that they have a serious negative impact on the state of the external environment, but their presence does not allow creating squares, parks and places for walking in the immediate vicinity of the complex.  There are also railway tracks near the Novaya Okhta residential complex, which is why noise from passing trains will interfere with residents of houses located closer to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD New Ohta St. Petersburg" class="if" height="366" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1280912.jpg" width="600"></div>

      <p></p>
    <p>  However, the negative impression and the ecological situation itself are somewhat obscured by the presence on the territory of the Okhta River and fairly large forest tracts that begin right outside the boundaries of the microdistrict under construction.  In addition, in view of the current situation, the developer intends to carry out mass work on the maximum landscaping of the courtyards and streets of the complex. </p><p>  So, by and large, it is rather difficult to call the environmental situation in the microdistrict unfavorable. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Own infrastructure facilities as such are not currently available.  Some of them are at the stage of completion, while the rest will be commissioned along with the last buildings of the residential complex.  The builder plans to create a real microcity.  The first floors of all houses are equipped with commercial premises, which will house pharmacies, <span>beauty salons,</span> cafes, restaurants, sports sections, fitness centers and much more that a modern person needs.  Schools and kindergartens, supermarkets will also be built.  In general, everything will be over time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the meantime, as evidenced by the reviews of buyers on the Novaya Okhta residential complex, who have already settled in their apartments, one has to use the services of infrastructure facilities located at the metro stations Grazhdansky Prospekt and Devyatkino and the village of Murino.  The latter, which is located just a few kilometers from the complex, has a school, a kindergarten, as well as grocery and department stores, a law enforcement post, a pharmacy, and an outpatient clinic. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lcd new ohta reviews" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1280900.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Near the metro you can find food markets, shopping centers "North Mall", "Rubicon", "Okay" and others.  On Prospect of Enlightenment, which is located near the complex under construction, there are kindergartens, schools, cafes and restaurants.  The services of all these and other institutions and institutions are still used by those who already live in the residential complex "New Okhta".  St. Petersburg is a large city, even on the outskirts of it there are a lot of various objects of both social and commercial infrastructure.  So, although residents of new buildings have to endure some inconvenience, no one feels deprived of themselves. </p><h2>  Transport connection </h2><p>  As for transport interchanges, here in the LCD "New Okhta" the full order.  Next to it is the roundabout, and you can get to the metropolis along the Toksovsky highway.  The route is considered relatively unloaded, congestion, as a rule, occurs only during rush hours, which, in principle, all the routes of St. Petersburg ‚Äúsin‚Äù.  The rest of the time, travel is almost free.  You can use an alternative option - the Road of Life, to which, if you go through the roundabout, only seven kilometers. </p><p>  Near the newly built houses there are bus and minibus stops, where you can get to the nearest metro station Grazhdansky Prospekt, as well as to the village of Murino.  In the latter there is a <span>railway station</span> and a bus station. </p><p>  So from the point of view of transport the location of the complex is more than good. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="apartments in new okhta" class="if" height="305" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/41452/1280898.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  What do property owners say about the New Okhta residential complex?  First of all, everyone unanimously praises the low cost of apartments.  Taking into account the fact that they all are finished, the prices for them can be called one of the most affordable of all available on the real estate market today.  Residents and transport accessibility are praised, claiming that they have no problems getting to work in the morning or going to St. Petersburg for shopping.  There are no complaints about the quality of housing.  The developer does not deviate from its principles and delivers only a quality product to the market.  Yes, of course, the yards are not yet landscaped, there are problems with the roads, and the ongoing construction work does not add comfort.  However, it can be seen from everything that the developer is trying, the objects of the trade infrastructure are being handed over ahead of schedule, thanks to which residents of the microdistrict can now buy essential goods near the house.  Everyone is looking forward to when the <span>building</span> of the kindergarten under construction will be commissioned.  Some are not entirely satisfied with the environmental situation in the region, while others are disturbed by the noise of passing trains at night.  Nevertheless, these shortcomings were not hidden, so it was too late to make claims, it was necessary to take them into account when choosing and buying an apartment.  So, by and large, the reviews of those who have already bought apartments in the complex or are considering the issue of their acquisition here are mostly purely positive. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to experts and potential buyers, LCD "Novaya Okhta" in St. Petersburg is one of the most suitable complexes for buying real estate.  Housing here - high-quality and comfortable - is offered at fairly affordable and reasonable prices, and therefore everyone can buy an apartment in a residential complex. </p>
