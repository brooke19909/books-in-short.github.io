    <h2>  Distance to infrastructure facilities </h2><p>  Hotel Fiore Healthy Resort <span>4 * (Vietnam,</span> Phan Thiet) is located on the famous cozy beach of Tien Tien.  Nearby are such tourist sites as the Ke Ga lighthouse (12 km) and the majestic sand dunes (20 km).  And in the immediate vicinity of the hotel (only 3 km) there are several luxurious golf courses.  However, in order to get to all this beauty and luxury, you will have to cover a fairly considerable distance, because <span>Ho Chi Minh</span> International <span>Airport</span> is already 190 km from this resort. </p><h2>  Guest rooms </h2><p>  The hotel is characterized by a fairly compact size, in its room stock there are only 40 apartments.  But this is a completely justified policy of the Fiore Healthy Resort 4 * hotel.  Reviews of tourists who have been here earlier indicate that a small number of apartments are compensated by their well-groomed and luxurious.  So, the hotel administration offers its guests to stay in the following rooms: </p><ul><li>  Royal Suite is a truly luxurious room that has three panoramic windows in your bedroom, thanks to which you can contemplate all the beauty of the Vietnamese landscapes around the clock.  The interior of the apartment is quite restrained, because the emphasis is on the beauty of the landscape.  There is also a small living room with a kitchenette and a sofa bed, which acts as an extra bed. </li><li>  Deluxe is a spacious one-room room with two large beds and an extra bed in the form of a folding soft sofa.  A feature of this category of apartments is a bewitching view of the ocean, which opens from a huge panoramic window. </li><li>  The bungalow is a compact one-room house that can accommodate up to 6 guests (4 adults and 2 children) at a time.  This apartment has a lot of space.  Zoning occurs with the help of wooden <span>beams, decorative</span> partitions and color schemes of the interior.  There is access to a terrace with beach and garden furniture, a private garden and a pool.  A nice end to the overall picture will be the view of the ocean. </li><li>  Superior Standard is a small room designed for two adults with 2 children.  The apartment has a special charm with a corner panoramic window that gives guests an unforgettable experience. </li></ul><p>  The design solution of the rooms of the Fiore Healthy <span>Resort 4 *</span> hotel (Vietnam, Phan Thiet) deserves special praise.  The photo shows the traditional restrained style for the area. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Negative reviews </h2><p>  Unfortunately, the Fiore Healthy Resort 4 * hotel (Vietnam) made some shortcomings in its work.  Reviews may contain the following negative comments: </p><ul><li>  air conditioning does not cope with air cooling; </li><li>  almost none of the hotel staff speaks neither Russian nor English; </li><li>  the hotel is quite far from attractions and urban infrastructure, which greatly affects the prices of products and tariffs of carriers; </li><li>  all services at the hotel are very expensive; </li><li>  untidy beach (almost never cleaning); </li><li>  too expensive excursions with hotel guides (cheaper to buy at local offices); </li><li>  some guests believe that the Fiore Healthy Resort 4 * hotel (Vietnam) does not look very presentable, photos, by the way, sometimes really show some deterioration in the number of rooms; </li><li>  poor quality laundry services (stains remain); </li><li>  complete lack of entertainment. </li></ul><h2>  Useful information for tourists </h2><p>  Going on vacation, it is useful to know some of the internal rules that apply in the hotel: </p><ul><li>  check-in and check-in, according to the charter, is done at 14:00, but in fact everything happens much faster, since the hotel is small and the flow of guests is corresponding; </li><li>  check out of your room on the day of departure must be strictly before 12:00; </li><li>  placing on extra beds for children under 12 costs $ 15 daily, and if the child is an old man, the price rises to $ 29; </li><li>  in each room (regardless of area and category) only one extra bed is allowed; </li><li>  the hotel operates payment terminals for payments by plastic cards; </li><li>  in the hotel restaurant, children under 5 years old are provided with free dinner if the parents fully paid for their order; </li><li>  the cost of all additional services is calculated and paid directly at the hotel; </li><li>  if any holiday date (for example, New Year) falls during the period of your stay at the hotel, then the gala dinner will be included in the price of the tour, which will cost $ 50 to an adult and $ 25 to a child; </li><li>  if you want to invite additional guests to the gala dinner, they are required to pay the full cost of this service. </li></ul><h2>  Overall impression after visiting the hotel </h2><p>  The Fiore Healthy Resort 4 * hotel leaves a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions that can be called quite ambiguous.  It is worth saying right away that this is just the perfect place for those who are looking for peace and solitude, but those who are used to noisy entertainment will not be very comfortable here. </p><p>  Since there are no attractions near the hotel, and the ocean is not happy with cleanliness and tranquility, you will spend most of the time on site.  Since its main feature is glass rooms with panoramic windows, it is better to stay in bungalows, which are in much better condition than other rooms. </p>
