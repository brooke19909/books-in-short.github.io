Many of them were already born on the street, while others still remember the warmth of their home and do not understand why their beloved owners doomed them to death, throwing them over the threshold.  To survive, they are knocked down in flocks and often pose a threat to people living nearby.  But despite this, abandoned animals need care and human participation, without which they can die.  At the state level, this problem still can not find a solution.  Therefore, volunteers are taking care of our smaller brothers in different cities of Russia, trying to somehow make life easier for these poor fellows, who are certainly not to blame for human cruelty. </p><p>  Similar caring people live in Krasnodar.  For many years, the Krasnodog shelter has been engaged in the rescue of wounded and crippled animals, as well as their subsequent placement in new families.  Of course, simple residents of the city, bringing food, medicine and money, help the shelter survive.  Each such visit becomes a symbol of saving someone‚Äôs little four-legged life, so today we decided to talk in detail about the Krasnodog animal shelter in Krasnodar.  You can find out the address of this place and other useful information about it from this article. </p>

    <h2>  From the history of the organization </h2><p>  The Krasnodog shelter has been operating in the city for fourteen years.  However, in the early years, the charitable organization was very seriously different from what its employees and volunteers managed to create by today. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, the organization was almost a mini-shelter, where only five aviaries for dogs and cats were installed.  They simultaneously contained more than fifteen animals. </p><p>  For all the work of the Krasnodog shelter, several volunteers were responsible.  They took animals, fed them and cleaned the cages.  In parallel, the treatment of animals was laid on their shoulders.  The absence of their own veterinarian left a certain imprint on the work of volunteers and made it difficult.  After all, animals constantly had to be transported to various veterinary clinics of the city, and this required additional costs.  Many of the founders of the shelter did not even believe that they would survive in their first year of existence.  However, good deeds never remain without support, and today the Krasnodog animal shelter has many functions, being considered one of the largest charitable organizations of this kind in the city. </p><h2>  Activities of Krasnodog </h2><p>  If you have a pet and you live in Krasnodar, the address of the Krasnodog shelter is most likely familiar to you.  Indeed, today there is not only overexposure of animals, but also an excellent veterinary clinic.  In parallel, employees of the shelter are also conducting other activities that deserve close attention: </p><ul><li>  shelter for dogs and cats; </li><li>  placement of healthy animals in new families; </li><li>  help wounded and crippled animals; </li><li>  redirecting animals to other cities; </li><li>  zootherapy; </li><li>  conducting lessons of kindness; </li><li>  reception of visitors in a <span>veterinary clinic</span> with its own laboratory and hospital; </li><li>  grooming animals. </li></ul><p>  The listed items of the list confirm the fact that the Krasnodog Shelter is a unique organization not only for Krasnodar, but also for other Russian cities.  Therefore, we will cover in detail each direction of the shelter. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Homeless animals </h2><p>  In Krasnodar, there is not a single state shelter, which means that all four-legged four-legged animals abandoned to the mercy of fate fall into the only organization officially registered. </p><p>  However, the Krasnodog shelter does not receive funding from the city.  It exists at the expense of donations from caring residents and subsidies from the powers that be of Krasnodar, who responded to a call for help. </p><p>  Today, the territory where homeless animals are kept is landscaped and divided into several parts: </p><ul><li>  sixteen indoor street enclosures; </li><li>  quarantine cells; </li><li>  enclosures for animals with skin diseases; </li><li>  places for healthy animals. </li></ul><p>  It is noteworthy that all cells are heated, water is supplied to the shelter, and in winter animals can sleep in warm booths.  The creation of comfortable living conditions for pets in the shelter "Krasnodog" is taken very seriously. </p><p>  Cats and dogs feed twice a day.  They get dry food and canned food.  Several times a day cleaning of enclosures is carried out, according to a certain schedule, sanitary treatment of all cells is carried out. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, it is not surprising that through the efforts of the organization‚Äôs employees, animals recover very quickly and find new owners.  Usually in a shelter at the same time contains about two hundred pets. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The device of animals in good hands </h2><p>  Not a single shelter can replace the warmth of the owner's hands and love, which has set in to animals.  Therefore, all four-legged babies are desperate for a new family.  In addition, without the placement of animals, the Krasnodog shelter simply could not exist, because the enclosures would be constantly busy and there would be nowhere for new guests to settle. </p><p>  Every month, employees of the organization attach more than a hundred animals.  At the same time, each of them is healthy, vaccinated and treated against parasites.  Sometimes it takes only a few hours from getting a dog or cat to the shelter before being sent to a new home, and sometimes the same person has to wait a whole year.  However, employees of the shelter say that the owners are sure to be for any animal.  Just have to wait. </p><p>  Most often, the search is conducted by submitting ads on various Internet resources.  This method is the cheapest and most effective.  The Krasnodog animal shelter (Krasnodar) is positively characterized by the fact that its employees always monitor the fate of the given animal and, in the case when it does not get along with the owners, can again pick up the pet for overexposure. </p>

    <h2>  Rescue Wounded Animals </h2><p>  Very often, people pass by our lesser wounded or crippled brothers.  But without participation and help, they are doomed to death, so try not to be indifferent and do something for the animals.  The Krasnodog shelter‚Äôs address is familiar to anyone who hasn‚Äôt passed a sick dog or cat lying on the pavement at least once in their lives.  The organization always accepts such patients, because it is the organization that is oriented towards their salvation. </p><p>  Many of them, after the hands of flayers, remained disabled and in great need of the love of the new owners in order to regain faith in people. </p><h2>  Redirecting animals to other cities </h2><p>  Sometimes the wounds and illnesses of the pets that have arrived at the shelter are so serious that the Krasnodog veterinarian cannot cure them.  Therefore, employees of the organization negotiate with clinics in other cities and find people who can transport animals.  As a result, many of our smaller brothers recover and gain their masters where they received treatment. </p><p>  Thanks to this approach, the shelter manages to save the most hopeless animals with severe injuries. </p><h2>  Zootherapy </h2><p>  Not everyone has heard about this therapy, but its effectiveness every year makes this method of treating mental illness in children more and more popular.  Psychologists have long recognized that children with Down syndrome, for example, or developmental delays when interacting with animals experience a lot of positive emotions.  This stimulates their development, allows you to overcome various fears and helps to cope with the symptoms of the disease. </p><p>  Employees of Krasnodog have been implementing a zoototherapy program for nine years.  They go to orphanages, boarding schools and hospitals, where children with a weakened psyche live and bring cats, dogs, ferrets, rabbits and other animals with them. </p><p>  In the process of communicating with them, the children relax and forget about their problems.  Similar classes are conducted together with a psychologist and a veterinarian, as well as ordinary employees of the shelter.  Children not only communicate with furry pets, but also learn a lot of interesting things about them.  This program is implemented as part of charity. </p>

    <h2>  Lessons of kindness: what is it? </h2><p>  To attract public attention to the problems of homeless animals, employees of Krasnodog regularly conduct excursions for schoolchildren and students. </p><p>  At the lessons of kindness, they will be taken around the shelter, shown the conditions of the animals and tell about their fate.  Particular attention is paid to the topic of cruelty to animals, children are surely introduced to the victims of such bullying in the hope that they will never be able to offend a defenseless creature. </p><p>  The lessons of kindness contribute to the development in children‚Äôs souls of a sense of compassion and responsibility for their actions.  In addition, after such excursions, many children come to the shelter with their parents to take this or that animal with them.  In addition, school groups always bring food, care products and medicines to Krasnodog as voluntary assistance. </p>

    <h2>  Vet clinic </h2><p>  Today, the shelter has its own doctor and the ability to help not only homeless animals, but also treat pets.  Krasnodar residents often write grateful reviews on the work of the veterinary clinic on the Krasnodog website.  Here you can conduct an examination of the animal, make tests or surgery.  Naturally, all these services are paid, but their cost is much lower than the average for the city. </p><p>  Thanks to the activities of the veterinary clinic, shelter staff can treat homeless animals for free.  However, drugs, dressings and much more are still not enough for the shelter.  Therefore, the Krasnodog website regularly publishes lists of what is needed.  Anyone who wants to help the shelter can familiarize themselves with them. </p><h2>  Animal Grooming </h2><p>  Only for those who do not have a pet, it seems that a haircut is not a very serious problem for the owners of the animal.  However, actually cutting your pet is not so easy, because many of them violently resist any trips to the specialist.  Therefore, employees of Krasnodog have developed a special program that will make the process as comfortable as possible for your animal. </p><p>  You can sign up for a haircut at any convenient time, during work the owner can stay next to his pet, which always reassures the animal.  If it is too nervous, then the shelter employee will make your pet easy anesthesia.  In parallel, doctors can remove tartar from the animal or perform castration. </p>

    <h2>  Running on the rainbow </h2><p>  Unfortunately, not all the pets that were admitted to the shelter can be saved.  Many fall into Krasnodog already in critical condition and cannot survive the operation.  The days when animals die are the saddest for the organization.  All data on them is published on the official website of the Krasnodog animal shelter.  "Rainbow" is a section that provides complete information about those animals that died within the walls of the shelter.  Here are photos of cats and dogs, as well as their stories. </p><p>  After viewing such information, some visitors to the site are so imbued with the difficult fate of animals that they become volunteers of the shelter or begin to help it on an ongoing basis. </p>

    <h2>  Shelter "Krasnodog": address </h2><p>  A charitable organization that helps animals is located in Kuibyshev Driveway, at number two.  It is noteworthy that the address of the shelter is not published in all sources.  This is due to the fact that often people use their knowledge and throw foundlings to the walls of Krasnodog, whom the shelter simply cannot accept due to overcrowding. </p><p>  If you don‚Äôt know what to do with the animal found on the street, then call Krasnodog.  Here they will tell you what needs to be done, and if possible they will accept a cat or dog for overexposure. </p><p>  The shelter also provides free legal assistance in matters of animal cruelty.  You can call here three times a week from eleven to twelve in the afternoon. </p>
