The main activities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The victory over Napoleon brought Europe the long-awaited peace, but did not solve any internal problems of the Russian Empire.  The post-war period of the <span>reign of Alexander 1 is</span> characterized by a new direction of civic activity - the social movement.  For the first time in Russia, <span>civic initiatives</span> took on organized forms.  The social movement under Alexander 1 laid the foundation of its activity on the foundation of liberal ideas. </p><h2>  Liberalism in the country </h2><p>  The ideas of European liberalism spread in Russia even during the time of Catherine II, who actively corresponded with such ideologists of this direction as Voltaire, Rousseau, Didro and others. However, later the Empress rejected such teachings, rightly fearing that they would harm the monarchical system of Russia. </p><p>  The second wind the liberal movement in Russia received in 1812.  Soldiers and officers who traveled to Europe returned to their homeland as staunch opponents of serfdom and the autocratic system.  The absolute disregard by the authorities for the need to transform the country caused a deep discontent among the progressive sections of the population.  It was under such conditions that the social movement under Alexander 1 was born and began its activity. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  The first public organizations in Russia were Masonic lodges.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Masonic movement came from Europe.  By the 20th year of the XIX century.  members of the Masonic lodges were about 3 thousand noblemen, merchants and people of the middle class.  Freemasonry gave society the experience necessary for the organization and operation of secret societies. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social movement under Alexander 1" class="if" height="359" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/669602.jpg" width="512"></div>  Basically, the <span>social movement</span> under Alexander 1 is known for such secret societies: the Union of Salvation, the <span>Southern Society, the</span> Union of United Slavs and others.

Its founder was A.N.

There were separate calls for a conspiracy and regicide, but they were not widespread among most members of the union. </p>

    <p>  After the decision was made to attract broad public support, the Union of Salvation disbanded, and on its basis the Union of Welfare arose.  The secret society program had its own charter, which was known as the Green Book.  The society is based on the same ideas as before - the overthrow of the autocracy and the destruction of the serfdom.  But at the same time, the members of the union agreed to participate in state reforms along with the government, and attached great importance to the ideas of upbringing and education.  When the government refused to reform the state, the social movement under Alexander 1 was in jeopardy.  Successful military coups in <span>Western Europe</span> prompted the idea to organize a military rebellion in Russia and force the government to make concessions. </p><p>  Therefore, after the Union of Welfare, new societies were created, called the North and South. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Northern Society </h2><p>  The center of the Northern Society was Petersburg.  Members of the union were E.P. Obolensky, S.P. Trubetskoy, N.M. Muravyev and others.  According to the program set forth by N. M. Muravyov in his "Constitution", Russia was to abandon the autocracy and become a constitutional monarchy.  He also laid down the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa federal division of Russia into 15 ‚Äúpowers‚Äù.  The rights of the emperor were limited.  The personal freedom of the peasants was envisaged, and civil rights were introduced for each resident of Russia.  These theses give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the social movement sought under Alexander 1. </p><h2>  Southern society </h2><p>  This civic education brought together officers who served in Ukraine.  The head of the Southern Society is the hero of the Battle of Borodino, Colonel P.I. Pestel. </p>

    <p>  Under his leadership, a draft Constitution of Russia was created under the name "Russian Truth", but with more radical theses than Muravyov‚Äôs.  So, the Russian Empire was to become a republican country, and not a monarchy.  The state was to be governed by the supreme council and the popular council.  The peasants were granted not only freedom, but also land plots. </p><p>  Thus, the abolition of serfdom and radical transformations in the state were the foundations that characterized the social movement under Alexander 1. A table illustrating the brief goals of public organizations is presented below. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="social movement under Alexander 1 table" class="if" height="314" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/668384.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Members of secret societies actively discussed real ways to achieve their goals.  The result was a decision on state military action. </p><p>  Despite the conspiracy, the government was aware of the threats posed by the social movement under Alexander 1. In 1822 a decision was made to ban all Masonic lodges and secret societies.  A few days before his death, the king ordered the arrest of participants in the rebellion.  The unexpected death of the emperor pushed people to the uprising of 1825. </p>
