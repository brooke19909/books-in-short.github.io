Advantages and disadvantages of ceramic glass hob surfaces</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  More recently, the purchase of a conventional gas or electric stove was a whole event in the life of an average Russian family.  Having arrived at the store today, the buyer‚Äôs eyes are scattered from the abundance presented there.  The hob is electric, gas, gas-electric, <span>built-in hob.</span>  How to choose what is really necessary among this magnificence?  How to deal with all this?  After all, buying and connecting a hob is a serious matter and requires careful preparation.  Let's try to understand the types of hobs.  How is an electric hob different from a gas hob?  And what are their main <span>advantages and disadvantages.</span> </p><p>  Regardless of whether the hob is electric or gas, they are of two types.  The first type is a dependent hob.  In this case, the <span>oven</span> is located under the hob or surface, as it is also called, and has a single control with it.  In the second version, the hob is connected separately from the oven and it is controlled independently.  This type of hob is called independent.  Today everyone can order a special furniture set, which will be made and equipped with any kitchen appliances of your choice.  But recently, there has been a situation where buyers give preference to individual hobs.  And this is not surprising, because they can easily be integrated into existing kitchen furniture.  In addition to the cooking surfaces in stores today you can find a great many different built-in modules: built-in grills, double boiler and deep fryers.  Such an abundance of modules even in the most ordinary medium-sized kitchen will allow you to mount a work surface that would fully meet the needs of the hostess. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Cooktops are electric, gas and combined - gas-electric.  An electric hob made of carbon steel and coated with enamel is considered the cheapest.  Nevertheless, she perfectly tolerates all the trials that fall to her lot, and looks great externally.  This type of panel is in good demand among buyers.  In some cases, enameled panels are decorated with <span>tempered glass.</span>  Especially good with such inserts look <span>gas hobs.</span>  It seems that the gas burns directly on the glass.  Panels made of stainless steel are more durable than enameled.  They are not afraid of blows and endure the effects of acetic or citric acid.  The disadvantages of such cooking surfaces include a higher price compared to enameled panels and the fact that they require special cleaning products to care for them. </p><p>  An <span>electric</span> or gas hob made of glass ceramics is the type of hob most common on the Russian market.  They are much more expensive than enameled and made of stainless steel panels.  However, they have a number of advantages.  Such panels heat up very quickly and cool just as quickly.  This material has a low horizontal thermal conductivity, due to which the side surfaces of the panel remain almost cold.  To date, hobs made of glass ceramics are the most popular.  A significant role in this was played by their appearance.  In addition, they are easy to clean.  The margin of safety of glass-ceramic panels is high enough, but, nevertheless, it is better to avoid strong shocks.  Unfortunately, glass-ceramic panels are not without drawbacks.  In addition to the fact that they do not tolerate point hits, it is not recommended to spill products that contain sugar on them.  For such panels, you will need to buy a new set of dishes, as the old one may not work.  When cleaning the surface, cleaning agents containing abrasives are not recommended. </p><p>  Today, a lot of companies are engaged in the production of ceramic panels.  To list them all does not make sense.  We can say that the most popular among consumers is the products of Bosh and Ariston.  Cooktops from these manufacturers are considered not only the most reliable, but also the most advanced in terms of using modern technologies.  For example, in Bosh glass-ceramic hobs, the TermoControl system is used, using which, the hostess will only need to select a mode, and the burner temperature will be controlled automatically.  And in modern models of Ariston glass-ceramic panels, Hilight elements are used that heat the burner in a matter of seconds. </p>
