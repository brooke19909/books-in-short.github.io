The largest of them is Krk, in Croatia.  Spectacular landscapes, mild climate, interesting history made it a real gem of the country.  For over a hundred years, it has been one of its most popular tourist and cultural centers. </p><h2>  A bit about history and geography </h2><p>  Like the entire Adriatic coast, Krk was inhabited in pre-Roman times.  In antiquity it was called the “Golden Island”.  The Slavs came here in the 7th century, but were unable to maintain control over the lands for a long time.  The territory of Krka was in the hands of the Venetians, Austro-Hungarians, Germans, French, Italians.  It was part of Yugoslavia, and after its collapse again became Croatian. </p><p>  At the end of the 19th century, Krk in Croatia was the only place where the Dalmatian language was preserved.  In the rest of the region, it disappeared in the 16th century.  The last native speaker was Tuone Udayna, who died in 1898. </p><p>  The island of Krk in Croatia belongs to the Dalmatian region.  It is washed by Kvarner Bay and is located near the cities of Rijeka and Opatija.  It has more than 20 settlements, in which up to 18 thousand people live in total. </p><p>  On the island of Krk in Croatia is located the international airport of Rijeka, which receives tourists mainly from Europe.  It is connected to the mainland by a road bridge.  He is often called Titov in honor of the Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tit.  This is the second longest arch bridge in the world, with a length of 1,430 meters. </p>

    <p>  Writing glorified and Vrbnik.  Once upon a time there was a printing house where Croatian verbal texts were printed.  Now signs on some houses testify to it.  It is located on a hill in the eastern part of the island of Krk in Croatia. </p><p>  It houses one of the best-preserved fortresses in the country, the chapel and bell tower of the Renaissance, and one of the narrowest streets in Europe.  Particular attention is paid to Vrbnik plantations.  Autochthonous grapes are grown on the local slopes, and then Vrbnichka Zhlakhtina wine is made.  Champagne is also produced here, which is not aged in cellars, but under water. </p><h2>  Nature </h2><p>  Krk is famous for its unique nature.  It contains 1400 species of plants, which makes up almost half of all types of Croatia.  In the vicinity of the town of Baska, there is one rare species that is characteristic only for this area - barbašova lazarkinja. </p><p>  A lot of birds nest on the island.  In its northeastern part, bjeloglavi sup or white-headed vulture settles.  This is a large neck, up to one meter in size and wingspan from 2.30 to 2.70 meters.  Typical poultry foods are sheep and other large mammals. </p><p>  There is also a large karst cave of Biseiruk on the island.  It is equipped with lighting and safe trails.  Here you can see beautiful mineral growths, various stalactites and stalagmites.  Its lowest point is at a depth of 13 meters. </p>
