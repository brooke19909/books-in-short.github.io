    <h2>  Upper, Middle and Lower Katun </h2><p>  Routes may vary, depending on requests.  Tourist complex "Manzherok" (Altai Mountains) offers options from 2 to 9 days.  During this time, tourists are invited to pass a section of the path, starting from the Upper Current of the Katun.  Here the river flows quietly along the intermontane basins.  In the direction of movement, you will see how the river is compressed by the Katunsky and Terektinsky ranges and is gaining speed.  Here is the time for rafting.  And then tourists have to overcome the cascade of rapids. </p><h2>  To the foot of the beluga whale </h2><p>  Another route that gathers large groups every year.  From the level of preparation of the group, it can be easier or more complicated.  You can take an easy walk along the shortest route, and there are routes for real professionals.  The beauties of the Katunsky ridge are so amazing that you will dream of local landscapes for a long time.  Peering around is simply impossible.  Alpine meadows, streams and springs, sparkling peaks, beckoning with its unearthly charm.  If you want to conquer your first peak, then order a route with climbing.  Then you will be delivered to the foot of the Beluga as soon as possible, and then your adventure will begin. </p><h2>  The cost of tourist routes </h2><p>  Whatever your income, come to Manzherok.  The prices here can be so different that you can choose a vacation option for every taste and budget.  For budget tourists, camping is a great option, as well as an independent hike in the surrounding mountains.  Detailed cards that are sold at the hotel will not let you get lost.  Such a vacation can be kept at 400 rubles per day. </p><p>  If you decide to use the services of a guide, then, again, the prices will depend on the duration of the trip, the use of vehicles and rental of tourist equipment.  On average, one day can cost from 1800 to 4000 per day. </p><p>  Whatever type of vacation you choose at the Manzherok Hotel, you can be sure that you will return rested and full of strength, as well as wonderful experiences.  Mountain Altai is one of the best places to spend a vacation; no European resort can replace it. </p>
