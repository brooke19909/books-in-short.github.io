  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Famous physicists. Famous nuclear physicists</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Man began to study the laws of nature several millennia ago.  The lack of necessary equipment, the times of religious dictatorship, difficult access to education for people without a significant condition - all this could not stop the progress of scientific thought.  Famous physicists from around the world were able to learn how to transmit information over long distances, receive electricity and much, much more.  What are the most significant names for the story?  We list several of the most prominent specialists. </p><h2>  Albert Einstein </h2><p>  The future scientist was born in March 1879 in the city of Ulm, in Germany.  Albert‚Äôs ancestors lived in Swabia for several hundred years, and even he kept the memory of their heritage until the very last days - he spoke with a slight South German accent.  He was educated at a public school, and then at a gymnasium, where from the very beginning he preferred natural sciences and exact sciences.  By the age of 16, he had mastered everything that was necessary for entering the university, but could not cope with the language exam.  Nevertheless, he soon became a student at the Polytechnic University in Zurich. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous physicists" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/755381.jpg" width="457"></div>  His teachers were famous physicists and mathematicians of that time, for example, German Minkowski, who in the future would come up with an excellent formula for expressing the theory of relativity.  Einstein spent most of his time in the laboratory or reading the works of Maxwell, Kirchhoff, and other leading specialists in this field.  After studying, Albert was a teacher for a while, and then became a technical expert at the patent office, over the years of work in which he published many of his famous works that made him famous all over the world.  He changed people's ideas about space, made a formula that turns mass into a form of energy, and deeply studied molecular physics.  His success was soon awarded the Nobel Prize, and the scientist himself moved to the United States, where he worked until the end of his days.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Nikola Tesla </h2><p>  This inventor from Austria-Hungary is perhaps the most famous physicist in the world. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous Physicists" class="if" height="316" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/755382.jpg" width="475"></div>  The eccentric nature and revolutionary discoveries made him famous and inspired several writers and directors at once to use his image in his work.  He was born in July 1856 and from an early age, like many other famous physicists, began to show his penchant for exact sciences.  Over the years of his work, he discovered the phenomenon of alternating current, fluorescent light and energy transfer without wires, developed a remote control and method of electric current treatment, created an electric clock, a solar motor and many other unique devices for which he received more than three hundred patents.  In addition, it is believed that the famous physicists Popov and Marconi invented the radio, but Tesla was still the first.  Modern electric power industry is completely based on his personal achievements and discoveries.  One of the most striking experiments of Nikola was the transmission of current for fifty kilometers.  He managed to light two hundred light bulbs without any wires, building a huge tower from which lightnings flew out, and thunder was heard throughout the district.  Spectacular and risky venture has become his <span>trademark.</span>  By the way, this experience is often demonstrated in films.

The famous Englishman was born in 1643.  Since childhood, he was interested in physics, over the years he has written works in mathematics, astronomy, and optics.  He was the first to formulate the elementary laws of nature, which greatly influenced the works of his contemporaries.  It is not surprising that <span>Isaac Newton</span> was admitted to the Royal Society of London, and for some time was also its president.

    <h2>  Leo Landau </h2><p>  Like many other famous physicists, Landau proved himself most vividly in the theoretical field.  The legendary Soviet scientist was born in January 1908, in the family of an engineer and a doctor.  He studied brilliantly at school and entered the Baku university, where he began to study physics and chemistry.  By the age of nineteen, he had already published four scientific papers.  A brilliant career was devoted to the study of quantum states and density matrices, as well as electrodynamics.  Landau's achievements were awarded the Nobel Prize, in addition, the Soviet scientist received several <span>Stalin Prizes, the</span> title of Hero of Socialist Labor, was an honorary member of the Royal Society of London and several foreign Academies of Sciences.  Collaborated with Heisenberg, Pauli and Bohr.  The latter influenced Landau especially strongly - his ideas appeared in theories about the magnetic properties of free electrons. </p><h2>  James maxwell </h2><p>  In compiling a list that would include the most famous physicists of the world, one cannot help but mention this <span>name.</span>  <span>James</span> Clerk Maxwell was a British scientist who developed classical electrodynamics.  He was born in June 1831, and by 1860 he became a member of the Royal Society of London.  Maxwell created the country's first physical laboratory with professional equipment.  There he studied electromagnetism, kinetic theory of gases, optics, elasticity and other topics.  He was one of the first to create a device for the quantitative measurement of colors, later called the Maxwell disk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The most famous physicist" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/755391.jpg" width="401"></div>  In his theories, he summarized all the known facts of electrodynamics and introduced the concept of bias current, which generates a magnetic field.  Maxwell expressed all the laws in four equations.  Their analysis allows you to clearly demonstrate patterns that were previously unknown.

    <h2>  Igor Kurchatov </h2><p>  The famous nuclear physicist from the USSR also deserves mention.  Igor Kurchatov grew up in Crimea, where he graduated from high school and university.  Since 1924 he began <span>working as an assistant in the</span> Department of Physics at the Polytechnic Institute of Azerbaijan, and a year later he was hired in Leningrad.  For the successful study of dielectrics, he was awarded the doctorate. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Famous physicists and mathematicians" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/13506/755393.jpg" width="348"></div>  Under his leadership, in 1939 the cyclotron was commissioned.  <span>Igor Kurchatov</span> conducted work on nuclear reactions and led the Soviet atomic project.  Under his leadership, the first nuclear power plant was opened.  Kurchatov created the first Soviet atomic and thermonuclear bomb.  For his achievements, he received several state prizes and medals.
