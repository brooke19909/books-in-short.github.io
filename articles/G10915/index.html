The state is also located on the Mediterranean coast, has a warm climate, good beaches and interesting excursion programs.  In addition, in Tunisia, tourists can try the famous thalassotherapy (healing mud wraps).  If you decide to relax in this country, then it is worth choosing a hotel with quality service.  One of them is the tourist complex El Mouradi Palace 5 * (Sousse).  But is it worth it to stay in it? </p><h2>  Hotel location </h2><p>  The tourist complex is located near Sousse - the most popular youth resort in Tunisia.  In addition to the five-star El Muradi Palace, there are many cheap hotels at the lowest prices.  The city is filled with nightclubs, bars, restaurants, shops, golf courses and pleasure boats that provide guests with an active holiday.  History buffs will be able to visit a huge number of excursions to the ancient monuments of the city. </p><p>  You can get to the El Mouradi Palace 5 * hotel (Tunisia) from <span>Monastir Airport,</span> which is 20 km from Sousse.

Not far from the hotel is the most famous golf club in Tunisia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  general information </h2><p>  The construction of the El Muradi Palace Hotel was completed in 1995, and it began to receive its first tourists in 1996.

They note the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  in some rooms, the carpet needs serious cleaning, it has large dirty spots; </li><li>  the rooms are poorly cleaned, food may be left unfinished by the former guests in the refrigerator, and good service can be obtained only with a tip; </li><li>  garbage and algae are constantly floating in the sea, which are not always cleaned immediately; </li><li>  the staff does not understand well in Russian and in English, sometimes they do not provide an iron, hairdryer and other necessary things; </li><li>  monotonous animation and loud music every night. </li></ul><h2>  Draw conclusions </h2><p>  The hotel El Mouradi Palace 5 * leaves a double impression.  The description of the hotel offers tourists a modern quality vacation, but when they come here, travelers discover that the price does not match the quality.  The complex is significantly short of the title of a five-star hotel, having rather significant shortcomings. </p><p>  If you are not confused by the above disadvantages of the complex, then you can safely go on vacation to El Mouradi Palace 5 *.  Tours are offered by many travel companies.  The cost of rest will primarily depend on the length of stay and food options.  It is safe to say that the hotel is suitable for couples and youth companies.  And families with small children and older people here may be too noisy. </p>
