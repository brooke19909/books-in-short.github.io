    <p>  But despite the fact that the effects of global warming have been recorded by many scientific observations, endless discussions are still going on around this topic.  Some scientists believe that due to <span>climate change</span> on Earth, the onset of the "ice age" is expected.  Others make disappointing forecasts, while others believe that the catastrophic effects of global warming on our planet are highly controversial.  Which of them is right?  Let's try to figure this out. </p><h2>  Global warming concept </h2><p>  What definition can be given to this term?  Global warming on Earth is a process that represents a gradual increase in the average annual temperature in the surface layer of the atmosphere.  It occurs due to an increase in the concentration of <span>greenhouse gases,</span> as well as due to a change in volcanic or solar activity. </p><p>  The problem of global warming began to especially worry the world community at the end of the 20th century.  Moreover, many scientists associate the increase in temperature with the development of industry, which releases methane, carbon dioxide and many other gases into the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect.  What is this phenomenon? </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The greenhouse effect is an increase in the average annual temperature of air masses due to an increase in the concentration of water vapor, methane, etc. These gases are a kind of film that, like glass in a greenhouse, easily passes sunlight through it and traps heat.  However, there is a lot of scientific evidence showing that the causes of global warming on Earth lie not only in the presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  There are many hypotheses.  However, none of them can be accepted with absolute certainty.  Consider the statements of scientists who deserve the most attention. </p><h2>  Hypothesis No. 1 </h2><p>  Many scientists believe that the causes of global warming on our planet lie in an increase in the activity of the Sun.  On this star, meteorologists sometimes observe the so-called <span>sunspots,</span> which are nothing more than powerful magnetic fields.  This phenomenon causes changes in climatic conditions. </p><p>  For centuries, meteorological scientists have been counting the spots that appear on the sun.  Based on the data obtained, the Englishman E. Mondoro in 1983 made an interesting conclusion that over the 14-19 centuries, sometimes called the Small Ice Age, there was no such phenomenon on the Heavenly Star.  And in 1991, scientists from the Danish University of Meteorology studied the "sun spots" recorded over the 20th century.  The conclusion was unequivocal.  Scientists have confirmed the fact that there is a direct correlation between temperature changes on our planet and the activity of the Sun. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hypothesis No. 2 </h2><p>  The Yugoslav astronomer Milankovich suggested that global warming is largely caused by changes in the orbit along which the Earth rotates around the Sun.  Affects climate change and the angle of rotation of our planet. </p><p>  New characteristics in the position and movement of the Earth become the cause of changes in the radiation balance of our planet, and, consequently, in its climate. </p><h2>  The influence of the oceans </h2><p>  It is believed that the oceans are responsible for global climate change on Earth.  Its water element is a large-scale inertial accumulator of solar energy.  Scientists have found that between the thickness of the oceans and the lower atmosphere there is an intense heat exchange.  This leads to significant climate change. </p><p>  In addition, there are about one hundred and forty trillion tons of dissolved carbon dioxide in ocean waters.  Under certain natural conditions, this element enters the atmosphere, also influencing the climate, creating a greenhouse effect. </p><h2>  Action of volcanoes </h2><p>  According to scientists, one of the causes of global climate warming is volcanic activity.  During eruptions, a huge amount of carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere.  It is this that causes the increase in average annual temperatures. </p><h2>  This mysterious solar system </h2><p>  One of the reasons for global climate warming on Earth, according to scientists, is the incompletely studied interactions that exist between the Sun and the planets included in its system.  Changes in temperature on Earth arise in connection with various distributions of <span>gravitational fields</span> and many types of energy. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Nothing can be changed </h2><p>  Among scientists, there is an opinion that global warming occurs on its own, without human influence and any external influences.  Such a hypothesis also has a right to exist, since our planet is a large and very complex system with a lot of various structural elements.  Adherents of this opinion even built various mathematical models confirming the fact that natural fluctuations in the surface air layer can be from 0 to 4 degrees. </p><h2>  Are we to blame for everything? </h2><p>  The most popular cause of global climate warming on our planet is the ever-increasing activity of man, which significantly changes the chemical composition of the atmosphere.  As a result of industrial enterprises, the air is increasingly saturated with greenhouse gases. </p>

    <p>  Specific figures speak in favor of this hypothesis.  The fact is that over the past 100 years, the average air temperature in the lower atmosphere has increased by 0.8 degrees.  For natural processes, this speed is too high, because earlier such changes have occurred over more than one millennium.  Moreover, in recent decades, the rate of increase in air temperature has increased even more. </p><h2>  The trick of the producers or the truth? </h2><p>  To date, the following question cannot be completely resolved: "Global warming - myth or reality?"  There is an opinion that climate change is nothing more than a <span>commercial project.</span>  The history of the consideration of this topic began in 1990. Prior to this, mankind was scared by a horror story about ozone holes, which are formed due to the presence of freon in the atmosphere.  The content of this gas in the air was negligible, but, nevertheless, American manufacturers of refrigerators used this idea.  They did not use freon in the manufacture of their products and waged a merciless war against competitors.  As a result, European companies began to replace cheap freon with an expensive analogue, increasing the cost of refrigerators. </p><p>  Today's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãglobal warming is in the hands of many political forces.  After all, caring for the environment can lead many supporters into their ranks, which will allow them to obtain the coveted power. </p><h2>  Scenarios </h2><p>  Scientists' predictions about what consequences climate change will have on our planet are mixed.  Due to the complexity of the processes taking place on Earth, the situation may develop according to various scenarios. </p><p>  So, there is an opinion that global climate change will occur over the centuries and even millennia.  This is due to the complexity of the relationship between the oceans and the atmosphere.  These powerful energy storage batteries will not be able to rebuild in the shortest possible time. </p><p>  But there is another scenario, according to which global warming will occur relatively quickly on our planet.  By the end of the 21st century, air temperature will increase compared with 1990 by an indicator from 1.1 to 6.4 degrees.  At the same time, intense melting of the ice of the Arctic and Antarctica will begin.  As a result, the waters of the oceans will increase their level.  This process is observed today.  So, from 1995 to 2005.  the thickness of the oceans has already risen by 4 cm. If this process does not slow down, then global warming will become inevitable for many coastal lands.  This will especially affect the populated areas located in Asia. </p><p>  Climate change processes in the western United States and northern Europe will cause an increase in storm frequency and rainfall.  On these lands, hurricanes will rage twice as often as in the 20th century.  What will be the results of global warming under such a scenario for Europe?  In its central territories, the climate will become changeable with warmer winters and rainy summers.  In Eastern and Southern Europe (including the Mediterranean) there will be heat and drought. </p>

    <p>  There are also scientists' predictions according to which a global change in climatic conditions in some parts of our planet will lead to short-term cooling.  This will be facilitated by a slowdown in warm currents caused by the melting of ice caps.  Moreover, a complete stop of these huge carriers of solar energy is possible, which will cause the onset of the next ice age. </p><p>  The greenhouse disaster could be the most unpleasant scenario.  It will be caused by the transition to the atmosphere of carbon dioxide contained in the water column of the oceans.  In addition, as a result of the <span>melting of glaciers</span> , methane will begin to be released from permafrost.  In this case, a monstrous film will form in the lower layers of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, and the temperature increase will take on a catastrophic scale. </p><h2>  The effects of global climate change </h2><p>  Scientists believe that the failure to take drastic measures to reduce greenhouse emissions will lead to an increase in average annual temperature by 1.4-5.8 degrees by 2100.  The effects of global warming will affect the increase in periods of hot weather, which will become more extreme in their temperature regime and longer.  Moreover, the development of the situation will be ambiguous in different regions of our planet. </p><p>  What are the projected effects of global warming on the animal world?  Penguins, seals and polar bears, accustomed to living in polar ice, will be forced to change their habitat.  Moreover, many species of plants and animals will simply disappear if they cannot adapt to new living conditions. </p>

    <p>  Also, global warming will cause climate change on a global scale.  According to scientists, this will cause an increase in the number of floods resulting from hurricanes.  In addition, summer precipitation will be reduced by 15-20%, which will cause desertification of many agricultural territories.  And due to the increase in temperature and water level of the World Ocean, the boundaries of natural zones will begin to shift to the north. </p><p>  What are the effects of global warming on humans?  In the short term, climate change threatens people with problems with drinking water, with the cultivation of agricultural land.  They will lead to an increase in the number of infectious diseases.  Moreover, the most serious blow will be inflicted on the poorest countries, which, in principle, do not bear any responsibility for the upcoming climate change. </p><p>  According to scientists, about six hundred million people will be put on the brink of hunger.  By 2080, people in China and Asia may experience an environmental crisis caused by changes in precipitation and melting glaciers.  The same process will lead to flooding of many small islands and coastal territories.  In the flood-prone zone, there will be about one hundred million people, many of whom will be forced to migrate.  Scientists predict the disappearance of even some states (for example, the Netherlands and Denmark).  It is likely that part of Germany will also be under water. </p><p>  As for the long-term prospects of global warming, it can become the next stage in the evolution of man.  Our distant ancestors faced similar problems in those periods when, after the ice age, the air temperature increased by ten degrees.  Such changes in living conditions have led to the creation of today's civilization. </p><h2>  The consequences of climate change for Russia </h2><p>  Some of our fellow citizens believe that the problem of global warming will affect only residents of other states.  After all, Russia is a country with a cold climate, and an increase in air temperature will only benefit it.  The cost of heating housing and industrial facilities will be reduced.  Agriculture is also expected. </p><p>  What, according to scientists, is global warming and its consequences for Russia?  Due to the length of the territory and the great variety of natural and climatic zones available on it, the results of changes in weather conditions will manifest themselves in different ways.  In some regions they will have a positive character, and in others - a negative one. </p>

    <p>  For example, the average heating period should be reduced by 3-4 days in the country.  And this will provide tangible savings in energy resources.  But at the same time, global warming and its consequences will have another effect.  For Russia, this threatens to increase the number of days with a high and even critical temperature level.  In this regard, the costs of air conditioning of industrial enterprises and buildings will increase.  In addition, the growth of such <span>heat waves</span> will become an unfavorable factor that worsens the health of people, especially those who live in large cities. </p><p>  Global warming is becoming a threat and is already creating problems with permafrost thawing.  <span>Ground subsidence</span> in such areas is dangerous for transport and engineering structures, as well as for buildings.  In addition, when the permafrost melts, the landscape will change with the formation of thermokarst lakes on it. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  There is still no definite answer to the following question: ‚ÄúWhat is global warming - myth or reality?‚Äù  However, this problem is quite tangible and deserves close attention.  According to the comments of scientists, it especially made itself felt in 1996-1997, when a lot of weather surprises were presented to mankind in the form of about 600 various floods and hurricanes, snowfalls and showers, droughts and earthquakes.  During these years, the elements caused colossal material damage in the amount of sixty billion dollars and claimed eleven thousand human lives. </p>
