    <p>  <span>What are</span> exact sciences?  Is it possible to give some clear definitions to them if any knowledge has its own structure and characteristic features, its own theories, laws, and basic concepts.  Along with this, the exact sciences are now called those areas in the context of which exact laws are studied (in a quantitative sense), while rigorous and established methods are used that test hypotheses.  They are based on logical reasoning, which are then reproduced in experiments.  Needless to say, that science and technology are interconnected so much that one without the other practically does not exist.  And the reason for this is that this <span>type of science</span> involves more precise measurements, which contribute to the movement of technological progress. </p><p>  <strong>What exact sciences exist?</strong> </p><p>  This question is most often encountered by schoolchildren who are on the verge of adulthood.  It is extremely important for them to take into account all their <span>individual psychological characteristics in</span> order to choose the right profession.  But it is still a long way to work in a specialty, because it is initially important to get a special education.  That is why if you feel that it is yours and you like it, you can study the exact sciences, the list of which is not so extensive.  So, it is customary to attribute the following to the exact sciences: </p><p>  1. Mathematics - in its context, all its conditional sections (geometry, trigonometry and others) are taken into account.  Of course, the science that we study at school is completely different from the one that we have to comprehend in universities.  Many debate about its accuracy, since it is mathematics that underlies all other sciences. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  2. Computer science and programming also began to be referred to exact sciences.  Needless to say, there is nothing to argue about.  No abstract concepts, everything is obvious and accurate in the style of "if - then."  And programming is now used in many areas of human life. </p><p>  3. Not so long ago, psychology was also included in this list.  Many sincerely oppose the fact that this discipline has entered the category of ‚Äúexact sciences‚Äù.  But in fact, if you look at the theoretical and methodological features of this <span>scientific knowledge,</span> you can understand that this science is just still very young, but, in fact, its basic concepts, theories and laws are always accurate. </p><p>  The exact sciences include natural: </p><p>  1. Physics - this science studies the fundamental and general laws that determine the structure of the material and rational world.  All its laws underlie natural science, which, in turn, is based on mathematics.  But physics can also be called a rather conditional exact science, if you "find fault" with the fact that all research in the category of this knowledge was carried out and formulated under ideal conditions. </p><p>  2. Chemistry is the most extensive field that studies substances, their basic properties, structure and transformations that occur as a result of various chemical reactions.  Just like any other exact sciences, chemistry is based on the fundamental laws to which all studies obey. </p><p>  3. Biology is an exact science that studies living beings and the features of their interaction with the outside world.  All this obeys the laws of chemistry and physics, but the main area for study is directly those aspects of life that include the evolution, growth, structure and functioning of various biological creatures. </p><p>  In contrast to the exact put humanitarian scientific knowledge.  And every year more and more theoretically substantiated disciplines are assigned to this category.  Therefore, any existing classifications are rather arbitrary, and both the exact sciences and the humanities are closely interconnected and can hardly exist without each other. </p>
