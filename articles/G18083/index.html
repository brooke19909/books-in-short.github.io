  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3d TVs without glasses have every chance to conquer the market</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Manufacturers of household and electronic appliances, driven by fierce competition, offer us new technologies and models, inventing and implementing them at a rapid pace.  Until recently, there was a competition between conventional LCD TVs and liquid crystal devices with LED backlighting, and now the market is already filled with technology that allows you to play 3d images at home.  3D TVs appeared in the exhibition halls of CES and IFA only in 2010, and many well-known companies immediately engaged in their industrial production. </p><p>  <strong>3</strong> <strong>D television with passive and active glasses</strong> </p><p>  Developing technologies of passive and active surround television systems, world leaders staged a real race in the struggle for the client and for increasing their niche in the market.  Using passive 3D technologies, LG and Vizio release their products, the active option is the choice of Sony, Samsung and Panasonic.  Both technologies have advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>  So, 3d TVs with passive glasses create a certain effect of a three-dimensional image, but the picture is dull and faded, and part of the color information is lost.  Active stereo glasses with built-in chips control the shading of the desired lenses.  For the 3D effect in active glasses, a wireless synchronization scheme implemented using <span>infrared radiation</span> with a reproduced image on a TV screen is used.  The picture in active glasses turns out to be brighter and better. </p><p>  But manufacturers, among them Samsung, obviously, in order to avoid legal liability, published research results on the possible consequences of using 3D glasses.  They indicate the harm of 3d glasses to human health.  Side effects include <span>dizziness, nausea,</span> disorientation, convulsions, blurred vision, fainting, and muscle cramps.  For these reasons, watching 3D movies is not recommended for young children, the elderly, and pregnant women. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  <strong>3d TVs without glasses</strong> </p><p>  If we take into account the fact that many consumers do not welcome the use of glasses for watching programs and movies, 3d TVs without glasses are a logical next step in the development of 3d technology.  At CES 2011, Sony, Toshiba and LG presented their models that impressed visitors to the exhibition with image quality and the novelty of technological solutions. </p><p>  What is the difference between 3d TVs without glasses from previous models?  They use the principle of two shifted images located very close to each other.  Our brain and eyes do not really need to do anything to form a 3D image.  Panels on which playback is possible should have a <span>resolution that is</span> significantly higher than normal Full HD, namely, 1080p (1920 x 1080).  They were nicknamed 4K TVs. </p><p>  The panel broadcasts two frames at the same time, taken from slightly different angles.  A special filter separates the two images and displays them with hardly excellent points of view.  The eyes of the audience perceive individual images, which becomes the reason for the formation of a 3D effect.  In this case, when the gaze is shifted from the active point, the volumetric effect will be violated, and the person will experience the crosstalk in the form of a double edge of the objects, or the 3D image will disappear completely.  For 3d TVs to work without glasses, you must be in a certain area at some, a certain distance from the 3D screen. </p><p>  Microsoft and other well-known companies are actively working to develop technologies that combine dynamic filters on top of the screen, a camera mounted in the TV and a system that can detect faces or track eye movements.  Such smart 3d TVs without glasses continuously adjust the filters to the current position of the pupils of the audience, so that the zone of best perception is kept in the field of view of your eyes.  At the moment, the Microsoft Applied Sciences division already owns a prototype 3D display that can track four users at the same time, displaying a ‚Äúbezel-less‚Äù 3D television for them.  Nintendo has a similar technology, it has been used in portable 3DS gaming devices. </p><p>  Active rivalry between companies and effective work on the invention of new methods of 3d television promises us that soon the market will fill with high-quality, free from imperfections products at affordable prices.  And broadcasting channels with a three-dimensional image will become the only expedient in a modern, rapidly developing world. </p>
