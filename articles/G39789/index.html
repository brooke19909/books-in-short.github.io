By the way, many lakes of the Kemerovo region are of mainland origin.  There are also those that arose in the river valleys.  They are called floodplain.  Let's look at some of them. </p><h2>  Big Berchikul Lake </h2><p>  The pond is located near the village of Tiskul.  This lake is the largest in Kuzbass.  It has no surface tributaries.

    <h2>  Lake Tanaevo </h2><p>  This is a picturesque pond located near the village of Zhuravlevo.  It is small: the depth does not exceed 2-3 meters.
