Almost every one of them has a unique design.  Mobile phone Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual - a bright representative of the extraordinary imagination of Sony engineers.  It is about him that will be discussed in this article. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Following its design trends, Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual appears in a special way to the user.  Firstly, the phone is simply huge - the display size is 6 inches.  Its total length is 16.5 cm, and its width is 8, which is slightly out of the usual sizes of gadgets.  When viewed from the front, it forms a classic rectangular case.  But just touch its edges, and it becomes clear that they are rounded along a small radius. </p>

    <p>  Despite the size, users appreciated the usability, judging by the reviews on the <span>Sony Xperia</span> XA1 Ultra Dual.  The dimensions themselves seem to make it hold tight. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  As stated earlier, the screen size is 6 inches.  At a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels, the final density is quite high - 367 pixels per inch.  The screen itself is made using IPS technology and has a scratch-resistant glass.  Viewing angles are excellent, color reproduction is also on top.  On some images, slight distortion may be observed, but this is if you look closely. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Performance </h2><p>  The hardware in the smartphone is decent.  The main load is borne by the MediaTek Helio P20 processor.  It is made using 16 nm technology, which has significantly reduced power consumption.  Cores 8, 4 of them operate at a frequency of 2.4 GHz and 4 at 1.6.  The graphics chip is a productive Mali-T880 MP2 with a frequency of 900 MHz.  This allows you to run heavy applications and games without "brakes" and "lags." </p>

    <p>  RAM 4 GB.  For everyday work more than suitable.  32 GB are declared built-in, but about 24 is available. If this volume also ceases to be enough, you can install a flash card up to 256 GB. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  Traditionally, cameras on Sony products are some of the best.  Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual in this regard also adheres to the general trend.  The main camera has 23 MP, the front - 16. The main module can recognize faces and smiles, has intelligent autofocus and is able to shoot video in Full HD format.  Frontalka can be used mainly for selfies, although the main cameras of some devices may envy the quality of its images. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  The application for shooting is full of various modes and settings.  You can set the parameters for almost all types of images.  Their quality, by the way, is excellent.  Not to say that professionals will appreciate it, but for amateur photos this can be called an ideal.  However, under special conditions or in low light, some color distortion may occur. </p><h2>  Software </h2><p>  The smartphone is controlled using the latest version of the Android operating system - 7.0.  In the stock version, there are several pre-installed factory applications such as album and music. </p><p>  The system works without ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù and ‚Äúhangs‚Äù, technical parameters and optimization are working at the proper level. </p><h2>  Interfaces </h2><p>  The number of interfaces is rich.  For communication there are all known GSM standards, as well as LTE.  It is especially worth highlighting the equipment of the smartphone with NFC technology.  Wi-Fi allows you to connect to wireless networks.  For navigation, GPS and domestic GLONASS are used. </p><h2>  Autonomy </h2><p>  For such productive characteristics and the screen, the battery capacity does not seem so big - only 2700 mAh.  But there is a special STAMINA energy saving mode, which disables the transfer of mobile data and Wi-Fi in the background. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  Both cameras pleased users with the quality of their pictures.  Someone even confirmed that this is a business card of Sony. </p><p>  As for navigation and other interfaces, here the reviews about the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual are positive. </p><h2>  Negative comments </h2><p>  As for the negative reviews about the smartphone Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual, here it is not special and critical. </p><p>  Basically, they concern not ideal sound quality, but also pictures.  A couple of users had problems interacting with the system.  For example, some brakes in the operation of the Android interface have been described, freezes and, as a result, a reboot. </p>

    <p>  Also in one of the reviews about the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual smartphone, it was noted that when the signal is weak, the battery is consumed much faster. </p><h2>  Overview of nearby competitors </h2><p>  The first in a range of similar smartphones is probably the Xiaomi Mi A1 64 GB.  Its cost varies from 16 to 18 thousand rubles.  Moreover, the set of characteristics in some ways even surpasses the hero of the article. </p><p>  Version "Android" in the device 7.1.  The screen resolution is the same, however, the size is slightly smaller - 5.5 inches.  But then the resulting density is 401 pixels per inch.  The cameras, of course, cannot match the XA1 and have 12 MP each.  The device can work in all known network standards up to 4G.  Under the hood, he has a very effective Snapdragon 625 with 8 cores at 2000 MHz.  The amount of RAM is not inferior to the Sony Xperia XA1, but the built-in memory is twice as much - 64 GB.  The battery in this phone allows you to be a little autonomous due to the volume of 3080 mAh. </p><p>  Lenovo Phab 2 Plus can be purchased for about 20 thousand rubles, plus or minus 2 thousand.  The smartphone screen is significantly larger and has 6.4 inches at the same resolution as the Xperia.  The camera is only 13 megapixels, the older Android, and less by 1 gigabyte of RAM.  But on board there is a large supply of energy - 4050 mAh. </p><p>  Another worthy opponent is the ZTE Nubia Z11 Max.  Screen size and resolution are similar.  The camera is slightly weaker - 16 MP.  The ability to work in any communication standard is.  The eight-core Snapdragon 652 can be distinguished from the computational filling. The graphics are implemented due to the Adreno 510 capacities. The RAM is identical to the monitored smartphone, but it has twice as much built-in memory - 64 GB.  All this is served by a reliable 4000 mAh battery.  The cost of this ZTE model is an average of 18-23 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews on the characteristics of the Sony Xperia XA1 Ultra Dual, it may seem that all of them are left by fans of the company's products.  Indeed, among competitors there are more productive devices with equal other characteristics.  Excellent cameras can become a stumbling block, but only a professional can evaluate such camera performance on the phone.  It is possible that someone will be pleased with an interesting approach to design, which has its own trends for several series of smartphones. </p><p>  In general, judging by the review and reviews, the Sony Xperia XA1 smartphone is a worthy device.  But whether it is suitable for each user is difficult to understand.  A person who takes photographs every six months is unlikely to need 23 megapixel cameras.  It will be more profitable for him to pay for the computing cores and the RAM.  For fans of ubiquitous photographs, the phone will be right at the time, well, for Sony fans in general. </p>
