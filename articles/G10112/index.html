  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mating dogs. What breeders should know</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every professional breeder must know how to breed dogs.  It would seem that the process is completely natural and one hundred percent already inherent in nature in animal genes.  Is the role of the owner in this situation also important?  Yes, and very much so.  After all, the breeding of dogs in the wild and at home varies greatly.  Let's take a closer look at the basic nuances that every owner of a thoroughbred male or female should know. </p><p>  Every year, everyone is sure to watch so-called ‚Äúdog weddings‚Äù from time to time, when a whole flock of dogs chases one female.  Such a picture arises only if the bitch does not belong to any particular group of animals.  After all, then she usually already pre-makes a pair of dominant individuals of the opposite sex.  And even before the female begins the estrus period.  Mating dogs in this case occurs approximately as follows.  At first, the bitch does not allow the dog to be close to her.  Moreover, she can even bite him.  However, if the dog is pleasant to her, as well as familiar, then soon the next period begins.  The bitch ceases to zealously run away from her "gentleman", and he, in turn, takes the so-called "asking" pose.  It looks as follows.  The animal presses its chest against the ground and extends one front paw towards the partner.  After that, peculiar games or courtship courtship begin.  Animals chase each other, behave playfully and very friendly.  At the same time, a male from time to time may make efforts to cage (the so-called mating of dogs, when the male takes a pose for frictions).  At the end, the bitch reaches an extreme degree of excitement and is no longer trying to break away from her partner.  The male penetrates into it, while fixing the animal with its front paws, so that the inexperienced female does not make attempts to twist.  In the process, there comes a moment of gnawing, when the internal muscles of the bitch almost tightly fix the male inside.  It can last up to several hours (an average of 20 minutes). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since mating dogs at home is quite spontaneous, the animals have virtually no time to get to know each other.  Sometimes they are not even allowed to sniff before mating.  If you let the whole process drift, then the consequences can be very sad.  For example, a male dog will even perceive a female who is in a heat estrus stage hostile, as she has entered its territory.  Or a bitch, frightened by a sharp change in situation, will not only not let her partner in, but will completely discourage him from mating with a rude refusal.  In any case, for the whole procedure to take place, the animals will need a lot of time, which the owners may well not have.  In this case, dog owners are forced to act in a somewhat unnatural way. </p><p>  The owner of the bitch rigidly fixes her in the position most comfortable for the dog.  The owner of the second animal makes sure that it is constantly excited not only from the sight of the finished partner, but also from the smell of its secretions.  Owners have to severely suppress any attempts at courtship and rutting, as well as the so-called "puppy" cages (front and side).  When the mating of the dogs has already occurred, it is recommended that the bitch be left in the muzzle until the mating has passed.  Otherwise, due to unpleasant sensations, she may well become angry with the male and cripple him. </p><p>  The breeding male must learn to quickly become excited without any prior courtship.  However, if the owners are dealing with an inexperienced animal, then it may well be too early to "give it out."  If the dog shows signs of overexcitation (excessive fussiness, repeated and unsuccessful attempts to cage, etc.), then it is better to bring the dog out for a while.  Otherwise, it will take him many more hours to regain his strength. </p>
