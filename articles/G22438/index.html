    <p>  What other ATM addresses are known?  Alfa-Bank selects the operating mode and location of its points in such a way that it is convenient for busy residents of St. Petersburg as well.  For good reason, money machines are installed at many metro stations.  Access to them is open from 5:30 to 24:00.  At the Nevsky Prospekt station, there is one, as well as at the Gostiny Dvor station. </p><h2>  ATMs and offices on Moskovsky Prospect </h2><p>  Due to the rich set of attractions, a large flow of pedestrians passes through Moskovsky Prospekt in St. Petersburg. </p><p>  The following Alfa-Bank branches are known in this area: </p><p>  1. Credit and cash office "Victory Park" at the address: Moskovsky Prospect, d. 192-194, pom.  19H, lit.  A. </p><p>  2. Credit and cash office "Moskovsky Prospekt" at the address: 193 Moskovsky Ave. </p><p>  Both offices work on weekdays until 20:00, on Saturday - until 19:00. </p><p>  What other ATM addresses are known in this area?  Alfa-Bank installed several more money machines on Moskovsky Prospect with the famous white letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù on a red background.  One of them is located at the Technological Institute metro station, the other is located in the SMT outpatient complex at 22 Moskovsky Prospekt. </p><p>  An ATM is open daily until 24:00 in the M-Video store near the Olimpia Garden, at 44 Moskovsky Prospekt. A hardware hypermarket is a partner of Alfa-Bank.  If you often make purchases at M-Video, then it makes sense to issue a special plastic card at the bank.  On it will be awarded bonus rubles. </p><h2>  ATMs on Vasilievsky Island </h2><p>  Many customers are interested in the question of where Alfa-ATMs are located on Vasilievsky Island.  You can name, for example, the following addresses: </p><ul><li>  Maly Prospect V.O., 88/2 (in the building of the Skipper Mall). </li><li>  Sredny prospekt V.O., 21st Line, 6 A (on Beeline premises). </li><li>  Sredny prospekt, 38 (Perekrestok hypermarket). </li></ul><p>  There is also a modern ATM at the Vasileostrovskaya metro station. </p><p>  A cash machine operates around the clock at the following address: 7th Line VO, 54. It is located in the building of the St. Petersburg-Vasileostrovsky credit and cash office. </p><h2>  Partner banks </h2><p>  Alfa-Bank JSC establishes partnerships with other financial institutions.  This allows its customers to withdraw money from ATMs of different banks without commission.  This is true for Visa and MasterCard. </p><p>  Partner addresses are also mapped on Alfa-Bank‚Äôs website.  These include PJSC BINBANK and owned by the same owners PJSC MDM Bank. </p><p>  At ATMs of Gazbrombank and MKB, not only withdrawals are available.  Through them, you can even deposit cash into a card account opened with Alfa-Bank.  Funds are not credited instantly, but on the same day.  It is important to know that the amount that can be paid per day is limited.  For example, at the Moscow Credit Bank ATMs, it is possible to conduct operations with Alfa Bank only within the range of 480 thousand rubles. </p><p>  Partners also include Rosselkhozbank, Rosbank and UBRiR. </p><h2>  Internet banking for individuals </h2>

    <p>  When servicing at Alfa Bank, the client does not have to know where the ATMs and payment terminals are located.  In most cases, he can simply use the Alfa-Click online bank for individuals.  Having a card, and to it - a secret username and password, the client will carry out almost any operation in cashless form.  You can do it yourself: </p><ul><li>  open a personal bank account; </li><li>  order a card; </li><li>  repay a loan; </li><li>  place funds on deposit at interest; </li><li>  make investments in mutual funds. </li></ul><p>  Alfa-Click also allows you to analyze the structure of personal expenses and compare it with the previous month. </p><p>  Full details for payments are not required.  Many Russian organizations, especially those that accept utility bills or monthly fees, are already entered into the system and loaded automatically. </p><p>  Therefore, ATMs are becoming less and less busy.  Alfa-Bank in St. Petersburg (where we have already discussed the self-service points) reports the necessary information to customers through the Internet bank. </p><h2>  Mobile Bank </h2><p>  The Alfa-Mobile application for operations on cards and accounts is installed on a tablet or smartphone based on Android, App Store or Windows Store.  Having a personal login and password, you can quickly: </p><ul><li>  Recognize account balances </li><li>  carry out any operations; </li><li>  analyze expenses; </li><li>  chat in direct chat with the bank. </li></ul><p>  The last option allows customers to ask operators, for example, about where the nearest Alfa-Bank ATM is located in St. Petersburg, if it works, how many people are currently in the queue. </p><p>  Each payment transaction is confirmed by SMS-password.  In addition, Alfa-Bank has a special system that tracks emergency cases when scammers clone a SIM card and try to enter a mobile bank.  All operations in this case are immediately blocked. </p>
