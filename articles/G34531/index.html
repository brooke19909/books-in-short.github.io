In nature, it is found in the form of a mineral. </p><p>  <strong>Application</strong> </p><p>  Copper is one of the trace elements needed by plants.  In agriculture, it is used in the form of Bordeaux <span>liquid (a solution of</span> copper sulfate in milk of lime) from grape aphids and various fungal diseases.  In addition, it has a beneficial effect on the process of respiration and photosynthesis of plants. </p><p>  Copper sulfate is also used for seed dressing before planting, thus destroying mold spores on the seeds. </p><p>  Copper sulfate (aqueous solution) is used to neutralize the effects of leaks, remove salts, rust stains from plastered, concrete and brick surfaces;  give wood refractory properties and prevent its decay by impregnating the wood with a solution of copper sulfate. </p><p>  Anhydrous copper sulfate is used as an indicator of indoor humidity.  In laboratories, it is used to dry ethanol and other substances. </p><p>  Copper sulfate is used in the manufacture of mineral paints, in the production of <span>acetate fiber</span> (part of the spinning solutions).  It can be used to detect zinc, magnesium and manganese in stainless steel and <span>aluminum alloys.</span> </p><p>  Copper sulfate in the food industry is used as a preservative (food additive) E519.  In animal husbandry - as mineral additives in animal feed. </p><p>  Used in medicine as an astringent, antiseptic and cauterizing agent.  In cases of <span>white phosphorus</span> poisoning, it is recommended to rinse the stomach with a 0.1% solution of copper sulfate. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Copper sulfate is also used in electroplating - when coating copper with metal products;  in the metallurgical industry;  in nickel plating processes, and as a feedstock in the preparation of other compounds. </p><p>  <strong>Copper sulfate: properties</strong> </p><p>  Copper sulfate is a non-combustible, fire- and explosion-proof substance.  Very hygroscopic.  It is odorless, has no metallic taste.  It is well soluble in water, in diluted alcohol and in a concentrated solution of hydrochloric acid.  When heated, it loses water and turns gray.  If, after cooling, dripping water on a gray powder, it again acquires a blue color.  It is completely dehydrated at a temperature of 258C.  Melts at a temperature of 1100C.  Chalcanthite, butite, chalcocyanite, and others are found in nature in the form of minerals. </p><p>  <strong>Sulphate Crystal</strong> </p><p>  It is easy to grow a beautiful blue crystal of copper sulfate at home (by the way, it will be possible to grow violet crystals from <span>chromium-potassium alum</span> and colorless crystals from table salt in the same way).  The whole process will take two to three weeks. </p><p>  To work, you will need wire, thread, a glass jar and copper sulfate (or any other selected salt).  A very concentrated salt solution is prepared: we add, constantly stirring, the salt in a jar of water until it stops dissolving.  Then slightly warm the mixture, for better dissolution of the salt, for which the can (or glass) is placed in a pan with heated water. </p><p>  The concentrated solution obtained in this way is poured into a beaker, a small crystal of the same salt is suspended there with a wire jumper, immersed in a thread on the thread.  On this crystal (seed) the crystal we need will grow. </p><p>  We place the glass with the solution in the open form in a warm place and observe how the crystal grows.  When it becomes large enough, we take it out of the solution, dry it with a paper towel or a soft cloth, cut the thread and cover it with a colorless varnish (so as not to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù in the air). </p><p>  The resulting crystal is very similar to a gem. </p>
