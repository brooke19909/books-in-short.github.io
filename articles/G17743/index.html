    <h2>  Description and design features of the model </h2><p>  The color range in which the Panasonic SD-2511WTS bread machine is presented is rather modest.  The case is made in black or white, so the device fits perfectly into absolutely any kitchen interior.  This model allows you to bake bread and other flour products weighing up to a kilogram.  Since the structure itself is vertical with a built-in metal shape, all baking takes the form of a loaf.  According to many users, a very convenient option is the ability to independently choose what color a crisp should be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The case itself is made of durable plastic to facilitate a rather voluminous design. </p><h2>  How to use? </h2><p>  The bread maker is controlled by the display, which is located on the top cover.  The board indicates all the information about the existing modes, baking time, here you need to choose the weight of baking.

Thanks to the powerful and modern dispenser, any pastries can be prepared both in the classic version and with any additional ingredients (walnut, raisins, bran, etc.).  There is a cheat sheet under the dispenser lid, which will help you choose the right program. </p><p>  As users recommend, after the end of the program you do not need to immediately get the finished bread, it is worth letting it stand for 15-30 minutes, then it will not lose its airiness. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="panasonic panasonic sd 2511wts bread makers" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23597/1730797.jpg"></div>
