Reign of Elizabeth I</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Elizaveta Petrovna ascended the throne as a result of a coup in 1741.  She was the daughter of the famous emperor Peter I and Catherine I. Foreign and domestic policy of Elizabeth Petrovna was aimed at continuing the reforms of her father.  The empress preferred to lead an idle life, and power in the state was in the hands of the favorites.  Despite this, her reign was marked by a series of transformations.  In this article, we will discuss the reforms carried out by Elizaveta Petrovna, and briefly consider her foreign and domestic policies. </p><h2>  On the way to power </h2><p>  <span>Elizaveta Petrovna was</span> born in 1709.  There is evidence that she was the beloved daughter of the emperor.  Elizabeth received a good education.  Peter I, hoping to marry his daughter to Louis XV, invited the best teachers to teach her French.  In the character of Elizabeth, temper and capriciousness were combined.  Historians note that the future empress loved to wear luxurious dresses, loved to dance and was engaged in horse riding. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Foreign and domestic policy of Elizabeth Petrovna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/834923.jpg" width="343"></div>

    <p>  After the death of Peter I, Elizabeth's nephew Peter II ascended the throne.  After his death in 1730, Anna Ioannovna came to power.  At this time, the authority of the highest power fell significantly.  After the death of Anna Ioannovna, the throne was taken by her nephew <span>Ivan VI,</span> but due to his young age, Anna Leopoldovna ruled the country.  The policy of this regent was dissatisfied with the highest circles of Russian society. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Coup d'etat </h2><p>  The accession to the throne of Elizabeth Petrovna was connected with the coup d'etat of 1741. It was the result of a conspiracy in the highest public circles, and the organizers were I. G. Lestok and the future empress.  The coup was accomplished with the help of the guards of the <span>Preobrazhensky regiment.</span>  In November 1741, two manifestos were published.  They officially confirmed the accession to the throne of Elizabeth Petrovna and declared the reign of Ivan VI illegal. </p><p>  It should be noted that the empress was assisted in organizing the coup by I. Lestok, A. Shuvalov, P. Shuvalov, A. Razumovsky, M. Vorontsov.  It was they who became the main support of Elizabeth during the years of her reign. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elizabeth 1" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/834924.jpg" width="381"></div>

    <h2>  Political reform </h2><p>  In 1740  Elizaveta Petrovna‚Äôs foreign and domestic policy was aimed at returning to the Petrine reforms.  Having ascended the throne, she returned to the Senate the rights that he had during the reign of her father.  During the reign of Empress <span>Elizabeth 1, the</span> activities of this body were not marked by any major transformations.  The main measures of the Senate were aimed at solving problems as they arise. </p><p>  The political reforms of Elizabeth Petrovna also affected the Cabinet of Ministers.  This body has been abolished.  Instead, the empress established the Conference at the highest court.  She controlled the activities of the legislative body - the Senate. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Also, during the time of Elizabeth Petrovna, the work of the Main Magistrate, the Berg and Manufactory Collegiums was resumed. </p><p>  It should be noted that the empress‚Äôs favorites and the people who helped her ascend to the throne occupied the highest posts at the court.  Among them, one can distinguish nobles from the Vorontsov, Razumovsky and Shuvalov clans. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Reforms of Elizabeth Petrovna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/834932.jpg" width="379"></div>

    <h2>  Social politics </h2><p>  The social policy of the empress was aimed at strengthening the autocracy and was of a pro-noble character.  As a result of the reforms carried out by Elizaveta Petrovna, the peasants were even more dependent on privileged persons.  In 1760, the nobles received the right to exile serfs in Siberia.  In addition, the peasants could not engage in financial affairs without the permission of the landowner.  They also, of their own free will, were not able to enter military service.  Since 1764, only peasants of noble origin could keep peasants in their possession. </p><p>  It should be noted that during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna the death penalty was abolished.  Instead, it began to apply milder methods, although the practice of corporal punishment on landlords and in the army continued to exist. </p><h2>  Peasant unrest </h2><p>  Foreign and domestic policies of Elizabeth Petrovna led to a significant deterioration in the situation of peasants.  This has led to protests in their midst.  The dissatisfaction of the peasants was manifested primarily in mass shoots, robberies of landowners' estates and robbery.  This was often accompanied by the murders of the nobles. </p><p>  Also during the reign of Elizabeth mass peasant revolts broke out.  At the beginning of 1740  unrest occurred among the Bashkirs.  In 1743, the Teryushevsky uprising began.  The imperial authorities managed to suppress it only in the middle of 1745. </p><h2>  Economic policy </h2><p>  Reforms of Elizabeth Petrovna also affected the economic sphere.  In 1754, she abolished customs duties within the country.  This reform helped to eliminate Russia's economic fragmentation and revitalize trade relations.  In 1757, customs duties on goods imported into the country were increased.  Russia during the time of Elizabeth Petrovna conducted lively trade with the West European powers (England, France) and the eastern states. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Accession to the throne of Elizabeth Petrovna" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/834933.jpg" width="399"></div>

    <p>  By order of the empress, new <span>banks</span> were created <span>: Noble</span> and Merchant.  Their discovery contributed to the development of entrepreneurship in the Russian Empire.  Also during the reign of Elizabeth Petrovna, the nobility received a monopoly on distillation. </p><p>  In the 40-60s.  XVIII century  actively developed manufacturing.  New enterprises were opened in Irkutsk, Yaroslavl, Tambov, Ivanovo, etc. </p><h2>  Cultural Development of Russia </h2><p>  Speaking about the development of Russia in the 40-60s.  XVIII century., It is important to note the policy in the field of culture, which was pursued by Elizaveta Petrovna.  The years of her reign were marked by achievements in the field of education, science, architectural construction, etc. It is from the time of Elizabeth in Russia that the Enlightenment begins. </p><p>  By decree of the empress, military educational institutions were reorganized.  In addition, the first gymnasiums were opened in the capital and in Kazan.  In 1755 Moscow University was founded, and after 2 years - the Academy of Arts. </p><p>  The Empress paid much attention to the arrangement of the monarch's residences.  An architect of Italian origin, Rastrelli, was invited to build the <span>Winter Palace</span> .  He also arranged the <span>Catherine Palace</span> in Tsarskoye Selo.  The former residences of Peter I Peterhof and Strelna were also transformed. </p><p>  During the reign of Elizabeth, the first public theaters were founded in Yaroslavl and St. Petersburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elizabeth Petrovna years" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/834934.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Foreign policy in the 1740s </h2><p>  As noted earlier, the foreign and domestic policies of Elizabeth Petrovna were aimed at strengthening the position of the imperial power.  Prior to her accession to the throne, Russia participated in the war with Sweden.  The commander in chief of the army was appointed P.P. Lassi.  After Elizabeth came to power, Russian troops managed to capture the entire territory of Finland.  Peace talks between the countries began in 1743.  The delegates from Russia to them were A. Rumyantsev and I. Lyuberas.  Abo Peace was concluded in 1743.  Under its terms, part of Finland passed to Russia. </p><h2>  Russia in the Seven Years War </h2><p>  2 coalitions of European states took part in this war.  The first included England, Portugal and Prussia, the second included Austria, France, Sweden, Saxony, Spain and Russia.  Elizabeth 1 declared joining the war in 1757. This was due to the policy of Prussia, which threatened the territorial interests of the Russian Empire in the Baltic states and Poland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Elizaveta Petrovna table" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33430/834939.jpg" width="336"></div>

    <p>  In the early 50s, the empress had a new favorite.  His name was Ivan Shuvalov.  He was a fairly educated person, he loved science and art, and also maintained close friendships with M. Lomonosov. </p><p>  The connection with several favorites and the rampant life of the empress gave rise to a lot of rumors about secretly born children.  After the death of Elizabeth Petrovna, impostors began to appear.  They declared themselves children of the Empress.  The most famous impostor was Princess Tarakanova. </p><h2>  Lifestyle </h2><p>  Contemporaries of Elizabeth Petrovna noted her intelligence and kindness.  However, these qualities were completely crossed out by extraordinary laziness and thirst for entertainment.  The empress led a reckless lifestyle, often drank alcohol.  It was rather indifferent to state affairs.  Russian diplomats during the reign of Elizabeth noted that treaties on the conclusion of peace could lie with her for months without a signature. </p><p>  Shortly before her death, the empress was seized with fear of loneliness.  She was afraid to spend the night alone in the room.  In addition, she constantly thought about revenge on the ghosts of people tortured or sent to Siberia on her orders.  Every night Elizabeth Petrovna spent in different chambers of the palace. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  Elizaveta Petrovna was on the throne for 20 years.  Despite the rampant lifestyle and indifference to state affairs, her reign was marked by a number of reforms and cultural achievements.  The following features of the policy of Elizabeth Petrovna can be distinguished. </p><p>  1. The initial stage of the reign of the empress was marked by progressive reforms.  However, already in the 50s, conservative traits appeared in the politics of Elizabeth 1.  During this period, the situation of the peasantry worsened significantly, as evidenced by the uprisings. </p><p>  2. Noble policies aimed at increasing his privileges. </p><p>  3. In foreign policy, the western vector prevailed.  As a result of the wars, part of Finland was annexed to Russia. </p><p>  4. The development of science and culture.  The reign of Elizabeth Petrovna was marked by the first steps towards <span>enlightened absolutism.</span> </p>
