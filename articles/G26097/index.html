  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Voip gateway will allow you to create high-quality and cheap communication</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Any large company or organization incurs large expenses for paying for telephone calls.  But it turns out that you can significantly reduce this expense item by purchasing a voip gateway.  Today, the development of IP-telephony is growing rapidly and it pays off pretty quickly.  Re-equipment of any existing telephone exchange is carried out quickly, since a voip gateway is easy to install.  Such modernization will reduce costs for both long-distance and international negotiations. </p><p>  Voip gateway is very beneficial for large corporations that have their branches not only in different cities, but, possibly, in different countries.  The use of this device allows you to transfer all phone calls to the Internet.  If you installed the voip adapter, now you will pay much less, even if you have a megabyte charge for traffic. </p><p>  Until recently, communication via the Internet could only be done by its users.  A Voip gateway also allows telephone network users to communicate over the Internet.  The cost of such equipment is small, and you will appreciate the benefits literally immediately after connecting it. </p><p>  There are several reasons for obtaining cheaper communication when using VoIP equipment, and the main ones are: </p><p>  - if networks with packet communication, which are used in traditional telephony, are quite expensive for consumers, then using a voip gateway, you will get already worked out solutions that are much cheaper in the form of networks with packet communication; </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  - when using this equipment vocoders or voice codecs are used.  It is their use that allows you to get digitized speech, the traffic of which is much less. </p><p>  To understand the difference between IP-telephony and digital telephony, we can say that the <span>bandwidth of the</span> first is about 6-13 kbit / s, while for the second it is necessary to provide a channel of 64 kbit / s (ISDN). </p><p>  Typically, communication with traditional providers that provide long-distance and international telephony services occurs in two ways: </p><p>  - using the telephone network, while the voip client dials the server number, then authentication is performed using the pin code, and then you can dial the desired number.  The disadvantage of this method is the obligatory availability of a regular city number; </p><p>  - The use of a VoIP gateway allows you to make all calls without having to have a <span>landline number.</span>  For it to work, you only need an Internet channel that the provider will provide you with.  Also, hardware or software IP telephones can be used instead of gateways. </p><p>  With the installation of this equipment, it becomes possible to create a corporate telephone network.  At the same time, you can conduct all telephone calls within the company using an internal IP network.  These networks perform the following functions: </p><p>  - give high mobility to all users, since the connection can be made at any access point to the IP network; </p><p>  - receiving communications between branches located in different cities; </p><p>  - all users are combined in one range of numbers; </p><p>  - allows you to widely use services such as audio or video conferencing; </p><p>  - It is not difficult to create centers for processing telephone calls. </p><p>  The use of VoIP makes it possible to implement a number of functions that cannot be implemented using conventional telephone networks: </p><p>  - the opportunity to make calls directly from the company‚Äôs website, the so-called click2Dial call; </p><p>  - the use of automatic voice informants, as well as conferences, both audio and video; </p><p>  - viewing all missed calls using <span>voicemail</span> ; </p><p>  - the ability to determine online and offline status of the subscriber in the network, etc. </p>
