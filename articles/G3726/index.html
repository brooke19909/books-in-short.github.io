Today, through our windows and windows, a mixture of gases with dust and pollutants comes into our homes that is hardly useful.  As additional sources of pollution in houses, modern materials for construction and decoration, household chemicals and gas appliances often act.  To ensure effective cleaning, it is required to install a purifier and a humidifier at home, which will not only eliminate unnecessary impurities, but also raise the humidity level to the optimum value.  These are special climatic devices, without which the life of a modern person is greatly complicated. </p>

    <h2>  Home <span>Air Purifiers</span> </h2><p>  The air purifier is designed to rid indoor air of poplar fluff, <span>dust, tobacco</span> smoke, dangerous bacteria, allergens, odors and harmful impurities.  In terms of design, this is usually a device that includes an engine and a set of filters that allow you to achieve the highest quality air purification from all kinds of impurities.  Modern devices can have several fan speeds, so that the performance is regulated quite flexibly.  The cleaner can be floor or suspended.  The humidifier-ionizer, in contrast to it, has only a desktop version. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Device types </h2><p>  Devices that are installed under the ceiling are more focused on cleaning the air from all kinds of volatile pollutants, such as tobacco smoke, and they do not do very well with ordinary dust.  Power can be up to 2000 watts and is a fairly important indicator of work efficiency.  This parameter should depend on the size of the room in which the device is installed.  The purifier and humidifier should not be excessively powerful, as this will cause increased consumption of electric energy. </p><p>  The instrument housing has a certain set of filters, the quality and quantity of which have a direct impact on the degree of work efficiency and cost.  Cleaners use such filters. </p>

    <h2>  Mechanical filtration </h2><p>  That is, pre-cleaning.  This is the simplest type, since it is a fine mesh on which large dust particles, poplar fluff, and animal hair settle.  This is the necessary protection of the engine of the device from all kinds of pollution.  The filter does not need to be replaced; it only needs to be washed periodically in cold water. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Carbon filtration </h2><p>  Such filters are used to absorb odors, remove tobacco smoke and all kinds of contaminants.  They are usually used in combination with others, as in an environment with high humidity they are usually ineffective.  The carbon filter is replaced every 4-6 months, otherwise it becomes a source of pollution in the room itself. </p>

    <h2>  Complex devices </h2><p>  - HEPA fine filters trap approximately 99% of the particles entering them.  This type is necessary to ensure the most effective cleaning, especially for people suffering from allergies.  As the filter becomes dirty, it must be replaced. </p><p>  - Electrostatic (ionizing) filters - plates of metal, which are supplied with voltage, designed to create an electrostatic field.  A humidifier-ionizer works according to a similar principle.  Dust particles receive a positive charge, and then settle on positively charged plates. </p><p>  - Lamps with ultraviolet radiation are used as additional cleaning; with their help, viruses, bacteria and fungi are effectively destroyed. </p><h2>  Humidity in the house </h2><p>  A comfortable humidity level in the house can be maintained by a humidifier.  Benefit or harm from this device - what prevails?  It‚Äôs worth sorting out.  The normal humidity value is 40-60% for the room, but in winter it drops to 20% due to the central heating system.  This causes a strong drop in human immunity, and also reduces its resistance to viral infections.  In addition, a decrease in humidity leads to cracking of wooden furniture and parquet.  That is why it is worth using a humidifier.  Benefit or harm from this device - what dominates?  This is a rather important issue, since now there are different types of these devices, respectively, and opinions differ on this matter.  Household humidifiers are often used in greenhouses, greenhouses and winter gardens to create the most comfortable conditions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now the Russian market offers several types of these devices. </p>

    <h2>  Traditional moisturizers </h2><p>  Their work is based on the principle of ‚Äúcold‚Äù evaporation, which is natural.  Water is poured into the tank of the device, after which it falls on special evaporation elements.  The fan drives the air through them through the room, and moisturization occurs in a natural way.  These are quite economical devices with a low noise level, as simple as possible to operate.  Since this type of evaporation is a self-regulating process, relative humidity reaches a certain value for a specific temperature.  At higher temperatures, the evaporation rate increases.  You can increase the efficiency of a classic evaporator by installing it next to some kind of heat source. </p>

    <h2>  Steam humidifiers </h2><p>  This type of appliance works on the principle of ‚Äúhot‚Äù evaporation.  Using a pair of electrodes, the water in the humidifier is heated to a maximum temperature, after which it passes into a vaporous state.  When the water is completely evaporated, the device automatically turns off.  For this type of device, the advantage is high performance and the possibility of <span>increasing humidity</span> up to 60% or more.  At the same time, a <span>steam humidifier, the</span> instruction to which says about the need to regularly fill it with water, so that work is carried out continuously, is not equipped with a built-in hygrostat and consumes quite a lot of power.  Since the output is quite hot steam, you can not use such a device in a children's room.  However, such a device is appropriate to use for inhalation and aromatherapy.  To do this, put a few drops of fragrant oil into the humidifier nozzle. </p><h2>  Ultrasonic Humidifiers </h2><p>  These are the most effective and popular devices from this category.  Then water is supplied to the plate, which vibrates at a high frequency, as a result of which a cloud forms above it.  And the fan drives air through it into the room.  Using this unit, you can generate wet and cold fog at home.  Consider such a humidifier.  Is the benefit or harm derived from its use?  The built-in gyrostat is designed to control the humidity level and maintain it within certain limits.  For him, it is best to use distilled water.  This type is characterized by maximum performance, safety, low power consumption and low noise.  Most buyers say that such an air humidifier is optimal for them, the price of which significantly exceeds the cost of other types.  Usually the simplest models cost 500 rubles or more. </p>

    <h2>  <span>Climatic complexes</span> and "air washing" </h2><p>  This is a combination in a single humidifier housing with a cleaner.  Both devices can be operated separately or simultaneously.  Cleaning allows you to remove most harmful impurities, tobacco smoke, wool particles and house dust from the air, and humidification makes the indoor climate as comfortable as possible, which is ensured by ‚Äúcold‚Äù evaporation.  Often such complexes are called "air washes."  Among their characteristics, one can note good performance, profitability, quiet operation, no need to change filters.  With their help, as noted by the reviews, it is possible to produce aromatization in the room.  But consumers also highlight negative points.  Among the disadvantages that such a humidifier has: the price is several times higher than the cost of traditional models, large dimensions, as well as the inability to maintain a humidity level of more than 60%. </p><h2>  Control </h2><p>  So, now it‚Äôs clear what kind of device this is - a humidifier.  The benefit or harm from its use is a resolved issue.  Positive results become visible immediately after the start of operation.  Instrument control can be mechanical or electronic.  The first option provides for the use of several rotary knobs that set a timer or mode of operation.  More expensive models can be equipped with electronic controls, a small display and a few buttons.  This type allows you to more accurately set the device program of work, changing the evaporation rate or fan speed.  For example, the Boneco humidifier is electronically controlled with a convenient and intuitive system. </p><p>  Climate devices should have indicators of power mode, the need to replace or clean filters, and low water levels.  <span>The Polaris</span> Puh humidifier includes, for example, an infrared remote control.  This is quite convenient if you often need to change the mode of humidification or air purification. </p><p>  Swiss humidifier is very popular among buyers today, which provides all the conditions for the well-being of people in houses and apartments.  As follows from the reviews, when there are people with asthma or allergies in the family, it is better to choose devices with a wide range of filters.  Consumers say the <span>Boneco humidifier</span> does its <span>job</span> well, while creating the most comfortable living conditions. </p>
