    <p>  Many of us received a call from an unknown subscriber, which we did not have time to answer.  Then we plague ourselves with who it might be and where they called from.  Often we don‚Äôt even know whether it is possible to find out the city by phone number.  In fact, such information is available to many, and absolutely free. </p><h2>  What does that require? </h2><p>  In order to find out the city by cell phone number, you will need a computer with Internet access and the phone itself.  To get started, you can just call your mobile operator and find out from him the information that interests you.  Of course, the representative of cellular communication will not tell who the subscriber‚Äôs number is registered to, but he will definitely name the region from which the call was made.  He has no reason to hide such information. </p><h2>  How is cellular communication arranged? </h2><p>  The entire territory of the country is divided into specific cells.  With the help of repeaters, uninterrupted communication is constantly ensured in them.  The distance between the transmitters depends only on the actual location of the repeater.  They have a certain capacity, i.e. the number of mobile phones that can work simultaneously.  In urban areas, it is much higher than in the village.  Naturally, the subscriber moves around the territory, so the network monitors it in a certain way and switches from one transmitter to another.  If the phone is turned on, from time to time it sends a signal to the repeater, even if it is not used for conversation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Services of mobile operators </h2><p>  In fact, it is almost impossible to determine the city by phone number.  The operators themselves provide such a service.  They have very sensitive equipment, which makes it possible to know the location of the phone very accurately.  For this purpose, the direction finding method is used.  A similar service is offered by the mobile companies themselves.  They have very finely tuned equipment, which allows you to determine the location of a cell phone up to several tens of meters.  These devices have a great opportunity to calculate the location by receiving a signal from three different points.  The operator catches it on his computer.  The repeater emits a standard - a long digital signal.  A mobile phone receives it and a small part of it re-radiates.  After the signal that was received from the repeater is compared with the standard, it determines the time delay, and after that you can find out the city by phone number. </p><h2>  Information accuracy </h2>

The operator has information about where the subscriber was a few minutes ago.  The more often calls are received, the more accurate the information.  You can find out the city by phone number accurately, but you need to pay attention to a number of factors.  First of all, it is interference that reflects the radio signal.  The topography of the area also plays a significant role.  Attention must be paid to the size of the cell and the number of phones that work in it, as well as to where the base stations are located.  After all the data that is received on the computer is analyzed, it will be possible not only to find out the city by the cell number, but also the movement of the subscriber at a certain time.  This information is in the database, which contains everything you need about mobile stations.

    <h2>  Search for information over the Internet </h2><p>  You can recognize the city by phone number using the virtual network.  To do this, the phone code must be uploaded to the search engine.  Not only the city has its own code, but also the region and country.  On the corresponding resources there is a special background information in full.  If the call was supposedly made from Russia, then just enter the code in a special window, and you do not even need to fill in the remaining fields.  The system will give all the information about the range of numbers that has been entered.  You can also select the line "Long-distance and international codes" on these resources and find out the location of the subscriber.  The Russian communication site has the latest information.  However, in order to find it, you need to write in the search line ‚ÄúExtract from the registry of the Russian system and numbering plan‚Äù. </p><h2>  What do you need to pay attention to? </h2><p>  It is important to note that it is still possible to obtain information about the region in which the subscriber is registered.  But by the phone number of the city, it is impossible for an ordinary person to find out the exact location of the subscriber.  Such data is kept secret and is available only to those people who are law enforcement officers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãby number" class="if" height="200" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12720/419217.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  There is an alternative for information.  A special program has been developed for cell phones that is able to automatically determine the region and city.  The most important thing is to choose the right one for your phone model.  Russia cares about the security of its subscribers and does not provide such information to private individuals.  To do this, you must obtain the consent of the owner of the phone to recognize his location.  However, foreign countries have been using such a positioning system for a long time.  It got its development because in 1996 a quarter of the calls that came from cell phones were addressed to 911, the rescue service.  Quite often, people were in a panic and could not accurately state their whereabouts.  That is why mobile operators have decided to organize a system that could very accurately determine the place from which the call was made.  This helped save many of the lives of those at risk.  You should never forget that a mobile phone is not only a convenient device that provides us with communication services, but also a real opportunity for other people to learn more about us.  When we buy such an accessory, we attach to ourselves a kind of beacon that informs us of where we are at this time.  Therefore, you should never forget about it. </p>
