Travel to Kazakhstan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Kazakhstan almost consists of attractions, a real open-air museum.  It is difficult to find a city in this state that would not have its rich history, its special memorable places.  Lakes, rivers, fields, canyons with their fabulous unreal world are the most beautiful places in Kazakhstan, where you want to be sure to travel around this amazing country. </p><h2>  reference Information </h2><p>  The territory occupied by Kazakhstan is located inside the mainland, that is, there is no access to the waters of the oceans.  But there are inland seas: Aral and Caspian.  By area, it is in 9th place in the world.  On a vast territory of 2 million 724 thousand square meters.  km live only 17 million people.  Uninhabited territories include steppes, mountains and deserts.  It is here, on the territory uninhabited by people, that nature appears before travelers in its pristine beauty.  Mountains cover the northern Tien Shan and Altai.  Rivers with cold glacial water rush through canyons and gorges.  Herds of horses graze in alpine meadows. </p><h2>  Steppes and hills </h2><p>  One of the attractions of Kazakhstan can be attributed to the ancient Great Steppe - a unique natural complex.  With the onset of spring, it, like the artist’s canvas, is colored with many colors, bright carpets of different colors, and in autumn the air is filled with the aroma of herbs.  Steppe landscapes are not like other types of nature.  And perhaps, urban residents, accustomed to the stone labyrinths of skyscrapers, may not appreciate the steppe, it may seem boring to them.  However, those who were born and raised here consider the steppe one of the most beautiful places in Kazakhstan. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The strip of yellow steppes and hills - Sary-Arka - occupies the central part of the country.  The Turgai Plateau is located west of the hills.  From the Ural Mountains in the west to Altai and Tarbagatay in the east, the territory of Kazakhstan.  The climate is affected by the location of the country within the mainland.  That is, it is mainly continental.  In the desert and in the mountains, the weather changes frequently.  It is hot during the day, and the north wind blows at night, bringing with it cold masses of air. </p><h2>  Zailiysky Alatau </h2><p>  There is a beautiful pearl in the Tien Shan mountain system.  This is Zailiysky Alatau.  Its mountain range runs along the border of Kazakhstan with Kyrgyzstan.  The difference in height is 4000-4600 meters.  The highest point of Alatau with varying heights of peak peaks is Talgar peak (4973-5017 m).  The south side of Alatau is steep.  North - gently sloping, with many small lakes at the foot.  Larger include Lake Issyk and Big Almaty. </p><p>  By the way, the name of the mountain range - Zailiysky Alatau - comes from the word “Zailiysky”, that is, beyond the Ili River, and “Alatau” in Kazakh means “motley mountains”.  Now it’s clear why the names of many mountain ranges have this word.  And those ridges that are not covered by snow and not rocky get this prefix.  They are decorated with scarlet poppies and emerald grass, field tulips and green spruces.  And if you look at the sky above the mountains with its unnatural blue, it becomes clear: this is neither in the steppe, nor on the plain. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  Alpine meadows - summer pastures - are located at an altitude of 3000 meters.  The foothills of the Zailiysky Alatau, called “counters”, at an altitude of 1,500 m have a width of up to 10-15 km.  Its northern base looks like a sloping plain, where Almaty is located.  <span>The city has long</span> been the capital of Kazakhstan.  Here is the Medeo sports complex, built in 1972 in the gorge of the same name 15 km from Almaty. </p><p>  Above the sports complex is a mudflow dam and the Chimbulak ski resort.  A mudflow dam was built to protect the sports complex from a terrible phenomenon - mudflow.  The thing is that gorges over which rivers flow over the city.  They take their origin in mountain lakes.  As long as the seismological situation is normal, there is no abnormal melting of glaciers, the water in the lakes does not overflow.  In the event that something is disturbed in nature, from lakes overflowing with water, water rushes down the rivers, involving stones, boulders, clay in its movement.  So mudflow is formed. </p><p>  If you climb the stairs to the dam, from a bird's eye view you can explore the surroundings adjacent to the sports complex.  The autumn season is especially beautiful here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Charyn Canyon </h2><p>  One of the amazingly fabulous places located east of Almaty is the Charyn Canyon, named after the Charyn River.  The length of the Charyn canyon is 154 kilometers.  Its beauty can be compared with the Great <span>Canyon of Colorado.</span>  One must look at the natural “architecture” not through the camera’s lens, but with one’s own eyes.  Not a single photograph can convey that wonderful world of arches and columns of bizarre shapes, sculptures of sandstone, reaching 150-300 meters in height.  Fairy-tale names came up with them, such as the Witch's Gorge or the Valley of Castles. </p>

    <p>  It affects the biodiversity of the landscape.  Ornithologists noted the fact that more than a hundred species of birds make their nests in the canyon.  The flow of travelers and ecotourism groups formed in Almaty is practically not running out.  Charyn Canyon is also a place for lovers of hiking. </p><h2>  "Ruler of heaven" </h2><p>  For many professional tourists, the goal is to conquer the peak of Khan Tengri, this majestic peak, "ruler of heaven", translated from the Kazakh language.  Rare peaks are comparable in beauty.  It is located in the Issyk-Kul region of Kazakhstan.  Since 1912, the peak region was surveyed by topographic expeditions.  There were unsuccessful attempts to climb.  By 1964, two ascent routes were laid, currently nine of them.  To get to the top, you need special training and years of training.  Many climbers died while climbing the Khan Tengri peak.  Despite the large number of deaths, for those who come to conquer the peaks, “only mountains that have not been before can be better than mountains”. </p><p>  Local residents have long given the name Mount Cann-Too, which is translated from Turkic as “Bloody Mountain”.  Obviously, the air masses and sunset set off the top of the mountain in scarlet.  <span>Natural</span> wonders <span>of Kazakhstan, of</span> course, do not end there. </p>

    <h2>  Bird paradise </h2><p>  The flora and fauna of the country is represented by rare species of plants, animals and birds.  One of the picturesque places of Kazakhstan <em>,</em> which would be interesting for travelers to visit, is the “Bird Paradise” of the Korgalzhyn Nature Reserve.  It is located 130 kilometers from Astana.  Here, on Lake Teniz, is the northernmost nesting ground for pink flamingos.  Birds fly to the reserve in the spring, in March-April.  Nest construction begins in May on the silty shores of Tengiz.  Neither animals nor humans are afraid of birds here <em>.</em>  They cannot get here, but the storm waves that happen once every seven to ten years, usually wash away everything in its path.  Wintering flamingos fly to warm countries: Iran, Iraq, Cyprus, Turkey.  But in early spring they return to their homeland to sit their offspring. </p>

    <p>  In addition to pink flamingos, the reserve sheltered hundreds of species of different birds.  Many of them are listed in the Red Book. </p><h2>  Lake Balkhash </h2><p>  Many tourists prefer to organize their holidays near rivers or lakes.  Despite the fact that most of the country's territory is occupied by deserts and mountains, the rivers and lakes of Kazakhstan, without stint, give life-giving moisture to the earth.  The largest lakes include Balkhash.  The estimated age of the reservoir is 35,000 years.  It is the only lake in the world that consists of fresh and salt water.  And she does not mix.  Fresh is the western part of the reservoir, and the eastern is salty.  In this amazing water, 20 species of fish feel good.  The ancient Kazakhs very correctly called their lake - "Balyk As", which is translated as "nursing fish."  Along the lake stretches the Bektau-ata mountain range. </p><h2>  Kul-Sei Lakes </h2><p>  The <span>most beautiful places in Kazakhstan</span> include the high-altitude lakes Kul-Say, filled with water from the river of the same name, originating in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau. </p>

    <p>  One of these monuments is located in Turkestan - this is the mausoleum of Khoja Akhmet Yassaui.  Until the 16th century, Turkestan was called Yassi and lay on one of the branches of the Great Silk Road, where there was a brisk trade.  The mausoleum was erected in honor of the preacher of Sufism, Ahmet Yassaui, who lived in the 12th century.  It is believed that Yassaui was a follower of the Prophet Muhammad.  At the age of 63, he voluntarily shut himself up in the dungeon of a mosque and spent 4 years until his death in prayers.  He was buried in a small mausoleum, which became a place of pilgrimage, equivalent to going to Mecca.  The mausoleum, which exists now, was established 233 years after the death of Akhmet, by order of Tamerlane.  Pilgrims from all over the world continue to come to Turkestan to honor the memory of the follower of Muhammad and touch the masterpiece of the Middle Ages. </p><h2>  From the history of Astana </h2><p>  The history of modern Astana, like Turkestan, is associated with the Great Silk Road.  During excavations five kilometers from Astana, the medieval settlement of Bozok was found, which is the forerunner of the current capital.  Excavations are currently underway in the capital itself, as historical research has gained priority.  Monumental structures are being erected in Astana along with excavations.  Since the current capital did not have a historical appearance, the buildings are being erected in a modern style by now-living foreign architects.  Significant buildings include the <span>Palace of Peace and Accord.</span>  This is a glass-frame structure.  Inside the palace is an opera hall for 1300 spectators.  The meeting room is located under the dome of the building, the walls are covered with images of flying pigeons. </p><p>  Traveling in Kazakhstan always leaves the most indelible impressions.
