This genus began to exist even before the reign of Ivan IV.  The activity of the Stroganov dynasty (photos of some representatives can be seen in the article) was of great importance for the economy of the Russian state.  The family included famous entrepreneurs, art connoisseurs, military men, statesmen.  The legacy of the Stroganov dynasty is carefully guarded by the authorities today.  What is the genus so famous for? </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroganov dynasty" class="if uuid-3066107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066107.jpg"></div><h2>  The beginning of the dynasty </h2><p>  According to one version, the Stroganovs came from a Tatar who received the name Spiridon in baptism.  The author of this version is the merchant Isaac Massa.  And it was distributed by the Dutchman Nikolai Witsen, who met with Massa.  This version explains the origin of the Stroganov dynasty.  Spiridon married a relative of Dmitry Donskoy, but was subsequently captured by the Tatar-Mongols.  The khan ordered to tie him to a pillar and to "cut out" the body, then chop and scatter it into pieces.  In 1395, the son of Spiridon Kuzma (Kozma) was born, who was named Stroganov (Strogonov) in memory of the death of his father.  This version, however, is partially refuted by Karamzin, considering the fact of "planing" to be just a fable. </p><p>  The author of the second hypothesis was N. G. Ustryalov, who worked in the archives of the Stroganov family.  The history of the dynasty, according to this version, begins in Nizhny Novgorod.  Here, too, the founder is Spiridon, who had a son Kuzma.  As clarifies F. A. Volegov, the grandson of Spiridon, Luka Kuzmich, gave money for the redemption of Vasily the Dark.  Around 1488, his son Fyodor Lukich (monk Theodosius) settled in Sol-Vychegodskaya.  Here he had 4 sons: Stepan, Vladimir, Osip and Anika (Ioannikiy, Anikiy).  The first three died without leaving offspring.  It was Anika who became the founder of the rich Stroganov dynasty. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Start of activity </h2><p>  Anika began with salt fishing.  Most sources indicate the year 1515.  However, this is unlikely, since he was only 18. A.A. Vyvedensky has evidence that Anika bought a third of the crockery without a salt pan (tsyrena) and a third of the brewery place, and then in 1540 still a crochet with a place and a grout.  In 1550, a letter was bought from Ivan IV for a device for a barbecue with tax privileges for 6 years. </p><p>  Many historians are concerned about the question of who was the founder of the Perm branch of the Stroganov dynasty.  Let's figure it out. </p><p>  Anika had three sons: Jacob (after the death of Daniel‚Äôs grandson, the male line of this branch was stopped), Gregory (he had only one son Nikita, who died single) and Semyon (all the other Stroganovs went from him). </p><p>  In April 1558, Ivan IV granted Gregory vast lands along the r.  Kame (the region of the Ural Prikamye, from the mouth of Lysva to the Chusova River).  A total of 3.5 million acres (one tithe of 1.09 ha) were transferred.  In August 1566, all of these lands became part of the oprichnina, respectively, income went to the state treasury.  In March 1568, a letter of merit on land along the river.  Chusova was given to the eldest son of Anikey Yakov. </p><p>  The Stroganovs developed salt, hunting, fishing, ore mining, agriculture, and construction on their lands.  They erected cities, fortresses, suppressed the uprisings of the local population, with the help of squads added new territories to their lands in Siberia and the Urals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroganov dynasty briefly" class="if uuid-3066111" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066111.jpg"></div><h2>  Time of Troubles </h2><p>  Shortly before the Time of Troubles, Semyon Anikeevich was killed.  The Stroganov dynasty was headed by his second wife, Evdokia Nesterovna (came from the boyar clan of the Lachinovs).  From this couple all descendants descended.  Other branches, except for the "neighborhood", ceased to exist in the XVII century.  Marriage to Lachinova was beneficial to Semyon, since she was the sister of the Solikamsk governor. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  During the Time of Troubles, the positions of the Stroganov dynasty significantly strengthened.  By Shuisky‚Äôs letter, Nikita Grigorievich, Peter and Andrei Semenovich received the special title of ‚Äúeminent people‚Äù for serving the Fatherland and providing cash loans.  The Stroganovs were always present at the gala dinners of the Moscow patriarchs, and sat next to the boyars.  After the Time of Troubles, the main source of income for entrepreneurs remained salt mining.  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãSalt-Kama salt production was developed. </p><p>  In addition to entrepreneurial activity, the Stroganovs actively participated in foreign policy.  They sponsored the conduct of the Smolensk War, the Russo-Polish War of 1654 - 67. </p><p>  It is known that at the end of the XVII century.  the construction of the temple complex of the Trinity-Sergius Lavra was carried out with the participation of representatives of the Stroganov dynasty.  An arch was built in Sergiev Posad - a continuation of the entrance to the monastery.  After it, the Church of the Nativity of John the Baptist was erected in the style of "Stroganov's Baroque". </p><h2>  The beginning of the XVIII century. </h2><p>  The Stroganov dynasty was very numerous - the children of Anikeia had many heirs.  The unification of possessions, fragmented between them, took up in the 80s.  XVII century  Grigory Dmitrievich Stroganov.  He received 8 royal letters.  According to six of them, he received real estate and land in Prikamye.  By 1715, the total land area amounted to 6 million 639 thousand dessiatins. </p><h2>  Competition </h2><p>  It should be noted that not only the Stroganov dynasty was engaged in salt mining.  Briefly dwell on some of their competitors. </p><p>  So, in 1661 - 62 years.  The Sokolovs (Balakhninsky industrialists) took the land for salt production.  But in 1688 the territories were transferred to the Shustovs by petition filed in 1685. The document stated that there was no salt mining on these lands.  The claim to the territory was declared by Grigory Stroganov.  He filed a petition in which he argued that the disputed lands were his possessions.  As a result, a land survey was carried out and the Lenva salt fields were transferred to him.  At the same time, posad people who opposed land surveying were sent to Azov together with their families.  In 1697, Gregory rents, and after 3 years takes into permanent possession Zyryanovskie usolye. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="rusmania.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroganov dynasty in the history of Russian entrepreneurship" class="if uuid-3066112" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066112.jpg"></div><p>  Judging by the available documents, Gregory had a great influence.  This is confirmed, in particular, by the following.  In 1698, by order of Prince Dashkov, the local salt industrialist Rostovshchikov was put in a hut.  However, he filed a complaint and with the active assistance of Stroganov, the prince was removed from the post of governor. </p><h2>  Entry into the nobility </h2><p>  During the Northern War (early 17th century), the history of the Stroganov dynasty was marked by a number of significant events.  As before, they sponsored the hostilities, providing Peter I with large sums.  In addition, the Stroganovs founded metallurgical and other plants in the Urals. </p><p>  After the war, in 1722, Sergei, Nikolai and Alexander Grigoryevich received the baronial titles, and the title "eminent people" was removed from them.  Since that time, the active state activity of the dynasty of entrepreneurs of the Stroganovs begins.  Alexander Sergeevich took part in creating a draft of new legislation during the reign of Catherine II.  In addition, at the turn of the XVII - XIX centuries.  he headed the Academy of Arts, led the Public Library, was a member of the State Council.  In 1761, he received the title of count from the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. </p><p>  Pavel Aleksandrovich was a member of the Secret Committee of Alexander I, was the deputy (comrade, as the post was then called) of the Minister of the Interior.  Sofya Vladimirovna, his wife, founded the Maryino estate, created the School of Forestry and Agricultural Sciences. </p><p>  From Grigory Alexandrovich comes the second branch of the Stroganov dynasty.  The founder of the branch was a prominent diplomat of his time.  One of the sons - Sergey Grigoryevich - in 1859 - 60s.  was the Moscow governor-general.  Alexander Grigoryevich in 1839 - 41 was the Minister of the Interior, and in 1849 he became a member of the Council of State. </p><p>  Many representatives of the Stroganov dynasty are known for their interest in literature, history, art, archeology.  Pavel and Grigory Sergeevich, in particular, collected impressive libraries, collections of medals, paintings, etc. </p><p>  The last representative of the dynasty, Sergei Alexandrovich, as a naval officer, actively sponsored the development of weapons.  In 1923, he died in Nice. </p><h2>  Division and seizure of territories </h2><p>  In the middle of the XVII century.  in the history of Russian entrepreneurship, the Stroganov dynasty, in short, did not play a big role. </p><p>  In 1749, the Chusovsky, Zyryansky, Novousolsky and Lenvensky salt fields were divided between the brothers.  The lands of the Upper Prikamye with people remained common family property.  Alexander Sergeevich tried to develop the South Ural territories.  He built the Trinity-Satka plant in 1755 - 1757.  But the enterprise was unprofitable, so Stroganov sold it to the merchant Luginin in 1769. </p><div class="photo" data-original="artinvestment.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroganov Dynasty History" class="if uuid-3066677" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066677.jpg"></div><p>  In the second half of the XVIII century.  most of the possessions of the Stroganovs passes into the hands of the princes Shakhovsky, Golitsyn, Lazarev, Vsevolzhsky.  In addition, the territories owned by entrepreneurs have almost halved due to seizures of state land for the construction of factories. </p><p>  Alexander Sergeevich first filed claims for the return of possessions, but in 1790 he decided to abandon all claims against them.  He agreed to the seizure of the territories in which the state-owned metallurgical plants and villages of state peasants were located.  His son, Paul, in 1817, before his death, asked Emperor Alexander I to transfer the Perm estate to a mayorate. </p><p>  In accordance with the imperial decree of August 11, 1817, the estate of the Stroganovs was to be transferred from one person to another in the possession of the whole.  It was forbidden to partially or fully mortgage it or sell it to a private person or the state, burden it with debts or other obligations.  If any transactions were made in violation of the decree, then they should have been recognized as invalid, regardless of who and where to conclude them.  In the history of Russian entrepreneurship, the Stroganov dynasty is one of the few families that enjoyed such patronage.  Perm status remained for the Perm estate until 1917. </p><h2>  Decay of the Majorate </h2><p>  The authorities tried to legislatively stop the destruction of the Perm estate.  Nevertheless, the disintegration continued until 1917. In 1833, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe majorate was 1,551,625 dessiatins, and in 1859 - 1,456,576. But the number of men increased from 57,778 to 78,064.  The acceleration of the breakup of Perm mayorate was due to the abolition of serfdom in the factories of the Urals.  By law, all those who were liberated needed to be given land.  During the ransom in Stroganov‚Äôs estates from 1872 to 1886.  former serfs, rural workers and field workers received a total of 700,982 dessiatines. </p><p>  Majorate Square in the late 1880s  was approximately the same as in 1858. This is due to the fact that the estate was enlarged in 1872 and 1877.  due to the accession to it of territories of other branches of the Stroganov dynasty.  So, in 1872, the land of Sergey Grigoryevich was included in the majorate - about 600,000 dessiatines with the Kynovsky plant.  And in 1877, Alexander Grigorievich sold to a mayorat for 1 million rubles.  150 thousand dessiatines with Leven crafts.  Accordingly, by 1886 the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe estate amounted to almost 1.5 million tithes.  Sergei Stroganov increased it by acquiring the Utkinsk plant from the Demidovs and almost 90 thousand acres of land in 1890 (although 24 thousand acres were to be given to the count by the population of the mining center). </p><div class="photo" data-original="tournavigator.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Stroganov dynasty in history" class="if uuid-3066807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066807.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the decrease in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãmarjoram continues.  It was connected with the delimitation of the earth and disputes with neighbors.  In 1907-17  almost 100 thousand dessiatins passed to the artisans, former field and yard workers of the Stroganov estate.  As a result, by the October Revolution, the majorate included 1,464,576.81 acres. </p><h2>  Reorientation of production </h2><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, a new round was marked in the history of Russian entrepreneurship. </p><p>  The Stroganov dynasty owned vast forest territories.  Shortly before the First World War, the majorate factories ceased to bring the expected profit and began to close.  As a result, the Stroganovs reoriented towards the sale of forests.  The tree was rafted in Tsaritsyn along the Volga and Kama rivers.  In 1915 forests were sent for 915 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The second place in the production of the Stroganovs was occupied by the production of iron and cast iron.  So, the Belimbaevsky plant smelted about 6 million pounds of pig iron, and Utkinsky smelted more than 6.5 million pounds.  The Dobryansky plant, in turn, produced almost 9.5 million pounds of iron from all this cast iron. </p><p>  At the beginning of World War I, the Stroganovs concluded an agreement with the state on the release of artillery shells at the Dobryansky plant.  For this, the necessary equipment was brought from America in 1916. </p><p>  At the beginning of the twentieth century, saltworks were still preserved in the majorate.  In 1908 - 17 years.  they produced nearly 3.5 million pounds of salt.  In 1917, 5 wells and 7 varnits worked in Usolye, and 5 wells and 8 varnits worked in Lenva. </p><p>  Milling was also very profitable.  By 1917, 56 working mills and 160 flour production machines remained in the Perm Majorate. </p><p>  Peat deposits on the territory of the Stroganov estate became the most important discovery of the period of the First World War. </p><h2>  Barons Stroganovs - art lovers </h2><p>  Sergey Grigoryevich, a prominent representative of the dynasty, with the active participation of Rastrelli, built a palace in St. Petersburg in which he exhibited a collection of paintings.  Later, his son Alexander continued the tradition.  By and large, he became the first Russian philanthropist. </p><p>  Alexander Stroganov - a famous nobleman of the Catherine period - made a trip to European countries.  There he became interested in collecting books and paintings.  The Baron returned to his homeland, impressed by European libraries.  In Russia, the first library was built only under Paul I. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.nailizakon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dynasty of entrepreneurs" class="if uuid-3066809" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066809.jpg"></div><p>  The first Count Stroganov managed to collect a large collection of sculptures, paintings, books.  Already at an advanced age, he began the construction of the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg.  Only Russian architects and painters were involved in the construction. </p><p>  Pavel Alexandrovich, son of A. S. Stroganov, was very close to the imperial house of Alexander I. He distinguished himself in military affairs. </p><h2>  Educational activities </h2><p>  The Stroganovs began to actively conduct it at the beginning of the 19th century.  The brightest representative of the "new generation" was Count Sergey Grigorievich.  He actively contributed to the opening of vocational schools, schools for the poor.  In 1825, the count, with his own money, founded a drawing school in Moscow, the famous Stroganovka. </p><p>  For a long time Sergey Grigoryevich stood at the helm of Moscow University.  As an archaeologist, a member of historical society, he made a huge contribution to the development of Russian numismatics.  In addition, Stroganov actively participated in the construction of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.  He also created the Archaeological Commission and became its permanent chairman. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After the October Revolution of 1917, the last representative of the male line of the Stroganov dynasty, Sergei Alexandrovich, handed over the keys to the palace in St. Petersburg to the narcotics of education.  After that, he moved abroad.  Some of the valuables remaining in the house were given to the Hermitage, some were stolen.  Subsequently, in the Stroganov Palace there were many different institutions.  In 1988, the building was transferred to the Russian Museum.  Currently, an active restoration of the palace. </p><p>  Representatives of the female line of the Stroganov dynasty today live abroad.  Their surnames, of course, have long been different.  In 1992, one of the representatives of the dynasty, Elena de Lyundingauzen, founded a charity fund.  All the money that goes into it goes to the restoration and reconstruction of monuments, including architectural structures, the Stroganov heritage in the Russian Federation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.nailizakon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="who was the founder of the Perm branch of the Stroganov dynasty" class="if uuid-3066811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20380/3066811.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, the Stroganovs did a lot for the state.  I especially want to emphasize their patronage to art, books, sculpture.  The entrepreneurial activities of the dynasty brought to the treasury huge sums necessary for the implementation of the foreign policy tasks facing the authorities. </p>
