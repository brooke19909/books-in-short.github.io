    <h2>  What is included in the delivery </h2><p>  The Samsung 7262 cannot boast of something unusual in terms of configuration.  The instruction manual for the gadget with a warranty card is a complete list of documentation in the box of this device.  In addition to the smartphone itself, the package includes such accessories: </p><ul><li>  Battery with a capacity of 1500 mA / h. </li><li>  Standard stereo headset. </li><li>  The adapter for charging the battery. </li><li>  Cord for connecting to a personal computer. </li></ul><p>  As expected, there is no flash card in the delivery kit, which you will have to buy separately.  A similar situation with a protective film and a cover. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance and usability </h2><p>  By form factor, this device belongs to monoblocks with touch input support.  Otherwise, this is a typical representative of the Galaxy line of this South Korean manufacturer.  The second name of this smart phone model is Galaxy Star Plus.  So in a similar design of the device there is nothing special.  The volume swings are brought to his left edge, and the lock button to the right.  Under the screen are three classic <span>control buttons.</span>  Like most devices of this brand, two of them are sensory (they are located at the edges), and one, central, is mechanical.  The Samsung 7262 phone has the following dimensions: the length is 121.2 mm, the width is 62.7 mm, and its thickness is 10.6 mm.  At the same time, its weight is 121 g. In general, this is a typical representative of the entry-level smart phone segment.  He cannot boast of something special against the background of competitors, just as he has no special flaws. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  CPU </h2><p>  A processor based on the Cortex A5 architecture with one core acts as the computing heart of this device.  Its maximum possible frequency is 1 GHz, at which it operates at the time of peak load.  As can be seen from everything previously said, the CPU is very weak on the Samsung 7262 mobile phone.  The characteristics given earlier allow him to cope with most everyday tasks today: watching videos in the * .avi, * .mpeg4 or * .3zhp format, playing audio recordings, reading books, browsing Internet sites or simple games.  But video in HD and higher quality or complex 3D games on it will definitely not work. </p><h2>  Graphics subsystem </h2><p>  There is no separate graphic adapter in this smart phone model.  Its role is played by the <span>central processor.</span>  As a result, the hardware platform leaves much to be desired for Samsung 7262.  His characteristics are not so good, but here he is also loaded with graphics.  The diagonal of the display of this device is 4 inches.  It is built on the basis of the TFT sensor.  The picture quality is not satisfactory, but the viewing angles are significantly less than for devices with an IPS matrix.  The screen resolution is 800 x 480. The pixel density is normal, and the eye is difficult to distinguish between them.  The number of reflected shades is equal to acceptable 16 million.  The rest is a fairly high-quality display based on touch technology. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Only one main camera is the Samsung 7262.  Characteristics and reviews <strong> </strong>  in relation to her one: her quality is below average.  No wonder, because it is based on a 2 megapixel sensor element.  At the same time, some additional options that can significantly improve the quality of the resulting image are not implemented in the smartphone.  There is also no LED backlight, and as a result, photographing on this device is possible only in the presence of normal lighting.  The situation is even worse with video recordings.  Only 15 frames per second with a resolution of 240 x 320 - this is very small today.  The quality of the videos is very poor. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  It's hard enough to say how much RAM is in this gadget.  According to the documentation, there should be 512 MB, but according to the test results, it turns out that this number is decreasing and amounts to 460 MB.  But here we must remember that there is no separate video card in this smartphone.  Its functions are performed by the central processor.  Well, it turns out that 52 MB is reserved for the graphics subsystem of the device.  The remaining 460 MB is occupied by approximately 60-70 percent of system processes.  As a result, only 100-120 MB is allocated to the user's needs.  Somehow it turns out a little, and to increase this value will not work.  The capacity of the built-in drive is 4 GB.  About half of them are occupied by the operating system.  In turn, 2 GB is allocated to the needs of the user.  This is only enough to install the software.  But there will be nowhere to store music or photos.  The ideal solution in this case is to install an external drive, and the corresponding slot is in this device.  The maximum capacity of a memory card can be 32 GB - that is how much Samsung 7262 can ‚Äúsee‚Äù.  The settings of the memory subsystem must be made so that the internal memory is used to install the application software, and the external drive is completely and completely occupied with the user's personal data (music, photos, books and films). </p>

    <h2>  Battery and autonomy </h2><p>  This smartphone is equipped with a 1500 mAh battery.  It's kind of like a little today.  But, on the other hand, it has a processor with 1 core, no graphics adapter and a small display diagonal of 4 inches.  All this in total with an average level of use allows this gadget to last 3-4 days on a single <span>battery charge</span> .  If you use this device to the maximum, then this value will decrease to 1-2 days.  But in the energy saving mode, it can last 5 days. </p><h2>  Software part </h2><p>  The software environment of this smart phone is based on a very outdated version of Android with the serial number 4.1.  Of course, this is not entirely good, but, on the other hand, there should be no problems with <span>application software</span> .  On top of the operating system, a proprietary TouchWiz shell is installed, which is equipped with all Samsung smartphones.  Prices <strong> </strong>  because of this, they have higher than that of similar devices, but functionality due to this is significantly improved.  Otherwise, the set of software is quite familiar: social clients, a set of utilities from Google and standard built-in applications. </p>

    <h2>  Communications </h2><p>  A standard, familiar, as for an elementary-class device, set of interfaces for this device.  The Samsung 7262 smartphone cannot boast of something unusual and in this regard.  And this list is as follows: </p><ul><li>  The main interface for receiving and sending information to the Internet is Wi-Fi.  It allows you to receive and transmit data at speeds of 150 Mbps.  This allows you to download movies in high quality in minutes.  With all other everyday tasks (watching online video, Internet sites or chatting on social networks), this also makes it easy to handle. </li><li>  There are 2 slots in this smart phone for installing SIM cards.  They work in a variable mode.  That is, during a conversation on one of them, the second is automatically out of the access zone.  You can solve the problem by reconfiguring the call forwarding system.  The device is equipped with a module for working only in second-generation networks, that is, there is no support for 3G and LTE in this device.  Hence, the peak transmission of information with such a connection can reach 500 kbps.  In fact, this value is many times smaller and amounts to about 100 kbit / s. </li><li>  Another important way to share data is with Bluetooth.  Its main task is to exchange data with similar mobile devices, but the secondary one is to connect a wireless headset to the smartphone (of course, it will have to be purchased separately). </li><li>  A 3.5 mm audio port allows you to output sound from this gadget to an external <span>speaker system.</span>  The stereo headset that comes with it is far from the best quality and it is better to immediately purchase other headphones with higher sound quality. </li><li>  The last important wired interface is microUSB.  Its main task is to charge the battery.  But it can also be used to connect to a computer or to connect an external battery with increased capacity to the device. </li></ul><h2>  The opinion of the owners of this device and experts </h2><p>  The opinions of experts and owners agree much on the Samsung 7262.  Specifications and reviews highlight a number of shortcomings in this device.  Among them, one can single out a small amount of RAM, frankly, a weak processor and absolutely no camera.  This list goes on and on.  All this, in theory, should be offset by the democratic value of the gadget.  But like all Samsung smartphones, the prices for this device are overpriced.  Currently it costs $ 55.  At the same time, its Chinese counterpart with the best configuration will cost $ 45-50.  Hence the problems in the unit for the production of mobile phones and smartphones in the South Korean giant. </p>

    <h2>  Total </h2><p>  This is how ambiguous Samsung 7262 turned out.  Its characteristics are very modest, the price is slightly overpriced.  But still, this smart phone will certainly find its buyer.  Moreover, its hardware and software resources are enough to solve most everyday tasks. </p>
