Children of Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Information networks cannot exist without sensational publications.  Recently in the newspaper The Dallas Telegraph was published a photo story-sensation.  Here a story was raised related to a man whose name is Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov <span>(brother of Lenin).</span>  The bottom line was that in the biography of the Ulyanov family there are white spots associated with the number of their children. </p><h2>  Publication plot </h2><p>  What was written about in the publication?  It seems that in <span>the Ulyanov family there</span> was another boy named Sergei.  It was the <span>identical twin brother of</span> Vladimir.  And when the great leader of the proletarian revolution in 1924 died, Comrade Stalin secretly ordered all information about the life of Sergei Ilyich to be deleted (deleted).  A man named Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov (photo attached) as a competitor for the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars should not have existed. </p>

    <h2>  Author </h2><p>  The author of this newspaper duck was an artist from Bashkortostan Rinat Voligamsi.  The newspaper published several dozen old yellowed photographs from the Ulyanovs <span>family album</span> , as well as photographs from a later period, until 1964, on which Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov, Lenin‚Äôs brother, was captured. </p>

    <p>  The photographs were supplied with brief comments describing the stages of the life path (from childhood to the last year of life) of the twin brother of the leader of the proletarian revolution.  Today on the Internet you can find dozens of photos, supposedly old, where both "brothers" are depicted.  Some photographs of Vladimir Lenin, as claimed by lovers of sensations, actually depict Sergei Ulyanov. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Biography of Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov </h2><p>  What do we know about a man named Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov, whose biography is foggy and indefinite?  Born in 1870, he lived in the Ulyanov family until 1886.  His parents, like all children, loved and protected him, even spoiled him more than others.  Sergey was the antipode to Vladimir.  He did not eat meat (he was a vegetarian, which is why he lived 95 years), did not offend animals, was distinguished by a complaisant character.  After graduating, Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov in 1886, leaving his parents' house, went to the Ufa province, where he started a family, marrying a girl Zuhra, a local beauty. </p>

    <p>  Further, the story goes that in connection with the raging typhus, parents did not have the opportunity to come to their son‚Äôs wedding.  He was little discouraged about this.  By the mid-thirties, being a wax trader, Sergey Ilyich Ulyanov made a decent capital.  Having become a wealthy man, he turned into a local "Sultan", marrying three beautiful girls at once.  But the family idyll did not last long.  Further events began to develop according to the revolutionary scenario. </p><h2>  Activities during the revolution </h2><p>  The revolution of 1905 and the subsequent difficult times required funds.  The communist cell could not exist without financial influences.  In this difficult period, Vladimir Ilyich remembered that he had a bourgeois brother.  Turning to him in a letter, he writes that without the availability of financial support, the cause of the revolution would perish.  The brother, quickly realizing the entire supply of wax, brings money to the raging Petrograd. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  We conclude from the article that during the Great October Socialist Revolution, Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin's twin brother) is at the forefront of a just cause, leading workers and peasants to the triumph of great victories.  Moreover, Lenin did not seem to abhor <span>his brother‚Äôs</span> advice <span>, calling</span> their union a force capable of inflating the crucible of a future world revolution. </p><h2>  Post-revolutionary period </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 1920s, Sergei Ilyich returned to Bashkiria, where he was engaged in educational work and campaigning.  But again he was not given rest.  The brother‚Äôs reign did not last as long as Sergei would have liked.  In 1924, the leader of the proletariat suddenly dies, and Stalin, taking all power in his hands, begins to persecute Lenin's former comrades-in-arms. </p>

    <p>  Seeing himself as one of the first candidates for the Stalinist meat grinder, Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov, whose biography did not correspond to the status of the proletariat, flees abroad.  At first he secretly lives in Lithuania, later through the territory of Romania he makes his way to Switzerland.  Later, he seems to write that flight is a necessary measure, and his escape served as a continuation of his brother's work - serving the ideas of Marxism. </p><p>  At the end of the 30s, he was trying to unite by miracle the surviving supporters of the cause of Lenin, scattered throughout many countries of the world.  For this purpose, Sergei Ilyich moved to Mexico, closer to Trotsky, where he is actively engaged in literary activities.  He publishes his sensational epic ‚ÄúTurning History Back‚Äù, subsequently more than thirty times allegedly reprinted in many languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. </p>

    <p>  Sergei Ilyich had an idea that he raved about, trying to implement it throughout his life.  It consisted in the ‚ÄúIslamization" of communism.  He was very worried that her compatriots living both in their homeland and in exile did not support her.  And then, trying to thoroughly study Islam, Sergey Ulyanov goes to Mecca.  Here he not only indulges in religious teachings, but also in love, as a result of which he has a daughter.  Apparently, the children of Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov were of little interest, since he soon again, realizing his crazy revolutionary ideas, changed his place of residence. </p><h2>  The last refuge of S. I. Ulyanov </h2><p>  Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov, Lenin‚Äôs twin brother, found his last refuge in Cuba.  At the end of the 50s, it seems that he was personally invited by Comrade F. Castro.  Here, on Liberty Island, in 1965, Sergei Ilyich died and lived a long, eventful life.  He lived 95 years, waging a merciless struggle against world imperialism, having survived his twin brother for more than 40 years. </p><h2>  What does the author say about this? </h2><p>  After the publication of the photo archive, the question of how the author himself relates to such an idea and what he thinks about it became inevitable.  The essence of the author‚Äôs answers to the correspondent‚Äôs questions was that: </p><ul><li>  alone, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was unlikely to be able to do such a titanic amount of work, he should have had an assistant, possibly a twin brother; </li><li>  the birth of the project provoked a personal fantasy; </li><li>  the veracity of editing photos is achieved using modern technology; </li><li>  comments on photos were signed by an unknown person; </li><li>  the Islamic origin of Sergei Ilyich Ulyanov, perhaps, should lead him to Mecca in old age; </li><li>  doubles of other political figures (Stalin, Khrushchev) are not of interest to the author due to the dullness of their personalities. </li></ul><p>  The author of the publication was born in the then Soviet Bashkiria in 1968.  After graduating from an architectural institute, he worked as a designer in construction.  Currently, she is engaged in painting and participates in projects whose names speak for themselves: "surrealism", "absurdity", "critical realism". </p>
