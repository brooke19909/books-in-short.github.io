    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  Prazeres Resort 3 * is located in the smallest Indian state of Goa, in its northern part, in the village of Candolim.  This is a pretty respectable resort, where the whole Indian elite rushes.  The state of Goa stretches for almost 100 km along the Arabian Sea, washing its western part.  From the east it is surrounded by the Sahyadri Mountains <span>(Western Ghats).</span>  The entire coast is indented with picturesque rivers, starting their journey in the mountains and flowing into the sea.  Literally a few kilometers from Candolim there is another Indian resort village - Calangute, where a completely different, more fussy atmosphere reigns.  Candolim is much calmer, so those who are not looking for noisy entertainment come here.  The nearest <span>international airport</span> to the village <span>that</span> accepts charter flights from Russia is called Dabolim.  It is located near the village of the same name, 13 km from the capital of the state of Panaji.  From the hotel it is about 27 km.  Regarding the beach, Prazeres Resort 3 * is located not on the first coastline, but closer to the center of the village, on one of the busy streets.  Nearby are many cafes, restaurants, shops, there is a market and a supermarket with low, fixed prices, and there is a bus stop nearby where buses leave for Panaji and neighboring towns. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Regarding the catering in Prazeres Resort 3 * reviews are mixed.  Some tourists believe that a standard <span>continental breakfast</span> is provided here <span>, for</span> others it seems unusually modest.  Breakfast is served from 7:00 and strictly until 10:00 in the hotel restaurant or on the outdoor terrace.  The menu includes coffee or tea, 2 toasts, butter, jam and a glass of packaged juice.  This breakfast is included in the room rate.  For a fee (130 rupees, or about $ 2), you can order an omelet.  Day and evening, you can also eat in the hotel restaurant, but at an additional cost. </p><p>  In Prazeres Resort 3 * there are two bars, in the lobby and on the premises.  They offer various alcoholic drinks of local production and imported.  The quantity is unlimited, because everything is for money. </p><p>  Near the hotel, on the way to the beach and on the beach itself, you can find dozens of various cafes (with Russian-speaking staff and a Russian menu), restaurants, bars, many of which offer free Wi-Fi.  Food prices are different everywhere, but quite reasonable.  Especially popular among Russians are the cafe ‚ÄúLuck‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt Pasha‚Äù, ‚ÄúInferno‚Äù, ‚ÄúAt Kiryusha‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Service for children </h2><p>  This hotel accepts guests with children of any age, but there are no benefits for them.  Cots in the rooms and highchairs in the restaurant, as well as a special menu, are not provided.  For the youngest tourists there is only a section with a shallow depth in a common adult pool. </p><h2>  Sea </h2><p>  For an excellent beach holiday, the Prazeres Resort 3 * hotel is quite suitable.  Goa is proud of its coastline, stretching for many tens of kilometers.  In Candolim, according to the general opinion of vacationers, the beach is the cleanest and most well-groomed.  From the hotel you can walk on a very busy street.  The road takes 7-15 minutes, depending on who moves how.  The beach is clean and very pleasant to the touch sand, clean, warm sea all year round.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid here (from 100 rupees per day), but you can also take them for free by buying in the neck to which they belong something edible or a drink.  Free Wi-Fi works the same way.  An exotic feature of the beach is cows walking along it. </p>

    <p>  In addition to Candolim, vacationers in Prazeres Resort 3 * can go on vacation to Calangute, which is only 4 km away, or to the beach in the village of Baghe, located 5 km from the hotel.  There is also a small water park. </p><p>  When planning a trip to this hotel and generally to Goa, it should be noted that India has the best months for a beach holiday - from November to April inclusive.  It is at this time that the least rainfall occurs, and the wind is weak, that is, there are no high waves at sea.  There is also little rainfall in May, but the wind is already quite strong.  The most inappropriate months to visit Goa are June and July.  During this period, the wind is especially strong, the sea is closed for swimming, and on average, rainy days are 25-27 out of 30. </p><h2>  Entertainment outside the hotel </h2><p>  For active tourists a good option is the Prazeres Resorts 3 * hotel.  India (including Goa) with its unique identity, unique color and the brightest colors - that‚Äôs why it is worth making such a trip.  Numerous excursions (to old <span>Goa, Panaji,</span> other settlements, to numerous temples, including Shantadurga, to a butterfly park and bird sanctuary, to a crocodile farm and spice plantations, swimming on the river and visiting the famous night market and dozens of others) can be bought at the hotel either on the beach. </p>

    <p>  It is even more profitable to order a taxi and visit all the interesting places on your own.  A taxi in Candolim costs 15 rupees per km, but you can always agree on cheaper payment.  Another option is to rent a bike (from 200 rupees per day). </p><p>  In addition to excursions, many tourists in Goa are interested in shopping.  To do this, it is best to go to the capital of the state of Panaji, but also in Candolim, and not far from the hotel, there are numerous shops and shops with souvenirs, cashmere scarves, spices and other Indian goods.  Especially popular is the Newtons supermarket, considered the largest in the state. </p><h2>  Security </h2><p>  Goa was once a Portuguese colony.  The word Prazeres in Portuguese means "pleasure", which every tourist who comes here counts on.  The hotel has a security service, but, according to the guests, the items and money often disappear from the rooms, which always goes unpunished.  Therefore, a paid safe at the reception here is very relevant.  Also, according to tourists, in this hotel there are cases of provoking conflicts by individual employees in order to extort money to settle affairs with the police. </p><h2>  Additional Information </h2><p>  From all of the above, a conclusion follows: only for unpretentious tourists who come to India for the sake of outdoor activities and exploring the country, Prazeres Resort 3 * is suitable.  Reviews of guests repeatedly note that the hotel is not suitable for citizens with children, as well as for those who count on excellent service.  The category "three stars" in this case is present only in the brochures of some travel agencies.  In fact, Prazeres Resort is a typical ‚Äúdeuce‚Äù.  Even from European hotels of this category one should not expect anything special, and in India, where there are completely different concepts of service and cleanliness, all the more so.  This should be considered by all tourists buying a tour to this hotel.  Its main advantage is its low price, which is fully justified. </p><p>  Check in here starts at 12 noon.  For early settlement will have to pay (from $ 20).  For a more comfortable room also requires a serious surcharge (from $ 200).  You need to free the room before 11 a.m. </p><p>  The staff practically does not know Russian, only English and their native language. </p><p>  Pets with animals of any kind are prohibited. </p>
