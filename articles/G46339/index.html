Stained glass on glass is absolutely safe, and it can be done with children.  It is made using acrylic paints.  To perform this work, you do not need to have any special skills or abilities.  The necessary colors can be bought at any art or hardware store.  Painting can be done not only on transparent surfaces, but also on wood, plastic, ceramics, metal or plaster. </p><h2>  Facts only </h2><p>  The name "stained glass" comes from the Latin word vitrum - "glass", which means transparent patterns, paintings or drawings made on glass or colored glass. </p><p>  Stained glass on glass originates in antiquity.  Most often it was used in temples and churches.  In the temples of Germany and France, the first plot stained-glass windows were used, made in bizarre forms, of different colors, of sufficiently large sizes.

    <h2>  Stained glass acrylic </h2><p>  So, we begin to make stained glass on glass neatly and without rushing. </p><p>  Glass is laid out on a previously prepared sketch, the edges are aligned so that the drawing is in the right place.  Glass must first be washed and degreased, for this you can use ordinary vinegar or alcohol. </p><p>  To make the line drawn by the contour thinner, a special metal tip is put on it.  Using the contour, the drawing is applied to the glass.  The movements should be fairly confident, clear and fast, with light pressure on the bottle.  In order for the paint to flow out better, and the contour was a bit voluminous, the tip must be kept at a large angle to the glass.  The contour must be applied carefully enough so that there are no gaps in the drawing, since then it will need to be filled with liquid paint, and it can blur through the holes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  After the application of the main contour is completed, you must wait until it dries.  Then we proceed to fill it.  The technique of filling the circuit is so simple that you can do it even with a child.  For this, the necessary shades of acrylic paints are selected.  When working, you need to remember that the paint should be applied to the surface exactly as much as not to exceed the height of the contour.  If the paint has flowed a little on the contour, you should not worry, after drying it will become transparent, and your slip will not be so noticeable. </p><p>  Doing stained glass on <span>glass with their own hands,</span> artists often want to get smooth transitions or various shades.  To do this, mix or blend several colors.  This can be done with a regular toothpick.  One of the colors is applied along the <span>contour of the picture,</span> with a small distribution to the center.  Then, from the center to the edges, a second color is applied, which is necessary for mixing.  Then, with a toothpick, the paint is mixed and leveled to spread evenly over the element to be painted.  If air bubbles appear during application, they can be easily removed with the same toothpick. </p><h2>  Little tricks </h2><ul><li>  During operation, do not worry that the <span>stained glass paint is</span> quite pale and does not look the way you would like.  After drying, it will darken a little and become much more transparent. </li><li>  To paint more evenly, you can lightly tap on the bottom of the glass - it will spread better. </li><li>  It is very convenient to work with acrylic paint not only on horizontal planes.  She can also decorate <span>window panes,</span> and even make a stained glass window on the door glass without removing it from the frame. </li><li>  To make the picture look a bit voluminous, use a sponge when applying a pure white color. </li></ul>

    <h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><p>  A stained-glass window on glass is created quite quickly, while the work will not have its own kind.  The biggest advantage of such a painting will be its practicality.  Drawn stained-glass windows, in contrast to soldered ones, can be used for large surfaces; moreover, they do not require cutting out individual pieces of glass and fixing them on the sketch.  Therefore, painting glass with acrylics, you get a solid and solid image.  In addition, stained glass on the glass, made of paints, can be inserted into a double-glazed window, which will save much more heat than if a soldered stained glass is inserted into them. </p><p>  Glass painting fits much more easily into any apartment interior, while solder stained-glass windows require a carefully selected setting.  In addition, the painted glass perfectly transmit light, creating a light kaleidoscope effect. </p><h2>  Other types of stained glass </h2><p>  Stained glass on glass with paints is the easiest to do at home, but there are other types and methods of such work. </p>
