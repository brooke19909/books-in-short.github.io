    <p>  Several production technologies.  The more popular is the effect of solutions on materials that contain silica at constant temperatures.  The second option is the fusion of water and sand. </p><p>  As for the application, various construction and finishing works are impossible without this composition.  There is no better material for waterproofing than water glass.  They have known for a long time what it is, for these purposes they have not yet created anything better.  The use of this adhesive many times increases the life of buildings. </p><p>  Silicate glue is produced on the basis of sodium, potassium or lithium, although the latter is used very rarely.  Potash is used in many areas, and it has excellent technical characteristics and properties.  If you compare this glue and liquid glass, sodium, then the first composition has a more loose structure.  The seams made using this glue do not differ in stability. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Both potassium and sodium adhesives can be used in many areas, but potassium-based compounds are much less common.  The thing is that its price is quite high.  Therefore, it is often replaced by sodium adhesives. </p><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  At chemical plants, sulfuric anhydrite, iron and aluminum oxides, a silicate module, sodium and calcium oxides, and silicon dioxide are used to produce this universal product.  Sodium and potassium water glass will be composed of sodium oxide and calcium, but in smaller compositions.  So, glass with sodium has 9% sodium, and calcium - only 0.2%. </p><h2>  Specifications </h2><p>  This glass meets GOST 13078-81.  The speed with which this material will dry out depends on how and where it is applied.  If glass is used in its pure form, it will dry out within 10 minutes.  As part of mixtures, the pour time can take from 2 hours. </p>

    <p>  <span>The density of the glass</span> is up to 1.45 g / cm <sup>3</sup> .  Shelf life is 2 years.  The specific gravity is 1.45.  To melt silicate glue, it is necessary to heat it to 1088 degrees. </p><h2>  Production </h2><p>  The process of manufacturing liquid glass is quite complicated, so they produce material in chemical plants.  First of all, quartz is crushed to sand, and then mixed with soda, potash, sodium or potassium sulfates. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Then all this is fused into a monolithic ingot.  Autoclaves are used for this.  After melting, the resulting mass must also be dissolved.  In this case, the temperatures will be about 170 degrees.  This process is quite lengthy and takes about 7 hours. </p><h2>  Application </h2><p>  In the construction industry, they have long understood and managed to apply liquid glass.  What is it, understandably, but how is glue used?  Thanks to the main property, or rather high adhesive ability, this material has become one of the components for various building mixtures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liquid glass Price" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1194126.jpg" width="414"></div>

    <p>  Sodium and potassium glass nevertheless have a different composition, and this determines the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir use.  The latter is resistant to chemical and atmospheric influences.  Often this material is used as one of the ingredients for the production of protective paints. </p><p>  Sodium glass can improve glue quality.  The material works great with minerals.  Silicate sodium glue is widely used for waterproofing foundations.  Antiseptic and fireproof mixtures are also prepared on its basis.  But there are other properties that liquid glass has. </p>

    <p>  What is it, only professional builders know.  However, there is no better way to produce insulating materials.  Designs with this product can withstand very high temperatures. </p><p>  This material is almost completely harmless to humans.  However, you need to work with it very carefully: everything is to blame for alkali - one of the components.  It is best to use gloves when working. </p><h2>  Liquid glass: low price, excellent results </h2><p>  Not only because of the high characteristics of this product began to be used in construction.  Unlike other similar materials, the cost of glass is very low (200 rubles for 5 kg).  Therefore, it is used as one of the components in concrete solutions.  It is possible at its expense to significantly increase the strength of the structure and moisture resistance.  Silicate glue is able to fill even the smallest cracks or bumps as much as possible. </p><p>  With all the advantages, there is also a small drawback - fast hardening speed.  Sometimes it‚Äôs not too practical.  Therefore, more often with silicate glue, the surface is simply impregnated.  And if it is then painted or plastered, then liquid glass should not be used. </p><h2>  Not only for construction </h2><p>  This material is popular not only in this industry.  Many drivers use liquid glass for cars.  Until recently, only wax was among the body protection products, and today a special ceramic composition or unique nanocoating is very popular. </p><p>  Ceramic coating with liquid glass provides the body with a specular gloss, high water and dirt repellent properties, high resistance to sunlight, protection from scratches and chemical attack.  You can easily buy liquid glass - its price is very low. </p>

    <p>  However, nanocosmetics based on it should also be looked at for sale.  There are also certain difficulties with applying these compounds to the body. </p><h2>  Application technology </h2><p>  The process of processing a car is called <span>ceramic polishing.</span>  It is the same for all nanopreparations.  First of all, the car should be washed thoroughly.  Then degrease the entire surface of the body.  For this, sparing drugs are chosen.  Next, polishing is performed with the removal of old residues of <span>polishing pastes</span> and various impregnations.  Then remove chips and polish again to a shine.  Next, liquid glass is applied.  They knew what it is for a long time, but they started using it only a couple of years ago.  It must be applied from 3 to 10 layers.  Then the body is dried for 8 hours.  If you have certain skills, then you can apply the composition with your own hands.  But to do the same in the service station will cost a high price. </p><h2>  How long does the coating last? </h2><p>  Liquid glass for cars, according to manufacturers, can be kept on the body for up to 3 years.  However, updating it is still recommended more often.  It is better to do this once a year if the machine is used every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="liquid glass reviews" class="if" height="461" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12663/1194129.jpg" width="600"></div>

The manufacturers of these mixtures indicate abstinence from washing for 3 weeks in the recommendations.  Then there will be practically no dirt on the body, and it will be enough just to rinse. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  <span>Nanoceramics for cars</span> really work.
