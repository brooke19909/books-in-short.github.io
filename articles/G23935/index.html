It doesn‚Äôt matter what the name of the holiday, be it New Year or Birthday, for children the main thing is to receive a long-awaited gift.  In anticipation of extraordinary surprises, boys and girls count the days to bring closer the fabulous time for receiving gifts.  It is sometimes very difficult for parents to make a good present for various reasons.  Some can not afford to buy an expensive gift for a child, while others have already gifted everything before, so now they can not come up with anything original. </p><p>  An alternative to choosing holiday surprises in various situations can be a gift made by yourself.  An original gift for a child, created with his own hands, will be more valuable than a purchased one, because in making it, parents put all their love and warmth into the product.  It does not matter how old the child is, the main thing is to make a gift that will be unique and unforgettable. </p>

    <h2>  What gift to make? </h2><p>  Sometimes it happens that many mothers and grandmothers lack ideas for making creative things.  But this is not a problem, it is worth watching the child and, learning about his preferences, get to work.  Children under ten years old can safely sew, knit, glue various toys from cardboard and other materials.  Elders will use homemade earrings, beads, sweater bracelets, bags and other things.  In fact, the choice of things for needlework is very large, and everyone can always make the one that suits him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Universal gifts </h2><p>  An excellent surprise for any occasion as a main gift or addition to something will be the so-called universal gift.  Most often, sweets are called that, but not just a bar of chocolate or a box of chocolates, because you can buy and eat them on a weekday, but a chic set consisting of various delicacies.  A basket with sweets filled to the top with delicious surprises will be remembered for a long time by any person, regardless of his age. </p>

    <p>  The principle of operation is the manufacture of a three-dimensional frame of the required shape from cardboard.  For example, if you make a car, you must first glue it from cardboard, then give it a presentable appearance by gluing it with corrugated paper and bordering it with ribbons.  Only after the work done should we start decorating with sweets.  Sweets must be selected, taking into account the shape of the product, for some round candies are suitable, for others - rectangular or square.  The selected goodies must be glued so that bare places are not visible from under them.  Candies should only be glued to double-sided tape and in no case should glue be used.  The final step will be the packaging of candy souvenirs in a transparent gift wrap.  For these types of gifts, you need to choose sweets in very colorful wrappers, then the made present will look festive and will undoubtedly cause a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãapplause. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New Year's fantasies </h2><p>  Such an unusually fabulous holiday, like the <span>New Year, is</span> undoubtedly waiting for children of all ages.

    <p>  Gift Santa Claus can be created from sweets by the method described earlier, but then it will be short-lived.  Santa Claus, made of thread with his own hands, looks unusually.  To make it, you will need the following materials: white threads, two balloons, PVA glue, pieces of black and red felt, white fleecy threads (for the beard), a small section of scarlet velvet or velvet fabric (for clothes) and strips of any white or golden color.  Having collected all the necessary materials, you can begin to work: </p><ol><li>  Inflate two balls, one large (for the body), the other smaller (for the head). </li><li>  Balls carefully, in turn, spread with PVA glue. </li><li>  The ball smeared with glue must be wrapped with white thread so that there are no large bald spots between them.  Outwardly, such a ball looks like a piece of openwork.  With the second ball, do the same as with the first.  After this, let the glue dry on the spheres. </li><li>  When the glue dries completely, you will need to pierce the balls with a needle and carefully remove them.  Thus, you get durable balls of thread. </li><li>  Next, you need to begin bonding the torso and head of the future Santa Claus.  Do this with PVA glue. </li><li>  The next step is to make clothes for the fairy-tale hero.  The easiest way is to make a red cloak that will look like a coat.  To do this, you need to take a cloth and cut out a circle from it, the size of which will fit a large ball (body).  In the center of the big circle, make a small circle, it needs to be cut, it will be the neck.  Then, from one edge of the large circle, make an incision to the neckline.  Thus, a wrap will be obtained, which will need to be glued to the body. </li><li>  A white border made of fluffy fabric should be glued along the edge of the cape and on the neckline. </li><li>  Next, proceed to the production of a beard.  Take the fleecy threads and, cutting them into small pieces, stick in the place where the beard will be attached.  In the same way, make and stick hair to Santa Claus. </li><li>  Now it's time to start gluing eyes cut from felt, nose and eyebrows. </li><li>  It remains to make only a hat for the holiday hero.  To do this, cut an oval from red fabric, bend it in half and glue it on the sides.  Glue the same material to the bottom of the cap as on the hem of the cape.  Glue the hat to the head of the protagonist.  Santa Claus is ready. </li></ol><p>  If you wish, you can make a grandfather a small bag for gifts, which will fit small souvenirs for children.  If Santa Claus is intended for a girl, then you can put hairpins and elastic bands for hair or other jewelry in a bag.  For boys, you can stack small cars or designers.  A bag filled with sweets will also look good.  Such a gift will be good not only as a toy, but also as an annual decoration for the New Year tree. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Making <span>gifts for children for the New Year</span> with their own hands, you can not only create a creative thing, but also have a great rest.  After all, the creative process allows a person to distance themselves from the hustle and bustle of everyday problems and relax in the process of translating the plan into reality. </p><p>  To make gifts for children for the New Year with your own hands, it is not necessary to buy expensive materials for their manufacture.  Surely in every house there is everything you need for this.  Indeed, from various unsightly pieces of fabric, beads, ribbons and threads, you can make delicious toys. </p><h2>  Little fashionistas </h2><p>  Making a gift for a girl with her own hands sometimes seems easier than for a boy.  After all, little fashionistas can always be pleased by giving them homemade beads, hair clips, bracelets, rings and other little things.  A suitable gift for a young lady is a self-made bag.  Even if the child already has the bags, another one will not hurt, because it will differ from others in its unique design.  And children always want to brag to their peers with their original new things, which no one else will have. </p>

    <p>  Before you start creating baby bags with your own hands, you need to be sure that you can do the job effectively.  Therefore, if you do not have much experience in knitting, crocheting or you do not know how to sew, then choose bag models a little easier. </p><p>  There is a huge selection of patterns and patterns in order to make children's handbags with your own hands, but you can come up with a completely unique model if you wish.  Small handbags knitted on knitting needles look very nice.  To make a simple model of such a bag, you need to tie a canvas measuring 20 x 20 cm. Choose the thread size at your discretion.  If you plan to make a lining, then the threads can be of medium thickness, if without it, then choose a thicker yarn. </p><p>  The cloth is knitted with any patterns, for beginners it is best to knit it with either the wrong side or front loops.  Then it is sewn on the sides with a needle or crochet.  To make handles for a bag, you need to knit two identical strips of 5 cm wide on the needles, the length will depend on the height of the child (the handles should not be too long or short).  Then, having sewn the handles to the bag, you need to start decorating the product.  Even a bag of the simplest style can be made a designer thing, correctly decorating it with various trifles. </p><p>  You can decorate the product with various beads or embroider with crocheted flowers.  Original icons on which there may be inscriptions with the name of the girl also look beautiful on a knitted bag.  If desired, the handles and edges of the bag can be further tied with threads of other colors using a hook or a large needle.  It is not necessary to sew a snake in such bags, but if the child carries a bunch of small things in it, then in order not to lose them, you will have to mount the zipper in the product.  Most of all, multi-colored lightnings are suitable for these purposes. </p><p>  Having made a gift for children with your own hands in the form of such a handbag, it can additionally be filled with various surprises.  For example, if you put in your purse a beautiful mirror and a comb, as well as perfumes and nail polish, designed for little fashionistas, then you can certainly surprise a child with such a surprise. </p><h2>  Little defenders </h2><p>  In order to please a little son or grandson with a present, you don‚Äôt need to sit and waste time thinking about what would be interesting to do.  A beautiful car is a great gift for a boy who will make it very easy and simple with his own hands.  Dad and grandfathers can be involved in such work, because they are more versed in cars and will probably be able to suggest good ideas. </p>

    <p>  Making such a gift to children with your own hands, you will surely please them, because there are no such boys who do not like cars.  The choice of car models is very large, starting with the truck and ending with the version of the race car. </p><h2>  Which one to choose? </h2><p>  It‚Äôs very hard not to get confused when choosing a car model for manual work, because it‚Äôs not always possible to make a miniature copy of a real car.  But it is very easy to get out of this situation by making a large model of cardboard.  A home-made car should not be the same size as a real one, but large enough so that the child can fit there. </p><p>  Almost all houses have unnecessary cardboard boxes left over from the purchase of household appliances, and it is from them that a wonderful machine can be made with their own hands.  To do this, you need to take a large box, for example from a washing machine, and give it a car shape.  To make a windshield, it is necessary to bend one of the closing sides of the top in half and unbend it, then attach the cover to the box with adhesive tape until the fold.  The rest of the closing top (unused) must be cut off. </p>

    <p>  The whole machine should be pasted over with colored paper or painted with paint.  Then draw all the necessary parts of the machine on top of the colored paper (doors, handles).  Wheels can be drawn too, but there is another option.  Turning the plastic plate upside down, paint it blue and attach it to the center of the drawn tires, these will be the disks.  The steering wheel can also be made of a plastic plate, attaching it to the right place with the help of a secure mount that will allow the steering wheel to rotate.  Lights to paint and paint with yellow paint.  That's all, the machine is made with your own hands!  Now it remains to decorate it with a gift bow. </p><h2>  Would you like it? </h2><p>  Making a gift for children with their own hands, many worry about whether they like the thing done.  What if the present is not to your liking and the child is upset?  In fact, all young children are always happy with any gifts.  And when they find out that the object was specially made for them by their own people, they value the presentations even more. </p><h2>  What to make the smallest? </h2><p>  Sometimes it is very difficult for parents to come up with a gift for the youngest children.  They think that children from 3 to 5 years old need completely different surprises.  Undoubtedly, all toys must correspond to the age of the child and participate in its development.  But little girls and boys will enjoy playing with various homemade products, the main thing is not to use small parts for their manufacture.  When making a gift for a child with his own hands (5 years old or 10 years old - it doesn‚Äôt matter), one thing to remember is that all materials for gifts should be non-toxic and safe. </p><h2>  Gift wrapping </h2><p>  Preparing for the holidays and making gifts on your own, you need to think through everything to the end, because in this matter, as in any other, little things are important.  Therefore, after you have made a gift to your children with your own hands, you need to take care of its colorful wrapper.  It does not matter at all whether it will be a beautiful oilcloth or a packaging made by one‚Äôs own, the main thing is that it should be as bright and colorful as possible.  Your children will remember such vivid impressions from the holidays for a long time. </p>
