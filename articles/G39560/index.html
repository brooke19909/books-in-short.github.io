    <p>  Yes.  It has already been said that often adults have higher daily wages.  500 rubles per day is approximately 10,000 per month.  Not much, but making so much is real.  The main thing is to know how.  What advice and recommendations do people give each other regarding the task? </p><h2>  Official work </h2><p>  Where to earn 500 rubles a day?  More often than not, the best idea is to simply get a formal job.  Relevant advice mainly for adults.  Adult citizens in almost any job will receive the indicated amount.  As already mentioned, the monthly income for a 5-day working week will be 10 thousand rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  So many cleaners get in most regions.  Therefore, often the advice "find a job" really helps.  The main thing is that in a month the performance of labor duties is estimated at no less than 10,000 rubles. </p><h2>  Public catering </h2><p>  How to earn a student 500 rubles a day?  In Russia, there are now quite a few prospects for the <span>employment of minors.</span>  This chance is required to be used.  If a child wants to earn 500 rubles a day without investments, it is best to advise several attractive vacancies. </p><p>  The first and most common offer is work in the catering.  Or rather, in a fast food cafe.  It is allowed to work here from the age of 14, official employment - from 16. Payment is hourly.  The student can work no more than 4 hours.  With age, the duration of labor increases.  Accordingly, earnings also become higher. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to earn 500 rubles a day" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466894.jpg"></div>

    <p>  As practice shows, most often an hour of work in a fast food cafe allows you to earn 160 rubles.  For 4 hours of work, the student will receive 160 * 4 = 640 rubles.

Or payment will be negotiated, for a fully worked day.  As many say, "for the exit."  Promotions are paid on average just in the specified 500 rubles.  Sometimes more, in some cases less. </p><p>  Work, as already mentioned, is perfect for people of any age who want to make a one-time profit. </p><h2>  Property surrender </h2><p>  How to earn 500 rubles a day?

And 500 rubles a day for such a side job is the norm. </p><p>  How to receive the indicated amount?  To do this, you can rent property.  No investment.  Just set the rent so that the monthly amount is at least 15,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="where to earn 500 rubles a day" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/1466895.jpg"></div>
