Over time, they were superseded by the more convenient and cheaper format of 35 mm film cameras.  However, now the use of medium format cameras is becoming more and more popular, even the first digital analogues have appeared.  You can read more about the nuances of choice, the best manufacturers and places of purchase of professional film cameras in this article. </p><h2>  Medium format in photography </h2><p>  In the last century in the world of photography there were many different formats.  But only two took root and became widespread - 35 mm and medium format.  At first, all photographers used medium-format cameras, but over time, most of them switched to 35-mm film, since cameras with it were much more compact and convenient.  In addition, large format cameras didn‚Äôt have automatic parts, and people had to manually rewind and rewind the film, as well as measure exposure. </p><div class="photo" data-original="chemicalcameras.wordpress.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="medium format digital cameras" class="if uuid-2563698" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2563698.jpg"></div><p>  Currently in the world you can find the following options for medium format cameras: </p><ul><li>  Modern (digital) SLR cameras. </li><li>  Dual Object SLR Camera (TLR). </li><li>  Mirror frames with one (interchangeable) lens: SLR. </li></ul><h2>  Differences between conventional and medium format cameras </h2><p>  The term "medium format" refers to a class in a camera that has a film frame measuring 4.5 by 6 or 6 * 9 centimeters.  Medium format differs from ordinary cameras, first of all, in quality.  Due to the large <span>size of the matrix</span> and the frame of a larger area, the camera captures more information and the pictures are more detailed.  Initially, medium format cameras were used by professionals, it was from 6x9 film that they printed material for magazines and posters.  The question is, why are medium-format cameras now so popular again?  The answer is simple - no matter how hard the developers of digital cameras try, they still fail to achieve the quality of conventional film cameras.  The camera, released in the last century, shoots with a resolution of 50 megapixels, which exceeds all the indicators of digital analogues.  Of course, this is the picture that will be chosen for printing large banners, because it has simply amazing detail with minimal distortion.  True, and the camera for this should be good, you should take into account some of the nuances of shooting.  The medium format has many advantages and a couple of minuses.  The pluses include: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Great information capacity.  A larger frame captures more details, which means that the graininess of the image decreases, but the smoothness of the transitions increases. </li><li>  Accurate colors and shades.  Many modern photographers try to achieve "film color" in digital photographs.  The medium format camera allows you to create natural colors that do not need to be adjusted in any way. </li><li>  Focal lengths on such cameras, as a rule, are greater than on small-format ones. <div class="photo" data-original="thecoolimages.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="medium format hasselblad cameras" class="if uuid-2565349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2565349.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  However, medium format cameras also have disadvantages that often stop photographers who want to purchase them: </p><ul><li>  The high cost of technology. </li><li>  A lot of weight. </li><li>  Lack of automatic settings. </li><li>  The high cost of consumables (film, development). </li></ul><h2>  The most famous models </h2><p>  If you decide to buy a medium format film camera, then you will probably want to choose the best model from the existing ones on the market.  Below are the "best sellers" in the camera market. </p><ol><li>  Hasselblad - this camera is a tool of professionals and is known throughout the world.  With this camera, you get wonderful quality pictures. </li><li>  Mamiya has produced many medium-format models for 120 films.  The most famous is Mamiya 645, which is often sold in thrift stores. </li><li>  Pentax is loved by many photographers for its soft color reproduction and perfect picture.  The most popular model is the 645N, which can be purchased for about $ 70. </li><li>  You can buy a Seagull camera if your budget is limited.  These are lower-class cameras, which, nevertheless, make excellent shots.  They belong to the class of dual-lens cameras, in which one lens is needed for focusing, and the other for shooting. </li><li>  ‚ÄúKiev‚Äù - on the market you can find cameras with a frame window size of 4.5 * 6 and 6 * 9 cm. Cameras made in the USSR have a much more affordable price than their imported competitors.  After the purchase, it is important to give the camera for a routine examination to a specialist. </li></ol><h2>  Digital Medium Format </h2><div class="photo" data-original="photorumors.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="medium format hasselblad cameras" class="if uuid-2565360" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2565360.jpg"></div><p>  A rare photographer will remain indifferent to medium-sized cameras.  Manufacturers realized this, and in 2010 the production of new, digital cameras with a large digital sensor, which is similar to the film format, began.  As in the case of film cameras, you get in the transition from the usual 35 mm to the medium format - this is color accuracy and high image detail.  Modern cameras consist of several parts: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the camera itself; </li><li>  a digital backdrop that allows you to convert an optical image into a digital one. </li></ul><p>  What companies are represented by the digital medium format in today's market? </p><ol><li>  <span>Pentax 645Z</span> has a large matrix with a size of 43 * 32 mm, which is 1.5 times the size of small-format cameras.  Even compared to full-frame cameras, Pentax captures significantly more details.  The light sensitivity of this camera is 204,800 ISO, which allows you to shoot it in almost complete darkness. </li><li>  Mamiya also released a digital analogue of the film medium format: 645 DF +.  Despite its high cost, this camera has very modest parameters: the maximum light sensitivity is 800 ISO.  But in matters of shooting speed and image quality, she has no equal, therefore, this camera is often chosen by professionals. </li><li>  The Phase One medium format camera is new to the market.  But the technical specifications of the camera are impressive.  The 53.7x40.4 mm CMOS matrix allows you to take frames with a resolution of up to 101 MP.  A wide dynamic range allows you to transfer details both in the lightest and darkest parts of the frame. </li><li>  The Hasselblad medium format camera is a revival of the legendary brand.  This Swedish legend is already nearly 180 years old. The sensitivity of the matrix reaches 12800 units, and the number of active pixels is 51. The cameras of the well-known brand became universal: thanks to the shutter speed, fast autofocus and the function of transferring pictures via Wi-Fi, they can be used in absolutely different tasks. </li></ol><h2>  Medium format Fujifilm cameras </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theverge.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="<mixchars> c </mixchars> fujifilm red format cameras" class="if uuid-2565352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2565352.jpg"></div><p>  For a very long time, fans of the Fuji brand have been waiting for the release of a medium format camera.  Most recently, the company released a modern model with a large matrix - GFX 50S.  This camera has a number of advantages inherent in all medium format cameras.  Thanks to mirrorless technology, the Fujifilm 50S is capable of taking several hundred shots per minute, while not making almost any noise.  Also, the camera has a rotary screen, the function of shooting video and the ability to use a variety of interchangeable lenses.  At the same time, the new camera is not too heavy due to the relatively light body. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hasselblad cameras </h2><p>  One of the very first manufacturers of medium format cameras was Hasselblad, which had previously become famous for its film cameras, and then began to produce digital cameras.  Among the most famous films, the 500C / M model is considered, which glorified the Swedish brand.  Despite their solid lifespan, these cameras still work flawlessly due to their high build quality.  The external camera is similar to the Mamiya, but it has one indisputable advantage.  The Hasselblad 500C / M camera is equipped with Carl Zeiss optics, so that the photos taken on it are sharp and with an interesting pattern.  True, you should not hope that time has reduced the price of this model - as before, you can buy a Hasselblad medium format camera no cheaper than $ 100 (6,000 rubles). </p><p>  Hasselblad H6D-100C was the first digital version of previous models.  Despite the fact that medium format digital cameras are significantly inferior to classic 35 mm cameras in shooting speed, weight and price, they are considered the best in the world.  Why?  The fact is that Hasselblad surpasses other systems in sharpness, ease of control and quality of optics.  For medium-sized digital cameras of this company, there are more than 20 lenses that impress with their quality and impeccable optics.  Of course, the Hasselblad brand is not the cheapest in the world, but it costs its money. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bhphotovideo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="medium format cameras review" class="if uuid-2565337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2565337.jpg"></div><h2>  The most affordable medium format camera </h2><p>  Those who are just starting to get acquainted with the world of medium format photography often ask the question of which camera is the most affordable for purchase?  It is definitely impossible to answer this question.  At the moment, the cheapest can be considered film cameras, which are sold at flea markets and on specialized sites.  Their price depends on the condition of the <span>camera, brand</span> and seller.  One of the most affordable medium format cameras at the moment can be considered the following: </p><ul><li>  The Soviet ‚ÄúAmateur‚Äù camera was manufactured in the 40s and 50s of the 20th century and now it is practically an antique, which, however, can be removed.  The price of such a camera is only about 2-3 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Yashica-MAT LM is a classic Japanese medium format camera with a film of 120 mm and a frame window size of 6 * 6 cm. You can purchase for 13-15 thousand rubles. </li><li>  Mamiya C3 - a two-lens reflex <span>camera with interchangeable lenses.</span>  The cost starts from 30 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  In general, the following principle dominates the world of film photography: the more expensive, the better.  Therefore, the larger the budget you have, the more high-quality equipment you can purchase.  Many photographers are wondering if Canon has medium format cameras?  This company has long been a leader in the production of cameras, but its leaders do not yet plan to produce cameras with an expanded matrix. </p><h2>  Instruction for use </h2><p>  Many photographers ask where to start?  Medium format cameras have a completely different device than the usual 35 mm.  Each brand has its own nuances, but general operating principles can be distinguished. </p><ul><li>  First of all, if you have a film camera, you need to choose the right type of film.  120 type fits almost all cameras.  Medium format cameras are not equipped with automatic ‚Äúscrolling‚Äù of the film, so after you fill it in, you will need to scroll it to the end yourself. </li><li>  Then you need to set the correct settings.  Medium format cameras are usually not equipped with a built-in exposure meter, so it can be purchased separately or be guided by the standard table for the ISO ratio and aperture values. </li><li>  After you have shot, you must manually scroll forward. </li><li>  In the end, with the utmost care, you need to remove the film and give it to print or scan.  Modern film scanners allow you to transfer all information to a digital version in high resolution, so most photographers prefer this option. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.bjp-online.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="fujifilm medium format cameras" class="if uuid-2565346" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2565346.jpg"></div><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  A review of medium format cameras proves that their cost can start from several thousand and reach several million.  This is an area in which new cameras are more expensive than some cars.  Below is a list of the most popular models and their cost. </p><ol><li>  Mamiya 645 together with a standard lens of 80 mm will cost 30-40 thousand rubles.  The cheaper model RZ67 is sold on Ebay for 17 thousand.  The new Mamiya medium-format digital cameras are already selling much more expensive, their price has increased due to an improved design and a digital back.  The cost of such a model starts from 2.5 million rubles. </li><li>  A supported Hasseblad film camera in the basic configuration is sold for 30-40 thousand rubles.  If you want to purchase a ready-made kit with branded CarlZeiss optics right away, then you will have to pay 50-100 thousand rubles.  Hasseblad, like other manufacturers, also released a digital version of medium formats, the prices of which start at 800 thousand rubles and reach up to 2.5 million, depending on the model of camera. </li><li>  The legendary Pentax 645 with a frame window size of 4.5x6 cm is sold on stocks at a price of 30 to 80 thousand rubles, but individual copies are sold for 13-15 thousand, it all depends on the quality of the equipment.  But the new digital Pentax 645Z with a fast lens will cost about 550 thousand.  At the moment, this is the cheapest medium format digital camera. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="lukecaseyphotography.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="<mixchars> c </mixchars> red format digital cameras" class="if uuid-2565350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51639/2565350.jpg"></div><h2>  The most frequent breakdowns and repairs </h2><p>  When working with supported equipment, you will undoubtedly run into some difficulties.  If you purchase a camera that is technically ideal, you will most likely need some help from specialists.  Immediately after the purchase, you must give the camera for a routine inspection and adjustment.  Indeed, for several decades, some elements of the camera probably stopped working as they should.  On the lenses of medium format cameras, quite often you can find mold between the glasses, which affects the final result.  Therefore, when choosing a supported camera, you need to pay attention to the comments of sellers, who, as a rule, indicate similar nuances in the description.  The most common breakdown is considered to be film flare and shutter problems.  So, for example, repairing the shutter of a medium format camera "Kiev" 88 can cost a price higher than the price of the camera itself.  And it‚Äôs not easy to find specialists in repairing old equipment.  To test this function, it is better to take a film with you and make a couple of test shots on the spot. </p>
