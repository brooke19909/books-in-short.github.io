    <h2>  Who is this smartphone for? </h2><p>  It is enough to take a quick look at the Lenovo S850 phone and it will become clear that this model is aimed at a female audience.  A thin case that combines glass and plastic in three colors: pink, white and dark blue.  Moreover, the first two options for the color performance of the gadget are focused specifically on the weak half of humanity.  And only the dark blue version is universal and suitable for both men and women.  Therefore, this device can be safely attributed to women's smartphones and give it to your soulmate for some holiday, such as Christmas, New Year or birthday. </p><h2>  Boxed version </h2><p>  Phone "Lenovo S850" by the manufacturer initially belonged to the segment of medium devices.  Now it can already be ranked among the decisions of the budget class.  But the equipment allows this gadget to be attributed to the middle segment of smart phones.  It includes such components and accessories: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ul><li>  Smartphone with a non-removable battery and a non-separable case. </li><li>  A standard interface cable with USB connectors and, of course, MicroUSB.  With it, you can charge the battery or connect to any personal computer with a USB port. </li><li>  Stereo headset with headphones and an additional set of pneumatic nozzles for them. </li><li>  Charger with an output current of 1 A. </li><li>  Clip for removing SIM cards. </li><li>  A quick guide to setup and operation and, of course, a warranty card. </li></ul><p>  Although the device‚Äôs case is made of reliable and high-quality materials, it will be difficult for the smartphone owner to do without a case.  A similar situation is with the front panel, which will be more reliable to protect with the help of a special film.  These two accessories will have to be bought immediately for an additional fee.  But the owners of this device will not need an external flash drive.  There is no slot for installing it in this device. </p>

    <h2>  Device design, location of communication ports and controls </h2><p>  There is much in common in the design of the iPhone 5S and the Lenovo S850.  The reviews of the owners of this smart phone indicate this feature.  On the front panel of the device is a 5-inch IPS display.  A <span>touch panel</span> of three control buttons is displayed below it.  Above the screen is a conversational speaker (it is protected by a metal mesh), a <span>front camera</span> and a number of sensors.  The side faces of the smartphone are made of plastic, but in its appearance it is very similar to metal (a similar design solution is implemented in the device from Apple).  On the right side of the gadget there are a lock button and a rocker, providing volume control device.  On the left edge is a slot for installing SIM cards.  The main loud speaker is also displayed here.  On the bottom side of the smart phone are all the wired ports of the gadget: MicroUSB and, of course, an audio port.  The body of the device and the back cover are made of shockproof glass (again, the analogy with Apple's smartphone is felt).  It has a hole in the main camera and LED backlight for it.  There is also a manufacturer‚Äôs logo, which in combination acts as an indicator of events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  CPU </h2><p>  One of the best entry-level processors installed in the Lenovo S850.  Reviews regarding the hardware resources of this smartphone are another confirmation of this.  MT6582 (just such a chip is used in this gadget) can easily cope with any, even the most demanding task.  This CPU consists of 4 computing modules that are based on the energy-efficient Cortex-A7 architecture.  Each individual core cannot boast a high level of performance, but their number allows us to solve the problem with a lack of computing resources.  Depending on the load, the frequency of each computing module can vary in the range from 600 MHz to 1.3 GHz.  If only one or two cores are needed to solve the problem, then unused modules are disabled.  It is such an algorithm of the processor part of the device that allows achieving a high level of system performance and saving the resource of the built-in battery.  In conclusion, it is worth noting that one of the most demanding gaming applications today - Asphalt 8 - will work without problems on this phone model. </p>

    <h2>  Display and video accelerator </h2><p>  The Lenovo S850 phone is equipped with a very high-quality display.  Reviews highlight this advantage over competitors.  Its matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãbased on the most common technology today - IPS.  This provides viewing angles that are as close as possible to 180 degrees.  Also, the brightness, color reproduction and contrast are impeccable.  <span>The screen resolution</span> in this model is 1280x720, that is, the image on the display is displayed in HD format.  It should also be noted that the air gap between the touch surface and the matrix of the screen in this device is absent, which means that the picture quality improves.  The Lenovo S850 smartphone is equipped with the Mali-400MP2 graphics accelerator.  Of course, he cannot boast of a high level of performance, but his computing capabilities are quite enough to solve any problem today, including the most demanding on the hardware resources of the smartphone. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Features of the device in photos and videos </h2><p>  The quality of the photo and video of the main camera does not allow to make claims to the Lenovo S850.  Customer reviews confirm this fact.  This is not surprising.  After all, the basis of the camera is a sensitive element, based on a 13 megapixel matrix.  Also, the device implements such software and hardware options as an autofocus system, digital zoom and LED backlight.  All this allows you to get high-quality photos in daylight.  Although there is a LED backlight in this gadget, it is quite difficult to achieve good image quality in the dark.  The main camera can record video in FullHD format, that is, with a <span>resolution of 1080x1920.</span>  In this case, the frequency of updating the image will be 30 frames per second.  Good technical specifications and the front camera at 5 megapixels.  This is quite enough to get high-quality photos in daylight, make video calls, IP-telephony and, of course, selfie. </p>

    <h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The memory subsystem is one of the main advantages of the Lenovo S850.  The amount of RAM is 1 GB.  This is quite enough for comfortable work on this device.  About 600 MB is occupied by the operating system and proprietary add-on "Lenovo Laucher 5".  The remaining 400 MB will be enough to run several fairly demanding applications at once.  The capacity of the internal drive is 16 GB.  Of these, about 4 GB is occupied by preinstalled software: all the same operating system and proprietary add-on.  The remaining 12 GB will be more than enough to install all the necessary application software and store personal data.  If for some reason the free space on the built-in drive runs out, then you can use free cloud services to store personal information.  But to install an additional external drive in this smartphone, as noted earlier, will not work: it does not have the necessary additional slot. </p><h2>  Gadget Autonomy </h2><p>  A non-removable <span>battery with a capacity of</span> 2150 mAh is integrated into the Lenovo S850 smartphone.  Reviews indicate two significant drawbacks: the low battery capacity and the inability to dismantle it on its own.  The nominal capacity is not enough for such a device.  Still, the screen size is decent 5 inches, and the processor includes four computing modules, albeit energy-efficient.  As a result, with an average level of load on the gadget, one battery charge is enough for 1-2 days of battery life.  If desired, this value can be increased to 3 days.  But at the same time you have to save on everything.  Another important nuance is the non-removable battery.  If it breaks, you will have to contact the service center.  On the other hand, the case quality of this smart phone is not satisfactory.  Apparently, the Chinese engineers had to sacrifice the autonomy, weight and capacity of the battery for a high-quality case. </p>

    <h2>  Interface set </h2><p>  An impressive set of interfaces is implemented in the Lenovo S850.  It includes both wired and wireless methods of transmitting information.  The main ones are: </p><ul><li>  The main way to transfer data is wireless wifi.  Its radius of action is relatively small, but with its help you can download large files quickly enough.  Also, this standard of information transfer allows you to view any Internet resources. </li><li>  The device is equipped immediately with 2 slots for SIM cards.  They can work in networks of the 2nd (GSM) and 3rd (3G) generations.  In the first case, the speed theoretically can reach 450 kbit / s.  In reality, this value is much smaller and at best is 150 kbit / s.  This is enough for social networks and unpretentious Internet sites. </li><li>  There is also in this gadget and Bluetooth.  It allows you to connect wireless headphones to your smartphone or exchange a small amount of information with a similar mobile device. </li><li>  The GPS sensor allows you to turn this smartphone into a full-fledged navigator. </li><li>  The microUSB wired port allows you to charge the battery and exchange data with the PC. </li><li>  The audio port, displayed on the lower edge of the device, makes it possible to connect wired external speakers to a smartphone. </li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  Under the control of one of the latest versions of Android with a serial number 4.4, the Lenovo S850 smartphone is functioning.  Reviews also highlight the presence of Lenovo Launcher 5th version.  The main feature of this program shell is that there is no additional menu, and the shortcuts of all installed programs are placed directly on the desktop (this nuance further integrates this smartphone with the iPhone 5S).  If necessary, you can immediately create a separate folder and group similar software products in it.  The rest of the software is typical: social network clients, pre-installed <span>system mini-programs</span> and a set of services from Google. </p>

    <h2>  Smart phone owners </h2><p>  The Lenovo S850 turned out to be very balanced.  Reviews confirm this.  Among the shortcomings, one can single out the fact that the smartphone has a non-separable case, a small capacity of the built-in battery and no slot for a microSD card.  The first of these disadvantages is offset by the impeccable build quality of the device.  Due to the second minus, the developers have achieved that the gadget weighs 150 grams and is quite thin - only 8.2 mm.  Well, in the latter case, a compensating drawback is the fact that the device has 16 GB of internal memory, and this is quite enough for storing personal data and for installing the necessary programs. </p><h2>  Price </h2><p>  The cost of 11,500 rubles at the moment is very modest for a gadget of such a class as the Lenovo S850.  The reviews, price and technical parameters of this smart phone simply do not leave competitors any chance.  Essentially, for the money you get a more modest version of the iPhone 5S, but the software gadget is based on the most popular software platform for mobile devices - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù. </p>
