Moreover, it is done quite simply.  It is necessary to take a sheet of whatman paper.  Further, support should be set at a great distance from each other.  It can be books or other items.  In place between the supports you need to put a white sheet.  You should get an arc.  It is best to make such a table for subject shooting on a large windowsill or in a place where there is a lot of daylight. </p><div class="photo" data-original="equitymates.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful books" class="if uuid-3186793" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112818/3186793.jpg"></div><p>  Another interesting variation is the photobox.  It also does not require much time and effort.  It is enough to take a large box and cut out all the walls in it except the back.  Instead of cardboard, you need to insert white sheets and attach them with adhesive tape.  It turns out such an illusion of a spacious and bright room.  Photos are very atmospheric. </p><h2>  Lighting </h2><p>  Light is the main source for creating beautiful and high-quality photos.  The main rule when shooting is cold daylight.  Books are worth photographing near large windows.  You can also create good lighting using artificial sources.  For example, cold-colored lamps, silver reflectors, white background.  All this can make the space sufficiently lit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="1ul.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Book and rose" class="if uuid-3186808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112818/3186808.jpg"></div><h2>  Composition </h2><p>  For photographs, it is better to choose books of the old format with a beautiful binding.  As for composition, it is important to remember the rule of "linear perspective".  Professional recommend taking pictures from the side, so they turn out to be more profitable.  In addition, the way books are arranged should also be considered.  It is best to stack them in an uneven stack and leave one open.  Also, the composition can be supplemented with any items: old pictures, a simple garland, flowers and so on.  The main thing is not to overload the frame with unnecessary objects, but to make it concise. </p><h2>  Examples </h2><p>  How to take pictures of books and coffee?  What can attract the attention of buyers?  Something cozy and homely in the picture.  This is considered one of the marketing tricks.  When a client sees something familiar and atmospheric in the photo, he immediately has a desire to purchase this product.  A cup of coffee is associated with homeliness, for which I want to read an interesting book.  The composition may be varied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.wsj.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Books and coffee" class="if uuid-3186800" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112818/3186800.jpg"></div><p>  An interesting option is to photograph books against the background of a chaotic mess in the interior.  It looks pretty homey.  You can add an atmospheric subject to the frame.  For example, a knitted blanket, a table lamp, a flower and so on. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.treehugger.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Books in the interior" class="if uuid-3186807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112818/3186807.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make the frame creative and unusual, you need to add an interesting object to it, which will attract the attention of buyers.  For example, glasses, a rose and much more.  The basic rule is the "atmospheric" (addictive effect) photo. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.frekuenca.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Books and glasses" class="if uuid-3186804" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/112818/3186804.jpg"></div><h2>  Tips from professionals </h2><p>  Professional photographers advise using a flash when shooting, because with it, frames become bright and bright.  The best time of the year for a beautiful photo shoot is autumn.  You can take colorful pictures with an interesting composition.  Moreover, it is this time that is considered more conducive to shooting due to consecration.  In the fall, daylight is very soft and subdued.  Photographers also recommend looking for new and interesting perspectives.  In addition, you should experiment with sharpness and contrast, so the photos will be "atmospheric".  It is best to take pictures concise, but with some unusual and bright detail.  Show your imagination!  We wish you creative ideas and new ways to work! </p>
