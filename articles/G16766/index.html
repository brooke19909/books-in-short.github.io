Pape art technique: master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Embroidery and origami, patchwork and beadwork, quilling and scrapbooking, decoupage, paper art and felting are all types of needlework.  It seems that all of them from ancient times help to decorate human life.  However, not all of the above types of handicrafts have a long history.  In this article we will find out what paper art is, who invented it and when, and also consider its basic techniques and techniques. </p><h2>  A bit about paper </h2><p>  Despite the abundance of a variety of gadgets and various modern materials, the paper that came to us from centuries ago is constantly with us, whether we notice it or not.  It can be different: white and color, velvet and parchment, rolled and sheet. </p><p>  From early childhood, interaction with paper begins: children draw on it, and from it, under the guidance of adults, they make a variety of crafts.  At school, it is on paper that we learn to write and count.  Growing up, some do not cease to enthusiastically interact with her and create unique works of art. </p>

    <h2>  Who is the author of the technique? </h2><p>  In 2006, the head of the Nikolaev studio of art and literary creation, artist, poetess and designer Tatyana Sorokina decided to bring something new and unusual to classes with her students.  As a result of this desire and enthusiasm, Tatyana began to teach children how to use paper, namely, paper towels. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Initially, the technique received the name "Napkin Plastic".  Under this name, the children's works of Sorokina’s students won the Grand Prix and first place at the International Children's Creativity Festival. </p><p>  In the future, an unusual technique of paper plastic attracted the attention of many lovers of needlework and for a short time gained great popularity. </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  The name “paper art” comes from the English phrase Paper Art, translated as “paper art”.  In the process of communication between the masters, the correct “pipe art” lost one of the letters and was reduced to the form of “pipe art”.  It is this name that is accepted everywhere now.  This technique of simulating various textures and textures, as well as decorating surfaces with paper towels, is completely different than decoupage. </p><p>  The main highlight of paper art is the creation of imitations of expensive and complex artwork, such as weaving and chasing, embroidery and carving. </p><h2>  What is the difference from other types of needlework? </h2>

It was on him that thin strips of paper were wound before, in order to obtain spirals, from which voluminous or flat compositions would later be assembled.  The paper uses paper of different weights, painted on both sides, as well as special devices. </p><p>  In paper art, unlike quilling, there is no strictly defined form of basic elements.  Paper flagella are just the starting material from which any shape and pattern can be made.  In addition, the paper uses thinner paper - napkins. </p><h2>  Decoupage and paper art </h2>

In the process of its execution, motifs cut out of special paper or napkins are applied to a previously prepared surface.  After additional processing and varnishing, the ornaments look like hand-painted.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The paper art style is completely different.  When decorating objects on the surface, volume and texture are created.  Common to these types of needlework is that each of them imitates some other type of <span>decorative art,</span> as well as the material used - thin paper napkins. </p><p>  Recently, in the decoupage technique, the direction of “volumetric”, or as it is also called 3D decoupage, is actively developing.  But unlike paper art, not only paper is used to create volumes, but also other materials, such as salt dough, various plastics and clay for crafts. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Bottles using paper art" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19142/397318.jpg?1400180282537" width="196"></div></h2><h2>  General principles </h2><p>  In order to make paper art crafts, you need the simplest, junk materials and tools.  Ordinary paper napkins, glue, water and the item you want to decorate. </p><p>  The essence of the technique is that paper threads are made from thin paper or napkins, by which the image is laid out on a flat surface of an object.  The image can be painted and fixed with PVA glue, and in some cases with varnish. </p><p>  And now, your attention will be presented to a simple and affordable <span>paper art technique, a</span> master class on which will help to understand the basic techniques of decoration.  We will decorate the most ordinary glass bottle. </p><h2>  We are preparing materials </h2><p>  We will need: </p><ul><li>  water; </li><li>  the most common paper napkins (preferably plain white); </li><li>  PVA glue; </li><li>  paint in aerosol cans; </li><li>  varnish; </li><li>  glass bottle (for the first experiment, not the largest and not very complex shape). </li></ul><h2>  Step-by-step instruction </h2><ol><li>  Before you can make a pipe art of a bottle, it must be washed and cleaned of any residual labels. </li><li>  We apply <span>PVA glue to the</span> cleaned surface of the bottle and <span>glue</span> it in small pieces torn off or cut off from a paper towel.  It is better to take a napkin plain and light, as difficulties may arise when painting. </li><li>  The easiest way to start gluing is from the bottom of the bottle.  After pasting the lower half, you need to let it dry well, and only then continue to glue the upper one. </li><li>  After the whole bottle is pasted over, coat it again with PVA glue and leave to dry. </li><li>  While the glue dries, you can prepare everything you need for further <span>decoration of the bottle</span> using the paper art technique.  First of all, we cut strips from 1 to 1.5 cm wide from napkins. </li><li>  We take a small bowl of warm water, slightly wet our palms and begin to twist the flagella from the cut out paper strips.  Striving to get a perfectly even and solid harness is not worth it.  Any further work will come in handy: thin and thick, long and short “strings”.  (The author of the technique, Tatyana Sorokina, recommends for a few seconds to lower the strips of paper, clamped with plastic scissors or tweezers, into a container of water, and then twist the plaits. Try which option is more convenient for you, so use it!) </li><li><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Paper art bottles" class="if" height="487" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19142/397307.jpg?1400179948263" width="419"></div>  When enough of them are stocked up, we take glue, a flagellum and, having connected the imagination, we begin to lay out all kinds of geometric shapes, original flowers, abstractions from paper blanks - all that the fantasy suggests.  First of all, you need to lay out the contours of the largest drawings.  (Previously, on a dried surface of the bottle, you can sketch the future pattern with a simple pencil. It is easier to lay out patterns on it, especially for children.) </li><li>  In addition to made paper threads for crafts using the paper art technique, you can use small shells, pebbles, dried flowers and leaves.  To create a beautiful ornament, you can take curly pasta, which today is produced in the most unusual and interesting forms, for example, various turns and curls, stars and the alphabet.  (Important: be sure to carefully coat with PVA glue every detail that you are going to fix on the bottle.) </li><li>  After all the parts are securely fixed, it will take a little time for the glue to dry out, and only then you can start painting.  It is better to use acrylic paints or gouache for the paper art bottle, although the car aerosol “lays down” quite well.  Gouache and acrylic are preferable if you are doing crafts with children: it, unlike an aerosol, practically does not smell, and it dries much faster. </li><li>  Paint can be applied in several layers, previously waiting for the previous to dry completely. </li><li>  After all the layers of paint have completely dried, the bottle, if it was painted with acrylic paints, can be varnished on an acrylic basis.  If staining was done with gouache, then it is better to use cheap hair spray, applying it in several stages. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, the technique of paper art, the master class of which is quite simple, still requires attention, perseverance and concentration. </p><h2>  A few secrets from the masters </h2><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Pape technique art master class" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19142/397306.jpg?1400180023722" width="600"></div></h2><p>  In any needlework there are small secrets and tricks, the knowledge of which helps to get better and more accurate products.  Pape art is no exception. </p><p>  So, experienced craftsmen advise using a thin towel for rolling napkins.  As a result, the harnesses will be more even and accurate.  Due to the fact that the cloth surface of the towel absorbs excess moisture, the strips do not “blur” when twisted. </p><p>  You can roll paper threads with a damp cloth and dry or vice versa.  Each master has his own method of making harnesses. </p><p>  In addition to napkins, you can use other thin paper products, for example, paper kitchen towels or cosmetic wipes. </p><p>  It is important to remember that all the time while the bundles are twisted, they must be moist.  In this case, they will not lose elasticity and easily take the necessary shape. </p><p>  Human hands are almost universal tools.  But in order to get an even spiral or circle, you can use a wooden skewer-skewer or a plastic comb with rare teeth. </p><p>  In the process of laying out the pattern, toothpicks will be useful to you - they are very convenient to adjust the plaits on the surface of the bottle. </p><p>  To improve the quality of the product, after the pattern has been fixed and laid out, it is necessary to cover the entire surface with PVA glue diluted with water in a 1: 1 ratio. </p><h2>  Combination options with other techniques </h2>

To decorate a bottle, casket or vase, you can use your favorite plot, “beating” it with voluminous elements made of paper flagella.  So, the marine theme can be decorated with voluminous <span>shells,</span> starfish and waves, and snowflakes and various Christmas decorations are suitable for winter and New Year decoration.

    <p>  The most important thing in any kind of decorative and applied art is the possibility of creativity and self-expression, not limited by any framework and barriers.  This kind of art like paper art gives everyone the opportunity to make something completely different from thin paper napkins, create the illusion of turning the simplest paper into metal, wood or textured fabric and create unique works that will be decorated with imitation of these materials.  Take some time and feel like a creator of new, unique things, a wizard who is subject to the most incredible transformations! </p>
