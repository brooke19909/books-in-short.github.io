The smartphones of this Chinese manufacturer are affordable mobile devices and are becoming increasingly popular.  They also often come up with software updates.  It is the installation of the new version of system software on such a mobile device that this material will be devoted to. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.android.gs" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to update the ‚ÄúMeizu M5‚Äù?" class="if uuid-3209192" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3209192.jpg"></div><h2>  Briefly about the brand </h2><p>  Before we talk about how to update the Meizu phone of any model, we give a brief information note about this manufacturer.  This company was founded in 1998.  Initially, she specialized in the manufacture of various media players and stereo headsets for them.  The first such product was released in 2003. </p><p>  In 2008, the company redesigned and began to produce smartphones.  And immediately her mobile devices were based on the Windows CE operating system.  But since 2011, this manufacturer switched to the Android software platform.  At the same time, he introduced his own interface for this operating system, which was called FlymeOS.  It is the update of the last two software components that this material will be devoted to. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Battery status </h2><p>  Before updating Meiza at the software level, you need to check the battery level.  If this condition is not met, then the device during the installation of new system software may unexpectedly turn off.  This will cause the smartphone to stop turning on after that.  The minimum battery level is 35 percent.  It is on this value that the manufacturer focuses attention. </p><p>  Below this threshold, unauthorized shutdown of the mobile device may occur.  At the same time, qualified specialists generally recommend a battery level of at least 50 percent.  The higher this setting, the safer it is to install system software updates. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to update Meizu phone?" class="if uuid-3209193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3209193.jpg"></div><h2>  What is the best way to download updates? </h2><p>  Before updating the ‚ÄúMeizu M5‚Äù or any other smartphone model of this manufacturer, we will figure out the most optimal way to download system software from the manufacturer‚Äôs official website.  For these purposes, you can use one of two methods of wireless information transfer.  The first one is based on cellular communications.  In this case, the speed can reach 150 Mbps, provided that there is 4G standard coverage.  But, as a rule, such data transfer is charged separately and requires a sufficiently large amount of money in the account.  During the upgrade process, a significant part of them can be removed for using traffic to install new software.  Therefore, using this method to receive updates is strongly discouraged. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is more correct to use any Wi-Fi network in this situation.  In this case, there is no need to pay for the data received.  Such connections in most cases are unlimited.  In this case, the transmission speed can be 300 Mbps or more.  That is, updates when using a Wi-Fi transmitter will be downloaded much faster.  In addition, there is no need to spend additional material resources.  All this in total makes the use of this method of obtaining information from the "global web" in this case more reasonable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="androidtalkie.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to update the version of &quot;Meizu&quot;?" class="if uuid-3209194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3209194.jpg"></div><h2>  Installing a new OS version </h2><p>  Now let‚Äôs look at the procedure for updating Meizu to a new version of system software.  The algorithm for installing such software is as follows: </p><ol><li>  We are connected to the Internet.  Moreover, as previously noted, it is recommended to use a wireless Wi-Fi transmitter for these purposes. </li><li>  Next, we find the item ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù on one of the working screens.  We open it. </li><li>  At the next stage, you need to open the menu item ‚ÄúSystem Update‚Äù. </li><li>  After that a new window will open.  It is necessary to click on the button ‚ÄúCheck for updates‚Äù. </li><li>  Then you need to wait a pause.  The smartphone should contact the server manufacturer and check on it for new versions of system software.  If the most current software is installed on the device, a corresponding message will appear after that.  Otherwise, the process of downloading updates will begin. </li><li>  Next, the software will automatically update.  In this case, the smartphone may reboot several times. </li><li>  As soon as it succeeds in updating the version of Meizu, the user will return to the main screen of the operating system.  This completes the operation. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.digianalysys.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to update ‚ÄúMeizu M3 s‚Äù?" class="if uuid-3209195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3209195.jpg"></div><h2>  Feasibility of updating system software </h2><p>  After the algorithm of how to update the ‚ÄúMeizu M3 s‚Äù or any other smartphone of this Chinese manufacturer has been described, we will find out the feasibility of its implementation.  The first versions of system software, as experience shows, most mobile phones have significant flaws that can lead to various kinds of ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù, reboots, and other similar problems.  Based on the requests of the owners, a list of comments is formed.  Further, this information is processed by company programmers who find defects and fix them.  After that, updates appear on the official website of the manufacturer with the corrected comments. </p><p>  Therefore, the installation of new system software in any case favorably affects the stability and reliability of the mobile system.  In addition, various shortcomings associated with the protection of information on the smartphone are eliminated.  Therefore, it is recommended to constantly monitor new versions of programs and install them regularly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.digitaltrends.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to update ‚ÄúMaize‚Äù?" class="if uuid-3209198" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12662/3209198.jpg"></div><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As part of this review, a universal algorithm for how to update Meizu was outlined.  And any model.  The software part of any current smartphone of this manufacturer is implemented on the basis of the Android OS.  But also the possibilities of the latter are complemented by the Flyme shell.  It is the update of these two software components that this material is dedicated to.  Also, general recommendations are given that will allow the simplest way to solve this issue. </p><p>  There are no super-complicated actions in the previously described algorithm.  Therefore, even a poorly trained owner of such a mobile device should cope with it without any problems. </p>
