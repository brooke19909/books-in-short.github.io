CTP Terms</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, a mandatory requirement for all motorists is <span>liability insurance.</span>  This review considers what OSAGO is, which covers what are the main features of receiving payments, what the insured driver should do in case of an accident. </p><h2>  Destination </h2><div class="photo" data-original="connelltransport.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="2 cars collided" class="if uuid-2636231" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636231.jpg"></div><p>  So what does CTP cover?  The driver who issued the policy has financial protection in the event that an accident occurred through his fault.  Today, each driver must draw up this document.  How much insurance covers in an accident?  As a rule, the size of payments is determined by material losses, namely, damage caused to the vehicle.  Moreover, the amount of payment is limited by the rate approved by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  The policy does not compensate for moral loss and lost profits.  These costs will fall fully on the culprit of the accident.  At the same time, the cost of the new policy will increase with the increase in the number of insured events. </p><h2>  Payout amount </h2><p>  What you need to know about this?  Compensation of insurance indemnity under compulsory motor third-party liability insurance is regularly indexed.  It is also determined by the extent of the damage caused and the number of victims.  Of great importance in determining the amount of compensation is still the make, model and year of manufacture of the car, the actual deterioration of the vehicle at the time of the accident, the length of service of the driver and other features.  The amount of payments for accidents will depend on the results of special examinations. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  These include: </p><ul><li>  road; </li><li>  traological; </li><li>  autotechnical; </li><li>  medical. </li></ul><p>  The maximum <span>payment for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance in an accident</span> in 2018 is 500 thousand rubles in the event of an accident, which resulted in damage to the health and life of citizens.  The amount of compensation for compensation for material damage reaches 400 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Is it realistic to calculate the amount of payments yourself? </h2><p>  You can check whether the accruals of the insurance company were carried out correctly.  The easiest and most reliable way is to contact organizations that conduct independent examinations.  In the simplest cases, you can also use basic programs.  One of them is the so-called OSAGO calculator. </p><h2>  Insured events </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.bzb.ro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="road accident" class="if uuid-2636224" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636224.jpg"></div><p>  At the legislative level, most of the points are specified in which the injured party needs to pay compensation under the policy.  However, there is a general provision for everyone: an insured event involves a traffic accident that occurred due to the carelessness of the owner of the policy at the time of driving, causing damage to property, health or life of other road users.  Without the registration of an accident, payments for OSAGO can not be expected.  This means that if the driver and the victim did not record the fact of a road trouble and decided to pay on the spot, then no one will return the money spent to the motorist. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many people wonder if the insurance policy is valid if the accident occurred in the parking lot.  The answer in this case will be positive.  If the vehicle was damaged on the territory of the enterprise, race track or training site, the insurance company has every reason to refuse to pay. </p><p>  How to get CTP payments?  The conditions are defined at the legislative level and are periodically changed.  The last change occurred on July 1, 2016.  It has greatly simplified the procedure for registration of accidents in compulsory motor third-party liability insurance.  Drivers now do not have to call DPS. </p><p>  However, this simplification only works if the following conditions are met: </p><ol><li>  Only two cars took part in the accident. </li><li>  The amount of damage is estimated at no more than 25 thousand rubles. </li><li>  As a result of the accident there are no dead and injured. </li><li>  Drivers have no disagreement about the culprit. </li></ol><p>  In this case, the participants in the accident can independently draw a <span>diagram of the accident</span> and fill out the Euro protocol. </p><h2>  Accident Actions </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.theglobeandmail.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="girl had an accident" class="if uuid-2636236" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636236.jpg"></div><p>  What should be done if the drivers decide to <span>arrange an accident</span> using the Euro protocol?  The first step is to photograph the scene of the accident.  It‚Äôs better to take a few shots from different angles.  The photos will be sufficient evidence for the insurance company, therefore, witnesses can not be involved in this process.  Only after that the car can be removed from the accident scene.  After that, drivers need to fill out notices that outline the scheme of a traffic accident.  The victim after the accident will just have to take the notice to the insurance company.  Then you just have to wait until the insurers consider the appeal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  When is it necessary to turn to the traffic police? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="girl calls after an accident" class="if uuid-2636334" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636334.jpg"></div><p>  This should be discussed in more detail.  Road police officers should be called in the following cases: </p><ul><li>  If as a result of an accident there are injured or deceased. </li><li>  Vehicles as a result of the accident were seriously damaged. </li><li>  Drivers could not independently identify the culprit of the accident.  In this case, the actions of the culprit of the accident must be recorded in the traffic police. </li><li>  Motorists cannot sketch the scheme of the accident on their own. </li><li>  One of the parties left the scene for no good reason. </li><li>  In the accident involved more than two cars. </li><li>  For some reason, the vehicles were moved. </li><li>  If one of the parties does not have an insurance policy. </li></ul><h2>  How to receive the money? </h2><p>  This issue should be given special importance.  Not everyone knows what to do in order to receive compensation for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance, which covers the payment.  Because of this, conflicts and controversial situations often arise between car owners and insurers.  In fact, the process is quite simple.  In 2018, an obligatory step in the procedure for receiving CTP insurance for accidents is to notify the insurance company about the accident in a timely manner.  In turn, insurers have the opportunity for a certain period of time to study all the materials of the case and conduct an examination to establish the exact amount of payment. </p><p>  In the process of registration of the CTP under CTP, pre-trial settlement of disputes between insurance companies is also envisaged.  This means that if for some reason you do not agree with the actions of the organization serving you, you can file a claim, and only then go to court.  Very often, such situations arise when insurance companies intentionally underestimate the amount of payments. </p><h2>  How to make an appeal? </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.thebalance.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawing up an appeal" class="if uuid-2636330" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636330.jpg"></div><p>  Under the new rules, the deadline for sending an application to the insurance company after an accident is 5 days.  In this case, this requirement is advisory in nature.  This means that if for some reason you did not have the opportunity to meet the deadlines for submitting an application, you can do it later.  A delay in this case is not a ground for refusing to receive a payment.  However, the sooner you contact, the better.  For your convenience, many companies offer the service of submitting an application by fax or through a legal representative. </p><p>  Many drivers have doubts about who should contact the insurance.  Here, everything is quite simple: the one who intends to receive compensation should deal with the compensation.  If the victim received serious injuries or died in an accident, representatives may speak on his behalf. </p><p>  Where to apply for compensation?  The answer to this question depends on the circumstances of the incident.  The car owner applies to his insurance company if only two cars took part in the accident, both drivers have insurance policy and only the vehicle was damaged.  In other cases, you need to call the insurance company responsible for the accident. </p><h2>  The necessary package of documents </h2><p>  What is included in CTP?  You can receive compensation in case of an accident only if you submit to the insurance company a full package of correctly executed documents.  The list may vary depending on the situation.  However, there is a list of documents required to be submitted, which remains low. </p><p>  It includes: </p><ol><li>  Identification. </li><li>  <span>A certificate of traffic accident</span> from the traffic police if the incident was executed with the participation of police officers. </li><li>  Europrotocol. </li><li>  Package of documents for a car. </li><li>  Bank details to which the transfer will be made. </li><li>  Traffic Accident Notice. </li></ol><p>  The last item on the list needs to be considered in more detail. </p><h2>  Traffic Accident Notice </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.ridester.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="where to call in case of an accident" class="if uuid-2636227" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636227.jpg"></div><p>  This document is drawn up in any case, regardless of whether the traffic police officers were called to the scene of the accident, or the drivers independently executed an accident.  The notice should include detailed information about the accident itself and the participants in the incident.  This document, completed in full accordance with the instructions and certified by the personal signature of the originator, must be transferred to the insurance company for the victims of an accident. </p><h2>  CASCO and CTP </h2><p>  What you need to know about this?  Many motorists are interested in the procedure for payments in case of an accident in the case of insurance of compulsory motor third-party liability insurance and hull insurance.  According to the rules of payments, drivers may well be insured and receive financial reimbursement also under hull insurance.  However, it is important to consider that the general principle of insurance is not the enrichment of the insured person, but compensation for the damage caused.  The issue of receiving CTP insurance payment together with CASCO payment implies a fraudulent operation, which in itself is illegal.  You can still get 100% compensation for only one insurance.  And by what - the victim should decide. </p><h2>  What to do if the damage caused exceeds the size of the payment? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the amount of insurance payments has been significantly increased, it is far from always the amount established at the legislative level will be sufficient to satisfy the injured party.  Often CTP does not cover the damage.  What to do in this case?  Part of the funds will have to be demanded directly from the culprit of the accident.  This is a rather complicated procedure that takes a lot of time.  This is especially true in cases where this person has limited financial capabilities, and the amount of payment is large. </p><p>  Many are also interested in whether the culprit of the accident can somehow reimburse the cost of restoring his vehicle.  The fact is that OSAGO payment does not cover the car repair of the culprit of an accident.  The policy provides for reimbursement of funds only to the affected party. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.nerdwallet.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="men shake hands" class="if uuid-2636286" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/49835/2636286.jpg"></div><p>  This review describes in detail what the CTP policy is, what this insurance covers, how to get paid in case of an accident.  Subject to all conditions and timely submission of the application to the insurance company, you can easily receive compensation. </p><p>  Very often, when calculating cash compensation, contentious issues arise.  You can independently evaluate the amount of compensation using the OSAGO calculator or using the services of companies that conduct independent expertise. </p>
