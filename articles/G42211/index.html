    <p>  The city is almost buried in greenery.  On its streets you can see various plants.  The history of this Botanical Garden of Montenegro has its roots in the distant past.  The convenient location of Herceg Novi at the entrance to the bay called Boko-Kotorsky made it a favorite port for the relaxation of foreign ships.  Sailors who went ashore brought palm trees and mimosa, subtropical and tropical shrubs and trees from distant lands.  Many of these plants have taken root on a sunny beach.  They still delight nature lovers with their splendor. </p><h2>  Resort Location </h2><p>  Montenegro, Herceg Novi ... This small town is located in the western part of the country.  Not far from it passes the border with Croatia.  At a distance of thirty kilometers from Herceg Novi there are two airports.  They are located in the Croatian cities of Dubrovnik and Tivat.  It is worth saying that between the resort town and airports there is a bay.  However, it is not necessary to go round it.  Holidays can begin with a ferry ride, at the end of which tourists will discover their ultimate destination - Montenegro. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="montenegro herceg novi reviews" class="if" height="398" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/372789.jpg?1397308902857" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Every year, many tourists visit the glorious country of Montenegro.  Herceg Novi attracts visitors with its fortresses and an interesting old town.  If you are going on an excursion, you will have to be patient.  A high staircase leads to the old city, located on a slope.  Only the embankment is on the flat part.  That is why Herceg Novi is called the city of steps. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In the event that you decide to go on a tour yourself, you will need a map.  Herceg Novi will surprise and delight you with the Spanish fort, as well as the idyllic Savina Monastery, which offers a magnificent panorama of the city and the Bay of Kotor.  It is worth taking a walk along the promenade.  Its name ‚ÄúShetaliste Pet Dannitsa‚Äù in translation from Serbian means ‚Äúpromenade Pet Dannitsa‚Äù.  This is the longest embankment in all of Montenegro.  Its length is seven kilometers.  A walk will be a real pleasure, because on the promenade there are a huge number of restaurants, gonobes (taverns) and souvenir shops. </p><p>  The history of the town of Herceg Novi was formed under the influence of a frequent change of power, each of which carried a different religion, as well as customs.  However, such a course of events was characteristic of the entire Balkan coast.  Montenegro did not escape this.  Herceg Novi, reviews of which testify to the amazing architecture of its buildings, attract tourists from all over the world.  Of particular interest is the old city.  Its inspection should begin with the square named after Nikola Dzhurkovich.  It rises Sahat Kula - a magnificent clock tower, built in 1850. It was erected at the time when the Turkish sultan Mahmud ruled.  Today it is the most striking symbol of Herceg Novi.  The main square, located in the old town, is named after Herceg Stiepan.  In its center back in 1900 the Church of St. Michael the Archangel Michael was built, not far from which there is an exquisite fountain with drinking water - Karacha. </p><p>  The old city is surrounded by fortress walls and towers, one of which is called ‚ÄúKanli Kula‚Äù (‚ÄúBloody Tower‚Äù).  It was built in the sixteenth century.  During the reign of the Ottoman Empire, there was a prison in it.  Now this place is intended for city celebrations, as well as theater and film screenings.  In its free time, the tower receives tourists who can take magnificent photographs of the old city, the Lustica peninsula, as well as the Boka Kotorska Gulf. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Herceg Novi Montenegro apartments" class="if" height="369" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5158/372787.jpg?1397308622179" width="550"></div>
