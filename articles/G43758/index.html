Features, varieties, price</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Coins of 50 kopecks of 1921 were issued in the RSFSR at the Petrograd Mint.  According to their characteristics and technical data, the coins resembled the money of imperial Russia and were even made on the same equipment.  Today we consider the details of these ancient coins, find the features and understand the varieties and prices. </p><div class="photo" data-original="zvonmoneta.ru" data-author=": " data-source="https://zvonmoneta.ru/sssr-526"><img itemprop="image" alt="50 kopecks 1921 cost" class="if uuid-3169071" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169071.jpg"></div><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Despite the large circulation, the coin of 50 kopecks of 1921 is loved and revered by many numismatists.  In it, epochs touch, there are details of the tsar’s mint and new elements of coinage of the RSFSR era.  Coins were made of silver (900th test) and copper.  No magnetic properties, of course, no.  Color - silver gray. </p><p>  A coin weighs 50 kopecks in 1921, about ten grams, of which nine grams is silver.  Around the circumference is a noticeable protruding edging. </p><p>  If the coins that will be minted in a few years time will not have any features of the edge, then this currency unit has an inscription.  It reads: “Pure silver 2 spools of 10.5 shares (A. G.).”  Initials are the name and surname of the Mintmeister of the Mint.  His name was Arthur Hartmann. </p><p>  Very, very rarely there are coins in denominations of 50 kopecks (1921), but there is no inscription on the edge.  They are very rare, they are not even found in catalogs, but experienced numismatists have information about their existence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Reverse </h2><p>  The central part of the coin disk is occupied by a large circle of decorative points, in the center of which there is a star with five elongated tips.  A small circle is extruded in the middle of the star, where the number 50 is inscribed. The face value of the coin of 50 kopecks in 1921 is also indicated above the decorative points, at the highest central point of the coin disk. </p><p>  Between the third and fourth rays of the five-pointed star, the year of manufacture of the currency is minted.  Around the perimeter of the coin is a beautiful wreath consisting of oak and laurel leaves.  A little later, the laurel will be replaced by ears of wheat, but the oak leaves will still live on coins. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.antikvar32.com" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.antikvar32.com/product/moneta-50-kopeek-1921-ag-rsfsr-ag-1_fx/"><img itemprop="image" alt="50 kopecks 1921 coinage" class="if uuid-3169074" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169074.jpg"></div><h2>  Obverse </h2><p>  Around the circumference is an inscription with a famous appeal: "Workers of all countries, unite!"  The central part is occupied by the emblem of the RSFSR.  In the middle is a cartouche entwined with wheat ears.  Bright rays of the sun come out from below, illuminating the hammer and sickle, which are located a little higher. </p><p>  Below, almost in the middle under the coat of arms, is a decorative inscription - an abbreviation of the state.  Letters R.S.F.S.R.  (the decorative dots after each letter, which were not forgotten at that time) were sealed in a beautiful carved frame.  Printed in writing.  The whole coat of arms goes around a chain consisting of decorative dots.  Below it goes into a frame surrounding the letters. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Marriage </h2><p>  The coin of 50 kopecks in 1921 was not without marriage.  Among the most common are: </p><ul><li>  "sticky"; </li><li>  collision of dies idle; </li><li>  lack of an inscription telling about "pure silver" and the printer responsible for the circulation; </li><li>  sheet edge; </li><li>  the point after the letter P in the abbreviation of the state (it is too thick and looks massive when compared with other copies); </li><li>  non-caulking; </li><li>  shift. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="99-kopeek.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="50 kopecks 1921 g" class="if uuid-3169089" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169089.jpg"></div><h2>  Improved coinage </h2><p>  There were only a few copies of the coins of 50 kopecks in 1921, which were made using advanced technology.  These were monetary units in polished coinage.  After production, they did not go “into the people”, but spread into collections of famous and influential numismatists and collectors at the time.  Also, several pieces were sent for preservation to the Soviet philatelic association. </p><h2>  Lack of edge </h2><p>  According to experts, there are only a few coins that do not have an inscription on the edge, like everyone else.  This is a simple technical marriage, as a result of which no currency symbols were applied to some currency units.  These coins are very rare, therefore, are the objects of desire and hunting of many collectors. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  There is no problem to sell or, conversely, purchase 50 kopecks of 1921 coins for your collection.  The most inexpensive in this money segment will be coins that are made according to standard coinage.  Their price varies from nine to two thousand rubles.  If the safety of the coin is perfect, then at some auctions you can also get up to five or even nine thousand rubles for standard minting.  But such cases are extremely rare. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.coins-spb.ru" data-author=": " data-source="http://www.coins-spb.ru/moneta/1037/"><img itemprop="image" alt="50 kopecks 1921 coin" class="if uuid-3169069" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43584/3169069.jpg"></div><p>  We go further, increasing the cost.  More expensive will be coins that have a clear marriage.  Here the price will be from five thousand rubles.  Coins with a smooth edge can be sold or purchased for 35,000-50,000 rubles. </p><p>  The most expensive option, as we said above, is coins with polished coinage.  Here the cost can reach up to 125 thousand rubles and higher.  Everything will depend on the appearance and preservation of the monetary unit. </p><p>  Despite sufficient demand and a large supply, coins of this denomination and year are valued in numismatic circles.  Collectors eagerly buy them for their albums (even sometimes a few).  Interest in these coins will only increase, as a large amount has been melted.  The smaller the remainder, the more expensive it is. </p>
