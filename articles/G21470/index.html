    <p>  This was an extraordinary person.  It perfectly combined the skill of a fighter with responsiveness, kindness and excellent organizational abilities.  Boris Feoktistovich Safonov was shy and modest by nature.  He never boasted of his victories, using only phrases such as "we shot down," "we flew."  In addition, Safonov credited many of the enemy planes destroyed by him to his comrades, as these victories were not an end in itself for him. </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  Tula province, the village of Sinyavino - this is the place where Boris Safonov was born on 08/26/1915.  The father and mother of the future hero were simple peasants. </p><p>  After graduating with honors from the seven-year school, Boris entered FZU (factory-apprenticeship school).  This educational institution trained specialists who knew the locomotive business.  At this school, the guy joined the Komsomol. </p><p>  Boris Safonov, whose biography was considered ordinary for his peers, would most likely become a railwayman.  However, the Lenin Komsomol, of which he was a member, announced his patronage over aviation.  And then thousands of young men and women rushed into the sky.  Among them was Boris Feoktistovich Safonov.  He became a member of the circle organized at the Osoviahim school, which later became the Tula flying club.  It was here that the future military pilot Safonov acquired qualities that are very necessary for the pilot.  This is self-confidence and independence, discipline and endurance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

He worked a lot and hard on the theory of ground training.  Even before going to bed, already lying in bed, Boris mentally sorted through all the details of the dashboard, which is on the plane in front of the pilot.  So he consolidated his knowledge gained during classes.  Then there were independent flights, during which Safonov showed his outstanding talent.

    <p>  The Tula province - the place where the future order bearer was born, grew up and studied, was abandoned by him in August 1933. This happened after the guy successfully completed the flying club, when Boris got to Kacha in the direction of his command.  Military pilots were trained here. </p><h2>  Studying at Kachinsky school </h2><p>  While in this institution, Boris Safonov carefully studied the works of the classics of Marxism-Leninism.  This was the initial stage of preparation for joining the Communist Party. </p><p>  During his studies at the Kachinsky school, at the age of nineteen, Safonov became a fighter pilot.  At the same time, he shows excellent skills in aerial shooting, in piloting techniques and in material knowledge, deserving the highest marks in all these disciplines.  In the description written by instructors in these years, it was noted that Safonov is distinguished by a quick reaction, is quick-witted and resourceful in the air, in addition, his rather high degree of initiative is noted. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Belorussian Military District </h2><p>  In December 1934, Boris Safonov was sent to a further place of his service.  He became the Belarusian Military District, and more specifically his 40th Aviation Brigade.  At this time, new aircraft were adopted by the Soviet Air Force.  They were I-15 and I-16, as well as I-153.  Boris enthusiastically studied new cars, spending hours in the library.  Already in the early summer of 1936, the aircraft that appeared in service with the Soviet Army were well studied by Safonov.  The fighter pilot even developed his own method of warfare, which later perfectly proved itself during the war years. </p><p>  In 1937, Boris Feoktistovich Safonov was accepted as a candidate for membership in the Communist Party.  At the same time, he also becomes the secretary of the Komsomol organization. </p><p>  In 1938, the fifteenth aviation regiment was formed.  Boris Safonov became an assistant commander for Komsomol work in it. </p>

The military pilot Safonov immediately filed a report in which he outlined his desire to be admitted to the fighter squadron heading north.  The request of Boris Feoktistovich was granted.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Instructor job </h2><p>  In the North, Boris became interested in the history of naval aviation, which determined his subsequent life path.  In addition, the flight skills of Safonov, the talent of the organizer and the ability to train did not go unnoticed.  Senior Lieutenant was appointed to the post of commander of the training squadron.  As an excellent naval fighter pilot, Safonov became a strict and patient teacher.  He prepared newcomers for all the surprises that they were to meet in a real battle. </p><h2>  First fight </h2><p>  The war with fascist Germany, Boris Safonov - a fighter pilot - began on an I-16 plane.  Already on June 22, 1941, he made his first combat mission over <span>the Rybachy Peninsula.</span>  Together with V. Volovnikov they attacked the He-111 bomber.  Soviet pilots fired until they ran out of ammunition.  However, the smoky German plane still disappeared into the clouds. </p><h2>  First victories </h2><p>  Two days after the outbreak of the war with the Nazis, Safonov took off on his I-16 in order to intercept the German reconnaissance Ju-87.  After a long chase, the enemy aircraft was attacked.  At first, Safonov killed the shooter and damaged the car.  After that, the Soviet pilot, using a long line of fire, cut off the tail.  The enemy machine fell into Zelentsy Bay, where its wreckage was picked up by a approached boat.  This aircraft was the first of those shot down in the sky of the North. </p><p>  The second victory was won by Safonov on 06/27/1941. The German aircraft HS-126, shot down by him together with his comrades, which the Soviet infantrymen later called the "Crutch", fell to the ground. </p><p>  In the days of the outbreak of war, stubborn air battles took place over Kola land.  The Germans sought to use the time of the polar day, when the sun stands above the horizon for 24 hours.  Enemy aircraft, grouped in large units, made an attack on the ships of the Soviet fleet.  The number of our fighters was small, and therefore naval pilots had to make 6-7 sorties per day.  With each meeting with an enemy aircraft, Boris Safonov perfected tactics while conducting close combat.  At the same time, he studied all the possibilities of German cars that fought over our Northern lands. </p><p>  Safonov‚Äôs list of air victories has expanded significantly over the next two months.  It was at this time that the Germans launched massive raids on the port of Murmansk and northern Soviet airfields. </p>

At this time, a group of German Ju-87 aircraft appeared in the sky over the territory protected by them, which accompanied the enemy Me-109 fighters.  An air battle ensued.  German planes were attacked by Soviet pilots who shot down seven enemy vehicles.  Our "nine" returned to the base in full force.

    <h2>  Assignment of the next rank </h2><p>  As early as July 10, 1941, Boris Safonov became captain.  In addition to awarding the next rank of a brave pilot, they were appointed fighter commander of the aviation squadron.  Also, the fighter was awarded a new I-16 type 17 machine, which had serial number 28213-95.  On its fuselage, Safonov wrote "Death to Fascism!" </p><p>  Boris Feoktistovich meticulously prepared for every air battle.  He personally monitored the state of his aircraft, each time being present when loading the ammunition, as well as checking the shells with which the tape was stuffed.  On the I-16 issued to him, Safonov made 109 sorties, during which he shot down 17 enemy fighters and bombers.  Over the entire period of hostilities, three engines were installed on his car three times.  Today, this aircraft is one of the exhibits of the Leningrad Naval Museum. </p><p>  On July 14, 1941, Safonov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.  The aerial battle that day was added to the list of his victories two downed enemy bombers.  On July 27, he destroyed two more German dive bombers, and on August 8, the Me-109 fighter.  By the end of the first war summer, there were ten enemy vehicles on the list of personally shot down by Safonov aircraft. </p><h2>  Battle autumn </h2><p>  The military operations in the North reached their apogee in September 1941. This is the time when the Germans took decisive measures to break through the defense of the Soviet troops.  To do this, they transferred their aircraft to the North from all fronts.  Enemy vehicles were constantly above our front lines, engaging in battles with Soviet fighters. </p>

Sometimes he imitated a stampede, and when the German pilot was already joyfully celebrating the victory, he suddenly slowed down and remained in the tail of a discouraged enemy.

    <p>  In any battle, Safonova was distinguished by mutual assistance and mutual assistance.  This was the main rule of the Soviet ace.  Not sparing his life, the pilot hurried to help his comrades.  So, in one of the fights, junior lieutenant Maksimovich was attacked by a Ju-88 bomber.  Carried away by the battle, he did not notice the Me-109 appearing behind.  Safonov immediately rushed to rescue his comrade, despite the fact that by this moment he had shot all the ammunition he had.  The German pilot was afraid of a fierce attack and left the battle. </p><p>  The courage and bravery of Boris Safonov was noted by the command.  On September 16, 1941, the brave pilot was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  By the time this Decree was published, Safonov‚Äôs account already had an impressive list of air victories. </p><h2>  Personal duel </h2><p>  In the same autumn days of 1941, the famous German ace was destroyed by Safonov.  "Messer" is a pilot whose fuselage depicted a red dog holding a red star fighter in his teeth, often seen during attacks on the air regiment.  The enemy held brazenly, but avoided open battle.  Safonov dreamed of meeting a fascist, and once such an opportunity presented himself to him.  The Soviet pilot boldly imposed a battle on the enemy, who skillfully chose favorable positions for him by performing complex aerobatic figures.  However, after a couple of minutes Safonov brought his ‚ÄúHawk‚Äù in the tail of the ‚ÄúMesser‚Äù and after a short pursuit made several well-aimed bursts.  The enemy‚Äôs car caught fire and fell down with a stone.  The German pilot left the blazing car and landed directly on the position of our anti-aircraft gunners by parachute.  Captured by Soviet fighters, the enemy turned out to be none other than the famous Willy Frenger.  On the account of this seasoned German ace there were nine hundred sorties and thirty-six aircraft shot down over the English Channel, for which the military command awarded him two Iron Crosses. </p><h2>  New appointments </h2><p>  On October 24, 1941, Safonov received an offer to gather the best pilots in the 78th Fighter Aviation Regiment and lead it.  Boris Feoktistovich accepted the new appointment.  The armament of the new aviation regiment consisted of twenty-seven Hurricanes ‚Äî the machines that the British pilots handed over to the Soviet Air Force.  The equipment was not new and for the most part required repair.  In addition, it was decided to rearm British planes.  At the initiative of Safonov, they delivered four heavy machine guns, two of which were soon replaced by guns.  A little later, guiding equipment for rockets was installed under the planes of the machines. </p><p>  As the commander of the 78th Aviation Regiment, Boris Safonov showed remarkable organizational skills, as well as the ability to educate and train subordinates.  For these merits he was awarded the next rank - major. </p><p>  Boris Safonov continued to make combat sorties, increasing the score of enemy vehicles shot down by him.  On December 22, 1941, he was awarded the second <span>Order of the Red Banner,</span> and on January 22, 1942, the third. </p>

March 20, 1942 he was placed at the head of the 2nd Guards.  In this air regiment, a brave pilot started a war.  Safonov continued to replenish the list of his military victories.  During this period, two more awards appeared on his tunic.  This is the Golden Star of the Hero and the award of Britain - the order of "DF".

    <h2>  Last Stand </h2><p>  Heading the 2nd Guards Air Regiment, the Guard Lieutenant Colonel Safonov devoted a lot of time and effort to the leadership.  In this regard, he began to fly less, but in almost every battle he replenished the list of his victories. </p><p>  In 1942, a new task was set for his regiment.  In addition to the defense of the port of Murmansk, the pilots were to guard the allied military convoys located on the territory of the <span>Northern Fleet.</span>  In carrying out this task, the famous Soviet pilot died.  He made his last sortie on May 30, 1942, taking off in the air to cover the Allied convoy that was on its way to Murmansk. </p><p>  Safonov was the leading four of the Soviet cars.  However, one of them returned due to engine problems.  Three Soviet pilots got involved in a battle with six enemy bombers, going to the enemy in a swift attack.  In the turmoil that arose during the fight, the link broke up.  More Boris Safonov not seen. </p><p>  The place of death of a brave pilot in the Barents Sea can be found on the map.  It is 69 degrees 51 seconds north latitude and 64 degrees 42 seconds east longitude.  He died in an unequal battle with the Nazis, having shot down two planes.  The Air Force lost the ace of naval aviation, on the account of which in May 1942 there were 25 downed enemy vehicles. </p><p>  What is the reason for the death of Boris Safonov?  There is still no answer to this question.  According to one version, he could not cope with the sudden attack of one of the "Junkers", and according to another, he fell due to engine failure.  The last of these two assumptions is considered the most probable. </p><h2>  Memory </h2><p>  The military merits of Boris Feoktistovich Safonov were expressed not only in the enemy aircraft shot down by him.  The Soviet commander made a great personal contribution to the development of aviation of the Northern Fleet.  Under his leadership, dozens of pilots gained significant combat experience, who later received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. </p><p>  The name of the North Sea pilot is not forgotten today.  The monument to Boris Safonov is installed in Severomorsk, Murmansk and Plavsk.  There is a bust of the hero in the village of Fedotovo near Vologda in the military garrison located there. </p>
