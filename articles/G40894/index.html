Next to the carriage, decorated with the royal monogram, a twenty-year-old handsome man pranced on his horse, astonishing his article with grace.  From the window twilight, the eyes of a woman who had already lost her youth, but retained the features of greatness and former beauty, were continuously watching him.  On that day, a star of a new Catherine's favorite, whose name - Plato Zubov, rose in the sky, became a symbol of the end of the reign of the greatest Russian empress. </p>

    <h2>  The military career that began behind the student desk </h2><p>  The last favorite of Catherine II, His <span>Serene Highness Prince</span> Zubov Platon Aleksandrovich who was born on November 26, 1767, was the third son of the provincial vice-governor and estate manager Count Saltykov - Alexander Nikolayevich Zubov, whom contemporaries called the "most dishonest nobleman in the whole state."  Apparently, there were reasons for that. </p><p>  Barely reaching the age of eight, the future Most Serene Highness Prince, and at that time simply Platosha, was enlisted as a sergeant in the Life Guards <span>Semyonovsky Regiment.</span>  While the boy grew up and received home education, his military career went uphill, and after the lapse of the set time he received the next rank.  As soon as the boy turned twelve, he was transferred by the vahmistra to the horse guards, and five years later he was promoted to cornet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For the first time in the army, which was then in Finland, Plato was in 1788, where he soon received another increase, becoming a second captain.  Such a rapid career advancement of the young man is explained by the patronage of Count Saltykov, whose father served as manager, and who very distinguished Plato for his "modesty and respectfulness." </p><h2>  The beginning of a fairy tale </h2><p>  But the true rise of his dizzying career began precisely on that summer day from which we began the story.  Thanks to the patronage of the same Count Saltykov, Plato Zubov was appointed commander of the Horse Guards, who went to Tsarskoye Selo - the residence of the Empress - to carry out guard duty there.  This move coincided in time with the "resignation" of another Catherine's favorite Count A. M. Dmitriev-Mamonov, and the heart of the aging, but still loving empress was free. </p><p>  As you know, emptiness is generally contrary to nature, and the female heart in particular, and to fill it in a hurry, the statute lady Anna Nikitichna Naryshkina, devoted to the Empress, hurried.  It was through her mediation that the Russian autocrat came closer to the young horse guards so liked by her. </p>

    <p>  At first, he received an invitation to dinner and won a pleasant conversation, and then was received in Catherine‚Äôs private chambers.  Obviously, Plato was worthy of her attention, because literally three days later he was granted a ring with diamonds and 10 thousand rubles in cash, and two weeks later he was promoted to colonel and adjutant wing. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is very possible that, given their age difference (Ekaterina was already over sixty at that time), she had very mixed feelings for her twenty-two-year-old favorite, in which the passion of a woman in love coexisted with maternal tenderness.  But, one way or another, and Plato Zubov and Catherine became inseparable.  Soon he settled in the palace, where he was allotted the very chambers that had previously been occupied by his predecessor - Count Dmitriev-Mamonov.  In the autumn of the same year, Zubov was appointed cornet of the Cavalier Guard corps and promoted to major general. </p><h2>  Old favorite and his young successor </h2><p>  It should be noted, however, that evil tongues claimed that this connection was nothing more than the result of political intrigue conceived by the enemies of His Grace Prince Potyomkin, who was removed from Catherine‚Äôs alcove, but nevertheless remained her closest friend and influential dignitary.  All former young favorites were his proteges and therefore did not pose a danger to the sovereign prince.  The courtiers, dissatisfied with his influence on the empress and who wished an early overthrow, needed a different candidate. </p><p>  The empress wrote to Potemkin, who was at that time in the Principality of Moldova, about her new favorite as a ‚Äúpupil‚Äù and ‚Äúnewcomer‚Äù who had recently appeared in her.  The Most Serene Prince, who very strictly controlled her affection for the heart, at first did not attach serious importance to the next novel.  According to the information that he had, the young man was a very superficial and near-minded dandy, not posing a threat to him. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  The "tooth" that interfered with Potemkin </h2><p>  By the way, Potemkin himself tried to please himself.  Plato in the presence of Catherine personally wrote the prince a letter in which he expressed his reverence and devotion.  At first, this had an effect, but soon the experienced nobleman, sensing danger, began to set the empress against her new "student", convincing her in letters that he was a "crappy" and "insignificant" person.  But the unexpected happened - Catherine, who always strictly followed his advice, this time became stubborn and flatly refused to part with her "newcomer" dear to her heart. </p>

    <p>  There is a funny legend: in a letter to the empress, answering a question about his well-being, Potemkin wrote that he was in good health, but was disturbed by a tooth that he would certainly tear out upon arrival in Petersburg.  Needless to say, this pun was directed against the young Zubov, with whom Potemkin intended to separate Catherine.  Looking ahead, it should be said that his plans were hindered by death, which made the omnipotent nobleman on the road from Moldova to St. Petersburg. </p><h2>  New Teeth at the Empress's Court </h2><p>  In the autumn of the same 1789, another representative of the Zubovs' surname appeared at the court - Valerian, who was the new favorite of his brother.  This eighteen-year-old fellow, being introduced to the empress, immediately gains her ardent sympathies and becomes yet another ‚Äústudent‚Äù.  She writes about him to Potemkin as a child, unusually beautiful and devoted to her in everything.  For him, Catherine asks the Most Serene for a worthy place in the army, which he leads, and from himself favors the young man the rank of colonel.  Apparently, the "student" showed considerable ability. </p><p>  Curious documents have been preserved that testify to the bounties that the empress showered at the expense of the treasury of one of her former favorites - Alexander Lansky.  It follows from them that within three years of his favorite, he received 100 thousand rubles for the wardrobe and outfits, and the daily table, at which at least twenty people gathered, cost the treasury 300 thousand rubles. </p><p>  The Empress personally handed him 7 million rubles, not counting the many gifts, such as diamond buttons for a camisole, two houses in St. Petersburg and innumerable serfs.  We can say with confidence that the treasury and the Teeth cost no less.  Plato was her last passion, and, presumably, Catherine was especially generous with him. </p><p>  He sent his excessively nimble brother out of sight, convincing the empress to send him to Moldova to Potemkin, where a warm place was ready for him.  It was calmer - who could know for how long both of them would have enough room in the heart of a woman‚Äôs satiated life?  Apparently, it was not in vain that Plato the Teeth reasoned.  A photo from the portrait of his brother, where he is depicted in a hat with a luxurious plume, is presented in our article. </p>

    <h2>  The beginning of state activity </h2><p>  In October 1791, the Empress‚Äôs loyal assistant in all public affairs, His Grace Prince Potemkin, suddenly died.  For Catherine, this was a terrible blow, because now she had one responsibility for making important decisions.  A reliable and intelligent person was always needed, always nearby.  In her opinion, Plato Zubov could become such an attorney.  Favorite like no other was suitable for this role. </p><p>  She began to join her Platosh (the empress so affectionately called him) during the life of Potemkin, but it cannot be said that he managed to succeed in this.  According to contemporaries, Plato Zubov - a favorite of Catherine II - with all his physical merits, did not have a sharp mind or a tenacious memory.  He was obviously not given science, but at the same time he was able to impress others with an intelligent and educated person.  This was helped by an excellent knowledge of the French language, in which he spoke easily and naturally. </p><p>  After the death of Potemkin, Plato Zubov, whose biography became the full embodiment of court favoritism, rose in his career to a whole new height.  Now, from a humble and respectful ‚Äúdisciple‚Äù, he turned into an omnipotent courtier, who did not consider it shameful to shout at those nobles whom he had slandered yesterday.  From his pen in those years came the most unthinkable and absurd state projects, such as the capture of Istanbul by the Russian fleet, the conquest of Vienna and Berlin, as well as the creation of a new state of Australia. </p><p>  Oddly enough, but hitherto wise and prudent in business, the ruler came under the influence of the Zubov brothers - empty and unprincipled careerists.  She signed decrees on the execution of their delusional projects and generously financed them.  For example, she sent Valerian with an army on a campaign, the purpose of which was the conquest of Persia, and then India.  It is believed that it was the brothers who persuaded the empress to brutally suppress the Polish rebellion, liquidate Poland as an independent state, persecute Radishchev, Novikov and prosecute the Freemasons. </p>

    <h2>  On top of power </h2><p>  As Platon Zubov came into force, Catherine 2 was showering with increasing generosity his many relatives, who had come to Petersburg for ranks and wealth.  The favorite's father, Alexander Nikolaevich, becoming a senator, took bribes and traded the patronage of his son.  Other Zubovs did not lag behind him. </p><p>  By this time, Plato Zubov had already completely entered the taste of power, especially since all those around him contributed to this.  The great commander A.V. Suvorov himself happily married his beloved daughter to him.  According to the memoirs of contemporaries, our other military genius, M. I. Kutuzov, considered it an honor to personally brew Zubov‚Äôs coffee, and the poet Derzhavin dedicated laudatory odes to him.  In general, everyone, as he could, tried to please the spoiled child of fate.  The famous portrait of Plato Zubov by Ivan Eggink, stored in the Hermitage and presented at the beginning of our article, depicts him at that happy time. </p><h2>  The end of the tale </h2><p>  The end of such a brilliant career came on November 17, 1796, when his patroness, Empress Catherine II, suddenly died in the Winter Palace.  Among those who mourned this death with genuine sincerity was, first of all, Plato Zubov - the favorite of <span>Catherine 2,</span> whose <span>biography</span> from this day began to develop in a completely different direction. </p><p>  Despite all the fears, Emperor Paul I, who ascended the throne, did not oppress the favorite of his mother, but simply sent him abroad under a plausible excuse.  However, he soon received news that he had begun secretly transporting his multi-million dollar fortune abroad, thereby causing significant damage to the Russian financial system.  In those days, such matters did not get away with, and the angry emperor ordered the seizure of all his real estate. </p><h2>  Murder complicity </h2><p>  Left abroad without sufficient funds to cover his exorbitant expenses, Zubov was forced to return to his homeland, where he immediately became one of the conspirators preparing the overthrow of Paul I. On the fateful night for the emperor on March 11, 1801, among those who entered the Mikhailovsky Palace , there was a tooth.  Plato, according to the recollections of the participant in the events of Count Benigsen, was the first to burst into the emperor‚Äôs bedroom, and his siblings, Valerian and Nikolai, rushed after him.  Perhaps not his hand dealt a mortal blow to the crown bearer, but the blood of the anointed of God lies on him. </p>

    <p>  Zubov had high hopes for the reign of Alexander I, since he personally took part in the elimination of his predecessor.  He showed great zeal in matters, drafting state restructuring projects (meaningless, as in previous years), and even became one of the authors of the law on the abolition of serfdom that was not adopted.  By nature, he was a typical opportunist who stigmatized the revolution during the time of Catherine, and in the reign of her grandson Alexander advocated for the constitution. </p><p>  But all his attempts were fruitless.  As you know, under Alexander I, none of the former conspirators was marked by high government posts.  Moreover, inwardly suffering from remorse, the emperor tried to get rid of those who reminded him of the tragic death of his father.  Among them was Zubov.  Platon Alexandrovich, obeying the circumstances, left the capital and settled in Lithuania, where during his brilliant career he received a magnificent estate as a gift from Catherine II. </p><h2>  The prototype of the "mean knight" </h2><p>  In the last period of his life, Plato Zubov - the favorite of Catherine II and the owner of countless wealth - became famous as an incredible miser, an equal which was hard to find.  Keeping chests filled with gold in the cellars of his castle (according to the most conservative estimates, his fortune was equal to twenty million rubles), he shamelessly robbed his own peasants, which made them the poorest in the district.  Painfully transferring even the most insignificant expenses, he did not hesitate to walk in old and torn clothes, sparing money for buying a new one. </p><p>  His only joy was, going down to the basement, to contemplate the wealth stored in dusty chests.  It is known that the prototype for writing by A. S. Pushkin of his famous ‚ÄúMean Knight‚Äù was precisely Zubov.  Plato, over the years increasingly losing his human appearance, only once, as if waking up from a dream, showed his previous interest in life. </p><h2>  The last years of the life of the former favorite </h2><p>  The legend says that shortly before his death, he accidentally saw a young girl of incredible beauty at the fair - the daughter of a local landowner.  By that time, he was already widowed and wanted to marry a young beauty.  Having received a categorical refusal from her, the old madman took out a chest from his basement, which contained a million rubles in gold, and simply bought an intractable girl from her father. </p>
