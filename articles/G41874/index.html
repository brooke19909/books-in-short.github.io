    <p>  Hotel Mitsis Ramira Beach (Kos) was created for a wonderful and fun holiday for all guests.  The first-class hotel complex is located on the sea coast.  It is designed and built in such a way that it is able to satisfy the wishes of the most demanding tourists, providing excellent service. </p><p>  If you dream of a relaxing holiday, but at the same time want to get a rich entertainment program, then you should stay at the Mitsis Ramira Beach 5 * hotel (Kos island, Psalidi).  Here you will be offered an extensive program of events that will not let anyone get bored. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Beach and Pools </h2><p>  The Mitsis Ramira Beach complex is good because it is located on the beach, so there is no problem getting to the beach.  Sun loungers and umbrellas by the pool and by the sea are provided free of charge.  I would like to note that the coastal area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is pebble.  Not all tourists like it, but because some prefer to ride on the sandy Paradise beach on the other side of the island. </p><p>  It features two outdoor saltwater pools.  The hotel‚Äôs own beach is convenient for families, as it is quite gentle. </p><h2>  Children's animation </h2><p>  No matter how old your kids are, they will have a great time at Mitsis Ramira Beach.  There is an entertainment club on the territory of the hotel for kids, which will take care of your children's leisure during the day, providing them with a friendly atmosphere and constant supervision.  The entertainment complex accepts children from three to fifteen years old.  Animators arrange for young tourists children's nights of fun, during which games, dances, faces are painted.  Such fun events last from 20.00 to 21.30. </p><p>  In addition, in Mitsis Ramira Beach in August and July there is a maxi club that accepts children from eight to twelve years old.  There is also a club for juniors.  While animators are engaged in children, parents can relax and enjoy the long-awaited vacation.  Unique and interesting programs allow you to organize exciting and fun games for the youngest guests, making your vacation unforgettable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel mitsis ramira beach 5 reviews" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1412108.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Chinese food lovers can enjoy the on-site restaurant.  In the central bar every day from ten in the morning until midnight, guests can enjoy cold and hot drinks with various sweets and biscuits.  Also, every day a special evening tea party is organized with a variety of desserts.  I must say that the central bar located in the main building is a wonderful place that will amaze you with an abundance of drinks, sweets, snacks, ice cream.  Here you can taste not only classic drinks, but also local non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. </p><p>  It offers guests on-site Lounge Bar.  On the beach, guests can grab a bite to eat at Beach Bar, which serves barbecue, ice cream, pizza, salads, fast food, and drinks. </p><p>  The Chees Bar is open daily by the pool - an ideal place not only for eating, but also for playing chess. </p><p>  As you know, many tourists prefer outdoor activities, and therefore attend many excursions.  In such cases, it is very difficult for people to enter the hotel‚Äôs standard meal schedule, so they can exchange their lunch for a basket of food.  This is a very convenient service.  For those planning an early departure from the complex, it is possible to order an early continental breakfast (from 4.00 to 7.00). </p><p>  Meeting and accommodation of guests in the hotel takes place according to a well-established scheme.  Everything happens very quickly and without a hitch.  Late arrivals offer refreshments and snacks. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  I would like to note that the island of Kos is not just a beautiful place, first of all, it is a point of concentration of archaeological sites.  For this reason, there is something to see.  Therefore, all tourists will be interested in visiting a number of excursions.  It is certainly worth seeing Asklepion - this is the most serious attraction of the whole island, since it is a sacred center dedicated to the deity Asclepius (the patron saint of medicine).  The entire territory of the complex is divided into three levels.  On the lower level are the famous Roman baths, and on the second - the temples of Asclepius and Apollo, on the third level there is another large temple of Asclepius, from which a beautiful view of the town of Kos and the Turkish coast opens. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mitsis ramira beach reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1412118.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  I must say that the island is in its own way a unique place in terms of organizing leisure.  The fact is that you can visit not only local attractions, but also stay on neighboring islands.  In addition, at a distance of half an hour on a ship by sea is Turkey.  You can also go on a day trip to the island of Rhodes, known worldwide for its medieval fortress and Acropolis in the city of Lindos.  You can also see the Monastery of Panoramity (Symi Island), visit Patmos Island, on which the Prophet John saw the visions later described in the Bible (Apocalypse).  On Kalymnos you can see the church of St. Sava.  But on the island of Nisyros, which is of volcanic origin, you can sink into the mouth of a real volcano.  In general, the list of attractions is simply endless ... Any tourist can find something interesting for himself in it. </p><h2>  Guest reviews </h2><p>  From the above list of hotel services, we can conclude that this is really a worthy place to spend a vacation.  But is Mitsis Ramira Beach really good?  Guest reviews confirm a decent level of the complex. </p><p>  The hotel is located near the city.  The road to it does not take more than ten minutes, which is convenient and completely not tiring.  At the reception the staff is very friendly, the settlement is fast and efficient, there are no complaints from tourists regarding the mess with the rooms.  You are provided with exactly those rooms that have been pre-booked. </p><p>  The apartments are spacious and comfortable.  According to some vacationers, the technical equipment of the rooms could already be replaced, since there are still tube TVs, but such nuances are not critical.  If you came to relax, and not watch TV channels, then this will not hurt you.  The furniture in the rooms is made of natural wood, the countertops and floors are marble, and the chairs are covered in genuine leather.  All this creates indescribable home comfort and a special atmosphere.  On the terraces and balconies of the rooms there is good-quality beautiful furniture, not plastic chairs, which sins most of the five-star hotels. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="room with pool" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1412119.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  As for food, all vacationers are very pleased with it.  It's hard to stay hungry here.  Very varied and delicious dishes, lots of fruits are served.  The Italian restaurant is worthy of special praise, where dinner is simply inimitable.  All catering facilities at the hotel are clean with attentive and agile staff.  The menu includes fish dishes daily. </p><p>  The hotel is very active animation.  Most vacationers are couples and senior citizens from England, France, Italy.  Perhaps the youth will miss the noisy parties all night, but this is a matter of taste. </p><p>  The hotel has a very convenient location.  So active tourists should go here.  Very easy to get to anywhere.  An indisputable advantage is the presence of its own beach.  Sometimes, it is surprising that he is pebble.  So, such a coast is a completely normal occurrence in these parts.  Therefore, choosing a hotel, carefully study the nuances.  The sea is very warm and beautiful.  The beach has good service.  The bartender delivers drinks to vacationers.  Of course, umbrellas and sunbeds could be updated, but these are such minor trifles that you should not pay attention to.  On the island of Kos, there is often wind, but it does not interfere at all.  It's nice that at the same time there is absolutely no feeling of heat. </p><p>  As for entertainment and sightseeing tours, there are a great many of them.  No active tourist will be bored. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Of course, there are minor flaws and shortcomings in the hotel, but they are so insignificant that they are fully compensated by the very good service and the friendliness of the staff.  In addition, this complex has very affordable prices for a hotel of this level, so it‚Äôs worth turning a blind eye to some points. </p>
