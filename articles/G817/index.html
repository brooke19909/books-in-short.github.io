Best tank japanese</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Japan was one of the leading forces during World War II.  The scale of the strategic plans of her leadership was to be confirmed by the high quality of technology.  Therefore, in the 30s, the Japanese created many models of tanks that had been fighting for several years without interruption on the Pacific front of World War II. </p><h2>  Western purchase </h2><p>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating their own tanks appeared in Japan after the First World War.  This conflict showed the promise of this modern type of weapon.  Since the Japanese did not have their own industry necessary for the production of tanks, they began to get acquainted with the achievements of the Europeans. </p><p>  For Tokyo, it was a familiar method of modernization.  The country of the rising sun spent several centuries in total isolation and only in the second half of the XIX century began to develop rapidly.  From scratch, new branches of the economy and industry appeared.  Therefore, the task of conducting a similar experiment with tanks was not so fantastic. </p><p>  The first in 1925 were purchased by the French Renault FT-18, which at that time were considered the best cars of its kind.  This model was adopted by the Japanese into service.  Very soon, the engineers and designers of this country, having gained Western experience, prepared several of their pilot projects. </p>

    <h2>  Chi-i </h2><p>  The first Japanese tank was assembled in Osaka in 1927.  The car was called "Chi-I."  It was an experimental model, which did not wait for mass production.  However, it was she who became the very ‚Äúfirst lump‚Äù, which turned out to be a starting point for Japanese experts for further technical research. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The model had a cannon, two machine guns, and its mass was 18 tons.  Its design feature consisted of several towers on which guns were installed.  It was a bold and controversial experiment.  The first Japanese tank was also equipped with a machine gun designed to protect the machine from the rear.  Because of this feature, it was installed behind the engine compartment.  Tests have shown that the multi-tower design was unsuccessful in terms of combat effectiveness.  Subsequently, Osaka decided to abandon the implementation of such a system.  The Japanese tank Chi-I remained a historical model that had never visited a real war.  But some of its features were inherited by machines that were later used in the fields of World War II. </p><h2>  "Type 94" </h2><p>  Basically, Japanese <span>tanks of World War II</span> were developed in the 30s.  The first model in this series is Tokushu Kengyshina (abbreviated as TC, or "Type 94").  This tank was distinguished by small dimensions and weight (only 3.5 tons).  It was used not only for military, but also for auxiliary purposes.  Therefore, in Europe, "Type 94" was considered a wedge. </p><p>  As an auxiliary vehicle, TK was used to transport goods and help convoys.  Such, according to the designers, was the original purpose of the machine.  However, over time, the project evolved into a full-fledged combat model.  Almost all subsequent Japanese <span>tanks of World War II</span> inherited from the Type 94 not only the design, but also the layout.  In total, more than 800 units of this generation were produced.  "Type 94" was mainly used during the invasion of China, which began in 1937. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Curious is the post-war fate of Tokushu Kenginsha.  Part of the fleet of these models was captured by the Allies, who defeated the Japanese after the atomic <span>bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</span>  The tanks were handed over to the Chinese - the <span>People‚Äôs Liberation Army of the</span> Communists and the Kuomintang troops.  These parties were hostile to each other.  Therefore, the "Type 94" was tested for several years on the sidelines of the Chinese Civil War, after which the PRC was formed. </p>

    <h2>  "Type 97" </h2><p>  In 1937, "Type 94" was declared obsolete.  Further research engineers led to the emergence of a new machine - a direct descendant of Tokushu Kenginsha.  The model was called "Type 97" or abbreviated "Te-Ke."  This Japanese tank was used during battles in China, Malaya and Burma until the <span>end of World War II.</span>  In fact, it was a deep modification of the "Type 94". </p><p>  The crew of the new car consisted of two people.  The engine was located at the rear, and the transmission - at the front.  An important innovation compared to its predecessor was the unification of the combat and management squad.  The car received a 37 mm cannon inherited from the TC. </p><p>  New Japanese tanks in the field were first tested in battles on the Khalkhin Gol River.  Since they did not participate in the first attacks on Soviet positions, most of Te-Ke managed to survive.  Almost all active units of this type were transferred to the Pacific War Theater of World War II.  These small tanks were especially effectively used for reconnaissance of enemy positions.  They were also used as machines that organize communication between different parts of the front.  The small size and weight made the Type 97 an indispensable weapon to support infantry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Chi Ha </h2><p>  Interestingly, almost all of the Japanese tanks of World War II were developed by Mitsubishi employees.  Today, this brand is known primarily in the automotive industry.  However, in the 30-40s, the company's factories regularly produced reliable machines for the army.  In 1938, Mitsubishi began production of Chi-Ha, one of the main Japanese medium tanks.  Compared to its predecessors, the model received more powerful guns (including 47 mm guns).  In addition, she was distinguished by an improved tip. </p><p>  Chi-Ha was used in battle from the very first days after its appearance on the assembly line.  At the initial stage of the war with China, they remained an effective weapon in the hands of Japanese tankers.  However, after the United States was drawn into the conflict, Chi-Ha had a serious combat rival.  These were tanks like the M3 Lee.  They easily cope with all the Japanese cars of the light and medium segment.  Largely because of this, out of more than two thousand Chi-Ha units, only a dozen representatives of this model remain as museum exhibits today. </p>

    <h2>  Ha Go </h2><p>  If we compare all the Japanese tanks of World War II, then we can distinguish two of the most basic and common models.  This is the above Chi-Ha and Ha-Go.  This tank was mass-produced in 1936-1943.  In total, more than 2300 units of this model were produced.  Although it is difficult to single out the best Japanese tank, it is HaGo that has the most rights to this title. </p><p>  His first sketches appeared in the early 30s.  Then the Japanese command wanted to get a car, which could become an effective auxiliary tool for cavalry attacks.  That is why HaGo was distinguished by such important qualities as high cross-country ability and mobility. </p><h2>  Ka-Mi </h2><p>  An important feature of the "Ha-Go" was that this tank became the basis for numerous modifications.  All of them were experimental and therefore not widely used.  However, this does not mean at all that among them there were no competitive models. </p><p>  High-quality, for example, was Ka-Mi.  It was unique in that it remained the only mass-produced floating Japanese tank of World War II.  The development of this modification "Ha-Go" began in 1941.  Then the Japanese command began to prepare a campaign for an attack on the south, where there were many small islands and archipelagos.  In this regard, there was a need to land a naval landing.  Japanese heavy tanks could not help in this task.  Therefore, Mitsubishi started the development of a fundamentally new model, based on the most common tank of the Land of the Rising Sun, "Ha-Go."  As a result, 182 Ka-Mi units were produced. </p><h2>  Use of amphibious tanks </h2><p>  The chassis of the previous tank has been improved so that the machine can be effectively used on water.  For this, in particular, the housing was significantly modified.  Because of its originality, each Ka-Mi gathered slowly and for a long time.  For this reason, the first major operation using amphibious tanks occurred only in 1944.  The Japanese landed on Saipan - the largest of the <span>Mariana Islands.</span>  By the end of the war, when the imperial army did not advance, but, on the contrary, only retreated, its landing operations also ceased.  Therefore, the "Ka-Mi" began to be used as a conventional ground tank.  This was facilitated by the fact that it was universal in its design and driving characteristics. </p><p>  In 1944, photos of Japanese tanks floating along the coast of the Marshall Islands circled the whole world.  By that time, the empire was already close to defeat, and even the appearance of a fundamentally new technology could not help it.  Nevertheless, the Ka-Mi itself made a great impression on the opponents.  The hull of the tank was spacious.  It housed five people - a driver, a mechanic, a shooter, a loader and a commander.  Outwardly, ‚ÄúKa-Mi‚Äù immediately caught my eye because of its double tower. </p>

    <h2>  Chi He </h2><p>  "Chi-he" appeared as a result of working on errors related to Chi-Ha's characteristics.  In 1940, Japanese designers and engineers decided to catch up with Western competitors in the easiest way by copying foreign technologies and best practices.  Thus, all the initiative and originality of oriental specialists were put aside. </p><p>  The result of this maneuver was not long in coming - "Chi-He" more than all its Japanese "relatives" and externally and internally began to resemble European analogues of that time.  But the project was implemented too late.  In 1943-1944  only 170 Chi-hee were released. </p>

    <h2>  Chi-Well </h2><p>  A continuation of the ideas embodied in Chi-he, became Chi-Well.  It differed from its predecessor only in advanced weapons.  The design and layout of the case remained the same. </p><p>  The series was not numerous.  At the final stage of the Second World War in 1943-1945.  only about a hundred Chi-Wells were released.  According to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Japanese command, these tanks were to become an important defense force of the country during the landing of American troops.  Due to atomic bombings and the imminent surrender of state leadership, this foreign attack never happened. </p>

    <h2>  OI </h2><p>  What was the difference between Japanese tanks?  The review shows that among them there were no heavy class models according to the Western classification.  The Japanese command preferred light and medium vehicles, which were easier and more efficient to use in conjunction with infantry.  However, this did not mean at all that in this country there were no projects of a fundamentally different type. </p><p>  One of these was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa super-heavy tank, which received the rough name "OI".  This multi-tower monster was supposed to accommodate a crew of 11 people.  The model was designed as an important weapon for preparing attacks on the USSR and China.  Work on "OI" began in 1936 and was somehow conducted up to the defeat in World War II.  The project was either closed or resumed again.  Today there is no reliable data that at least one prototype of this model was produced.  OI remained on paper, as did Japan's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãits regional dominance, which led it to a disastrous alliance with Nazi Germany. </p>
