    <p>  Adults are invited to the Hummingbird beer bar.  Here you can taste original cocktails or beer, of which there are more than 20 varieties.  If you are hungry, you can satisfy your hunger at the Hungry Hippo or Limpopo cafe.  In this water park (the only one in the Krasnodar Territory), non-cash payment for services is carried out. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  AquaLoo </h2><p>  By the number of entertainment complexes Gelendzhik is not inferior to Sochi.  Here you can also choose a good water park.  Krasnodar Territory is proud of its largest resort.  Here, a lot of work is being done to improve the quality of leisure for citizens and guests from all over our country. </p><p>  The AquaLoo complex includes a <span>sanatorium, a boarding house</span> and a luxurious water park.  This is the only building in the city, open to visitors all year.  There are two zones: summer and winter.  Water temperature +28 degrees.  In pools for children, it is higher: +30 degrees.  In the off-season in the open area, the water is heated. </p><p>  At AquaLoo, all guests undergo mandatory medical supervision.  4 times a day, a water analysis is performed.  There are 10 slides of different lengths.  The longest of them is the Space Bot (145 m).  A little shorter pipe "Rafting" (110 m), which descend on rubber circles. </p><p>  In the central part of the territory an excellent children's town is built.  In the shallow pool of children, various slides await. </p><h2>  <span>Waterpark Lermontovo</span> (Krasnodar Territory) </h2><p>  This is a famous resort village, the main attraction of which are the mountains and the sea.  Here you can admire the magnificent nature - mountain valleys covered with relict forests, caves and waterfalls. </p><p>  In the center of the village is a magnificent water park "Chernomor".  It is located in the hotel of the same name.  This is not a very large complex, but both adults and children can have a good rest. </p><p>  The main attractions of the Chernomor are, of course, a variety of slides. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water park Lermontovo Krasnodar Territory" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/479002.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  "Olympia" </h2><p>  In the suburbs of Anapa, in the village of Vityazevo, in 2012 a water park was opened.  The Krasnodar Territory has such a number of entertainment centers that, perhaps, this event has already surprised few.  And completely in vain.  This is one of the few thematic water parks in Russia.  It is decorated in the Greek style.  You are given a unique opportunity to visit Ancient Greece.  You will be able to watch the competitions of the ancient Olympians, see the amazing heroes of myths and legends. </p><p>  Olympia has several independent zones.  These are the Poseidon pool, the Hades and Zeus complexes, the Espizium children's town. </p><h2>  "Equator" </h2><p>  Today we are considering <span>water parks in the Krasnodar</span> Territory, photos of which are presented in this article.  It would probably be unfair not to talk about such a structure located in Krasnodar itself. </p><p>  This is the water park "Equator", located near the lake Old Kuban, in the microdistrict of Hydrobuilders.  Its location is very convenient - residents from any area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city can easily get here. </p><p>  Equator operates from June to September.  The water park covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 8 hectares.  Along the entire perimeter of the complex are food outlets - cafes and bars.  In the center of the complex you can enjoy meat grilled on the grill.  There is a cafe "Treasure Island". </p><p>  Adult visitors can ride from nine slides of different heights.  The most popular of them is Wave.  It creates the effect of free fall from a considerable height - 10 meters.  At rafts you can go down the Black Hole - a closed pipe.  It has a length of 100 meters, equipped with lighting effects. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="water parks of the Krasnodar Territory photo" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10506/479004.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Kids with pleasure master the slides "Children's Tobogan" (4 m), "Zero Gravity" and "Rainbow". </p><p>  All summer in this water park entertaining events are held - corporate parties, graduation parties, and even weddings.  In the evening, you can take part in a <span>foam party</span> or a disco. </p><h2>  The best water park in the Krasnodar Territory </h2><p>  It is extremely difficult to name one of the many water parks in this area the best.  It all depends on your preferences, on whether the children are relaxing with you, or in the water park you spend time as an adult company.  According to tourists' reviews, several buildings may claim this title: </p><ul><li>  water park in Dzhugba; </li><li>  in the village of Nebug; </li><li>  ‚ÄúGolden Bay‚Äù (Gelendzhik); </li><li>  Golden Beach (Anapa). </li></ul>
