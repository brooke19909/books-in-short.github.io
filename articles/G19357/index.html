    <h2>  Park history </h2><p>  This is the first park in the Soviet Union, intended exclusively for children's development and creativity.  In 2018, the Park will celebrate its 60th anniversary.  A beautifully landscaped area of ​​about 17 hectares is densely planted with greenery - these are luxurious trees and well-groomed flower beds, covered with bright flowers from early spring to late autumn. </p><p>  The pride of the park is a 6-meter oak, proudly bearing the name of the Giant of Tauris.  It is believed that his age is about 700 years. </p><h2>  Rides </h2><p>  Many parents bring their children to the park in order to ride them on their favorite attractions. </p><p>  In the depths of the park there is a free playground, made in the form of a huge ship.  In the game complex, kids are happy to frolic while their parents rest on the benches. </p><p>  Attractions set in the middle of the last century: the Saturn carousel and the Boats swing, have survived. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The park has a lot of modern vibrant attractions: </p><ul><li>  Ferris wheel; </li><li>  trampolines; </li><li>  train; </li><li>  electric cars; </li><li>  carousels, etc. </li></ul>

    <p>  A shooting gallery is very popular in which they hold a competition for the most accurate shooter. </p><p>  In the park you can ride on a typewriter or gyro scooter, enjoy ice cream, popcorn and cotton candy. </p><p>  Both adults and children love to take photos in the Simferopol Children's Park on the free site “Pushkin's Tales”, where they found a haven for Baba Yaga, Leshiy and the Little Mermaid, the huge head of Vityaz and Ruslan riding a horse, 33 heroes with Uncle Chernomor, Golden Fish and squirrel gnawing emeralds. </p><h2>  Children's Park in Simferopol - a territory of joy </h2><p>  After the beautification recently carried out in the park, a special platform for fans of bicycles and skateboards appeared in it.  Specially curved platforms enable young athletes to hone their skills. </p><h2>  Zoo in the children's park </h2><p>  In the Children's <span>Park of Simferopol</span> there is a zoo corner.  Over 300 species of various animals and birds inhabit the enclosures.  There are several bears in the zoo that willingly accept treats, camels, foxes, wolves, monkeys, raccoon dogs. </p><p>  In 2017, a new spacious aviary was built for the family of young lions, which its inhabitants really liked. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Tiger and cougar, buffalo and red deer, saigas and lynx - all these animals are seen by children near, not in the picture, but in the zoo.  With enthusiasm, kids and pets are examined: goats and pigs, rabbits and horses.  In the center of the zoo there is a pond where swans, ducks, geese and even red-eared turtles swim. </p><p>  That is why you can’t get around the enclosures on weekends - Simferopolians come to the animals and guests from other Crimean cities come.  Many generations from childhood remember the Simferopol zoo corner. </p><p>  In recent years, the zoo has been developing rapidly: new animals appear, comfortable pens and aviaries are being built, old ones are being improved.  The dream of the administration is to get zoo status. </p><p>  On the territory of the zoo there are 2 playgrounds, many benches, a toilet. </p><p>  All children are waiting for a visit to the zoo in the Children's Park of Simferopol.  How much is such a trip, parents and organizers of extracurricular activities are interested. </p><p>  Low cost: </p><ul><li>  adults - 200 r.; </li><li>  children's ticket - 150 rubles; </li><li>  Children under 5 years old are free accompanied by an adult. </li></ul><p>  The price may change, therefore it is better to clarify the information in advance on the official website. </p>
