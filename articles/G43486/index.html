    <h2>  A bit about the history of the city </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Veliky Novgorod is a truly ancient city.  It is interesting in that, according to many sources, it was here that Russian statehood began to emerge.  This fact is undoubtedly very important for the country, therefore Veliky Novgorod is of such interest.  It is believed that there was a vocation of Prince Rurik.  Then the city gradually began to develop and after some time became the center of <span>Novgorod Rus.</span> </p><p>  Interestingly, during the time of feudal Russia, the city became the very first free republic.  Several centuries later, political independence was lost during the Moscow-Novgorod war, in which Moscow Prince Ivan the Great defeated.  The war took place in 1477-1478.  Novgorod is one of the few cities that have not been subjected to the Mongol invasion.  Of course, he had to pay tribute to the Horde, but most importantly, he managed to preserve the unique cultural monuments.  Thus, Novgorod became the only city that could avoid decline in the XI-XII centuries. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>
