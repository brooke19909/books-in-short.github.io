    <p>  Tourists leave good reviews about food at the Aquamarine Hotel.  So, the menu here is quite diverse: guests are offered various types of meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, delicious desserts and ice cream.  The hotel's restaurant also serves national cuisine. </p><p>  I liked the vacationers and the beach.  It is sandy and very clean.  There are many bars near the beach where you can order both non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks, as well as a varied snack. </p><p>  As for the shortcomings, the main of them, tourists consider the lack of sunbeds near the pool in high season.  But this problem is characteristic not only for Aquamarine, but also for the vast majority of hotels.  Therefore, if you plan to spend several hours near the pool, it is recommended to get up early and take a deck chair, putting a towel on it.  Another disadvantage, some tourists consider the lack of television channels in Russian in the rooms, although most vacationers do not attach any importance to this. </p><p>  Almost all vacationers agree that the four-star hotel "Aquamarine" is an example of an excellent combination of price and quality.  Most of the tourists are ready to recommend it as a good place to spend a vacation with their family and friends. </p>
