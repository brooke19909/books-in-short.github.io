  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Banking operations with securities as a type of brokerage service</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Service by brokerage companies, like any transactions with securities in the markets, is carried out at tariffs, which are determined by the value of turnover per trading session.  According to this principle, the basic tariff plans are built, according to which active operations with securities of clients are serviced. </p><p>  Today, the main brokers in the national securities market are building their tariff policy with the maximum regard for the interests of customers.  For example, if you are just starting to conduct banking operations with securities, or just want to evaluate brokerage services, you will most likely be offered tariff plans that provide for short-term brokerage services at low costs.  At the same time, there is no minimum fee for the order, and the commission rate is only about 0.015% of the turnover.  If you have some exchange experience and want to get the most favorable conditions for your transactions, tariff plans are suitable for which the commission is calculated not for turnover, but for the profit that the client receives and, as a rule, is about 30% of the trading result for a month . </p><p>  Operations with <span>securities are</span> now held at all leading trading floors.  Representatives of companies in the regions of Russia organize activities on the basis of agreements, under the terms of which they are responsible for the service, and local employees carry out procedures and actions that require their presence in the regions in person.  Almost all cities of Russia today with the help of brokerage services get the opportunity to participate in tenders at favorable tariff plans and with high quality service. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  About 20 platforms are available for customers, including mobile ones, on which you can implement almost any trading strategy based on the needs of the client.  About half of them are free.  For example, the Transaq platform, after free installation on a computer, allows operations on the MICEX, Deutsche B√∂rse, RTS even on access channels with low bandwidth.  A proprietary application FinamTrade does not require installation at all and makes it possible to conduct trading on the MICEX, FORTS, Forex.  The application has a convenient settings panel, an intuitive and attractive interface, a news module and a wide option for servicing a client's portfolio.  The free MetaTrader application has proven itself in trading on the Forex market and in conducting futures transactions. </p><p>  The most important issue of the success of any transaction with securities at the auction is, of course, the problem of choosing a <span>trading strategy.</span>  Here the result depends, first of all, on the method and technology of actions on the market that you have chosen, which together constitute a trading strategy.  You need to understand that there is no universal and universally successful way to make money on exchange transactions, although whole volumes have been written on this subject.  The conditions and charts on the exchange are the same for all participants, but their interpretation is different, therefore the results are also different. </p><p>  But there are rules that must be taken into account by all participants when conducting transactions with securities. </p><p>  <span>An investment strategy</span> is to identify growing assets using <span>fundamental analysis,</span> and then, on the basis of these assets, a dividend portfolio is formed. </p><p>  The strategy of following the trend is to use the inertia of the trend, the goal is to enter the position exactly when the trend is growing, and exit - when the trend begins to weaken. </p><p>  The counter-trending strategy speaks for itself in its name, when using this technology, stocks are acquired in the fall, and sold when the price rises. </p><p>  There are other strategies, but when using any, it is important to remember that you can earn money on the exchange, but you can lose, trading on it is directly connected with risks, and only you can decide for yourself, take risks yourself, or resort to the services of a professional broker. </p>
