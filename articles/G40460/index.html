In addition, slopes are equipped here for athletes of any level, which means it will be comfortable for both amateurs and professionals.

Local tracks are designed more for beginner skiers and snowboarders than for professionals.  You can get to the ski center by a free bus from the city center, and the price of the ski pass includes a ticket for the skating rink at the Sports Palace and the entrance to the Blaise Castle. </p><h2>  Bohinj </h2><p>  The most famous ski slopes of Slovenia, located near the beautiful Lake Bohinj, are called Vogel, Kobla and Sorishka.  Couples with children and lovers of a relaxing holiday prefer to go to these places.  Here you can study at a <span>cross-country ski</span> school or take lessons at a ski school, which, incidentally, is considered one of the best in Slovenia.  In Vogel you can go sledding, snowboarding, take part in night skating or virgin snowboarding.  Here you will not find stormy entertainments and you will not be able to walk in plenty at night clubs.  But you will have a great time with your family, take a sleigh ride on the lake, try local wines and, if you're lucky, become a spectator of the cross-country skiing World Cup. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Ski resorts in Slovenia.

    <h2>  Bovec </h2><p>  Ski resort Kanin (Slovenia) is located on the highest slopes of the mountain of the same name.  Its tracks are located at an altitude of more than 2000 meters and quite often there are competitions in winter sports.  Skiers and snowboarders come here to relax and have fun from early December to late April.  They are delivered to the ski area by cable car, and the hotel can be reached by bus or taxi.

If you are a happy holder of a Schengen visa, you can purchase a ski pass and enjoy skiing from the mountains in different countries. </p><h2>  Slovenia.  Ski resort trails </h2><p>  Before you go to this country and enjoy a winter holiday, carefully study the types of tracks that this or that resort offers.  It is very important to evaluate your real level of skiing, so that your vacation goes the way you dreamed about it.
