    <h2>  Description of the hotel complex </h2><p>  Atlantica Creta Paradise 4 * refers to chain hotels, which usually has a good effect on the level of service and professionalism of employees.  In Greece, this chain includes twelve hotels of different stars, but they all receive positive reviews from our compatriots. </p><p>  In many tourist catalogs Atlantica Caldera Creta Paradise 4 * is positioned as a family hotel, where you should go with your children for a leisurely and measured vacation.  Guest reviews confirm this.  The hotel complex is fully consistent with the declared category and offers its guests a wide range of services.  Therefore, if you prefer noisy parties and the purpose of your vacation is to constantly move to explore the maximum possible number of attractions, then you should definitely choose a different hotel with fewer stars. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Atlantica Caldera Creta Paradise 4 * has a very unusual concept.  It is built in the traditional style of the Cretan village, which explains the layout of the territory and the location of the buildings.  Atlantica Caldera Creta Paradise consists of a main three-story block, where restaurants and a reception are located, a separate building in the interior and a complex of cottages located around a large pool.  The windows of the main building offer a magnificent view of the sea and mountains, so many of our compatriots prefer to settle in it.  In total, the hotel has two hundred sixty-seven rooms of different categories. </p>

    <h2>  Hotel Location </h2><p>  Hotel Atlantica Caldera Creta Paradise 4 * (Crete) is located in Chania.  This is usually written in tourist catalogs, but in reality the hotel complex and resort town are separated by a distance of eleven kilometers.  This does not allow tourists to travel to the city often, but it greatly simplifies the road from the airport to the hotel.  The fact is that it is in Chania that the nearest airport terminal is located, accepting flights from Russia.  From it to Atlantica Caldera Creta Paradise you need to overcome only about twenty-seven kilometers.  Many of our compatriots unknowingly purchase tickets to Heraklion, but from there they have to get to the hotel about three hours. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Judging by the reviews, the hotel complex is located in a slightly deserted area in the village of Platanias.  It got its name due to the large number of plane trees growing here.  In the village, guests of Atlantica Creta Paradise 4 * are chosen quite often to stroll along the beautiful streets or sit in small cozy restaurants with a magnificent view of the surroundings. </p><p>  Many hotel guests often choose boat trips for themselves, so it is worth keeping in mind that you need to drive seventeen kilometers to the nearest port.  Not all tourists are ready to travel for such a long time, so be sure to consider your options when choosing excursions. </p><h2>  Hotel beach </h2><p>  We already wrote that most of our compatriots come to Atlantica Creta Paradise 4 * for a beach holiday.  Therefore, the description of the coast in the reviews paid quite a lot of attention. </p><p>  Often tour operators claim that the hotel is located on the first coastline and literally at hand.  However, in reality, tourists will have to go to the beach for about seven minutes and cross the road, which, however, does not seem to be a serious problem for vacationers. </p><p>  The beach area itself is considered one of the best in Crete.  Atlantica Caldera Creta Paradise 4 * makes sure that guests are waiting for the cleanest sand and the seabed.  The beach area is cleaned daily, so here you will not see garbage or fittings buried in the sand thrown to the shore by the tide.  The sea itself is mostly calm, it storms extremely rarely, but even at such moments many of our compatriots continue to enjoy swimming. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The beach line stretches for about a kilometer and is well equipped.  Vacationers do not lack sun loungers and parasols.  There are also shower cabins on the shore and changing rooms equipped.  It is worth considering that very close to the beach is a boat pier.  Therefore, those who wish can easily and quickly rent for themselves a suitable boat for a walk. </p>

    <h2>  Territory and infrastructure </h2><p>  Atlantica Creta Paradise 4 * (Greece) has a not very large territory, so those who are used to the expanses of Turkish hotels may be a bit crowded here.  However, everything you need for a holiday fits very well in a rather modest area. </p><p>  On the territory there are two restaurants and three bars located in the most visited places in the hotel.  Vacationers from Europe prefer to spend their time at two outdoor pools equipped with sun loungers and parasols. </p><p>  The reception in the main building works around the clock, and check-in often happens before the specified hour.  Friendly staff at the front desk take care of this.  In the same building are shops and a rental car, where you can arrange a transfer to the airport or any other place at the request of the client. </p><p>  It is noteworthy that the hotel has a small church in the traditional Greek style.  She constantly attracts the attention of tourists with her austere charm. </p><p>  Atlantica Creta Paradise (Crete) offers its guests parking and laundry services.  Guests can also spend time in the sauna and relax during a professional massage. </p><p>  Interestingly, many Greek hotels have several conference rooms with different capacities.  There are three of them in the hotel complex described by us: </p><ul><li>  eighty-five people; </li><li>  one hundred twenty-five people; </li><li>  for three hundred and fifty people. </li></ul><p>  It is convenient that for all paid services rendered on the territory of the hotel, you can pay with credit cards. </p><h2>  Service and Facilities </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the hotel has four stars, it cannot boast of a large number of services.  However, you will definitely receive the claimed service. </p><p>  Wi-Fi is available on site, but a good and stable signal is only in public areas.  In the apartments you can hardly get on the Internet. </p><p>  All guests are noted by the polite and friendly hotel staff, which is very good towards Russian guests.  Many employees know several phrases in Russian, so you can still understand each other. </p><p>  Also, all guests are available room service.  However, do not forget that it requires additional payment.  In the apartment you can order not only dishes from the restaurant, but also essentials from the store. </p>

    <h2>  Children at the hotel </h2><p>  For parents planning a vacation with their children, it is important to know how comfortable they will be in the hotel complex.  In Atlantica Creta Paradise 4 *, kids are always happy, despite the weak animation, they will have something to do during the holidays. </p><p>  Kids and not only can find entertainment in the kids club.  Children from four to twelve years old are accepted there.  For each age, a special training program has been thought out so that the child is not bored. </p><p>  In the pools sections for children are provided, where the depth is much less than in a standard bowl.  If your child gets tired of frolic in the water, then he can be brought to the playground.  It is equipped with numerous designs made in accordance with all safety rules. </p><h2>  Supply system </h2><p>  Surprisingly, this hotel provides all-inclusive meals.  Experienced travelers know that this is very rare for Greece.  Therefore, the Atlantica Creta Paradise 4 * hotel (Crete) is often chosen for families with children. </p><p>  The all-inclusive system concept includes food, drinks from the bar and entertainment.  It is worth noting that the guests respond very highly to the quality of the dishes.  Every day, the day of a national cuisine of the world is announced and only relevant dishes are served.  Mexican and Italian days are very popular.  The week usually ends with a noisy Greek party with traditional songs and dances. </p><p>  Judging by the comments on the Internet, locally produced alcohol is of good quality.  And bartenders never dilute it with water.  Another advantage of the hotel is the ability to choose special dishes for children.  As such, there is no children's menu at the hotel, but many products are steamed and laid out in a separate section. </p><p>  A lot of enthusiasm is caused by the grill bar.  Dishes on fire can not but impress our compatriots, so they quite often have lunch and dinner in this small bar. </p>

    <h2>  Number of rooms </h2><p>  The hotel offers its guests four categories of rooms: </p><ul><li>  double rooms; </li><li>  family; </li><li>  apartments with a private pool; </li><li>  rooms in a bungalow with two bedrooms. </li></ul><p>  In general, the equipment of all rooms is identical.  Each is equipped with air conditioning, cable TV and telephone.  Internet access is available from the room (for a fee).  A mandatory attribute of the apartment is a safe, for which you also need to pay extra.  Therefore, many guests prefer to lock valuables in a suitcase to the castle. </p><p>  Depending on the room category, vacationers can enjoy views from the balcony or terrace.  Bathrooms are equipped with a shower and hairdryer.  In the bungalow, guests are always offered a wide range of cosmetic accessories.  Maids replenish this set once every few days. </p>

Therefore, we could not fail to note some of the disadvantages that Russian tourists mentioned: </p><ul><li>  lack of Russian-speaking staff; </li><li>  the road between the coast and the hotel; </li><li>  Intrusive photographers and high photo prices. </li></ul><p>  Surprisingly, most of the guests were so inspired by the rest that they did not even notice negative moments in their reviews. </p>
