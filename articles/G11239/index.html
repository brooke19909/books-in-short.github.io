    <h2>  Accommodation </h2><p>  The choice of apartments at the 3 * Santiago Resort is small.  There are double rooms and the so-called family rooms for four.  Of course, the hotel cannot boast of suites, deluxe, but those apartments that are here are a very comfortable option. </p><p>  Take, for example, a standard number.  It is quite spacious, in addition there is a balcony with a picturesque view of the surroundings, and a private bathroom with a toilet and various accessories.  You can book such a room for about 55-62 thousand rubles for two (duration of stay - 14 nights).  Breakfast, by the way, is included in the price, like all taxes with fees (which make up 17.42 percent of the total).  The price may vary depending on what season it is (i.e. the time of year), and on the presence (or absence) of stocks and special super offers.  So if a person gets into such a good time when discounts will be valid, then it will be possible to save several thousand rubles, which is by no means superfluous.  By the way, the hotel 3 * Santiago Resort still gives the opportunity to cancel the reservation (and for free). </p>
