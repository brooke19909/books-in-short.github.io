According to some experts, the title of <span>"best phone of the</span> year" is worthy of a new product from the Korean manufacturer.  The external attractiveness of the device was achieved by a skillful combination of glass and metal.  Thanks to the fourth-generation Gorilla Glass coating, the device is not afraid of scratches.

    <h2>  HTC One E8 </h2><p>  Today we are considering special cell phones, the best of the models, so we could not pass by this development.  Perhaps this is one of the most affordable devices to which we draw your attention today.  The developers placed a 5 MP front-view camera eye on the front side, along with a notification LED and <span>a light / proximity sensor.</span> </p><h2>  G3 stylus </h2><p>  Our rating of mobile phones also included a device with an input method, which many have already begun to forget.  The designers made the stylus one of the advantages of the model.  Convenience adds a small frame on the sides of the display.  At the same time, the phone fits in a compact case on which fingerprints are not visible.  There is good color rendering and brightness. </p><h2>  Sony Xperia Z </h2><p>  When the manufacturer created this model, he clearly wanted to develop the best phone in the world, since he had practically brought it to the ideal in many aspects.  Before us is the "crown of creation" of Sony.  The Xperia Z smartphone is so sophisticated and beautiful that it is difficult to call it resistant to external influences at first glance, but the device is fully compliant with IP57 and IP55 standards.  He is not afraid of dust, dirt and moisture.  In addition, the device pleases with its Full HD-screen.  With such a huge resolution, the smartphone fully retained the speed and smoothness of the interface. </p><h2>  Nokia XL </h2>

The premiere of such a device was expected with great impatience, and its appearance on the market aroused great interest among users.  As we already said, when drawing up the rating, we relied on people's assessments, and the community is most actively discussing the representative of the series with the largest possible display, and we'll talk about it.  The model has not only large sizes, but also improved technical characteristics compared to younger brothers.  Nokia XL is available in several colors.  The front of the smartphone has a microphone, a single ‚ÄúBack‚Äù key, a speaker, a camera for video communication, distance and light sensors and, of course, a screen.  On the right are the power and volume keys.  Left is empty.  Upstairs is the audio jack.  Below is microUSB.  On the back there is a multimedia speaker, the Nokia logo and a 5-megapixel camera, supplemented by a flash.  The polycarbonate case cover can be removed by pulling it on one of the sides, providing yourself access to the slots for a pair of micro-SIM, memory cards and the battery compartment.  The software basis for the device is a proprietary development of the manufacturer, created on the basis of the Android OS.  In this case, the software version can be updated.  By default, the manufacturer installed clients of various services and social networks in memory.  There is also a store, a number of proprietary applications, Astro file manager, games.  Conveniently implemented the work of a pair of SIM cards.  In the settings, you can activate the request with each action or set the default primary number for SMS and calls.  Video is recorded with a resolution of 864 x 480 pixels.  The camera features tracking smooth autofocus and sound.  The call quality is excellent.

    <h2>  Sony Xperia Z3 </h2><p>  If you are looking for the best phone in the world, we recommend that you consider this flagship from the Japanese manufacturer, which has absorbed many of the strengths of the more classic model described above.  The dimensions of the device are 146 x 72 x 7.3 mm, and weighs 152 grams.  The side faces are rounded, the device fits perfectly in the hand.  Z3 has plastic inserts at the corners, thus providing additional protection against falls.  There are 4 colors - emerald, black, copper and white.  There is protection against exposure to fresh water and dust according to the IP65 / IP68 standard.  The lower part of the body has no holes, the microphone is hidden behind a special grill, along with the lower speaker.  These two elements are covered by a single membrane.  The second microphone is placed on the top panel, next to the 3.5 mm jack.  The front and back sides are made of DragonTrail safety glass.  The microUSB connector hit the left side panel.  It is protected by a plug.  The right side placed the plug of the nanoSIM connector, which is located in a special plastic tray.  Here is a microSD slot.  A wide indicator light is located above the screen, near the speaker grid.  It is capable of flashing green, red and blue.  The indicator can be easily turned off if you wish, but it gives the device an additional charm, very in the spirit of Sony Style.  The front surface has placed the front camera, while the proximity sensor is hidden under the glass and it is so easy not to see it. </p>

    <p>  Build quality is excellent.  The screen uses Triluminos technology.  She suggests that the image has better coverage than LCD screens.  Green and red subpixels are created using phosphorus, making the colors look more saturated.  An unusual method of image analysis is used in the device, each point is able to change the brightness level of the backlight, thus, a more reliable image is formed under various lighting conditions.  Wide settings are provided.  The manufacturer has provided a twenty percent margin of brightness in comparison with the usual maximum indicator of this characteristic.  Information is read with ease, the screen is perfectly perceived on the street and indoors.  Thanks to the special settings, you can work with the device with wet hands or gloves.
