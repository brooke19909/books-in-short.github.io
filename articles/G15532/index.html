    <h2>  Phuket, Kata Beach Area: Features </h2><p>  This third most popular area in Phuket (after Patong and Karon) is traditionally divided into three parts.  Kata-Yai is a party district with nightlife, clubs and discos.  The beaches here are also crowded, with developed infrastructure, often filled with surfers and divers.  But the Kata Noi district, next to which is the Baan Vanida Garden Resort Karon 3 * hotel (Phuket), is quite quiet and calm.  It is perfect for families with children.  Nightlife is almost non-existent here.  Not far from the beach is the so-called "Dinopark".  This is a golf course with life-size sculptures of prehistoric animals.  People come here not only to play, but also to take a walk, especially with children who are only happy to be in this Jurassic Park.  Moreover, the dinosaurs are very realistic.  There are several markets on Katya, including nightly.  So, although there is less entertainment here than in Patong, tourists are not bored.  Travelers from the Russian Federation often relax here, so you can find signs in Russian everywhere.  And a kilometer from Kata, on a high hill, is the famous statue of the so-called Big Buddha, which can be seen even from the beach.  Sightseeing tours in Phuket specially bring tourists to look at it.  Nearby is the Wat Chalong Temple, where you can meditate, chat with the monks, and also tell fortunes for the future. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baan Vanida Garden Resort Karon 3" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2104792.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  Hotel Baan Vanida Garden Resort 3 * is located on the second line.  To the beach "Karon" from her walk about ten minutes.  Get a little longer to Kata Beach.  The first often has waves.  The second is better to relax with children.  But tourists claim that the "singing" the smallest sand of "Karon" can not be compared with anything.  However, the <span>"Kata" beach is</span> very clean.  The sand is white, good water and excellent infrastructure.  There are many casuarine trees under which you can hide from the sun.  Many sun loungers for rent at 100 butts (200 rubles) per day.  They belong to local bars, so if you want something to drink or have a meal, the waiters will bring you all this directly to the beach.  The most affordable restaurants - with real seafood - are located on the southern coast.  There is also a bar where Ska night parties are held.  It is built around a huge tree, and its doors open directly to the beach.  Kata is not only a beautiful place, but also suitable for entertainment.  Towels for sunbathing are issued at the reception.  The hotel also has an outdoor pool with jacuzzi.  There are sun loungers on the terrace.  It is very cozy and has a homely atmosphere.  There is a water massage and rain shower.  In the evenings, poolside parties can be arranged. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  If you have already arrived in Phuket, then you should not sit all day even in such a cozy hotel as Baan Vanida Garden Resort 3 *.  Reviews assure that you can get excellent excursions at local travel agencies, so your trip will be not only entertaining, but also informative.  First of all, these are walks on the islands of the Andaman Sea, where you can get acquainted with cave temples, where monkeys live, visit the villages of local pearl hunters on stilts, admire the bizarre cliffs that wash the waves.  A lot of time is given for swimming and relaxing on a beautiful landscaped beach.  You can also visit the mysterious islands of the neighboring province of Krabi with its fabulous nature.  But the most popular destination from Phuket is the Phang Nga region.  It was in these places that the famous film from the series about agent James Bond was shot.  Such excursions usually take all day.  But there are longer trips, for 2-3 days, for example, to the Similan Islands.  A Phuket sightseeing tour is most fun to do on motorbikes with a personal guide.  So one day you can go around the most beautiful places, see the best beaches and swim in the waterfalls. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Baan Vanida Garden Resort 3 Phuket Thailand" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/2104800.jpg"></div>
