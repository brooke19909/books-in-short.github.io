According to reviews, this is one of the most amazing places in the suburbs.  At the moment, the institution has the status of a park hotel, has all the relevant permissions to receive and service guests. </p><h2>  general description </h2><p>  The history of the Ershovo holiday home is of particular interest to admirers of everything ancient and mysterious.

The estate was a dowry of Maria Vasilyevna Saltykova, which became the property of her husband Adam Vasilyevich Olsufiev.  From then on and until the collapse of the Russian Empire, Ershovo remained a clan count nest. </p><p>  In 1829, the nobles took the initiative to build a stone Temple of the Life-Giving Trinity.  In its place was a dilapidated wooden church.  The construction was financed by a family of noble Olsufievs.  By 1837, construction work on the construction of the manor house came to an end.  The main building of CJSC Ershovo Rest House is the very building in which the landowners lived.  It has been preserved almost unchanged. </p><p>  The church and the house of the nobles were built according to the projects of the outstanding architect of that time, a native of serfs A.G. Grigoriev.  His name is often mentioned in conjunction with the name of the mentor - the famous architect Gilardi. </p><p>  The estate was threatened with destruction in the fall of 1941.  The territory of the village of Ershovo was on the front line when the Nazis planned an attack on Moscow.  The period of the Great Patriotic War is the saddest page in the history of the holiday home: on the lands of the village one of the borders passed - the stopping place of the fascist invaders. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Two years later, JV Stalin ordered the creation of a special laboratory, which was supposed to operate under the personal supervision of L.P. Beria.  The field of activity of its employees was limited by theoretical developments in the field of creating weapons of mass destruction - the atomic bomb. </p><p>  This department was top-secret.  At first it received the name "State Committee", and later became known as the Ministry of Secondary Engineering.  In the post-war period, trade union organizations began to protect the rights of workers, including Sredmash.  Trade unions represented the interests of the proletariat, including workers engaged in professional activities in the country's nuclear industry.  These specialists lived and worked in difficult conditions, they had to stay in classified cities for a long time, work in underground departments, and were in constant contact with radiation.  It is no coincidence that one of the first decisions of the trade unions was the creation of a network of medical and sanatorium and resort institutions for the rehabilitation of employees in industrial, military and research industries. </p><p>  One of the places in which it was proposed to organize a subordinate health resort was the Olsufyevs estate in the Odintsovo district.  The rest house "Ershovo" was to the liking and leadership of this project. </p><p>  The opening date of the health resort is January 18, 1952.  The staff of the park hotel celebrate it every year, considering it the birthday of the Ershovo holiday home.  On this day, vacationers came here for the first time - employees of the same secret laboratory, people who worked on the creation of the first Soviet atomic bomb and the USSR nuclear reactor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Entertainment and leisure </h2><p>  As already noted, the country park hotel is 40 km from the capital, <span>in the Odintsovo district.</span>  Rest House "Ershovo" is located to the west of the Moscow Ring Road.

The highlight of the standard and deluxe rooms is the summer terrace, where you can admire the local scenery.  However, not everyone was satisfied with the room equipment.  Most dissatisfied reviews can be found about economy class rooms. </p><h2>  Meals at the holiday home </h2><p> Holders of permits to the park-hotel "Ershovo" offer meals according to the "buffet".  It implies the simultaneous presentation of many dishes on a huge table.  Food is sorted out by guests at will, as at a buffet table.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are fully included.

Even after a few days in the rest house "Ershovo" you can recover to return to the gray weekdays with renewed vigor. </p><h2>  Medical services </h2><p>  Initially, the rest house "Ershovo" was created as a sanatorium.

Some guests write that they are satisfied with absolutely everything: they liked the location of the boarding house, and food, and the surrounding nature, and pricing, and excursions.  Many flattering reviews are devoted to picturesque landscapes in the boundless territory of the complex.  In general, people describe their stay in a hotel with positive emotions. </p><p>  To enjoy the atmosphere of an old manor and take a break from the bustle of Moscow, you need to go here for at least a week.  Only this will allow a complete reboot.  Vacationers prefer walks in the forested area, swimming in the pool, as well as entertainment for every taste - from ATVs to paintball.  The boarding house has enough space for children - they have at their disposal numerous playgrounds. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.personalguide.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="zao rest house yershovo" class="if uuid-2755128" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40315/2755128.jpg"></div><p>  There are other comments.  Most of all the indignation of the guests of the hotel in Ershovo is caused by two main points: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, this is an unsatisfactory condition of the number of rooms.  If you believe the reviews of people, then those photos of the rest house "Ershovo" that are presented on the official website have little to do with reality.  For example, in standard and economy rooms, guests complain about the lack of decoration, holes in the floor, bent mattresses from which springs stick out, old plumbing and strong audibility in the rooms. </li><li>  Secondly, these are problems with the organization of catering.  There is no order in the dining room, despite the current buffet system.  Cleaning dishes, guests say, during breakfast, lunch and dinner is not carried out.  No one is hungry here, of course, but you should not count on a varied menu. </li></ul><p>  Despite the existing shortcomings, the Ershovo holiday home remains a very popular destination for Muscovites and residents of nearby Moscow suburbs.  Undoubtedly, here you need to visit those who want to break out of the usual bustle of the metropolis, breathe clean air and feel like a real count. </p>
