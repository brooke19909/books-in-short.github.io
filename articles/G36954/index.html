It is worth choosing a strong, whole tank. </li><li>  Glue gun, PVA glue. </li><li>  Scissors, a simple pencil, a ruler. </li><li>  A cut of fabric or wallpaper. </li><li>  Wide tape. </li></ul><p>  Additionally, you need to take rags to remove glue residue, old newspapers.  To simplify the process of gluing the box, you can use a special roller or plastic plate.  It is advisable to take clothespins that will press the fabric to the base in the gluing process. </p><h2>  Features of the manufacture of the organizer </h2><p>  First you need to process the body of the future product.  The best option will be gluing the box with a cloth or wallpaper.  Additionally, other decorative elements can be used.  The box for sewing accessories needs to be well trimmed from the outside: </p><ol><li>  It is necessary to prepare a pattern on a fabric cloth or wallpaper.  Measure the length and height of the walls, take measurements from the bottom of the box.  Transfer measurements to the canvas.  It is worth making an allowance of several centimeters. </li><li>  If the box is glossy, you need to peel off the slippery coating.  This can be done with a knife and a damp cloth.  Make tears, soak and continue to remove the coating. </li><li>  When the box dries, it is good to lubricate the surface with PVA glue.  Glue the pattern, smoothing the air bubbles and wrinkles.  Remove glue residue.  Wrap the upper tabs inside the box and glue with a glue gun. </li><li>  Cut strips from the base material so wide that they cover the corners of the box.

Get a kind of lamination, which will allow for a long time to maintain the color and integrity of the decorative coating. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  How can I organize the interior space inside the casket </h2><p>  The principle of organizing the internal space depends on which tools will be stored in the box.  But there are universal elements that should be present in the box for sewing accessories: </p><ul><li>  Compartment for storing needles, which is then equipped with a more durable and lockable container. </li><li>  You can make room for vertical fixation of the coils.

The more magnets mounted around the perimeter, the better. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.marthastewart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="organizer for sewing supplies" class="if uuid-3173832" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3173832.jpg"></div><p>  The box must be tightly closed.  It is advisable to stick the box cover on textile tapes to the body.  You can choose an interesting decorative deadbolt or latch.  On the inside lid you can form textile pockets with connectors and fasteners. </p><h2>  Why is it better to make organizers yourself </h2><p>  A self-made box for sewing accessories is more functional and practical than a purchased analog: </p><ul><li>  A home-made copy can be equipped in accordance with its configuration. </li><li>  For finishing, quality materials can be used. </li><li>  You can think of a ‚Äúsecurity system‚Äù device. </li><li>  The decorative arrangement is thought out independently. </li><li>  You can make handy handles, hooks or compartments that will definitely not be available in store options. </li><li>  The cost of a homemade sewing box is much less, since the materials used are mostly used. </li><li>  Homemade organizers operate much longer than the purchased options. </li></ul><p>  In addition to all the advantages of a homemade organizer, there is also pleasure, which is associated with the process of manual work. </p><h2>  What materials can be used to make the internal structure </h2><p>  It is desirable to equip the boxes for storing sewing accessories so that each part remains in place during transportation.
