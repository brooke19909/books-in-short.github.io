    <h2>  Who is she, kikimora swamp? </h2><p>  In order to understand exactly what a kikimora costume should be, you need to get to know this fabulous character closer and highlight its features and distinguishing features. </p><ul><li>  First of all, this is hair - it should be long and green.  However, this does not mean that you need to color your own curls.  But more on that later. </li><li>  The kikimora costume should contain the appropriate robe.  It can be a long dress or a skirt with a T-shirt and a kind of mesh cape, with which scraps of thread hang (like seaweed). </li><li>  Particular attention should be paid to shoes - for kikimory it is definitely bast shoes. </li><li>  To complete the image, you should think about the accessories of the swamp theme.  Bracelets and necklaces with pendants made of beads of different calibers - what you need! </li></ul><p>  All these elements should contain both an adult kikimora costume and a children's one.  But what they will be - it already depends on the imagination. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  What to make hair from </h2><p>  The easiest way is to buy a wig, but in fact, those accessories that are on sale are not quite suitable for creating the image we need, since the strands in them are too silky and shiny.  And if we are preparing a kikimora costume for a girl, then it should be noted that the child will not be very comfortable and comfortable dancing in a wig under the Christmas tree, especially if his own hair is long and thick.  An excellent way out in this situation is <span>overhead locks</span> on the clamps, which are quite realistic to do on their own.  For this purpose, you will need a <span>sanitary flax,</span> the fiber structure of which is excellent for the role of kikimorin hair.  You can buy it at any hardware store.  This material can be painted with absolutely any paint or even green paint.  The strands before painting should be divided and boiled separately for 2-3 minutes in a solution with paint.  Then the fibers are rinsed and dried. </p><h2>  How to make hairpins with locks </h2><p>  When the flax dries well, they begin to form a lock.  The long fiber is folded in half and attached to the thread with a bundle or in any other convenient way.  The thread should be filled with strands along the entire length of the hairpin, after which the workpiece is attached with hot glue to the clamp.  For this purpose, you should choose good tight "crocodiles" that will not crawl through the hair under the weight of artificial "curls".  There can be 5-10 such hairpins, depending on the desired result.  In this way, you can make a luxurious green head of hair, which perfectly complements the kikimora costume for the New Year.  Clips are attached to the roots of the hair, which makes the hairstyle look very organic and natural. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Clothing for the image of kikimory </h2><p>  As already mentioned, the kikimora costume can be represented by a dress, a skirt with a T-shirt or trousers with a cape.  And in each case it is very important to choose the right fabric.  Pants and a T-shirt are best sewn from knitwear, for example, from velor or supplex.  These materials have an attractive appearance and stretch well, which will make the suit tight-fitting.  A mesh, which can also be bought at a fabric store, is good for a wrap.  It can be a silver or gold mesh interspersed with boucle.  For the cape, you will need a cut in two lengths, which will need to be folded in half and cut a hole for the head.  A ragged edge can be made along the perimeter of the mesh by adding a couple of cuts for greater suit effectiveness. </p>

    <h2>  How to sew a skirt </h2><p>  Sewing a spectacular kikimora costume with your own hands is easy!  A multilayer <span>skirt of tulle,</span> mesh, organza and satin will be very useful here.  In order to do it, you will need square rags that are superimposed on each other, shifting the corners, the segments are fixed in the center and a circle is drawn that is equal to the contour of the waist + 6-8 cm. Next, an elastic band of the appropriate length is sewn.  To prevent tissue sections from fraying, they should be overcast. </p><p>  The skirt can also be sewn in a simpler way.  Cut a strip of fabric of the desired length.  As for the width, it should be equal to 3-4 girth of the hips.  First, the side seam is sewn, then the bottom of the product is processed, and the top is tuned inside-out so that a hole for threading the elastic is obtained.  To make such a skirt look interesting, you should choose a beautiful fabric for it that drapes well.  And to keep her shape, we recommend making a tulle petticoat. </p><h2>  How to sew a dress </h2><p>  The kikimora costume for the <span>New Year</span> may consist of a dress and a wrap of mesh.  To open a dress for a <span>children's costume, you</span> will need a child‚Äôs t-shirt, which is circled along the contour, and lateral seams in the form of a trapezoid with such a base so that the baby can easily walk in it are removed from the armpits.  Also outline the sleeves along the contour and cut out the details. </p><p>  The dress can be with a detachable skirt - folded or tiered.  To make it, you need rectangular cuts of fabric, which are collected by a basting seam and sewn to the yoke. </p><p>  For the top of the dress, it is best to take a knitted fabric.  It is easier to work with, it does not require any special fit and fits perfectly on the figure.  But for a skirt, you can choose a more interesting fabric, for example, with sequins or embossed flowers.  To skirt was magnificent and well kept in shape, you will need a tulle petticoat.  The strip is sewn into smaller sections and collected at the top for elastic, and several tiers of frills are set up at the bottom to provide the desired volume.  It should be remembered that the main skirt should be slightly wider so that it fits beautifully on the petticoat. </p>

    <h2>  How to cut pants and a t-shirt </h2><p>  In order to sew a kikimora costume with your own hands, you will need a child's clothing that is suitable in size, according to which patterns are made.  It can be leggings and a blouse with a long sleeve.  The clothes are turned inside out, applied to the wrong side of the fabric, outlined with chalk or a tailor‚Äôs pencil and cut out.  To reshoot the pattern of leggings, one leg should be inserted into another and begin to circle the product from the step seam, rising up to the midline, then up and down to the side seam.  According to this principle, the front and back halves of the legs are outlined, allowances are added and details are cut out. </p>

    <p>  The t-shirt is circled along the contour, outlining the neck, armholes for the sleeves, which are also re-lifted and cut separately. </p><p>  After the details are sewn together, the top of the panties is turned inside out to make a drawstring for the elastic. </p><h2>  How to make bast shoes </h2><p>  What is a kikimora wading costume without bast shoes?  It is this detail that will bring a special charm to the image.  The bast shoes can be crocheted from thick yarn or knitted fabric of a suitable color cut into strips.  Since our character is Kikimore, it is best to opt for a green or yellow hue. </p><p>  So, they crochet a chain of 10 air loops and knit in a circle until the sole of the desired size is ready.  In this case, every second column should be tied out from one link of the lower chain.  After the sole is ready, you need to knit the height of the bast shoes (approximately 2-3 cm).  Next, the sock is tied, closing it from above.  In the middle of the top of the heel, a ribbon or chain made of the same fabric is wound directly into the canvas and secured.  The length of these ties should be approximately 60 cm (each rope) so that they can braid the child‚Äôs leg and tie a bow under the knee. </p><h2>  Accessories for the image of kikimory </h2><p>  How to make Kikimora costume even more interesting?  Of course, adding accessories.  Long beads of large green beads entwined around the neck, a bandage on the head with a rubber frog or a large hat with a veil, a belt with hanging leaves and threads in the form of algae, bracelets with long pendants that will hang playfully with their arms raised - all these elements will come to life and complement the image.  No matter how you create a Kikimora costume with your own hands (photos of several robes are presented in this article), it can be an excellent source of ideas and inspiration.  Thanks to them, it will be possible to create a unique, harmonious and, most importantly, spectacular outfit that will appeal to the child and his friends. </p>
