    <h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  <span>Given the remoteness of the Sherwood Forest residential complex from the capital, the issue of transport accessibility is relevant.</span>  <span>The road is perhaps the main drawback of the complex.</span>  <span>Residents note that you can get to the place only by an SUV, and public transport so far only goes to the nearest village.</span>  <span>This feature should be taken into account when planning the purchase of an apartment or townhouse here.</span> </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  <span>Residential complex "Sherwood Forest" is not a holiday village, but a small town among the forest, intended for permanent residence.</span>  <span>That is why there is nothing strange in the fact that every potential resident wants to know what infrastructure facilities he will receive.</span>  <span>The remoteness from the capital in this case is offset by its own infrastructure.</span>  <span>Of course, the project provides for the construction of shops, pharmacies, even a bank branch and a fitness center will appear.</span>  <span>The developer paid great attention to the organization of the recreation area: here there will be excellent playgrounds and sports grounds, a beach <span>area, a barbecue area</span> and walks.</span>  <span>Of course, the developer is not going to stop there: he plans to build a stunning outdoor sports complex with bike paths and ski slopes.</span>  <span>The project provides for the construction of a kindergarten, school and even a hospital, but this will not be in the very near future.</span>  <span>That is why at the initial stage it is necessary to come to terms with some inconveniences.</span> </p>

    <h2>  Construction stages </h2><p>  <span>The Sherwood Forest complex is a large-scale project, the name of which is well known to many Muscovites.</span>  <span>It involves the construction of low-rise houses and townhouses, while being long-term.</span>  <span>The object is being leased in stages, and most of the apartments and townhouses were purchased at the stage of preparation of the site, which, of course, gave rise to a number of doubts.</span>  <span>There are enough reviews on this topic on the respective portals.</span>  <span>It is clear from them that the company employs real professionals, truly qualified employees who are aimed at the satisfaction of each client.</span>  <span>That is why they do not interfere, but, on the contrary, offer to track every stage of construction: pouring the foundation, erecting walls, installing the roof, and making communications.</span>  <span>So, all those who took an active part and controlled the construction of their own home, note that the construction technology itself and the quality of the materials used were pleasantly pleased.</span>  <span>It is nice that the developer puts detailed photo reports with comments for those who can not independently come to the object.</span> </p><h2>  Price policy </h2><p>  <span>In fact, LCD "Sherwood Forest" is the dream of many.</span>  <span>At the current time, the project is under construction, and real estate on its territory can be purchased on very favorable terms.</span>  <span>A one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 square meters will cost only 1,800,000 rubles.</span>  <span>A spacious townhouse from 80 square meters costs from 3,500,000 rubles.</span>  <span>These are real prices for comfort-class housing, located not just in a picturesque, but in an <span>ecologically clean area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Moscow Region.</span></span> </p>
