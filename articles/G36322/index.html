    <h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  There are several options: </p><ol><li>  Personal vehicles on the highway Novorizhskoe.  About 4 km to the turn to the city of Krasnogorsk, then - Ilyinskoye highway.  Further, almost 500 m to the <span>first traffic light,</span> turn left (this is Zavodskaya street).  Another 300 meters, and here it is (on the right) - LCD "South". </li><li>  Also by personal transport, but along Volokolamsk highway.  About 4 km, then turn left (Pochtovaya street), then go straight ahead 2 km, turn right into Zavodskaya street and after 300 m (on the right) - the complex. </li><li>  By public transport: </li></ol><ul><li>  From the railway station  Leningradskaya (metro station Voikovskaya). </li><li>  From the railway station  Riga (metro station Riga). </li><li>  From the railway station  Tushino (metro station Tushinskaya). </li><li>  From the railway station  Dmitrovskaya (metro station Dmitrovskaya). </li></ul><p>  To the railway station Pavshino.  Then take a minibus (No. 41, 31, 49, and 858) or a bus (No. 824, 520, 34, and 891) to the Pavshinsky Mechanical Plant stop (the trip lasts about five minutes).  Then about the same amount of walking along the street.  Factory to the complex. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  By the way, from Pavshino station you can get to the Riga station. </p><p>  Buses and minibuses go to the capital from Krasnogorsk.  Experts believe that the transport issue in Krasnogorsk is solved very well.  And I want to believe them. </p><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  Buyers of apartments in the Yuzhny residential complex in Krasnogorsk will live in a southern, well-equipped area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city.  Here, within walking distance, such infrastructure facilities as a kindergarten, gymnasium, school, supermarkets (Magnit, Pyaterochka), chain stores (Lenta, Globus and Leroy Merlin), shopping and entertainment centers (including one of the most popular is Vegas, as well as ALGO), fitness centers.  In the center of the city there are well-established shopping centers Krasnogorsk RAIPO, PASSAGE, Oyster mushroom, etc. </p><p>  Not without pride, the developer reports about the well-known ski resort "SNEZH.KOM", which is located nearby.  Gorka Fitness Club invites you to get in shape.  In addition, not far from the Yuzhny residential complex there is a well-equipped embankment of the Moscow River and the Birch Grove park.  Also in this part of the city there is the Krasnogorsk city park, the Opalikhovsky forest park and the Gubailovsky forest park.  There are also many reservoirs: <span>Ivanovo ponds,</span> the Sinichka and Banka rivers.  And Zavodskaya street itself is buried in verdure.  Its main drawback is two-lane car traffic.  Therefore, travel under it is often difficult, especially in the evenings.  After all, residents of nearby houses park right on the roadway. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Medical care is available at Children's Clinic No. 2 and the Municipal Hospital for Adults No. 2. </p>

    <p>  The whole family can have a tasty meal in the following restaurants: Yuzhny Grad, Golden Horseshoe and Pearl.  Pizzeria ‚Äúat TIGI‚Äù invites you to grab a bite to eat, and the She Vero club will relax after a hard week. </p><p>  The inner territory of the residential complex has many green spaces.  Sports and playgrounds are already open here.  The first floors of the building are non-residential.  Commercial premises are located in them and a children's clinic will open a little later.  The plans of the developer LCD "South" in Krasnogorsk five-level parking.  But for now, residents are offered to use free parking at a five-minute walk. </p><p>  It seems that everything is enough, but the load on social objects is significant.  On the one hand, future residents are pleased with the children's clinic planned in the complex.  Adults have to get to their health facility for more than five kilometers.  The school, although large, is still one in the entire district.  There is not so far one more, but the children go into it, making a big hook.  For between the house under construction and the school is an industrial zone.  Not all parents are satisfied with the situation. </p><h2>  Neighbors </h2><p>  The new building, on the one hand, borders on a plant for the production of building materials and machine-building production, on the other hand, on Zavodskaya street and residential high-rise buildings.  And despite the large number of <span>parks, the ecological</span> situation is estimated by experts as contradictory (it depends on the direction of the wind, the amount of precipitation, etc.). </p><p>  A few hundred meters from the residential complex there is a railway, as well as constantly congested highways: Ilinsky highway, Novorizhskoye, Volokolamskoye and MKAD. </p><h2>  Apartments and layout </h2><p>  One, two and three bedroom apartments with a high level of comfort.  A significant advantage is also a small pantry, even in one-bedroom apartments. </p><p>  The apartments are sold ready-made for finishing, with a cement-sand screed and outlines of partitions in one brick.  They are finished only in the bathroom.  Ceiling height (before finishing) - 2.8 m. All loggias are glazed ‚Äúto the floor‚Äù.  They also have floor heating and electricity.  Each apartment has two-chamber double-glazed windows, heating radiators with temperature regulators and water meters. </p><p>  Installed in apartments and doors, but this is a construction option.  The developer of Progress LLC offers customers to contact the partners of the company and order a fine finish.  On average, it costs 8,000 rubles per square. </p>

    <h2>  One-room apartments </h2><p>  By the way, they are in the complex the most.  But the option of their layouts vary.  There are very similar to the so-called studios, others are more comfortable with a separate ten-meter kitchen and a large loggia.  An interesting option is a one-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãalmost 50 m2 with a dressing room, a spacious hall and a loggia. </p><p>  But most of all, the ‚Äúodnushka‚Äù with a corner loggia of 9.5 meters is most popular.

    <h2>  The progress of the construction of the residential complex "South" Krasnogorsk </h2><p>  Experts call this project long-playing.  The building permit was obtained in early spring 2009.  They promise to launch the turn into operation in the second quarter of next year.  The first two have been populated for a long time.  Residents do not express complaints or negative reviews about the Yuzhny residential complex in Krasnogorsk on forums.  Therefore, it is possible to evaluate the work of the builder as satisfactory.  But we must keep in mind that Progress LLC is not in the list of leading regional developers.  Therefore, buyers should carefully study their offers. </p><p>  Now, regarding the construction of the third stage of the South directly.  It took a lot of time for the developer to resettle the tenants from the old apartment building and to demolish it.  Now, the work has almost reached the planned targets, and it seems that the construction will be completed on time.  But optimism in this case should be restrained.  The point is the customer of the complex.  This is MosStroyMehanizatsiya-5 (MSM-5).  The media have repeatedly written about the problems of this company.  What, for example, is one of the brightly advertised objects of the MSM-5 - LCD Red Hills in the same Krasnogorsk.  The deadlines for this residential complex have changed several times.  Therefore, you should not rule out a similar scenario with the third stage of the "South". </p>
