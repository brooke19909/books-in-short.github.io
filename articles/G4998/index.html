The same children's airplane is an <span>origami</span> product <span>.</span>  <span>The history of</span> craftsmanship spans several hundred years and has become a particle of Japanese culture.  Making unusual figures is akin to solving puzzles.  Origami is not only an excellent educational game for children and adults, but also a source of flight of engineering, as well as an inspiration for architecture design.  The construction of unusual shapes from paper has turned into a separate type of art, the products created by modern masters look so intricate.  Today, many directions are known, but the most amazing are the figures of Kusudam and origami from triangles (modular). </p><p>  Often there are objects of kusadama - these are voluminous bodies of a spherical shape made of <span>paper flowers.</span>  Ancient Japanese used this origami to treat people.  They put medicinal herbs and substances inside the figures, and then hung the kusadama over the patient‚Äôs bed.  It is based on a <span>regular polyhedron,</span> usually a cube, an icosahedron or a dodecahedron.  Less common are models whose platform contains semi-regular polyhedrons.  Such figures are very complex and laborious to manufacture.  Unlike the origami of triangles, the constituent elements of kusudama are not built into each other, but are fixed with glue and even simply sewn together with threads.  Today, any spherical paper objects are called kusudama. </p><p>  Modular, or in another way it is called origami from triangles, is a fashionable direction of the ancient art of making figures from paper.  Unlike traditional origami, this technique consists in making crafts not from one paper sheet, but from many identical elements - modules.  Each individual part is formed according to the laws of classical origami, and then they are connected by inserting one element into another.  As a result, an <span>elastic force</span> appears <span>,</span> which does not allow the structure to collapse.  The absence of restrictions on the number of modules makes it easy to create large models with a diverse complex structure. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Individual parts can be folded independently even by young children, and there are an infinite number of options for various compounds.  With a flick of the wrist, birds, animals, dragons, plants, castles and ships are made of modules, in general, everything that is enough for imagination.  In addition, any paper, even old newspapers or magazines, is suitable for origami from triangles.  <span>Crafts from modules</span> can be built by a group of several people or the whole family. </p><p>  Modular origami consists of many identical parts, which can have a different type.  This distinguishes origami from triangles, the schemes of which are rather intricate, from a more general form - multi-sheeted, where the identity of the elements does not play an important role.  In complex volume-modular products without the use of glue and other means for connecting the elements can not do.  Only in simple cases when drawing up flat products, Sonobe cubes, the modules can hold fast enough due to the friction force.  But in the production of flat panels of origami, which includes hundreds, and sometimes thousands of elements, without glue it will be difficult. </p><p>  Depending on the type of connection of the modules, one or another figure is obtained.  Triangular origami models are both flat and three-dimensional.  The first type is represented by polygons, they are called coasters, rings, turntables, stars.  The second - regular polyhedra and their composite compositions. </p><p>  Before you make an origami triangle, you need to decide on the design and calculate the number of elements.  Schemes, models of figures, as well as technologies for their creation are widely represented on sites on the network. </p>
