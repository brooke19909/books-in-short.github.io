    <p>  Pedro Lopez was born in Colombia, in the small town of Santa Isabel.  He was born in 1948. </p><p>  His future biography was largely determined by how his childhood passed.  He does not remember his father, and his mother was a prostitute.  He had 12 more brothers and sisters.  The sex life of Pedro Lopez began at an early age.  The boy was only 8 years old.  Moreover, his first partner was a sister.  He claims that this first sex was in agreement, but many researchers in his biography doubt this fact.  The mother found them behind the act of intercourse, driving Lopez out of the house. </p><p>  Then, as the maniac himself said, he was taken hostage by a pedophile who kept him locked up in his house and regularly raped him.  Sometimes not alone, but with friends.  Often rented it for a while to other perverts. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only months later did Pedro escape.  He was sheltered by a married couple from America, who was trying to guide the boy on the true path.  They sent him to a school for orphans.  But here he again became a victim of sexual abuse.  When he was only 12 years old, he was raped by a teacher.  Lopez escaped from school.  Until adulthood, he wandered, interrupted by petty thefts and regular car thefts. </p><p>  A few years later, he and his friends tracked down a pedophile who was brutally avenged.  He was skinned.  The same fate befell some of his friends.  Moreover, Lopez raped both the owner himself and several men who regularly visited him as clients. </p><h2>  First trial </h2>

    <p>  Such a big story could not go unnoticed.  Pedro Lopez and his comrades were detained by the police.  Despite the fact that he himself became a victim, he was decided to be tried for several murders committed by him in the house where pedophiles abused him. </p><p>  At the same time, the court showed condescension to a teenager who also had a difficult and difficult childhood.  For several murders committed, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison. </p><p>  In prison, he had to overcome new challenges.  An 18-year-old teenager was repeatedly raped, in the most cruel way.  As a result, he had to kill three of his abusers.  Thus, Alonso Lopez Pedro was able to suppress further attacks on his body. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  From prison he went pissed off at the whole world, which he considered guilty of his troubles and misfortunes. </p><h2>  First killings </h2>

    <p>  What is noteworthy, Lopez was released into freedom with anger precisely on women, and not on men.  Although it was men who brought him the lion's share of suffering in life.  Perhaps his mother played a role, who, working on the panel, did not actually deal with children, leaving them to themselves.  Because of this, many of them had a bad luck. </p><p>  As a result, Pedro Alonso Lopez, whose biography was now associated with sexual killings, moved to Peru.  Here they did not know him at all.  Therefore, with impunity, he opened a real hunt for peasant women.  Mostly young.  Often minors.  He abducted them, took them away from the village in which they lived, raped him for a long time, often in a perverted form, and then simply killed him. </p><p>  He buried the bodies of his victims in the same place.  Thus, he was able to greatly facilitate the task of investigators who sorted out all the details of these crimes.  The serial criminal was caught by the locals who handed him over to the police.  This happened in 1978, when Lopez was 30 years old.  By that time, the list of his victims already totaled about a hundred people. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Latin America Travels </h2>

    <p>  Photos of Pedro Lopez at that time hit the front pages of newspapers.  Everyone was shocked by his cruelty.  However, the local police conducted an investigation so sluggish that he managed to escape.  And more than law enforcement, he was afraid of representatives of local criminal clans who were outraged that the stranger was stealing and raping girls in their territory. </p><p>  Lopez went first to Colombia, and then to Ecuador. </p><h2>  Taboo maniac </h2>

    <p>  At the same time, Lopez did not even think to lie down and calm down for a while.  He continued to commit his bloody crimes.  Moreover, despite the almost complete insanity, the maniac had a certain taboo, which he had never violated.  He never killed Columbia.  So the next victims of Lopez were girls from Ecuador. </p><p>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Many were struck by the frequency with which Pedro Lopez dealt with his victims.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">The statistics are just shocking.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">He killed about three girls a week.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">In Ecuador, he switched from women and young girls to very young girls, whom he also abducted, brutally raped and killed.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">Most often choked.</span>  <span data-mce-mark="1">At that time, his victims were mostly minors - from 7 to 18 years.</span> </p><h2>  The arrest of the rapist </h2>

    <p>  Lopez was arrested in Ecuador only in 1980.  One of his victims managed to escape from the hands of the tormentor and escape.  A few days later she reported to the police, providing detailed descriptions of the offender.  They came for Lopez.  He did not deny his guilt.  On the contrary, he began to actively talk about his atrocities, which he considered feats. </p><p>  According to some reports, he directly told investigators: "I killed 300 pieces of these whores."  At first, the police simply did not believe him.  Therefore, he began to give more detailed and detailed testimonies.  Showing the places of crimes and graves in which he hid his victims.  It turned out that he even has his own so-called private cemetery, on which lie the bodies of most of the girls and girls killed by him. </p><p>  Only in one of the investigative experiments in which he participated were the remains of fifty bodies discovered.  All of South America was shocked by police reports.  Each new message shocked people. </p><p>  At the same time, many argue that Pedro Lopez is a maniac who was proud of his popularity.  He was particularly flattered that the journalists gave him the nickname "Monster of the Andes."  In the course of numerous interrogations, as well as interviews that various newspapers and magazines took from him, an interesting fact was revealed.  Lopez was almost completely illiterate.  But even this did not stop him from telling about his crimes. </p><p>  After talking with several correspondents, he began to tell the story of his adventures.  He began to give a whole theory of why he began to kill.  And put forward several versions at once.  One at a time, the main blame was placed on his mother, who led a bad life.  He also increasingly recalled his first sexual experience with his sister, and sometimes got into lengthy discussions about the very act of bloodthirsty murder. </p><h2>  The trial of a maniac </h2>

    <p>  The Lopez case went to court.  It turned out a remarkable fact: the maximum possible punishment in this country was only 20 years.  He received this maximum term.  But what his further fate was is not known for certain. </p><p>  According to one version, after spending 16 years in a Peruvian prison, he was transferred to a special hospital in Colombia.  Such an indulgence was made to him for exemplary behavior and active cooperation with the investigation.  There he spent the remaining time. </p><p>  According to other sources, he was sent from Peru to Ecuador, where the death penalty was practiced.  According to some reports, he was sentenced to death and shot.  However, there is no official confirmation of this version.  Many in Latin America are convinced that in the late 90s Lopez was released from prison without becoming advertised.  He is still alive and continues to kill.  They say that he is either in Ecuador, or in the United States. </p><h2>  World record </h2><p>  The number of victims of the Latin American maniac was so huge that he was included in the Guinness Book of Records as the most productive serial killer.  His involvement in more than 300 crimes has been proven. </p><p>  In detail, the story of Pedro Alonso Lopez in the film "Biography" is demonstrated. </p>
