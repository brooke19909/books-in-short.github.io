  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Enlightened absolutism of Catherine II</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The transition from feudalism to capitalism in many countries took place against the background of the emergence of the ideology of the Enlightenment.  In Russia, this period fell on the 60s of the XVIII century - the time of the reign of Catherine the Great. </p><p>  Enlightened absolutism is a monarchical rule based on the ideology of the Enlightenment.  Its main ideas were as follows: a person is the highest value, his interests are above state;  people are equal in rights regardless of estates;  society needs to be improved, and science and legislation should play a major role in this.  In light of all this, the idea of ​​a “philosopher on the throne” has become popular. </p><p>  <span>Enlightened absolutism of</span> Catherine was characterized by events in the interests of the state itself and the ruling class (nobles).  They contributed to the development of capitalism in the camp, but at the same time did not take into account many realities of the life of society at that time. </p><p>  Already in the first days of her reign, Catherine made a number of trips around the country (Rostov, Yaroslavl, the Baltic provinces; drove along the Ladoga Canal, then along the Volga to Simbirsk).  Then she realized that the culture of the people was too low and hastened to “darn the sharp management gaps” (Klyuchevsky). </p><p>  Enlightened absolutism of Catherine, historians called the "Golden Age".  The empress strove to ensure the development of the life of Russian society in an evolutionary way, under the supervision of a "popular" monarch.  However, she did not want to change the social structure: the empire flourished due to the labor of the <span>serfs</span> and workers, and the throne relied on the nobility, which was the main bastion of absolutism. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The idea of ​​what to do for the prosperity of the state, the empress developed on the basis of ideas gleaned from the works of European enlighteners. </p><p>  Catherine tried to neutralize the country's most unpleasant “legacy of past regimes”.  She restored and strengthened the state bodies that were created under Peter the Great.  The Senate was divided into six departments.  The Main Magistrate, the Berg College, the Manufactory College were restored.  The centralization process was continued by bureaucratization of management, the elimination of hetmanism in Ukraine. </p><p>  The empress's enlightened absolutism was based on her personal understanding of the problems that should be addressed.  In 1767, a Commission was convened to develop a new code of laws.  In 1775, management reform began.  The number of provinces has increased.  They were led by governors, and groups from several provinces were governor-generals.  The Treasury Chamber became involved in industry, expenses and incomes, hospitals and schools - the Order of Public Charity.  Courts separated from the administration. </p><p>  Gradually, the entire system of government of the country became uniform, subordinate to the governors, then their governors, central colleges and, finally, the empress. </p><p>  In 1779, the Decree on the Free Opening of Industrial Enterprises was signed and published.  Merchants and artisans received certain benefits.  At the same time, in 1785, the Noble was granted the “Charter of Merit”, which secured their feudal privileges. </p><p>  Thus, enlightened absolutism and the empress's program turned out to be very controversial.  On the one hand, they were characterized by the proclamation of the advanced truths of enlightening philosophy, and on the other, by the preservation of autocracy, the rule of the nobility and serfdom. </p><p>  <span>The enlightened absolutism of Catherine II</span> as a whole had a positive effect on the development of the country: its territory grew, its population increased, and treasury income increased.  However, the situation of the people remained disastrous.  At this time, there was a powerful <span>peasant war,</span> led by E.I. Pugachev.  Maturing issues have not been resolved in full.  The state remained autocratic and serf. </p>
