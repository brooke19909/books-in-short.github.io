  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exciting creativity: 2 ways to paint with a toothbrush</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Perhaps all the kids love to paint bright and funny pictures.  Most often, familiar pencils, felt-tip pens and paints are used for this lesson.  However, there are many other interesting ways and techniques of drawing.  One of them is drawing with a toothbrush.  This fun activity will appeal not only to kids, but also to their parents. </p><h2>  Tool preparation </h2><p>  Before you start captivating drawing, you need to prepare everything you need.  The first thing that parents need to consider is that such a technique is quite dirty everything around.  Spray from the brush scatter in all directions and can easily spoil both the surface of the table and the clothes of the child.  Therefore, take care of a protective apron and a special oilcloth for creativity in advance.  The rest of the set is quite simple: </p><ul><li>  gouache paints (watercolors are also possible); </li><li>  medium hard toothbrush; </li><li>  brush; </li><li>  lid from the can. </li></ul><p>  Having prepared everything you need, start your creativity! </p><h2>  How to draw with a brush? </h2><p>  The toothbrush technique itself is pretty simple.  First of all, take the lid and apply a little paint on it, then dilute it with water.  Do not add too much water so that the shade does not lose brightness.  Put a clean sheet in front of the child and, dipping the brush in the lid, offer to draw something.  Typically, breadboard models are used in this technique.  To do this, an adult draws a tree trunk on a sheet, the outline of a house, an outline of an animal, etc. And the child adds strokes with a paint brush.  You can offer the baby a Christmas tree, because the New Year holidays are approaching. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.maam.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="tree with toothbrush" class="if uuid-2994363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2994363.jpg"></div><p>  To do this, draw the spruce trunk and dilute the green paint in the lid.  Using a brush, the needles of a Christmas tree can be depicted as quite realistic, while the pattern itself turns out to be interesting and unusual.  Decorate the finished spruce with balls drawn already with an ordinary brush. </p><h2>  Splashing </h2><p>  Another unusual technique is spray painting with a toothbrush.  However, for this you need to prepare stencils or large leaves of trees, ideally maple.  Take a white piece of paper and put a stencil on it.  Now dip the brush into the lid and brush it over its bristles to make a lot of splashes. </p><div class="photo" data-original="watercolorpainting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="brush spray" class="if uuid-2994374" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2994374.jpg"></div><p>  It is best to use a brush not for paints, but for glue, since it is more suitable for stiffness.  Alternate different shades of colors so that the spray turns out multi-colored.  When the white sheet is covered with paint, remove the stencil.  The space below it should remain perfectly white.  In this way, you can draw not only leaves, but also animals, fruits and vegetables, etc. The main thing is to cut a suitable outline from paper. </p><h2>  We combine two techniques </h2><p>  The most beautiful and unusual drawings are obtained by combining two techniques together.  To do this, first use a spray, which will serve as a background.  And then brush painting. </p><p>  Since it may be difficult for a small child to draw complex plots, offer him the most basic pictures.  Invite your child to draw a cat on paper.  With a simple pencil, draw an oval body, paws, tail and head.  Then give the child a brush with gray paint and ask the cat to make a coat.  Due to the hard bristles, the animal‚Äôs hair will turn out just as it should.  After the cat is ready, draw small details: face, ears and mustache. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mirobaby.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cat drawing" class="if uuid-2994368" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/63974/2994368.jpg"></div><p>  Using drawing with a toothbrush in kindergarten, the development of fine motor skills of young children, as well as the development of imagination, takes place.  In addition, such an original way of creativity perfectly calms the nervous system, activates brain activity and generally positively affects the emotional background of the child.  Toothbrush drawing is suitable for children of school age, and even adults.  Immerse yourself in creativity, giving free rein to your imagination! </p>
