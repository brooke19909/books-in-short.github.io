Many do not even realize that Uchkuduk is not only a city, but also an important strategic object of the USSR, as well as a great place to travel.  In this amazing city of Uzbekistan you can not only relax and enjoy the local beauties, but also get acquainted with the local cuisine, which simply amazes with its sophistication. </p><h2>  Uchkuduk - three wells </h2><p>  The city of Uchkuduk is located in the Republic of Uzbekistan in the Navoi region.  Previously, this area was completely deserted and deserted, and only passing caravans violated the silence of this area.  The city received its name in honor of three wells located nearby from each other.  These wells did not appear here by accident.  In the 50s, they were dug up by Soviet scientists who conducted uranium mining in this place.  Each well had its own purpose: </p><ol><li>  For a drink. </li><li>  For swimming. </li><li>  For technical needs. </li></ol><p>  Excavations in this area did not last long, and after their completion this once deserted area became known as <span>an urban-type settlement.</span>  Currently, the population of Uchkuduk exceeds 28,000 people, and the city has completely changed, become more modern and colorful. </p><h2>  Uchkuduk today </h2><p>  If before he was known only in narrow circles, and few knew what Uchkuduk was.  For many years Uchkuduk was a closed city, since uranium was excavated and mined there.  In Soviet times, it was not even indicated on maps, and access to it was very limited.  However, at present the city has become very famous all over the world, and all thanks to the song of the group "Yalla" of the same name.  The song became so popular and described the terrain in such detail that it immediately became clear to everyone that Uchkuduk is a terrain with three wells. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="fotostrana.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Uchkuduk Monument" class="if uuid-2685366" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2685366.jpg"></div><p>  Currently, Uchkuduk has changed a lot.  Instead of the tent camp of geologists, two, three and five-story houses were built in its place.  Many courtyards of houses are landscaped with playgrounds, and the once deserted city itself is simply surrounded by greenery. </p><h2>  What can I see? </h2><p>  Few tourists decide to visit this settlement, and all because they do not know that Uchkuduk is not only a song, but also a city in which there is something to see.  But those who have visited it at least once, talk about Uchkuduk as a completely tourist destination.  And this is quite justified, since there are a large number of attractions that you just need to see and photograph for memory. </p><ol><li>  The Three Wells Monument, erected on the site of three wells.  This stone monument does not quite resemble wells, but it looks so original that it must be seen. </li><li>  Night club in the form of a dragon.  This club was once very popular, but now it is in desolation.  However, despite this, its architecture still looks bewitching. </li><li>  The local market (bazaar), where you can purchase everything from food to clothing and household cleaning products. </li><li>  Sports complex "Falcon". </li><li>  DK "Sovremennik". </li><li>  Orthodox Church of All Saints. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="ru.sputniknews-uz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Landmark of Uchkuduk" class="if uuid-2685363" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2685363.jpg"></div><p>  For those who are in this city for the first time, it is mandatory upon arrival to rent a hotel room.  There are several of them in the city; there is a very good three-star and even four-star one.  But about the food here, you don‚Äôt have to worry at all, as the Uzbek cuisine can amaze even the most fastidious tourist with its delights.  Experienced tourists believe that eating is better not in restaurants and cafes, but in local small canteens, since there they not only cook tastier, but also the portion size is larger and the prices are much cheaper.  Delicious pilaf, juicy kebab, fragrant smoke and sambus, as well as fresh cakes are best prepared in Uzbekistan, as it is the birthplace of these amazing dishes. </p><h2>  Area Guide </h2><p>  Getting to the city is not at all difficult, since both trains and buses go in this direction.  The distance from Tashkent to Uchkuduk is about 760 km, which can be covered by car in just 9.5 hours. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="42.1534906" data-lng="63.56176849999997" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/6/7/2/6672.png"></div><p>  However, if you are poorly oriented on the terrain, then the most convenient way to get to the city will be by train, which runs in this direction daily.  Ticket prices vary depending on the comfort of the car.  So, a ticket for a compartment car costs from 2,000 to 3,000 rubles, and a ticket to a reserved seat - from 1,700 to 2,000 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ru.sputniknews-uz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Station Uchkuduk" class="if uuid-2685361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/93625/2685361.jpg"></div><p>  Now you know that Uchkuduk is not just a song, but a real city that you must visit to get acquainted with its culture and attractions. </p>
