And these are <span>key success factors.</span>  Most people who make a fortune in the financial markets constantly study and hone their acquired skills.  In this article we will talk about one of these professionals.  Meet Eric Nyman. </p><h2>  Childhood </h2><p>  The fate of the hero of this article was not easy.  Eric Leontyevich Naiman was born in Novosibirsk in 1969.  The boy's family lived poorly.  To feed his family, Eric‚Äôs grandfather (native German) moved to Ukraine in 1930.  He never returned to Germany.  Then the mass repressions began, and the Nyman family constantly changed their place of residence.  This continued until Eric's father decided to start a new life in Siberia.  It was there that the hero of this article was born.  All the boy‚Äôs childhood passed in Novosibirsk. </p><p>  At age 12, Eric Nyman accidentally stumbled upon a newspaper article about stock speculation.  She inspired the boy so much that he firmly decided to earn his first million on this.  Even then, little Eric devoted all his free time to the study of market laws.  And this knowledge was very useful to him in the future. </p>

    <h2>  Study </h2><p>  After graduating from high school, Eric Nyman did not move to Moscow.  Although most of the youth of Novosibirsk, sought this.  Indeed, in the capital there were much more prospects.  He entered the State Academy of Management and Science (Faculty of Finance and Economics).  Teachers noted the remarkable mathematical abilities of Nyman.  Eric paid particular attention to the scientific fields related to money, logic, analysis, and computing.  The young man decided to plunge into the world of business while still a student. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Together with one of the teachers, Eric Nyman opened the brokerage company "Spread".  The main activity of the company became operations with securities.  Unfortunately, the first business was unsuccessful.  Then Eric took up vouchers, but did not take into account the specifics of the market and also failed.  After that, the young man decided to concentrate solely on his studies and improve his professional level. </p>

    <h2>  Work </h2><p>  After graduating from the academy with honors, Nyman got a job as a <span>manager in foreign economic activity</span> in one of the Novosibirsk companies <span>.</span>  In this position, Eric was able to improve financial skills and ability to predict the movement of prices in the foreign exchange markets. </p><p>  Nyman daily practiced in operations to transfer both our rubles and the American currency.  During his work, he understood all the imperfection of the education system.  She absolutely did not prepare a specialist for activities in the real market.  Therefore, the young trader decided to start from scratch, focusing on statistics, macroeconomics and financial analysis.  Eric also realized that some of the time needed to be devoted to the study of trade secrets of Western experts. </p><p>  From 1997 to 1998, Nyman worked as a <span>financial analyst</span> at Alfa Capital.  The young man was engaged in trust management of funds of <span>non-state pension funds</span> and had access to securities of insurance companies.  Eric also managed deposits from private investors.  And he spent some of his working time studying the specifics of the activity of mutual funds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

He is a good writer and is actively involved in educational activities.  5 editions - exactly so many books have been written by Eric Nyman at the moment.  "Small Encyclopedia of the Trader" is considered the most famous of them.  This book has been published as many as 11 times.  The other four works of Nyman are no less interesting: ‚ÄúBill legislation in the Russian Federation‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe path to financial freedom‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to buy cheap and sell expensive‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaster trading‚Äù.  In addition, Eric writes many articles on the stock market. </p><p>  And a trader very often conducts classes in schools, revealing to children the secrets of financial analysis and investment decisions.

    <h2>  Philosopher </h2><p>  Eric does not like being called an entrepreneur.  He considers himself a philosopher.  Many traders and businessmen believe that in their business one should not reflect on high matters.  Eric has a different opinion.  In his interviews, Nyman has repeatedly stated that a philosophical approach is also worthwhile to work successfully on the currency exchange. </p>
