This typical resort of the Mediterranean coast of Turkey is famous for its medieval fortified city on a prominent rocky promontory in the sea, Cleopatra's beach under this cliff and Damlatas cave.  Fortunately, all three of these attractions are located in one area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAlanya.  If you are interested in combining an informative vacation with a stay on the most beautiful beach of the Anatolian Riviera, then you are right here at the Kleopatra Atlas Hotel 4 *. </p><p>  What is special about this hotel?  We learn this from the reviews of those tourists who visited there recently, in the summer and in the first half of the fall of 2016.  Alanya, unlike Antalya, attracts budget travelers.  But even those who are fed up with the Turkish "fives", argues that in "Cleopatra" you will find a decent vacation for a reasonable price.  Before describing the hotel in more detail, let's say that it is located across the road from the beach, and it offers an all-inclusive concept of food. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kleopatra Atlas Hotel 4" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33726/1477513.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  <span>The Cleopatra Atlas Hotel (Alanya), like many resort hotels in Turkey, introduced the concept of "All Inclusive".</span>  <span>Of course, this is not the "five", where they feed around the clock.</span>  <span>Food consists of three meals.</span>  <span>But their extent pleases.</span>  <span>You can have breakfast already from seven in the morning.</span>  <span>And those who like to sleep longer will have time to eat at half past ten.</span>  <span>The same ‚Äúsparing‚Äù schedule for lunch (from half past one to two) and dinner (from seven to nine in the evening).</span>  <span>For breakfast, they give eggs of all kinds, cereals, granola, a variety of delicious pastries, vegetables and fruits, honey of two varieties, coffee and tea.</span>  <span>Lunch and dinner consist of at least one soup, a variety of meat and fish dishes, and many side dishes (pilaf, fries, pasta, greens and vegetables).</span>  <span>Desserts in Turkey are beyond praise, especially pastries.</span>  <span>The reviews mention that during the holidays you can eat seasonal fruits: peaches, strawberries, apples, pears, oranges, plums, pomegranates ... Of the drinks, tourists mention vending machines with juices, "Cola", "Fanta".</span>  <span>Local alcohol and a variety of alcoholic cocktails can be enjoyed at the bar.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Small city hotel" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1477151.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Kleopatra Atlas <span>Hotel 4 * (Alanya)</span> is located in the most beautiful part of the city.  Literally across the road is the famous Cleopatra beach, where, according to legend, the princess of the Ptolemaic dynasty herself bathed.  This coast is very wide, covered with golden sand.  The claim that it was brought by ships from the Sahara belongs to the field of legends, but still it is one bliss to rest on it.  Reviews say that the beach has a wide selection of water activities.  The hotel has a swimming pool located between the buildings.  Nearby is a sunbathing terrace with sunbeds and umbrellas.  All types of beach services are provided on the coast of another hotel of the same hotel chain - Blue Star Beach. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kleopatra Atlas Hotel 4 (Alanya)" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12024/1477703.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Excursions and shopping </h2><p>  <span>Reviews call to break the all-inclusive shackles and more often go beyond the Kleopatra Atlas Hotel 4 * (Alanya).</span>  <span>Damlatas - a cave, whose name is translated as "Stones in the Drops", was discovered relatively recently, in the middle of the last century.</span>  <span>Entrance to it is paid, but the price is symbolic.</span>  <span>Inside, there is a winding and narrow fifty-meter passage.</span>  <span>In the cave you can not only admire the colorful <span>stalagmites and stalactites,</span> but also breathe deeper.</span>  <span>Damlatas is said to have the same healing properties as salt rooms.</span>  <span>Be sure to overcome laziness and go at least once to the old fortress city on the cliff.</span>  <span>Near the hotel there is a tour desk where you can book excursions throughout the Alanya region.</span>  <span>But the tourists most praised the boat trip along the rocky cape.</span>  <span>It is dotted with caves in which pirates once hid with their ships.</span>  <span>As for shopping, it is present in Turkey at every step.</span>  <span>And in the shopping center "Alanium" you can get on the bus number 202.</span> <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kleopatra Atlas Hotel 4 (Alanya).
