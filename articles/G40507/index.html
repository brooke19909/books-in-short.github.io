    <h2>  Housing stock </h2><p>  Most of our compatriots were satisfied with the apartments at Bella Express Hotel 3 * (Pattaya, Thailand).  According to them, the rooms here are quite spacious, comfortable, decorated in pleasant light colors.  The apartments have everything that a tourist may need during a vacation.  Especially travelers highlight comfortable beds and quality bedding.  The guests also liked the roomy refrigerators and the fact that throughout the hotel (both in the rooms and at the reception, and by the pool) there is access to wireless Internet, which can be used for free.  Moreover, the quality of the connection, according to tourists, is very good.  So you can always be in touch with your friends and relatives staying at home.  In addition, the hotel guests liked the comfortable balconies available in all apartments.  Here you could sit and relax after a busy day with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine.  True, as guests note, not all rooms can boast a picturesque view, but this did not become a serious problem for anyone. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bella express hotel 3 central pattaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097759.jpg" width="600"></div>

So, according to them, rooms are cleaned every day, and quite carefully - at least the floors are cleaned regularly.  Daily maids also change towels.  Bed linen is updated a couple of times a week.  The guests liked the fact that regularly maids erect amusing figures of towels on the beds.  By the way, the quality of service here is completely independent of the fact whether you leave a tip or not. </p><p>  As expenditures, the maids will replenish the supplies of personal hygiene products in the bathroom (toothbrushes, shower gels, soap, shampoo, toilet paper, etc.), as well as the contents of the set for making tea or coffee.  By the way, the room has cups, saucers and spoons.  There are no teapots in the rooms.  But on each floor there is a cooler with hot water. </p><p>  If you need something extra, then you can ask the maid or receptionist about it.  In most cases, you will have to pay for it.  So, for example, an iron costs guests 30 baht. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bella express hotel pattaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097760.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Check in, departure </h2><p>  Despite the fact that Bella Express Hotel 3 * (Central Pattaya) has a checkout time, in most cases it is not observed when new guests arrive.  So, if you arrive at the hotel in the morning, then most likely they will try to accommodate you in your room as soon as possible.  Therefore, you do not have to wait two in the afternoon to get the key to the apartment.  The overlay can only occur if the hotel is completely filled and previous guests have not yet vacated the occupied rooms.  Also note that you will be asked to make a deposit upon arrival.  Its amount is 1000 baht.  On the day of your departure, the hotel employee will check your room, and if everything is in order, then the deposit will be fully returned to you.  However, if, for example, you break dishes, lose your umbrella, or stain bedding a lot, then the administrator can deduct the amount of damage caused to the hotel from the amount indicated. </p><p>  In general, the occupied apartments should be vacated on the day of departure from the hotel until noon.  Moreover, if you plan to leave the hotel only in the evening, then you can hand over the room keys, leave things for storage in the luggage room and continue to relax until the moment of departure. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  The cost of living in this hotel includes breakfast only.  According to our compatriots, they are repeated every day, however, the choice of dishes and products is wide enough so that you can constantly diversify your menu.  So, tourists remember that in the mornings at Bella Express they had the opportunity to eat dishes of meat, poultry and fish, pasta, noodles, salads, cheese and sausage slices, eggs in different variations, fresh vegetables and fruits, juices, coffee , tea, delicious pastries and desserts.  So, having a hearty breakfast at the hotel, you will not want to eat until lunch. </p><p>  During the <span>day, tourists</span> can eat both at the Bella Express restaurant and in cafes located in its vicinity and in the center of Pattaya.  Travelers also mention that many excursions include lunch, and sometimes dinner.  In addition, you can always buy something from the products in one of the city's supermarkets or have a bite to eat at the tower (mobile food kiosk). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bella express hotel 3 pattaya" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11175/1097761.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Sea </h2><p>  The nearest beach is about 500 meters from Bella Express Hotel (Pattaya).  This path can be overcome both on foot (about 15 minutes), and on a tuk-tuk, taxi or rented motor scooter.  The beach here, according to our compatriots, is very large, fine sandy and quite clean.  You can stay here right on the sand, laying a mat and installing an umbrella from the sun.  Near the beach there are lots of cafes and bars where you can have a bite to eat and enjoy your favorite drink. </p><h2>  Staff </h2><p>  Many travelers note that the staff of Bella Express Hotel left them with an extremely pleasant experience.  So, according to tourists, the hotel staff is always very attentive to the guests, smiling, friendly.  You can contact the hotel staff with any question, and they will always do everything possible to help you.  However, as noted by vacationers from Russia and other CIS countries, most of the guests here are tourists from India.  Therefore, the staff in Russian almost does not understand.  However, our compatriots assure that basic knowledge of English will be quite enough. </p>
