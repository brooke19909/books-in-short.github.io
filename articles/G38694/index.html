Despite its considerable remoteness, it is part of the famous resort city of Anapa.  The village itself is located in a picturesque valley of the same name.  It is here that the famous Caucasus Mountains originate.  Sukko is a wonderful place where you can have a wonderful vacation while enjoying the hot sun and amazing air.  In addition, it is believed that here is the cleanest sea.  The village has a well-developed tourist infrastructure.  Here you can rent housing for every taste and at a very reasonable price.  Sukko guest houses with a swimming pool have recently been especially popular.  There are a lot of them.  The presence of its own reservoir in the territory provides visitors with additional comfort and makes the institutions themselves more attractive to tourists. </p><h2>  Natela </h2><p>  It is difficult to list all Sukko guest houses with a swimming pool that are functioning in the village today.  One of them is located on the 1st passage, 5 and is called "Natela".  The institution is located near the unique <span>Utrish nature reserve</span> and is a building of four floors with a small adjacent territory. </p>

    <p>  For visitors, there are two types of suites: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  One-room.  They are designed for 2 or 3 people. </li><li>  Two rooms.  They can accommodate up to 4 people at a time. </li></ol><p>  Each room, as a rule, has: </p><ul><li>  necessary furniture (beds, armchairs, wardrobes, sofas and bedside tables); </li><li>  a bathroom; </li><li>  refrigerator; </li><li>  TV; </li><li>  balcony; </li><li>  air conditioning system. </li></ul><p>  Guests can spend their free time in the courtyard.  Here visitors have 2 outdoor pools (one for children) with sun loungers, a cozy gazebo, a sauna with billiards and a relaxation room.  In addition, those who wish can independently fry the meat.  To do this, there is a separate area with a barbecue oven.  Like other Sukko guest houses with a swimming pool, Natela is aimed at tourists of different categories.  For visitors with children, a whole mini-town has been built here.  The price also includes meals.  The dining room is located in the basement of the main building. </p><h2>  Sherwood </h2><p>  <span>Sukko guest houses</span> with a pool are usually chosen by lovers of secluded relaxation.  Those who prefer comfort and silence will surely like an institution called ‚ÄúSherwood‚Äù.  A small four-story house is located in a cozy place near the picturesque juniper forests.  Visitors can take daily walks while enjoying the healing mountain air.  The hotel offers the following types of rooms: </p><ul><li>  "Standard" for two; </li><li>  "Deluxe" for 2, 3 or 4 people; </li><li>  "Apartments" for couples. </li></ul><p>  On the territory there are summer arbors where you can relax, hiding from the scorching rays of the sun.  Next to them is a small pool.  It can be bathed in those who, for whatever reason, decided not to go to the beach.  The pond is relatively shallow, so the water in it is always warm.  At the beginning of the season, when the sea is still warm, the pool will be very helpful.  For residents of "Sherwood" organized a full three meals a day.  A qualified chef of the highest category is responsible for this. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  "Novelty" </h2><p>  Every year there are more and more people who want to spend their holidays in Sukko.  Guest houses with a swimming pool have become very popular.  Among them, it is worth paying special attention to the hotel with the romantic name "Novelika".  This is a small three-story building, which can simultaneously accommodate 80 people. </p>

    <p>  There are three categories of rooms for visitors: </p><ul><li>  "standard"; </li><li>  "Luxury"; </li><li>  family. </li></ul><p>  The surrounding area is small, but it has everything you need for relaxation: </p><ul><li>  2 pools; </li><li>  sun loungers; </li><li>  playground; </li><li>  barbecue. </li></ul><p>  Residents feed on their own.  To do this, the rooms have a special set of dishes and an electric kettle.  And within walking distance from the house there are grocery stores.  There is a cafe in the evenings, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about dinner.  To organize the leisure of tourists, the hosts offer all kinds of excursions: a trip to the dolphinarium, a boat trip or a motor ship.  You can also go to Anapa or visit the "African village".  Usually visitors with pleasure agree to such offers. </p><h2>  "Visit" </h2><p>  As practice shows, tourists prefer, choosing a vacation in Sukko, guest houses with a pool.  Reviews about the time spent in such institutions are usually only positive.  Take, for example, the Visit Hotel, which is located right on the main street of the village.  From the outside, this institution resembles a personal cottage (a beautiful three-story house with balconies behind a high brick fence).  Inside, the territory is neatly lined with cobblestones, and green fluffy fir trees are planted around the perimeter.  This guest house is relatively small.  It has only 6 rooms, designed for 2 or 3 people.  If necessary, you can put an extra bed.  The rooms are bright, quite spacious and decorated in a "retro" style.  On the territory there are: </p><ul><li>  summer kitchen; </li><li>  parking; </li><li>  barbecue oven and barbecue equipment; </li><li>  playground with sandpit and swing; </li><li>  spacious arbors; </li><li>  pool and several sun loungers. </li></ul>

    <p>  For supporters of a secluded holiday, there is everything you need.  Particular attention should be paid to the pool.  For water purification, it uses the original ionization method.  This eliminates the use of bleach, which gives an unpleasant odor.  The water in the pool is heated, and the lights work at night.  Sometimes guests do not even want to leave the territory for days and leave this beauty. </p><h2>  "Eve" </h2><p>  In 2007, a guest house was built in Sukko with a pool and meals called "Eva".  The institution looks more than modest in appearance.  But inside it resembles an upscale hotel.  The hosts put a lot of effort into this. </p>

    <p>  The three-story building is located on Central Street, not far from a mountain river flowing nearby.  It is equipped with 20 comfortable double and triple rooms of the category "standard" and "luxury".  The entire courtyard is surrounded by greenery and flowers.  The owners have well thought out the infrastructure of the institution.  There are: </p><ul><li>  bathhouse; </li><li>  free parking for cars; </li><li>  a cozy terrace with picturesque sea views; </li><li>  billiard room; </li><li>  a dining room where visitors can order food for themselves (in the evening it works like a cafe); </li><li>  beauty salon with massage apparatus; </li><li>  spacious outdoor pool. </li></ul><p>  Near the house there is a stop.  From it you can quickly get to Anapa by minibus.  Rest in such a hotel costs from 750 to 2000 rubles per day.  Given the level of service offered, this is quite inexpensive. </p>
