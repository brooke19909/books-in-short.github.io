    <p>  Two World Wars proved to be especially indicative in this regard, when the losses of all the warring parties exceeded 70-80 million people.  Historians believe that more than 100 million died, since the actions of the Japanese militarists in China to this day have not been adequately studied, although they killed a huge number of civilians. </p><p>  Today other global issues.  The demographic problem is one of the most serious and important among them.  However, one should not assume that a sharp increase in the number of mankind began exclusively in our days.  In the distant past, there were also sharp jumps in the population of individual countries, and all these processes often led to very serious consequences worldwide. </p><h2>  What is the result of the population explosion? </h2><p>  It is believed that the sharp surge in population still has a positive feature.  The fact is that in this case, entire countries are "getting younger", the cost of medicine is reduced.  But that‚Äôs where the good ends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The number of beggars sharply increases, the cost of education increases many times, the number of specialists graduating from educational institutions increases so much that the country simply cannot provide their employment.  A huge number of young and healthy people appear on the labor market who are ready to do work for a very modest remuneration.  As a result, the cost of their labor (already cheap) drops to a minimum.  The rise of crime begins, robberies and murders quickly become the "calling card" of the state. </p><h2>  <strong>Integrated Vision</strong> </h2><p>  Many <span>modern global problems</span> follow from this <span>.</span>  The demographic problem is often only a reflection of the negative processes taking place in the state.  The inability of society to engage new citizens in useful work, the unwillingness to guarantee them housing, food and education indicates a weak domestic policy. </p>

    <p>  However, not everything is so scary.  If the country has close ties with international partners and trains highly qualified specialists, then part of the younger generation may well find itself in the labor markets of other states.  In addition, seasonal jobs are important, which can relieve the internal labor market and somewhat correct the demographic problems of society. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Differences in living standards </h2><p>  Alas, in this case, the level of development of the state itself plays a crucial role.  If in Europe the rapid growth of the white population is simply impossible because of the high prices for good housing and education for children, then for such a wave of migrants from Africa and other countries of the ‚ÄúThird World‚Äù such trifles do not matter. </p><p>  Satisfied with state benefits, they can easily huddle in small rented apartments, regularly producing new children.  As a result, the number of parasites sitting on the neck of taxpayers is sharply increasing.  <span>Social tension</span> is growing, wages are declining, unemployment is massively appearing, as all ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù posts are massively employed by migrants who agree to work for less. </p><p>  Here are the causes of the demographic problem.  The ‚Äúfirst fiddle‚Äù must be played by the state.  If it removes itself from solving the problem, then nothing good will come of it. </p><h2>  Once again about social policy </h2><p>  If we consider all global problems in a complex, the demographic problem is often a predisposing factor, but by no means the cause leading to all of the above consequences. </p>

    <p>  The main root cause of all troubles is always the poor social policy of the state or the complete absence thereof.  Take the same Africa.  The world community allocates huge funds for the purchase of contraceptives, but almost no one is engaged in their advertising, which creates the demographic <span>problems of modern society.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, in many regions of Central Africa, the population has already been brought to such a beggarly condition that a large number of children who will work on the field or beg, is the only means of survival for the family.  Growing up, they join the ranks of countless armed groups that continue to drive the entire region into even greater chaos.  The reason is the lack of even basic state support for social development, the absence of any sources of official income. </p><h2>  Other risks of overpopulation </h2><p>  It is known that the consumption level of modern civilization is many thousand times higher than the level of normal biological human needs.  Even the poorest countries consume more than they did a couple of hundred years ago. </p>

The consequence of this is the multiply increased plums of toxic waste from home-made enterprises, garbage piles and the complete neglect of at least some environmental measures.

    <h2>  What does all this lead to? </h2><p>  As a result, the country is on the verge of an environmental disaster, and the population is on the verge of starvation.  Do you think modern demographic problems began only in recent years?  In Africa, from the mid-60s onwards, in whole provinces, people began to suffer from malnutrition.  Western medicines allowed to increase life expectancy, but its general structure remained the same. </p><p>  Many children were born, more and more land was required for their food.  And farming there to this day is conducted slash-fire method.  As a result, hectares of fertile soil turned into deserts, undergoing wind erosion and leaching. </p><p>  These are all global problems.  The demographic problem (as you can see) is characteristic of transitional cultures that have gained sharp access to the benefits of modern civilization.  They do not know how or do not want to rebuild, as a result of which there are tough socio-cultural contradictions that can even lead to war. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="socio-demographic problems" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15322/446759.jpg" width="486"></div></h2><h2>  Reverse example </h2><p>  However, in our world there are many countries in which the demographic problem is presented from a completely opposite perspective.  We are talking about developed countries, in which the problem is precisely that people of reproductive age do not want to create families, do not give birth to children. </p><p>  As a result, migrants take the place of indigenous peoples, who often contribute to the complete destruction of the entire sociocultural component of the ethnos that previously lived on this territory.  Of course, this is not a very life-affirming ending, but without the active intervention and participation of the state, a similar problem cannot be solved. </p><h2>  How can a demographic problem be resolved? </h2><p>  So what are the solutions to the demographic problem?  Solutions are logically derived from the causes of the phenomenon.  First, it is imperative to raise the standard of living of the population, to improve its medical care.  It is known that in poor countries mothers are often forced to give birth to many children, not only because of traditions, but also because of high <span>infant mortality.</span> </p>

    <p>  If each child survives, it will make less sense to give birth to a dozen children.  Unfortunately, in the case of the same migrants in Europe, good medical care only led to the fact that they began to give birth even more.  About the same thing is observed in Haiti, where the overwhelming majority of the population lives far below the poverty line, but continues to give birth regularly.  Various public organizations pay many benefits, which are enough for survival. </p><h2>  Medicine is Above All! </h2><p>  Therefore, it is not necessary to be limited only to improving the quality of medical care.  It is necessary to offer financial incentives to families with no more than two or three children, tax them less, to offer simplified schemes for entering higher schools for children from such families.  Simply put, <span>socio-demographic problems</span> must be addressed comprehensively. </p><p>  In addition, effective social advertising about the benefits of contraception, supported by the low cost of such drugs, is extremely important.  It is necessary to explain to people that overpopulation entails poor living conditions for their children, who will not be able to live normally in the smog of large cities without greenery and clean air. </p><h2>  How to increase the birth rate? </h2><p>  And what are the ways to solve the demographic problem, if you have to fight not with overpopulation, but with a shortage of this very population?  Oddly enough, but they are almost the same.  Consider them from the standpoint of our state. </p><p>  Firstly, it is extremely important to increase the level of well-being of the population.  Many young families do not have a baby just because they are not sure about tomorrow.  Preferential housing for young families, tax incentives, significantly increased payments of material benefits to large families are needed. </p>

    <p>  Among other things, the possibility of obtaining preferential medicines and nutrition for children should be provided without fail.  Since all this costs a lot, many young families simply drain their budgets by buying everything they need with their own money.  In the same row is the reduction of the <span>tax burden</span> on young and large families. </p><p>  Of course, do not forget about the promotion of family values.  In any case, the solution to the demographic problem must necessarily be comprehensive, with the obligatory consideration of all factors that lead to fertility problems. </p>
