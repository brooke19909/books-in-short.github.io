  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where does the transport tax from individuals go?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In each region of Russia, the <span>transport tax</span> on individuals varies.  This may be caused by operating conditions, climatic conditions, the location of the city or other settlement.  All funds go to local budgets. </p><p>  The objects of taxation are: </p><p>  Cars and buses, motorcycles and jet skis, scooters, self-propelled mechanisms and machines, helicopters and airplanes, yachts and motor ships, boats, motor sledges and a number of other air, water and ground <span>modes of transport.</span> </p><p>  Transport tax in Russia is paid by persons who are the official owners of the vehicle.  They can be both individuals and organizations and institutions that own transport. </p><p>  In each region, tax rates, deadlines and payment procedures are established.  There are also benefits established by deputies of this region. </p><p>  How is <span>vehicle</span> tax calculated <span>.</span> </p><p>  For <span>individuals, the</span> amount of transport tax is calculated based on information about the transport owned, about their owners.  In addition, all changes to the design are taken into account.  All information contained in the registration structures of the STSI should be transferred to the tax authorities, which cannot make any changes or adjustments without legal permission.  They are only users of information. </p><p>  A small explanation: to calculate the tax yourself, you need to multiply the tax rate by the number of horsepower, while taking into account the coefficient, which is defined as the total period of time of registration of the vehicle relative to all months of the year.  But you don‚Äôt have to calculate anything, at a certain time (recently, this time is November) you will receive a receipt that already indicates the amount of the transport tax and payment deadlines, violating which, you are subject to penalties in the form of a penalty.  If you sold a car, then the month of sale will be included in the transport tax. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  For many categories of citizens there are significant discounts on tax payments, and in some cases a full exemption from them.  These benefits are enjoyed by the heroes of the USSR and the Russian Federation, the heroes of social labor, order bearers awarded the <span>Order of Glory of</span> all degrees. </p><p>  The preferential transport tax from individuals will be when relevant supporting documents are submitted to the tax office, and only the originals. </p><p>  Such cases are frequent when the vehicle is sold, and the tax inspector sends receipts of payment to the former owner.  This mainly happens when the <span>car is sold by general power of attorney,</span> which, although it is an official document, but not quite.  To solve such a problem, it is necessary to remove the transport from the registration account and pay the transport tax from individuals.  If receipts still come, then you should personally contact the tax authorities or, if it is not difficult for you, arrange everything online.  For this purpose, there is a special service of tax problems.  You must send there your appeal electronically.  After receiving your letter from the tax office, they will correct and make changes to your profile. </p><p>  There are situations that few people are familiar with because they are rare.  When a car is stolen, a transport tax is not charged from individuals.  But this is only if the fact of theft or theft of the vehicle, certified by the relevant authorities, is confirmed.  When paying the next tax on transport, it is necessary to submit a certificate to the tax office, which indicates the period of time during which he was wanted.  In this case, no tax is levied on the owner. </p>
