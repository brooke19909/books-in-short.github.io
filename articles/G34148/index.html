Graphite is everywhere.  For example, rods for simple pencils are made from it.  Graphite is a very affordable and cheap substance.  But a substance like diamond is very different from graphite.  Diamond is the most expensive stone, very rare and transparent, unlike graphite.  It's hard to believe, but the chemical formula of graphite is the same as the diamond.  In this article we will examine how this is possible. </p>

    <h2>  Graphite: the history and properties of the mineral </h2><p>  The history of graphite goes back thousands of years, so the exact year it began to be used is extremely difficult to establish.  Graphite is famous for its good electrical conductivity.  In addition, this mineral is very fragile.  Therefore, pencil rods are made of it. </p><p>  The chemical properties of the mineral include the formation of inclusion compounds with many substances, such as salts and <span>alkali metals.</span>  The mineral is not soluble in acids. </p><p>  The graphite formula is C, that is, it is one of the <span>allotropic modifications of the</span> famous sixth element of the periodic table - carbon. </p>

    <h2>  Diamond: the history and properties of the mineral </h2><p>  The history of diamond is very unusual.  It is believed that the first diamond was found in India.  At that time, humanity could not understand the full power of this stone.  Geologists only knew that this stone was very hard and durable.  Until the 15th century, diamonds cost much less than emeralds and rubies.  And only then the unknown jeweler in the process of working with the stone gave him a beautiful cut, which later became known as diamond.  It was then that the stone showed itself in all its glory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Diamonds are mainly used in industry.  This mineral is the most durable in the whole world, which is why abrasives, cutters for processing strong metals and much more are made from it. </p><p>  As we already know, the graphite formula in chemistry is C, and the diamond has the same formula. </p>

    <h2>  Differences between Diamond and Graphite </h2><p>  Despite the fact that minerals have similar chemical formulas, they sharply differ from each other both in appearance and in chemical terms. </p><p>  First of all, diamond and graphite have a completely different structure from each other.  After all, graphite consists of a network of hexagons, while diamond has a cubic crystalline structure.  The fragility of graphite is due to the fact that the bond between its layers is very easy to break, its atoms are quietly separated from each other.  Because of this, graphite easily absorbs light; it is very dark itself, unlike diamond. </p><p>  <span>The structure of diamond</span> is different in that one carbon atom is surrounded by four more atoms in the form of a tetrahedral triangle or pyramid.  Each atom is at the same distance from each other.  The bonding of atoms is very strong, which is why diamond is so hard and strong.  Another property of a diamond is that it can conduct light, unlike graphite. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Is it strange that the formula of graphite coincides with the formula of diamond, but the minerals are completely different?  Not!  After all, diamond is created by nature at enormous pressure, and then very rapid cooling, while graphite occurs at low pressure, but very high temperature. </p>

    <h2>  <span>What are allotropic</span> substances? </h2><p>  Allotropic substances are a very important concept in chemistry.  This is the basis of the basics, which allows you to distinguish substances from each other. </p><p>  At school, allotropic substances are studied by the example of graphite and diamond, as well as their differences.  So, having studied the differences between diamond and graphite, we can conclude that allotropy is the existence in nature of two or more substances that differ in their structure and properties, but have a similar chemical formula or belong to the same chemical element. </p><h2>  Getting diamond from graphite </h2><p>  The graphite formula - C - allowed scientists to perform many experiments, as a result of which allotropic substances of graphite were found. </p><p>  Teachers tell both schoolchildren and students about how scientists tried to create graphite diamonds.  This story is very interesting and fascinating, and it also allows you to remember the existence of allotropic substances such as graphite and diamond, and their differences. </p><p>  Some time ago, scientists tried to create diamonds from graphite.  They believed that if the formula of diamond and graphite is the same, then they can create a diamond, because the stone is very expensive and rare.  Now we know that the diamond mineral appears in nature at high pressure and instant cooling.  Therefore, scientists decided to blow up the graphite, thereby creating the necessary conditions for the formation of diamond.  And in fact, a miracle happened, after the explosion on graphite, very small diamond crystals formed. </p>

    <h2>  The use of graphite and diamond </h2><p>  Today, both graphite and diamond are used mainly in industry.  But about 10% of all diamond mining goes into jewelry.  Most often, pencils are made from graphite, since it is very fragile and brittle, while leaving traces. </p>
