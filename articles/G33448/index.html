This is a major construction project, offering buyers an economy-class apartment. </p><h2>  Total information </h2><p>  During the construction of Tsaritsyno 2, the construction of a whole microdistrict was envisaged.  It will include: </p><ul><li>  12 multi-storey buildings (16-20 floors); </li><li>  kindergarten (320 places); </li><li>  comprehensive school (designed for 825 students). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno 2 construction progress" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2164774.jpg"></div></li></ul><p>  The total number of apartments in houses under construction is 2267. The developer is MKHK.  Buyers will be offered a wide selection of housing ranging from studios to 4-bedroom apartments.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartments varies from 37.77 to 127.12 square meters.  m. Apartments in Tsaritsyno 2 deserve special attention - during the construction of the thirty-fifth building all 3 sections of the building will be allocated for them. </p><p>  Convenient transportation, developed infrastructure and improved layout have already attracted the attention of new residents and investors. </p><h2>  Internal infrastructure </h2><p>  At the design stage of the Tsaritsyno 2 residential complex, the developers provided for the smallest details that will help make the neighborhood comfortable for permanent residence. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The first floors will be occupied by a concierge room and offices of commercial organizations, including: </p><ul><li>  bank branches; </li><li>  Beauty Salons; </li><li>  specialized shops; </li><li>  many other service organizations. </li></ul><p>  On the territory will be located underground two-level parking, elevated and guest. </p><p>  Yards are planned to be closed.  Here the territory will be landscaped (green spaces, playgrounds and sports grounds, paved walkways). </p><h2>  What happened during the construction of Tsaritsyno 2? </h2><p>  According to the plan, 12 multi-storey buildings were to be built and commissioned in several stages.  The delivery of the first and second phases was planned for 2016 (the fourth quarter), the third phase the developer was planning to put into operation in the fourth quarter of 2017. </p><p>  Several times, the company made announcements about postponements.  As a result, according to the end of 2017, the construction of this facility is considered frozen. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Tsaritsyno 2 construction progress" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2164780.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, it is rather difficult to call the developer of the MKH project (Moscow Bread Products Plant) a typical developer.  No other construction projects are under his leadership, he never participates in tenders for land.  Moreover, company representatives were not seen at industry exhibitions, round tables, conferences and other professional events. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The reasons for the failure of the term </h2><p>  In the Russian market of new buildings late and transfer commissioning is not a new phenomenon, but most often the developer actively makes contact with customers.  Moreover, the reasons that led to the current situation are clearly and clearly called. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsaritsyno 2 construction progress 25 building" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2164777.jpg"></div>

    <p>  MKH chose a slightly different path, because neither the builder himself, nor real estate agencies, for example, TsNN LLC, can provide clear information about the construction progress of Tsaritsyno 2.  For reference: Center for New Real Estate LLC is an organization that is the official representative of the real estate developer of this complex.  In general, the company cites several factors as the reasons at once.  At first it was a crisis that affected the economic situation and construction in particular.  Then, work on the construction site was inhibited by specialized bodies working with permits. </p><h2>  The situation at the construction site </h2><p>  Now the construction zone is surrounded by a high fence, and access to the territory is closed.  Given this factor, the construction progress of Tsaritsyno 2 can only be guessed at.  On the other hand, you can see from the video from the flyby available on the network: there are several tower cranes on the site, there are some other construction equipment.  However, not a single worker was noticed. </p><p>  As for the houses themselves, many of them are at the initial stage of construction, that is, only a few floors are built up.  Even if intensive work begins today, it will take at least six months to complete the project. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tsnn Tsaritsyno 2 course of construction" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2164779.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Corps readiness </h2><p>  The progress of the construction of the microdistrict.  Tsaritsyno 2 has not changed much over the past year.  The situation at the end of 2017 completely repeats the situation at the end of 2016. Not a single building was commissioned during this time. </p><p>  During the construction of the twenty-fifth building of Tsaritsyno 2, several sections of the building were erected under the roof, but they remained in the same condition.  No work has yet been carried out to complete the construction and commissioning. </p><p>  24 and 23 buildings are in the depth of the quarter.  At the end of 2015-beginning of 2016  the developer and managers of real estate agencies actively assured that these houses are at the stage of construction of underground and ground floors.  As you know from the general plan, it was planned to give the underground levels for parking, and on the first two floors there should be a commercial zone with company offices.  At the end of 2017, the situation did not change - the buildings remained at the initial stage of construction. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="construction progress md tsaritsyno 2" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2164778.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Building 35 should consist of three sections (the construction of apartments was planned in this house).  Currently, it has laid the foundation and several floors. </p><p>  28, 29, 30 and 31 buildings comprise the lion's share of the entire microdistrict.  According to the plan, these buildings should consist of sections of different heights (from 9 to 24 floors).  In the 2016 report, the builder assured that work on these sections was carried out at the level of underground floors.  For 2017, the situation remained unchanged. </p><h2>  The arrest of Igor Pinkevich </h2><p>  Dissatisfied interest holders more than once wrote complaints and went to rallies in connection with the failure of the construction deadlines.  Finally, they managed to draw the attention of law enforcement agencies to their problem. </p><p>  On August 19, 2017, the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow ordered the arrest of Igor Pinkevich, head of the MKH.  The reason is a suspicion of fraud and a delay in construction.  <span>Detention</span> lasted until October 2. </p><h2>  Forecasts of the construction progress of Tsaritsyno 2 residential complex </h2><p>  After the arrest of Pinkevich, an interview was given by Arseny Mesitov, who holds the post of communications adviser of the Nastyusha Group of Companies.  He stressed that the current situation with the company should in no way affect equity holders. </p><p>  He recalled that all equity holders are protected at the legislative level, because they have in their hands agreements on equity participation.  Apartments will still be transferred to their owners.  He also recalled that the readiness of Tsaritsyno 2 is 40%. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tsaritsyno 2 apartments construction progress" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58721/2164776.jpg"></div>

    <p>  At the same time, several investors expressed their readiness to complete construction on this long-term construction.  Among them is the company SK "Strategy".  However, a change of developer is possible only if the current developer gives permission for this. </p><p>  A significant role in the construction of Tsaritsyno 2 is ready to play banking organizations.  The GVSU construction company (acts as the general contractor for this project) bought out the debts of the construction company from Promsvyazbank and intends to complete the work as soon as possible so that the co-investors receive the long-awaited apartments.  Promsvyazbank is ready to finance the construction in the interests of interest holders and the city as a whole. </p>
