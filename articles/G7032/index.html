Thanks to the modern industry, you can choose something for yourself from such a variety of hats that vary in color, material, shape and technique.  It is impossible to overestimate their functionality, because, for example, a hood-cap, knitted with needles, will perfectly protect against adverse weather conditions, while adding a twist to the female image. </p><h2>  What material do we choose? </h2><p>  First, let us dwell on what material the hood-cap should be knitted with.  The headpiece should have three properties: beauty, pleasant sensations and comfort.  It is the material that is responsible for the latter. </p><p>  If you choose a mohair, the hat will be lightweight, durable and will retain heat well. </p><p>  The booklet will turn out a product with an interesting texture due to decorative irregularities: loops located on the threads. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful knitwear" class="if uuid-3204611" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3204611.jpg"></div><p>  From thick yarn you can knit a beautiful, voluminous hat.  This is indispensable in the cold and will go well with both a fur coat and a sports jacket. </p><p>  They even knit from mink.  The skin is cut into thin strips and knit the product according to a certain pattern.  The headgear will be inexpensive, but it looks no worse than a solid canvas. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If you choose angora, it will be warm and pleasant to the skin.  Since the fibers of the melange yarn are dyed in different colors, the hat will turn out to be very unusual. </p><h2>  Technique of execution.  Beginning of work </h2><p>  To get a good cap-hood with knitting needles for women (with a description that is often given to a photograph it is much more convenient), you need to prepare knitting needles, a hook, yarn, a centimeter and scissors in advance.  And also carefully study how it fits. </p><p>  Begin by measuring the head.  This is done so that the headgear is tied in size.  Now the number of stitches is calculated. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peneloping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hood Option" class="if uuid-3204638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3204638.jpg"></div><p>  For example, we collect 140 loops (and remember the two edge loops).  Knit a hood using openwork diagonally. </p><p>  The first row.  Knit three front stitches, * for the front walls two together, front, yarn and two front.  From * you need to do a repeat to the end of the row.  It should be completed with one front and one edge loops. </p><p>  Second row.  Wrong loops. </p><p>  Third row.  Knit two front, then - behind the front walls of the product two together front, make one double crochet.  At the end of the row, a double crochet is made in front of the edge loop. </p><p>  Fourth row.  Wrong loops. </p><p>  The fifth row.  Knit one front * on the front walls of the product two together, one, double crochet and two front loops.  From * repeat the pattern before the row ends.  At the end of the row, knit one at a time: front and edge. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  From purl to pattern </h2><p>  Sixth row.  Knit the wrong loops. </p><p>  Seventh row.  Knit two together front for the front wall of the cap, make one double crochet, knit two front. </p><p>  The eighth row.  All knit purl. </p><p>  The ninth row.  Repeat the pattern from the first row. </p><p>  So after the craftswoman has decided what she needs for the number of loops for work (focusing on measurements of the head), she can knit a pattern.  After this, you can begin to work using the front surface.  It is necessary to close the loops and connect the short edges, now you need to sew a hat from the inside, make it a crochet. </p><div class="photo" data-original="peneloping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beautiful knitwear" class="if uuid-3204640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3204640.jpg"></div><p>  In order to make the hat warmer, you can make a lining or knit the same part and sew together. </p><p>  All is ready!  This is how the cap-hood turned out.  To knit this headdress is not as difficult as it might seem at first glance. </p><h2>  About practical hoods </h2><p>  With this description, the needlewoman will be able to decorate any knitted blouse with a hood.  Moreover, it is suitable not only for women's things, but also for men.  To do this, you need to collect loops on the neck.  It is more convenient to take circular knitting needles.  Now you can proceed to knitting shortened rows.  Do it like this: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  The first row to knit seamy. </li><li>  Second row.  To knit six front stitches, expand the work and knit the back to two initial stitches.  The work must be turned again. </li><li>  Third row.  All knit with facial loops.  Expand and complete the six initial stitches after the seam strip.  Deploy again. </li><li>  Fourth row.  All knit purl.  Expand and knit after the strap twelve loops facing.  Turn and knit the twelve sewing stitches again.  Expand again and knit to the end of the row.  Again, expand the work and knit twelve stitches after the back side of the bar, unfold and knit the twelve stitches.  We again unfold the product and tie the purl to the row. </li></ul><p>  Another turn and knit sixteen loops after the front bezel.  Turn and knit sixteen stitches in the reverse order.  Another turn and work until the end of this series of facial.  Expand the product, knit sixteen loops after the back seam.  Now make the last U-turn and knit sixteen loops in reverse order. </p><p>  After the first two stitches from the bar and in front of the two final, you need to make additions in all six rows, one crossed yarn.  Then the cap-hood with knitting needles for women and men is knitted, based on the front surface.  When the craftswoman has reached the desired height, the loops can be closed. </p><p>  Connect both parts with a crochet hook using half crochets.  All is ready.  Wash the new product in warm water by adding shampoo, and then steam it. </p><h2>  For little princesses </h2><p>  Young women want to be fashionable.  For a girl, a cap-hood knitted with knitting needles is interesting in that such a hat can be used both independently and sewn onto an already finished product: a sweater or pullover.  For the scheme, you can take a regular rectangle. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.livemaster.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hat for children" class="if uuid-3204545" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3204545.jpg"></div><p>  First you need to dial from the edge of the neck of the loop using lifting them to the knitting needle.  It is important to lift them on the front side, because this way the product will look much neater.  Then knit all the rows with a garter stitch, that is, the front ones.  It is necessary to obtain a canvas of rectangular shape.  For the baby it will be enough to make 65 rows (for an adult, usually 75-80).  Now you can close all the loops in the last row and sew two edges using a knitted stitch.  It is convenient to use a hook.  It will be beautiful and elegant if you decorate the hat with a pompom, large buttons or thermal stickers. </p><h2>  Knit-knit hood </h2><p>  And now, briefly, about how to make a hat-cap with needles with your own hands.  A brief description, designed for craftswomen who have been knitting for more than one year. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="WxRaWT_VEL8" data-url="https://youtu.be/WxRaWT_VEL8" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/7/0/5/1/17051.jpg"></div><p>  On the knitting needles, dial one hundred and eight loops and knit three centimeters with an elastic band (alternately two front and two purl), starting from the wrong side in this way: an edge loop, two purl, * two front, two purl, repeat from * to the last loop of the row, the last - edging. </p><p>  Continue work with the front stitch until 22.5 centimeters from the set edge and in the next front row the first 54 stitches, turn the work, leave the rest of the stitches out of knitting, work in the opposite direction until the end of the row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newknittingpatterns.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Interesting hat cap" class="if uuid-3204649" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3204649.jpg"></div><p>  Now, at the beginning of each seamy row, the loops should be closed: four times one loop, three times two, two times three, one time four loops.  In total, 34 pieces are obtained.  Thirty centimeters from the set edge, close the loops. </p><p>  The second part of the hood fits symmetrically, in each front row to close the loop. </p><h2>  Warm collar </h2><p>  How to knit a hood-cap with knitting needles is understandable.  But she still needs to make a collar. </p><p>  96 loops are dialed, which are then joined into a circle.  A marker is placed so as not to lose where the beginning is, and knit an elastic band two by two twenty centimeters.  Then, according to the drawing, the loops close. </p><p>  The assembly is simple: the upper part of the hood is stitched and a collar is sewn along the lower edge. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Headdress with a collar" class="if uuid-3204593" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/35633/3204593.jpg"></div><p>  Now, perhaps, everyone understands how to properly knit the hood-cap with knitting needles.
