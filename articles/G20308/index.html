    <p>  <span>Hotel Pondok Sari Bungalow Resort 3 * (Indonesia) is quite far from the coast.</span>  <span>According to tourists, the road to the ocean is 20-30 minutes leisurely step.</span>  <span>On the way there are numerous shops selling souvenirs, so the road is not very boring.</span>  <span>Of course, not all vacationers like this remoteness of the hotel from the coast, but this nuance is fully compensated by the rather low cost of living in a hotel.</span> </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  <span>Experienced tourists recommend renting bikes, this can be done right at the hotel reception.</span>  <span>Owning such a vehicle will greatly simplify the movement of the resort.</span>  <span>You can quickly get to the beach, as well as visit the modest sights of Kuta.</span> </p><h2>  A bit about Bali </h2><p>  <span>Why recently, in terms of beach holidays, a holiday in Bali has been popular?</span>  <span>Prices for tours offered by operators in this area are incredibly attractive for tourists.</span>  <span>It is the low cost of travel that is a decisive factor for many vacationers.</span>  <span>Moreover, Bali is an interesting country in terms of nature, exotic, temples and attractions.</span>  <span>There is always something to see.</span>  <span>The country is able to surprise even those people who travel a lot in South Asia.</span> </p><p>  <span>Undoubtedly, all Asian countries have something in common, but at the same time, each is unique in its own way.</span>  <span>In this regard, the <span>island of Bali</span> is a real storehouse of a foreign culture, which you certainly want to know at least a little.</span>  <span>Having decided to visit the island, prepare in advance for the fact that part of the time you just need to devote to trips and attractions.</span>  <span>A bounty-style beach vacation is a great prospect, but you need to look at the local exotic too.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>It is worth noting that the most developed tourist towns on the island are Seminyak and Kuta.</span>  <span>In general, these two resorts are very similar to each other: the ocean, beaches, parties, bars and restaurants.</span>  <span>However, Kuta is more attractive to young people, thanks to affordable prices.</span>  <span><span>The cost of a standard room per day is approximately 1678 rubles, there are also promotional offers.</span></span>  <span><span>Often tourists buy a tour.</span></span>  <span><span>Accommodation in a <span>Superior double</span> room <span>for 7 nights will cost about 100,000 rubles.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The price includes breakfast.</span></span></span> </p><p>  <span>The resort has also been chosen by numerous surf lovers.</span>  <span>The local coast is an ideal place for those who want to conquer the wave.</span>  <span>For this reason, the district has an incredible number of schools and rental points for surfing equipment.</span> </p><h2>  Pondok Sari Bungalow Resort: reviews </h2><p>  <span>Summing up the conversation about the hotel, I want to turn to the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.</span>  <span>What are your holidaymakers' experiences with Pondok Sari Bungalow Resort?</span>  <span>The description of the hotel, given by us earlier, gives only an approximate idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel, and real reviews of tourists will help to make a real picture.</span> </p>

    <p>  <span>It is worth noting that the reviews about the hotel are quite controversial.</span>  <span>Some tourists are satisfied with living in it, especially considering the budget cost of apartments, while others, on the contrary, express a lot of discontent.</span>  <span>And now about all the nuances in order.</span> </p><p>  <span>The first thing you should pay attention to holidaymakers: the hotel is significantly removed from the coast.</span>  <span>If for someone this moment is very important, then you should look for another option.</span> </p><p>  <span>And now about the numbers.</span>  <span>Hotel apartments are not very diverse.</span>  <span>They are decorated with national-style wooden furniture.</span>  <span>All interior items are not new, but in good condition.</span>  <span>In principle, the apartments have everything that an unpretentious tourist needs.</span>  <span>In the closet you can even find an iron and an ironing board, which is surprising for a hotel of this category.</span>  <span>Rooms also include tumble dryers and umbrellas.</span>  <span>For Bali, heavy rains are normal.</span>  <span>The island has a fairly high humidity, so it is extremely difficult to dry things.</span>  <span>Yes, and in some apartments you can stumble on mold.</span> </p><p>  <span>All rooms have air conditioning, which are working properly, which is important at high temperatures.</span>  <span>The rest of the apartment is rather modest.</span>  <span>According to tourists, some rooms do not have windows, which is quite inconvenient.</span>  <span>In addition, it is worth knowing that all the apartments of the hotel are quite modest in size, there are no spacious rooms.</span> </p><p>  <span>According to tourists, the cleaning of apartments is superficial.</span>  <span>Maids arrive daily at nine in the morning.</span>  <span>Until this time, it is advisable to leave the room, otherwise you run the risk of simply being left without cleaning.</span>  <span>Guests have many complaints about linen.</span>  <span>Towels are very old and extremely washed, although they are changed regularly, subsequent ones are no better than the previous ones.</span>  <span>Bed linen has long been in need of replacement.</span> </p>
