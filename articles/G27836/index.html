The advantages are that relaxation and treatment can be combined with visiting holy and simply interesting places at any time convenient for you.

    <h2>  Curious historical facts </h2><p>  In the middle of the XVI century, the Russians began the active development of the Ufa river basin.  A jail (defensive fortress), now the <span>capital of Bashkiria,</span> was erected at its mouth <span>.</span>  The archer commander sent his soldiers to scout the surroundings.  Cossacks stumbled upon a river with bitter-salty, unpleasantly smelling water.  Climbing up a little along it, they found 3 springs with water even more concentrated.  Above them, the river was ordinary, fresh.  As it turned out, the locals had long been driving cattle to these sources so that it was healthy and obese.  The herders themselves drank water to get rid of ailments.  In those places, another prison was erected, and later a salt factory.  Gradually, the prison turned into the city of Solovarny, and after 1924 it became the village of Krasnousolsky.  In the same year, a doctor, two nurses, builders and a cook were sent here.  A little distance from the village put a few wooden houses.  So the sanatorium "Krasnousolsk" was formed.  Rest by savages in these places has been popular for a very long time, only before everything was free, and now the entrance and use of the pools is worth the money.  But, despite the thriving business, there are hundreds of people at the resort.  And it helps! </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Krasnousolsk rest savage 2014" class="if" height="347" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/465790.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Living and dead water </h2><p>  Holidays in Krasnousolsk are popular mainly due to healing sources.  They are divided into three groups.  In the 1st, keys are born from the banks of the Usolka River.  Their main component is carbonic limestones.  In the 2nd group, the springs hit on the left side of the river, the rocks of which formed in the <span>Quaternary.</span>  Water in these two groups, never mixing with each other, rises to the surface from a depth of up to 600 meters.  That is why it is so icy.  The 3rd group is represented by the keys of the right bank, consisting of gypsum from the Kungur stratum.  It is not very highly mineralized, especially the Gorky Klyuch spring (only 2.2 g / l).  But the water of the first two groups has a mineralization of about 77-78 g / l.  Vacationers call them springs with living water, dead and rejuvenating.  According to an unwritten law, one must bathe in all three in order.  Small springs with locker rooms were built near the springs.  It is allowed to swim both organized and savages. </p>

Such rules in the sanatorium "Krasnousolsk".  Rest by savages in this case is quite acceptable, the main thing is to enter the territory.  Since the 90s, ‚Äúhealth‚Äù began to be bottled, for which purpose the corresponding enterprise was built.  Water for bottling is taken from a weakly mineralized source No. 12. The brands entering the stores of Russia are ‚ÄúUfa‚Äù and ‚ÄúKrasnousolskaya‚Äù.  These waters are carbonated, but for treatment, the bottles need to be left open for a while.  The composition of water is as follows: sulfates, chlorides, bicarbonates, calcium, sodium, magnesium, lithium, manganese, copper, potassium and other chemical elements.

    <h2>  Miracle icon </h2><p>  For the sake of this miracle, crowds of people go to "Krasnousolsk" savage.  Bashkiria is an amazing country full of unsolved mysteries.  One of them is the Tabyn Icon of the Mother of God.  According to legend, she appeared to people four times, and each time this was accompanied by miracles.  So, at its first appearance, it was discovered by Bashkir shepherds and chopped into pieces.  After that, they all went blind.  Ripened only after sincere repentance and supplication for forgiveness.  There are several dozens of officially documented cases where the icon healed adults and children, saved the city from an epidemic of cholera, from fires.  In Krasnousolsk, in the temple, a list (copy) of this icon is kept.  Below is a holy cave where people pray, light candles, leave notes with wishes.  A lot of people testify that the icon helps now, especially for those who can‚Äôt conceive and bear a baby. </p><h2>  Krasnousolsk.  Wild Day 2014 </h2><p>  Sanatorium Krasnousolsk occupies a huge area.  Its territory is beautiful and remarkably well-maintained.  For vacationers there are saunas, bars, children's playrooms, fitness centers.  The housing stock is represented by seven buildings and a magnificent cottage with suites, junior suites and standard.  They have all the necessary modern equipment, including satellite TV, as well as a shower and toilet.  But a ticket to the resort is expensive.  Therefore, rest as a savage, that is, accommodation in the private sector of Krasnousolsky or in tents on the banks of the Usolka, is a wonderful option.  Kursovka (recently it is sold only with food) can always be purchased separately.  But if you came only for the weekend, you can do without it.  You can eat in several cafes located in the resort or in the village.  Some cook at the stake.  It turns out two to three times cheaper. </p>

    <h2>  Some cons </h2><p>  Most people warmly recall Krasnousolsk, the rest as a savage.  Photos taken as a souvenir better than any words convey the unique beauty of these places, the stages of self-treatment, the popularity of sources and the holy temple.  They come here all year round, especially at Epiphany, swimming in holy water.  However, such popularity has its negative sides.  So, in recent years, the resort has become too crowded.  Those who want to relax calmer come on weekdays.  On weekends and holidays, crowds of people and beer sold on every corner can spoil the calmer vacation.  But if you do not pay attention to such trifles, treat the body, and take the walks through the woods, inhale the healing aroma of needles, admire landscapes of unearthly beauty, then Krasnousolsk will leave only good memories. </p>
