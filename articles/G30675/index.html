    <h2>  What is accounting reporting? </h2><p>  First, a little theory about accounting.  The facts about it will be useful to us from the point of view of understanding the tasks facing the financial services of any commercial company. </p><p>  We noted above that financial statements should form enterprises in the status of legal entities.  This is an important nuance, since entrepreneurs who are, from the point of view of the legislation of the Russian Federation, individuals, should not conduct accounting, as well as fill out reports on the basis of the corresponding registers.  Obligations of the individual entrepreneur in terms of financial accounting are reduced to the book of income and expenses. </p><p>  Under the financial statements of a legal entity it is customary to understand the totality of information that reflects the results of the economic activity of the enterprise within the reporting period.  This information is formed mainly due to indicators recorded in accounting registers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  The considered type of reporting refers to the key at the enterprise, along with tax and management.  The information that is reflected in it is used to assess the financial condition of the company, its growth prospects, the correctness of significant indicators of economic activity, as well as tax reporting.  This information may be of interest to managers, owners of the company, government agencies. </p><p>  An important role is played by financial statements in the interaction of the enterprise with potential creditors and investors.  Persons interested in investing in the company will seek to consider reliable sources that will adequately assess the financial condition of the company.  Among those that fully satisfy these criteria are financial statements.  It is compiled and certified by competent employees of the company, sometimes with the involvement of external independent consultants who are able to analyze how correctly a particular section of the balance is filled out (‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù, for example), what points can be improved in the reporting procedure used . </p>

    <p>  The advantage of the sources in question is regularity.  Financial statements can be prepared once a year or more often, depending on the requirements of the law, as well as the wishes of interested parties, such as owners and creditors.  The financial statements, as a rule, are prepared according to standard forms, which are approved by regulatory bodies - first of all, by the RF Ministry of Finance.  It reflects a variety of economic indicators: asset, liability balance sheet, capital and reserves of the company. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The financial statements should correlate with the primary sources, as well as the registers used by the financial services of the enterprise.  The most important task of this type of reporting is to identify significant facts that reflect the financial stability of the company, the presence of certain reserves, the dynamics of income and expenses. </p><h2>  What are the features of accounting in a small enterprise? </h2><p>  Accounting at enterprises related to small business can differ significantly from the corresponding procedures that characterize the activities of medium and large firms.  First of all, it is worth considering the criteria for classifying an economic entity as a small enterprise.  This includes the company: </p><ul><li>  in which the authorized capital is more than 25% private; </li><li>  which employs from 15 to 100 people, and the annual revenue is 120-800 million rubles (if the business entity has less staff and turnover, then it will refer to the microenterprise). </li></ul><p>  The main feature of accounting in a small enterprise is the ability to keep it in a simplified format.  It differs significantly from the general accounting scheme, which involves: </p><ul><li>  filling out a balance sheet, a report on financial results, as well as various applications that supplement them; </li><li>  execution in the cases provided for by law of an audit report; </li><li>  preparation of an explanatory note to the balance sheet and the report on financial results. </li></ul><p>  Among the main sections of the financial statements - ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù in the balance sheet.  This is an information block reflecting financial indicators, the most important, from the point of view of assessing economic efficiency, of a company.  The general procedure for accounting requires its mandatory completion.  Simplified also involves filling in the section "Capital and reserves" in the balance sheet.  This is a mandatory component of the reporting of commercial firms, despite the fact that the simplified accounting procedure is characterized by a number of significant preferences for small enterprises.  Namely: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  the ability not to draw up annexes to the balance sheet and an explanatory note to it (if there is no objective need for this); </li><li>  the ability not to include figures on economic results in groups of articles in reporting documents (that is, there is no legislative requirement to indicate indicators for specific articles). </li></ul>

    <p>  As regards accounting directly, a small enterprise can conduct it both in a simple form, without registers, and in a standard form.  At the same time, a company that has the appropriate status and uses the preferences established by law for simplified accounting should be aware that the fixation of business transactions must meet the criterion of rationality.  Experts recommend following a similar rule in reporting. </p><p>  So, it makes sense, if possible, to nevertheless specify the indicators for individual articles within the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves" in the balance sheet of a small enterprise.  Let us consider in more detail how the corresponding reporting area can be filled. </p><h2>  Filling out the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù in the balance sheet: what information is reflected in it? </h2><p>  The section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù in the balance sheet is an information block, which consists of 7 lines.  The task of the accountant is to reflect in them such indicators as: </p><ul><li>  the size of the authorized capital of the company; </li><li>  the price of own shares of the company that are bought back from their owners; </li><li>  size of additional reserve capital; </li><li>  the amount of retained earnings or the size of the uncovered loss of the organization. </li></ul><p>  The size of the <span>authorized capital of the</span> company is reflected in line 1310. We study the features of its completion in more detail. </p><h2>  Share capital in the balance sheet: line 1310 </h2><p>  This line of balance (‚ÄúCapital and reserves") involves the reflection of the amount of the authorized capital corresponding to that defined in the constituent documents of the enterprise.  It does not matter the fact of partial payment by one of the founders of the company of its share.  Even if one of the investors, in principle, has not contributed the required amount to the authorized capital, the corresponding indicator in the ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù section of the balance sheet is recorded. </p><p>  To correctly fill in the line in question, you should use the credit balance on account 80, used in accounting registers.  Next, the accountant needs to reflect the correct information on the company's own shares. </p><h2>  Own shares in the balance sheet: line 1320 </h2><p>  Filling in the corresponding line of the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù in the balance sheet is a procedure that may be characterized by some features for firms in the status of AO and LLC. </p><p>  So, <span>joint-stock companies,</span> generating reports and reflecting the data on it in line 1320, indicate information on their own shares, which are bought directly from their holders.  LLC record information on the value of shares within the authorized capital, which are purchased, in turn, from the founders of the enterprise. </p>

    <p>  To fill in the considered line of the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù, it is necessary to use the data on the debit balance in the account 81. Next, it is necessary to reflect in the reporting information on the additional and reserve capital.  We will study the nuances of this procedure in more detail. </p><h2>  Additional and reserve capital in the balance sheet: line 1350 </h2><p>  Relevant information is the most important characteristic of such a source as the balance sheet (‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù).  What is included in them? </p><p>  Regarding additional capital - it can be formed in 3 ways: </p><ul><li>  upon revaluation of assets classified as non-current; </li><li>  at the expense of income generated in the process of issuing securities (if, for example, the shares of the company are traded at a value in excess of par), at the expense of the contributions of the founders - if it is an LLC; </li><li>  due to the restored VAT at the time of transfer of a property to the authorized capital. </li></ul><p>  In order to correctly reflect the numbers on line 1350, you must use the information in the framework of the credit balance of account 83. The reserve capital of the enterprise is also reflected in the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù.  The line code in the balance sheet intended to indicate the value of this resource is 1360. </p><p>  Information on the appropriate <span>type of capital</span> in the financial statements reflect companies with a reserve fund.  In the general case, these are joint-stock companies, since they are obliged to form it by virtue of the requirements of Russian legislation.  <span>The reserve fund of</span> JSC is formed by compulsory deductions - in the amount of 5% of net profit or more.  As soon as it reaches the value prescribed in the constituent documents of the enterprise, the corresponding deductions can be stopped.  In this case, the value of the reserve fund should be 5% or more of the size of the authorized capital of the company. </p><p>  Of course, the LLC also has the right to form an appropriate fund.  Its value and the order of capital transfer in order to create the appropriate resource are determined in the management policy of the organization. </p><p>  In order to correctly reflect the figures for reserve capital in the balance sheet, you must use the information about the credit balance in the account 82. The next information block of the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù in the balance sheet is line 1370. It reflects data on retained earnings of the company. </p><h2>  Retained earnings in the balance sheet: line 1370 </h2><p>  Information on line 1370 of the balance sheet should reflect all firms with commercial turnover.  The corresponding indicator can be represented by profit or uncovered losses.  In order to enter the correct data into the line in question, it is necessary to use the information from account 84. In this case, it may be necessary to transfer the debit or credit balance in the corresponding account to the balance sheet.  Note that by that time, the reformation of the balance sheet of the enterprise should be carried out.  It involves the closure of accounts such as 90, 91, as well as 99. </p><p>  Another important block in the section ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù in the balance sheet of a small enterprise is line 1320. It reflects the value of the company's own shares. </p><h2>  Own shares in the balance sheet: 1320 </h2><p>  Information on this line can be recorded by both AO and LLC (in case the company buys certain shares from the founders who are leaving the business).  AOs reflect in the corresponding block the value of securities purchased from their owners, and LLC - a share in the authorized capital acquired from the founders. </p><p>  In order to correctly reflect the information in line 1320, the accountant needs to use the data on the debit balance in account 81. </p><h2>  Small Business Reporting: Other Nuances </h2><p>  So, we examined how the accountant of a small business is filled in Section III of the balance sheet - ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù.  It will be useful to study additionally a number of other information characterizing the formation of financial statements in a company with an appropriate status. </p><p>  The legislation of the Russian Federation allows small enterprises to independently develop documents through which reporting will be generated.  For example, if a company does not fill out one or another balance sheet item (‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù includes, as we now know, quite a few lines, and not all of them will necessarily be filled in by the company - in some cases it may simply not have the necessary data) , then she has the right to exclude it from those forms that are used for reporting purposes. </p>

    <p>  A small business that uses simplified accounting methods can use registers without <span>double entry.</span>  But this opportunity should be used only if the appropriate accounting scheme does not interfere with the extraction of the required information to fill out such an information block of financial statements as the ‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù section.  The balance sheet liability, as well as its asset, in many cases can be correctly filled only if the accounts are examined in the context of double entry for various business transactions. </p><p>  Another nuance that characterizes accounting in a small enterprise is the ability to reduce the total number of accounts related to synthetic.  The fact is that firms that are larger are required to use the appropriate accounts on the list, which is approved by law.  On its basis, an internal corporate working chart of accounts is drawn up.  In turn, small enterprises, if accounting is carried out in them within the framework of a limited list of business transactions, has the right not to use their <span>synthetic accounts</span> , obligatory for large firms, and not to approve them in the work plan.  However, existing ones should fully reflect the essence of business processes.  The accountant should not have problems with how to calculate the capital and reserves in the balance using registers. </p>

    <p>  It can be noted that many firms in practice do not use the opportunity under consideration precisely in order to avoid situations when, in order to fill out an information block in the financial statements, there is a lack of information in accounting registers.  But if the company is confident that such precedents can be avoided, it has the right to use a simplified registration scheme for business transactions.  For this can be used, for example, a small book in volume and not complicated in structure. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  So, we studied the essence of accounting in a small enterprise, examined what constitutes the balance sheet (‚ÄúCapital and reserves‚Äù), which is included in it.  Firms with the appropriate status, by law, have the right to conduct accounting according to simplified schemes, as well as generate reports using less complicated registers and documents.  But in terms of filling the balance sheet, small enterprises actually have few advantages over larger ones, since significant economic indicators are recorded in the corresponding information blocks.  It is undesirable to ignore them in the preparation of reports - a key source of information about the financial position of a commercial company. </p>
