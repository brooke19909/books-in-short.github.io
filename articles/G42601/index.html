It was taken under the protection of UNESCO back in 1980.  Currently, it is an elite resort for wealthy tourists.  But at the same time, the city is not focused on children's leisure.  In local hotels there is no children's animation.  But the resort has a great variety of all kinds of restaurants, hotels, cafes, bars. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman hotel 3 cyprus paphos reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1522383.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Paphos attracts guests from all over the world not with a developed infrastructure, but with a rich cultural heritage, its history has been at least 5 thousand years old.  The city was founded by Agaperon.  Here a temple was built in honor of the goddess of love, which now attracts an incredible number of tourists.  One of the rulers of Paphos decided to move the city a little closer to the shore, which is why there was a division into a new and an old part. </p><p>  Currently, Paphos is divided into two parts.  Upper is located on a hill and is a commercial center.  And at the bottom are hotels, cafes and restaurants.  Local authorities are constantly working to make the city even more interesting for tourists.  Now in the city a completely new promenade has been built along the sea, walking along which you can admire beautiful landscapes. </p><h2>  How to get to the resort? </h2><p>  We have already said that there is no difficulty in getting to the Roman Boutique Hotel 3 * (Cyprus, Paphos).  The reviews of tourists confirm this.  Paphos has its own airport, but it is from Russia that not many planes fly here.  But in Larnaca, the choice of flights is much greater.  For example, there are direct flights from Moscow (flight duration is about 4 hours), the cost of which starts from 200 euros.  The price of tickets to the airport in Paphos is always somehow more expensive.  This point is worth considering.  And from the airport to the hotel can be easily reached by bus.  Cyprus has excellent transport links. </p><p>  To get from Larnaca to Roman Boutique Hotel 3 * (Cyprus, Paphos), you can use three different options.  The first is to arrange a transfer (it is convenient and not so expensive).  Taxi services will cost about 110 euros.  The third option is the cheapest, but more tedious and time consuming, since you have to make transplants. </p><h2>  Resort beaches </h2><p>  <span>The beaches of Paphos</span> have a completely different coating: stone and sand.  Sea calls are far from always convenient, especially near rocky shores.  The quality of the coast does not depend on the level of your chosen hotel.  A three-star hotel can be located on a better beach than a five-star hotel.  The fact is that the resort was originally aimed at the British and Germans, who prefer to relax by the pool than go to the sea.  When choosing a hotel, you should definitely pay attention to this nuance. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman hotel 3 paphos cyprus description" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1522389.jpg" width="600"></div><strong> </strong>

    <p>  It is believed that the best beach in Paphos is located in <span>Coral Bay,</span> and in Lara Bay you can admire the most beautiful coast on the island, there is also a reserve of <span>green sea turtles.</span> </p><h2>  Paphos Attractions </h2><p>  Paphos is rich in cultural and historical heritage, there is an incredible number of attractions.  During the excavations in the old part of the city, a large number of mosaics were discovered, created long before our era.  In those days, they decorated not only temples, but also the houses of the nobility.  A museum was created in Paphos where you can see the best mosaic paintings.  In addition, in the city you can see the ancient theater "Odeon", the ruins of an ancient castle, a complex of "royal graves".  It is also worth visiting the fishing village of Lachi, the Akamas Nature Reserve, the Panaya Hrizoroyatissa and Agios Neophytos Monastery. </p><p>  Aphrodite's baths are located near Paphos, as the myth says, it was here that the goddess came to the coast from sea foam.  However, in real life this place is completely unattractive. </p><p>  Most of the monuments of Paphos (catacombs of St. Solomon, the column of the Apostle Paul, mosaics of the House of Dionysus and others) are included in the UNESCO list of values. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman boutique hotel 3 cyprus paphos reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1522399.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Paphos is famous not only for its beaches and excursions, but also for its unique nature.  A pine forest grows in the middle of the city; its healing air has been cured of diseases for many centuries.  And on the outskirts of Paphos there is a beautiful park, which is home to hundreds of species of birds and even exotic animals.  Alleys of the park are buried in verdure, walking along them you can admire its inhabitants. </p><p>  In Paphos there is a water park, which is worth a visit with children.  No less interesting is the aquarium, in which Mediterranean and tropical fish live in 72 aquariums, and a bird park with pink flamingos, toucans, parrots, cranes and other birds. </p><h2>  Hotel Roman Hotel 3 * (Cyprus, Paphos): reviews </h2><p>  Speaking about the hotel, I want to discuss the reviews of tourists who managed to visit it.  Hotel Roman Hotel 3 * (Cyprus, Paphos) has a very favorable location.  You can walk to the beach in five minutes, a huge shopping center is nearby, where you can find anything.  Nearby there is an archaeological museum, to other attractions you need to walk or drive up by public transport. </p><p>  The hotel itself has an unusual design, all interiors are designed in the same Greek style.  The rooms and lounges are decorated with antique themes.  The hotel apartments are beautiful and clean, they are equipped with good furniture.  Maids cleaned daily, and do it very high quality.  Towels are changed daily.  Free internet is available only in public places, if you wish, you can pay 1 EUR per day and then you can use Wi-Fi in the room. </p><p>  The hotel is very attentive and nice staff.

    <p>  I would like to pay special attention to food at the Roman Hotel 3 * (Cyprus, Paphos).  Reviews of tourists speak of its worthy level.  According to some vacationers, the food in the hotel matches even four stars.  For breakfast, the restaurant serves several types of yogurt and cereal, milk, toast, jams, cereals, fried mushrooms, fried eggs, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables. </p><p>  For lunch and dinner, you can enjoy pork, chicken, fish, snacks, salads, shrimps and other seafood.  At the buffet there is always a huge variety of dishes.  For children, you can choose a more dietary meal.  Active tourists prefer to take only breakfast and dinner, because they travel a lot.  In general, it is much more profitable to take three meals a day, because the food is good and of high quality.  And dinners in neighboring cafes and restaurants will cost much more than in a hotel. </p><p>  The hotel is close to a nice sandy beach.  However, the seabed is rocky.  Bridges have been built on the coast, along which you can go to the depth, bypassing stones.  There are no crowds on the beach even in season.  In Paphos, there is a completely sandy beach - Coral Bay, which can be reached by bus (611).  On it sunbeds and umbrellas are paid, the cost is 7.5 euros. </p><p>  The hotel has a local guide where you can purchase tickets for excursions.  Near the beach there is an agency that also offers all kinds of trips, the prices for tours in it are lower than in a hotel.  Near the hotel are all the main attractions of the city: tombs, catacombs, archaeological museum, etc., which you can explore on your own, they can be reached on foot.  According to tourists, it is interesting to visit a jeep safari, which leaves an amazing impression.  In order to see all the most interesting, perhaps, one trip is not enough. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="roman hotel 3 cyprus paphos reviews" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1522405.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hotel is surrounded by a small garden and surrounded by greenery, although the territory is small, but very well-groomed and beautiful.  Here you can take beautiful photos.  On the territory there is a beautiful pool, to which even those vacationers who do not like artificial ponds, but prefer the open sea, will not remain indifferent. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Summing up the conversation about the Roman Hotel 3 * hotel (Cyprus, Paphos), the reviews of which are given in the article, I want to note that the hotel is a good option for a budget holiday in a fairly expensive resort, as evidenced by the many positive reviews of tourists. </p>
