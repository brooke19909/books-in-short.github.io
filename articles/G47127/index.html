This is hard to find in stores.  Single copies of the original bags made by needlewomen can be found in the markets.  And if you yourself know how to crochet, the bag, of course, will be a great opportunity to realize your creative abilities.  The article will introduce you to various options for this accessory and the technique of knitting original bags. </p><h2>  Learn to knit </h2><p>  Handicraft is highly appreciated.  Except fashionistas can afford to buy exclusive goods.  They buy their clothes in boutiques.  What to do for those who want to have an original knitted bag, but, having learned the prices for such an accessory, cannot buy it?  The answer is one - you need to learn how to knit yourself.  There is nothing complicated in this work, the main thing is to have desire and imagination.  Sometimes, surprisingly, beginner knitters get really unique things. </p><h2>  Necessary materials and threads </h2><p>  For knitting a bag of yarn, it is best to take 100% cotton, 100 g of which is 250 meters.  The bag will take about 2 skeins of such yarn.  The main pattern of the bag should be tight, that is, you need to knit tight.  That is why a hook of 2.5 mm, and not 3 mm, is required, as the instruction on a skein with yarn recommends. </p><div class="photo" data-original="schoenstricken.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Threads for knitting bags" class="if uuid-2511373" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2511373.jpg"></div><p>  The bottom of the bag can be made from a regular plastic folder or folder.  It is better to take the color of yarn so that the plastic does not shine through.  This frame is tied with crochets.  In this case, the bottom will be stiff.  But you can simply tie the bottom of yarn or a bag in the form of a bag, that is, without designing the bottom. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  What can be useful for knitting a bag?  Lining fabric may be required.  For an openwork bag, an atlas is suitable.  Glue cloth is needed to keep the bag in shape.  The best option is doubler.  Handles for a bag and a cord for decorating wooden beads can be purchased at a needlework store.  If you wish, the pens can be tied in the form of a cord. </p><h2>  Knitting pattern </h2><p>  The motive for knitted bags (photo 1) can be any: tight knitting with simple single crochet columns, sirloin pattern or lace, which is described below. </p><p>  It is assumed that the beginning of the bag, that is, its bottom, is connected by dense single crochet columns, approximately to a height of 10-15 centimeters.  Next, perform the drawing itself. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Figure and Description" class="if uuid-2511019" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2511019.jpg"></div><p>  This pattern knits the desired number of rows, that is, it turns out some part of the height of the bag.  You need to finish the product with a dense viscous, single crochet columns.  This is necessary so that then you can easily sew the lining to the top of the knitted bag. </p><h2>  Job Description </h2><p>  The bag will look beautiful if lined.  To do this, you need to know the dimensions of the finished product.  For example, the height of the bag is 40 cm and the width is 30 cm. We make the cut on the adhesive fabric, taking into account the allowances for the seams of 1.5 cm to the width.  But we take the length by 3 centimeters less so that the lining is below the top edge of the bag.  It turned out a square of 74x63 cm. 2 of these cuts are cut out of the lining material, since the lining should be both inside the bag and on the knitted side. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  We attach the adhesive fabric with the rough side to the wrong side of one of the squares of the lining material.  Cover with a thin cloth and begin to glue, ironing thoroughly with an iron.  After cooling, we add the ironed material in half and sweep the bottom and from one side.  Similarly, we sweep the lining without an adhesive base.  Next, on a typewriter, you need to sew the sour cream parts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Sewing a lining to a knitted bag" class="if uuid-2510891" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2510891.jpg"></div><h2>  We connect a lining and a bag </h2><p>  The upper parts of the lining with an adhesive base and without it are tucked 1 cm and sweep.  We turn the glued lining on the front side, and do not twist the second.  Next, we put one into the other and connect with pins, after which we connect them with a line on a typewriter.  We insert the finished lining into the bag.  We turn the edge of the knitted bag onto a stitched lining.  We sweep away the details and sew on a typewriter.  And you need to leave a supply of knitted fabric for sewing zippers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="stitching the lock in a knitted bag" class="if uuid-2510923" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2510923.jpg"></div><p>  Next you should sew a zipper into a hand-knitted bag.  If necessary, it is shortened.  The pin is pinned to the edge of the bag, but not too close to the zipper, leaving 2 mm to it so that the "dog" walks freely.  Sew swept zipper on a typewriter. </p><h2>  Combo Bag </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, the creation of a combination bag would be an original idea for those who like to do needlework.  The needlewomen probably have some old bag that has decent handles, and it itself is not worn out yet, but I don‚Äôt feel like wearing it anymore, but it‚Äôs a pity to throw it away.  It can be freshened by combining with a knitted fabric.  Take, for example, a bag in which the sidewalls are rubbed, and the handles and facades are in good condition. </p><p>  In this case, you need to make a pattern by measuring a rare thing, by which to tie the necessary side parts, and as a result you will get a fashionable bag.  In the bag, which is shown in the photo below, the sidewalls are crocheted with columns with a crochet of canvas <span>(linen) thread.</span>  The lining of the bag is saved and sewn to the newly connected parts of the product.  The connection of the knitted insert and the facades of the bag is made with a crochet, a regular single crochet.  As a decoration, you can make a brush on a chain of long canvas threads on one of the handles of a bag. </p><div class="photo" data-original="m.blog.naver.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Crochet combined bag in leatherette and knitted fabric" class="if uuid-2508507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2508507.jpg"></div><h2>  Beach bag </h2><p>  What should be a crocheted summer bag?  Of course, bright.  She should look like a summer, raising the mood of her owner, giving her a carefree look.  Solid bags of different colors can also perfectly complement the image. </p><p>  Indispensable for the beach bag-bag.  She is knitted in the form of a bag.  It has a round bottom and vertical walls.  This bag is made of multi-colored threads.  You can make it just striped or with a beautiful ornament.  It all depends on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa knitter.  Knitting starts from the bottom of the bag: with 3 loops closed in a ring.  Next, knitting goes with crochet columns No. 2.5-3 mm with a gradual expansion of the bottom by adding in each row additional crochet columns at equal intervals of loops.  The optimal size of the bottom of such a bag is about 25 centimeters.  Further, the bag is knitted without adding loops, thereby forming its sidewalls. </p><div class="photo" data-original="schoenstricken.de" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knitting sack bags for the beach" class="if uuid-2511440" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2511440.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the knitted bag depends on the purpose of its use.  If you plan to go to the beach with her, she should be roomy and have a wall height of about 40-50 centimeters.  The originality of this bag will be given by a cord that is drawn up in its upper part, which is tightened and tied in the form of a knot or bow.  The handles of such a bag should be wide: at least 5 centimeters, so that they lie comfortably on the shoulder and do not press when it is filled with things. </p><p>  The most beautiful of all the cords that are crocheted is a pearl flagellum, sometimes called a "caterpillar."  How to tie such a cord is shown in the proposed video material.  The lesson lasts only 4 minutes, but this is enough to get the knitting skill.  The ability to knit such a tourniquet will come in handy in the future, since this little thing is indispensable when decorating products. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="-wDfrzIfFqg" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wDfrzIfFqg" data-width="560" data-height="315"><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/3/8/1/4/3814.jpg"></div><h2>  Original ideas </h2><p>  The bags that we are going to talk about here are so easy to knit that even the needlewoman who had not crocheted before could handle the job and picked it up for the first time.  In the fourth photo are knitted <span>bags.</span>  <span>A description of the</span> work on their creation will be considered in this part of the article. </p><p>  A round bag is already attractive only for its youth.  It can be knitted both from canvas and from any cotton thread.  The capacity of the bag depends on the size of the circle.  You can knit a miniature accessory that only fits a wallet, keys and some of the makeup.  This will be a great addition to casual casual wear.  A large bag in combination with a wide-brimmed hat will perfectly complement the beach ensemble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Original knitted bags" class="if uuid-2511492" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2511492.jpg"></div><p>  By the appearance of a round bag, it is clear that it consists of two circles and a rectangular strip connecting them and at the same time being the bottom and sides.  As handles for a knitted bag, you can use a cord, an ordinary chain of two or three rows of loops or a leather belt. </p><p>  You can sew zipper in this bag.  In this case, the part between the circles is knitted so that both ends have a triangular shape.  The zipper is sewn along the length of the upper semicircle.  A button can be sewn to the miniature handbag on the inside of the semicircles. </p><h2>  Bag of squares </h2><p>  To tie a bag of squares, as in the photo, you must first complete the individual elements. </p><p>  Start knitting a square with a chain of three loops.  At the center of this chain, eight single crochets are made.  Next, you need to knit three single crochet in the first stitch, one in the next.  Continue this way to the end of the row. </p><div class="photo" data-original="creatys.info" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Knit square motif bag" class="if uuid-2511578" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14966/2511578.jpg"></div><p>  The resulting new row should have sixteen loops.  To note which loops are increasing, you need to put markers.  This is the central loop of three posts.  Now, in each subsequent row in this loop, three single crochet columns are knitted.  Due to the increase in each row is an increase in the square. </p><p>  Having connected the necessary square in size, we proceed to the manufacture of the following.  For a handbag in the penultimate photo, you need three identical squares, and for an accessory with various decorative elements (photo above) - four. </p><p>  In fact, there is nothing complicated in knitting bags.  The proverb says: ‚ÄúThe road will be overpowered by the one who walks.‚Äù It remains to wish the needlewomen good and interesting ideas. </p>
