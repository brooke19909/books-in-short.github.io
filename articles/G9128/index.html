This financial institution is most popular not only with those who want to get a loan to buy household appliances or an apartment, but also with customers who want to receive additional income from their savings account.  This method of investing money is now considered very relevant.  According to statistics for 2017, Sberbank's deposit proposals reached their peak and this institution ranked first in terms of the volume of transactions performed.  In addition, the bank takes first positions in terms of assets, as well as according to the largest capital. </p>

    <p>  <span>You can open a deposit</span> not only in the capital and major cities, but also in the region.  Of course, some banks offer investors more favorable conditions and higher interest rates, but this does not mean the reliability of organizations.  Since such accounts are opened for a rather long period, the client must be absolutely sure of the solvency of the selected financial institution.  Based on this parameter, Sberbank's deposit offers are considered the best by far. </p><h2>  Design Features </h2><p>  To open a deposit, many prefer to personally visit a bank branch.  However, it is worth paying attention to the fact that when registering online, customers are offered more favorable conditions.  Almost all tariffs provide for an increase in the annual rate if a person chooses to make a deposit via the Internet. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Also, Sberbank deposit offers are more beneficial for those who are already a client of this financial institution.  To choose the most interesting conditions of the deposit, it is worthwhile to consider in more detail the features relevant in 2017-2018.  tariffs. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúJust 7%‚Äù </h2><p>  This offer of Sberbank on deposits is a seasonal deposit, which can be easily drawn up if you have access to your personal account or after installing the official mobile application.  You can also use an ATM.  However, it is worth considering that these conditions are valid only until December 31 of the current year.  Therefore, this New Year's offer of Sberbank on deposits is limited. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the conditions of the deposit, then only the national currency is accepted.  The validity of the tariff is 5 months with a minimum contribution amount of 100 thousand rubles.  At the same time, <span>replenishment of the account</span> or partial withdrawal of funds is not provided.  Interest on the deposit (7%) is accrued at the end of the 5th month. </p><h2>  "Good year" </h2><p>  This is another Sberbank deposit offer for New Year, which is valid only until the end of this year.  According to the conditions of the deposit, the interest rate is 8% if the depositor has contributed the national currency (dollars are not accepted) in the amount of at least 100 thousand rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is noteworthy that last year the bank offered the same promotion called ‚ÄúHappy Year‚Äù.  However, then customers could also deposit foreign currency, and the interest rate was higher by 2%. </p><p>  Today's offer is designed for 3 months (last year it was 9 months) and does not provide for partial withdrawal or replenishment of the deposit. </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt get a deposit before the holidays, you should consider other offers of Sberbank on deposits of individuals. </p><h2>  ‚ÄúSave‚Äù </h2><p>  This contribution, like others, is primarily aimed at reducing financial losses from annual inflation.  If we talk about the conditions, then the deposit period in this case is calculated individually for each individual client, but the maximum possible period is 3 years.  The minimum amount for opening an account is 1 thousand rubles for the national currency.  If we are talking about foreign currency units, then in this case it is necessary to deposit at least 100 US dollars or euros. </p>

    <p>  When registering at a bank branch, the maximum rate will be 6.75%.  However, if a client opens a deposit online, then the offer of Sberbank on deposits of individuals will be more profitable.  In this case, you can get up to 7.15%.  At the same time, payments and capitalization are made monthly.  If we talk about a partial withdrawal of funds or replenishment of the deposit, then this option is absent. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  All accrued interest customers can either withdraw in cash or transfer to other active accounts. </p><h2>  "Replenish" </h2><p>  This new deposit offer from Sberbank is slightly different from the previously described rates.  The fact is that in this case the contribution can be replenished, due to which the received amount of charges will grow.  If we talk about the conditions, the initial payment should be at least 1 thousand rubles.  The storage period of funds is from 3 to 36 months, depending on the wishes of the client.  In this case, the maximum possible percentage per annum is 6.5%. </p><p>  Another plus of this offer of Sberbank on deposits of individuals is that you can deposit both rubles and Euros or US dollars.  Moreover, payments are made every month.  Another advantage for those who plan to open a deposit online.  In this case, the interest rate increases slightly (up to 6.9% based on the term of the deposit). </p><h2>  ‚ÄúManage‚Äù </h2><p>  All the Sberbank deposit proposals described above do not provide for partial withdrawal of funds.  This is not always convenient.  This is especially true for pensioners or people who have difficulty finding a job.  When opening this deposit, the client has the right to partially withdraw cash from the deposit without loss of accrued interest.  The only condition is that there is a minimum balance.  It is calculated individually, depending on the amount of the contribution. </p><p>  The minimum amount to be deposited is 30 thousand rubles.  If we are talking about foreign currency, the contribution will be at least 100 US dollars or euros.  In this case, the account can be replenished, but not more than 1 thousand rubles.  However, if operations are carried out by bank transfer, then no restrictions are provided. </p>

    <h2>  Can I open a deposit in foreign currency? </h2><p>  Yes, the ‚ÄúManage‚Äù, ‚ÄúSave‚Äù and ‚ÄúReplenish‚Äù tariffs provide for such a function.  At the same time, deposits are available to customers not only in rubles, but also in other currencies.  However, there are also other offers of Sberbank on deposits, which are created specifically for customers who prefer to use the monetary units of other countries. </p><p>  For example, the ‚ÄúMulticurrency‚Äù tariff also provides for the use of three monetary units at once.  If we are talking about rubles, then the rate will be from 0.01 to 6.19% per annum, depending on the total amount of the deposit.  When depositing US dollars, the maximum profitable percentage will be 1.67%, in euros - 0.4%.  If we talk about the conditions of this proposal, the term for the placement of funds is up to 2 years, subject to a minimum contribution of 1 thousand rubles or 100 US dollars (or euros).  At the same time, the client cannot partially withdraw or transfer money until the deposit expires.  Payments in this case are made once every 3 months.  Received money can be withdrawn in cash or transferred to your accounts or cards. </p><p>  There is also an ‚ÄúInternational‚Äù contribution.  In this case, the client can use pounds sterling, Japanese yen or Swiss francs.  In this case, the maximum possible profit will be 2.7%, 0.75% and 1.3%, respectively.  If we talk about the duration of the deposit, the term is limited to 36 months.  It is noteworthy that according to this tariff, customers can receive income not only from interest, but also based on a constantly changing currency rate.  Therefore, today many are interested in just such contributions.  Sberbank‚Äôs new offers are aimed at attracting customers using foreign currency.  Most often these are businessmen who own capital outside the country. </p>

    <h2>  Deposits, new offers of Sberbank to customers: how to open a deposit </h2><p>  The easiest way is to use a computer or phone and go to your personal account on the official website of a financial institution.  After that, you need to find the ‚ÄúDeposits and Accounts‚Äù section and select the item responsible for opening a new deposit.  At the next stage, the client is invited to familiarize themselves with the conditions of the selected tariff.  After a detailed study of all points of the proposal, just click on "Continue". </p><p>  The next step is to fill out an application.  The form shall indicate the account from which funds will be debited, the amount of the contribution and the period during which the funds will be on deposit.  After that, just click "Open." </p><p>  If you can‚Äôt open a deposit online, you can always contact your nearest bank branch. </p><h2>  Early termination and extension </h2><p>  In some situations, customers cannot wait for the deposit to expire.  If the funds need to be withdrawn from the deposit immediately, then this possibility exists.  If the investments were short-term (up to 6 months), then in this case the rate will be 0.01%.  In a situation with longer-term investments (more than six months), it all depends on the period when it was the client who made the decision to terminate the cooperation. </p>

    <p>  If we talk about the extension of the contract, then usually this happens automatically with the preservation of the previously selected conditions.  However, there are no restrictions on the number of such operations.  In this way, renewal can take many years. </p><h2>  Savings accounts </h2><p>  This is another option for obtaining passive income.  It will be of interest to those who want to receive the most advantageous offer of Sberbank on <span>deposits for pensioners.</span>  This option is good in that in this case the client can freely manage his money daily.  At the same time, an account is opened for an unlimited period of time, and the interest rate will be up to 2.3% per annum, however, it can be increased depending on the amount of money lying on the client‚Äôs account. </p>
