    <h2>  Negative traveler opinions </h2><p>  Sorry about the hotel St.  Raphael <span>Hotel 5 * (Cyprus,</span> Limassol) leave not only positive, but also negative reviews.  You should be prepared for the following negative points: </p><ul><li>  the hotel has only one indoor swimming pool of a very small size (if you take into account that a significant area is occupied by water aerobics, then there is absolutely no place for swimming); </li><li>  there are few enough sunbeds on the beach, and therefore you need to occupy them very early (at 7 a.m. there are practically no empty seats); </li><li>  not very good cleaning - maids almost do not wash floors and do not clean plumbing; </li><li>  if in special wishes you indicate that you need one double bed, then this requirement is most likely not to be fulfilled; </li><li>  it is strange that the hotel does not have a first aid kit or a medical center, and therefore if you feel unwell, you will have to go to the hospital by taxi; </li><li>  animators are absent from the children's playroom, and therefore kids are often left unattended; </li><li>  the dishes are poorly washed in the restaurant; </li><li>  the wireless Internet in the rooms is intermittent; </li><li>  there is no toilet or shower on the beach; </li><li>  for dinner in the restaurant you must strictly follow the dress code, which many guests are not ready for (not everyone has the appropriate things with them); </li><li>  there are not enough waiters in the dining room who physically do not have time to clean the tables; </li><li>  remoteness from the central part of the city; </li><li>  in some rooms large bugs are found, but the staff tries not to notice this even after the indignation of the guests; </li><li>  when evicting, it is worthwhile to carefully study the bill you are being billed, as they may add services that you did not use there; </li><li>  outdated design of rooms and other rooms (both morally and physically); </li><li>  there are no special paths on the beach that protect your feet from hot sand; </li><li>  the beach is practically not looked after; </li><li>  chemicals from insects are scattered on the lawns with sunbeds, and in the sun they can cause toxic fumes. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The hotel St. Petersburg makes an ambiguous impression on travelers.  Raphael Resort 5 *.  Cyprus, Limassol is a very popular tourist destination, and therefore on specialized resources you can find a lot of reviews about this resort.  Tourists who have already managed to visit the hotel described above note that every year the living and recreation conditions remain unchanged (and something is even getting worse), but the price of accommodation is constantly growing. </p><p>  As for the interior, it is already outdated.  Despite the fact that several years ago the repair was carried out, the condition of the hotel is not the best.  Although if we talk about the architecture of buildings and landscape design, they make a very good impression.  As for the staff, you can always count on help and comprehensive advice on all matters related to the hotel and the resort as a whole. </p><p>  Very beautiful nature and favorable climate is characterized by such a place as Cyprus, Limassol.  Hotel "Sant Rafael" offers guests a lot of opportunities for outdoor recreation.  This is a huge territory, and its own beach.  Outwardly, everything looks very beautiful and even luxurious, but if you look closely, you can identify a lot of shortcomings.  One of them is the almost complete absence of any care for the territory.  If some cleaning is still taking place in the courtyard, then the staff often forgets about the hotel‚Äôs beach.  Here, not even basic measures are taken to improve (removal of garbage, cleaning sand from sharp stones, etc.).  As a result, the surface of the beach is very unpleasant and covered with a hard crust.  Also, it does not provide such necessary amenities as changing rooms, umbrellas and showers.  But if all the guests leave the well-groomed beach and want to swim in the pool, then there simply will not be enough space for them. </p><p> Special attention should be paid to the hotel food system.  As already mentioned, the hotel operates on an ultra all-inclusive program.  This means that in addition to the main three meals a day, guests can enjoy tasty and satisfying snacks, as well as a variety of drinks and, of course, ice cream.  As for the menu, the gripe, perhaps, can only cause breakfast.  The Russian stomach is accustomed to a more satisfying meal in the morning than light skim cheese, cereals, vegetables and olives.  As for dinners, they are beyond praise.  Dinners can be considered a real holiday.  This is a kind of thematic evenings during which you can get acquainted with the cuisines of different peoples of the world.  It is also worth noting the variety of catering establishments.  They all feature luxurious design and a relaxing atmosphere. </p><p>  Thus, we can say that this hotel is ideal for tourists who do not pay much attention to minor flaws.  Beautiful nature, warm sea, delicious food, spacious room - what else is needed for a good rest?  In addition, thanks to good animation and interesting excursion programs, you simply will not have time to find fault with trifles. </p>
