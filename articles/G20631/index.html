  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much does a janitor get in Moscow today?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The profession of a janitor is, to put it mildly, prestigious.  This is a horror story for two students, which scared children, citing the example of a janitor as an example of the lowest level of the social ladder.  ‚ÄúStudy well or you will work as a janitor‚Äù - this was the motto for stimulating your children to the heights of knowledge.  Let‚Äôs try to figure out whether this is so, and most importantly, we will find out how much the janitor receives in modern Moscow. </p><h2>  A brief history of the word </h2><p>  The archaic meaning of the word ‚Äújanitor‚Äù is a husband who, after the wedding, moved to his wife‚Äôs house.  In the future, the owners of the inns began to be called janitors, and only then did the word get its modern meaning.  I must say that in the late 19th - early 20th century, the profession of a janitor was quite prestigious.  This was a man who not only was responsible for the cleanliness of the territory entrusted to him, but also performed, in fact, the work of the modern district police officer, and often the functions of private security.  Only then did derogatory terms such as ‚Äúbroom worker‚Äù, ‚Äúmongrel‚Äù, ‚Äúproletariat of mental labor with a broom‚Äù and others appeared. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="walking janitor" class="if uuid-2919323" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2919323.jpg"></div><h2>  Remuneration before the revolution </h2><p>  How much did the janitor get paid?  In the described time, the janitor received more than a decent salary.  If the average worker at the plant was satisfied with earning 20-25 rubles a month, then the janitor with experience earned as much as only a skilled worker in Moscow could receive.  This is 30-40 rubles per month.  To understand the scale of the figures: vodka in those days cost 40-60 kopecks per bottle, a good long coat - 10-15 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.videoblocks.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Car janitor now" class="if uuid-2919326" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2919326.jpg"></div><h2>  What are janitors </h2><p>  In this case, it‚Äôs not about specialization, all the wipers do about the same job.  However, the answer to the question of how much the janitor receives depends on the place where he works and the organization for which he works.  The experience and education of a janitor are much less important.  Alas, this work does not really require special qualifications.  The bulk of the janitors work in the field of a city-wide economy.  In Moscow, this is the state institution "Housing", more than 70% of all city wipers found their place there.  The rest work in different organizations in this position, which in addition often has various consoles such as a janitor-gardener, janitor-operator of equipment and so on.  There is a wide variety of working day construction: from part-time work and part-time work to shift work.  The traditional broom is a thing of the past, and instead of romantic rustling, city dwellers are increasingly hearing the howls of street vacuum cleaners, the noise of street sweepers and various devices that make communal services easier. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.nyoooz.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manual labor" class="if uuid-2919327" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2919327.jpg"></div><h2>  Janitorial jobs and salary offers in Moscow </h2><p>  A simple query on the vacancies of janitors in the capital gives the result of the presence of 410 vacancies.  Their distribution according to the question of how much the janitor receives in Moscow is as follows: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="Salary Fork Chart" class="if uuid-2919324" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2919324.jpg"></div><p>  As can be seen from the above data, potential wipers are most often offered <span>salaries</span> of up to 30,000 rubles per month.  To understand how much certain categories of janitors actually receive in Moscow, you can turn to the specialized resources of individual city companies. </p><p>  The most highly paid janitors are employees who managed to get a job in Gazprom and other similar structures.  The level of remuneration for their labor can reach 55,000-60,000 rubles per month.  In addition, potential employees who want to earn as much as possible should pay attention to proposals that provide for a shift method of work.  It is these 20 vacancies located at the bottom of the schedule that offer a monthly salary of over 50,000 rubles.  Summing up, it can be noted that the modal, that is, the most common salary of a janitor in the capital is in the range from 20,000 to 30,000 rubles per month, while in some cases it can reach 60,000 rubles.  But these cases currently make up no more than 5% of the total number of employees. </p><p>  Therefore, a relatively recent answer to the question of how much the janitor in Moscow receives from the deputy mayor of the city, who stated that his (janitor) average salary is 45,000 rubles, is doubtful.  Perhaps, there was an averaging <span>of the</span> janitor's <span>wages</span> with operators of urban mechanisms and devices working to clean the city.  In any case, the answer to the question of how much the janitor receives in Moscow can be left to the conscience of the official. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.bostonglobe.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Snow removal" class="if uuid-2919325" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/109095/2919325.jpg"></div><h2>  The scope of work of the janitor in Moscow and their composition </h2><p>  According to existing standards, the cleaned area per one regular janitor of the municipal economy is 800 square meters, while recently the cleaning standards have somewhat softened.  Earlier in the winter, it was required to clean the area to asphalt, that is, completely remove snow and ice in pedestrian zones.  Now a small cover of ice is allowed, but subjected to appropriate processing. </p><p>  Due to the widespread use of <span>cleaning equipment</span> in the city, it is possible to solve a problem that cannot be solved at first glance.  After all, the territory of the city is 150 square kilometers, or 150 million square meters, which by simple division gives the result of the need for approximately 1.5 million wipers.  It remains to add that recently the caretakers' vacancies have been filled mainly by residents of Moscow and Moscow Region, they make up 40% of the total, 30% are residents of other regions of Russia, and the remaining 30% fall to the share of labor migrants, whose number is constantly decreasing.  Moreover, how much the janitor receives in Moscow does not depend on his citizenship and place of birth. </p><h2>  Janitors in other regions of Russia </h2><p>  Compared to Moscow, where janitors often receive as much as janitors in other cities of Russia have never dreamed of, the situation in the regions is different for the worse.  How much do janitors get in Russia?  Some insight can be obtained from the following rounded data presented on recruiting sites: </p><ul><li>  St. Petersburg - 20,000; </li><li>  Tula - 16,000; </li><li>  Novosibirsk - 15,000; </li><li>  Chelyabinsk - 15,000; </li><li>  Kazan - 16,000; </li><li>  Nizhny Novgorod - 17,000. </li></ul><p>  How much a janitor should receive for his work can be illustrated by data on the income of such workers in developed countries.  In Germany, his income can go up to 4000 euros per month.  Of course, this is no longer a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù man with a broom or a shovel, but a rather qualified specialist working on complex equipment. </p>
