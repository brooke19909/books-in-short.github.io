  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Phuket Hotels, Nature and Landmarks</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Today, Phuket is the most popular holiday destination in all of Thailand.  It is hard to say what attracts tourists most to this place: Phuket hotels, beaches, service, local nature or something else.  But be that as it may, there are many tourists on the island throughout the year.  Sometimes a large number of vacationers are a little annoying, especially on the beaches.  But you can put up with this, paying attention to local attractions and entertainment programs.  Locals are very fond of holidays and fun, so you will definitely not be bored on the island. </p><p>  Looking at nature, it seems that all this has an unearthly origin.  It just looks so harmoniously, as if the artist painted the most <span>beautiful picture.</span>  At first glance, of course, it seems that everything is here, as elsewhere: beaches, the sea, the sun .... But how this is all presented is a separate conversation.  Locals really appreciate the surrounding nature.  In order to protect <span>rare species of animals</span> and plants, a national park has been created on the island, open for tourists to visit. </p><p>  Typically, all Phuket hotels have their own beaches.  They are equipped with everything that can come in handy during a vacation: umbrellas, deck chairs, changing rooms, small food outlets and much more.  In addition to a beach holiday, diving, windsurfing and water skiing are widely represented here.  By the way, scuba diving is very popular.  What coastal waters hide is known only to those who have already made the trip.  It should be noted that all hotels in Phuket have a high level of comfort.  They delight their guests with comfortable rooms, which often have Internet access, a telephone, a <span>TV, a minibar</span> and much more.  Phuket Island hotels have at least one restaurant of their own, where you can taste delicious dishes of national cuisine.  The most popular hotels on the island are Allamanda Laguna Phuket, Sheraton Grand Laguna Phuket and some others.  Often they are chosen not only for recreation, but also for conferences.  Phuket Island offers hotels for every taste.  Here you can rent both very expensive apartments and rooms at very reasonable prices.  In a word, many people can afford a vacation in Phuket.  You can have a good time in this place even with children - they also will not be bored.  Water parks, children's pools, lots of entertainment. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Allamanda Hotel Laguna Phuket </p><p>  This chic hotel is located on Bang Beach, 18 kilometers from the National Airport.  He offers its guests luxurious rooms, which consist of a spacious guest room, bedroom and bathroom.  A golf course is literally nearby, and the hotel has a spa, fitness center, restaurant and bar.  A little boring here may seem to those who are used to endless fun. </p><p>  Sheraton Grand Laguna Phuket </p><p>  The five-star Sheraton Grand Hotel is located on the west coast of Phuket in a lagoon that is covered in <span>coniferous forest.</span>  The territory is surrounded by flowering gardens and beautiful alleys.  The hotel is one of the best on the island, offering tourists comfortable rooms equipped with modern appliances and furniture.  It is the best suited for leisure newlyweds, families with children, businessmen and ordinary travelers. </p><p>  <span>Hotel Hilton</span> Phuket Arcadia </p><p>  The hotel is buried in exotic gardens, the territory of which domineering peacocks walk, and a beautiful waterfall rises nearby.  It is considered the largest hotel in Phuket, and is suitable for recreation of youth companies and families with children.  There is everything that can come in handy during your vacation.  True, for all the luxury Hilton Phuket Arcadia will have to pay a considerable amount of money, since all services are paid, and the prices leave much to be desired. </p><p>  What to do on the island?  Visit local attractions.  For example, you can visit the Butterfly Farm, which is located just three kilometers from the city of Phuket.  Here is a huge collection of various butterflies and insects.  It is also worth a visit to the Museum of Sea Shells, where you can look at a private collection of sea shells collected in the waters of Thailand and some other parts of the world.  But do you want to go down under the water in a submarine?  Some Phuket hotels are happy to offer you this opportunity by organizing an excursion to this local attraction.  The boat is equipped with all the amenities necessary for a comfortable stay on board.  During this trip, you can admire the different species of fish and corals, which form entire columns here. </p><p>  Phuket is an island of unforgettable experiences.  Do not forget to bring a camera or camcorder, because not everyone will believe that you spent an amazing vacation in a real paradise of Thailand.  Do not doubt that after stories about the island, your friends will immediately want to go to this place for a portion of new emotions and adventures. </p>
