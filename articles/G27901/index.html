All settlements are interesting and unique in their own way. </p><p>  In the central part of Priozerny district is located the item Sapernoye, Leningrad Region.  The settlement is located near Putilov Bay, on the A121 highway, on the Vuoksa River.  In the village itself there is a lake of the same name - Sappernoye.  A little more than 3.6 thousand people live in the village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="realty.jcat.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sappernoye village" class="if uuid-2342808" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2342808.jpg"></div><h2>  A brief historical excursion </h2><p>  The village has the historical name Valkj√§rvi.  This is the Finnish word that translates as ‚Äúwhite lake‚Äù.  Sometimes the village was called Venya Valkyarvi, which means "Russian white lake."  The earliest mentions of the settlement can be found in tax books from the 16th century. </p><p>  Until 1939, a rather large military unit called ‚ÄúKasarmila‚Äù was located in the village of Sapernoye in the Leningrad Region. </p><p>  After the end of World War II, the village gets its modern name - Sappernoye, then becomes a closed military town. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.farpost.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="House in the village of Sapernoe" class="if uuid-2342814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2342814.jpg"></div><h2>  Military unit </h2><p>  Until 2013, military unit No. 138 of the Motorized Rifle Brigade was based in the village of Sapernoye, Leningrad Region.  The main composition of the brigade was in the village of Kamenka or military unit 02511. This is a motorized rifle brigade, which is in full combat readiness. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Formed military unit number 138 in 1934, she took part in the battles for the cities of the Gulf of Finland from 1939 to 1940.  In 1944, military units took part near the village of <span>Krasnoe Selo</span> in the battles for breaking the blockade of Leningrad. </p><p>  In 1962, the division was already in abbreviated form, but the military took part in the fighting during the Caribbean crisis.  The personnel of the unit participated in peacekeeping operations in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Tajikistan and Transnistria. </p><p>  In 2009, the part was reformed and turned into a linear one.  And from 2009 to 2013.  she was completely transferred to the village of Kamenka. </p><h2>  Attack of a military unit by representatives of the Dagestan diaspora </h2><p>  This incident occurred in 2010.  In April 2010, about 20 representatives of the Caucasus arrived in the village of Sapernoye, Priozersky District, Leningrad Region, and specifically to military unit No. 138. They wanted to deal with one of the lieutenants, who is also a native of Dagestan.  The reason was an ordinary household quarrel. </p><p>  The military reacted quickly, began to shoot from military weapons into the air.  The battalion commander went to the Dagestanis for negotiations and raised the unit on alert.  Local residents, frightened by the shootout, called up a police squad.  Arriving law enforcement officials took fingerprints from the attackers, drew up a protocol and let them go home. </p><p>  By the way, this is not the first attack on a military unit in the village of Sapernoye, Leningrad Region.  In August 2005, there was a fight between the personnel and representatives of the Caucasus.  The conflict arose in the local cafe "Cosiness", where young lieutenants came, and Dagestanis were already resting there.  Among the vacationers were contract soldiers from the unit, but dressed in civilian clothes.  Officers ordered them to return to the unit, but representatives of the Caucasus stood up for them.  As a result, a fight ensued, in which 10 men participated, after some time more people came up to the cafe, and a mass fight began on the street.  There were already several dozen parties to the conflict.  There were fewer military men, they began to retreat to the barracks, the Dagestanis broke through to the place where they beat everyone on the way.  As a result, 4 officers were in hospital beds. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="msp.today" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="mushrooms in the lake district" class="if uuid-2342810" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2342810.jpg"></div><h2>  Sappernoye Lake </h2><p>  In the northern part of the village of Sapernoye, Leningrad Region, there is a lake of the same name where you can relax.  Its length is 1.3 kilometers, in the central pole the width of the reservoir reaches 600 meters. </p><p>  In the vicinity of the reservoir there are sandy hills covered with birches, pines and firs, a lot of mushrooms.  On the north coast, the soil is mostly marshy.  The lake is fed by springs and groundwater, so there is always clean water. </p><p>  The bottom of the reservoir is sandy, the depth in some places reaches 23 meters.  On the lake you can swim and fish, do the latter better from a boat. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sapernoe.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Rehabilitation center" class="if uuid-2342821" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2342821.jpg"></div><h2>  Temple of the Konevskaya Icon of the Mother of God </h2><p>  In the village of Sapernoye, Leningrad Region, there is an Orthodox organization - the parish of the temple of the <span>Konevskaya Icon of the Mother of God.</span>  It is located in Bogorodichniy Lane, 1. Divine services and liturgies are regularly held here.  Built in 1995.  The architectural style of the building is Russian wooden architecture, carved iconostasis. </p><p>  At the temple there is a rehabilitation center for drug and alcohol addicts called "The Abode of Healing."  Comprehensive social rehabilitation is free of charge.  The center invites everyone who wants to change their life. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="60.71429250000001" data-lng="29.957678299999998" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="12"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/6/8/4/1684.png"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  If you go from St. Petersburg to the village of Sapernoye, then you can take the electric train at the Finnish railway station, next to the Priozersk or Kuznechnoye stations.  You need to get out at the Losevo station, and then take a taxi to Saperny. </p><p>  The village can be reached by bus (next to Priozersk), which leaves from the bus station.  The bus calls into the village itself.  The main thing is not to be confused with the village of the same name, which is located in the south of the region behind the village of Kolpino. </p>
