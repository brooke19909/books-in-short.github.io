Some 40-50 years ago, fig trees grew in its place, and the Cypriots harvested a good crop there. </p><p>  Today it is a young resort, which is becoming fashionable due to its location, a beautiful bay with cozy beaches and comfortable hotels.  Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * in Protaras is one of them. </p><h2>  Young resort </h2><p>  The sun and sea are much more expensive than fig groves, Cypriots understood this with the advent of the first tourists on their beautiful island.  If people are willing to pay to lie on the beach and sunbathe, why not make a profitable business out of it?  Since then, Cyprus has become a tourist Mecca, and the young resort of Protaras - one of its pearls. </p>

    <p>  It just so happened that conditionally the island is divided into separate tourist zones: </p><ul><li>  The beaches and hotels of Larnaca will suit those who are used to getting the best.  Here the prices are much higher, but the quality of service corresponds to them. </li><li>  Ayia Napa resort was chosen by party people, so there are so many nightclubs and discos, foam parties and various attractions. </li><li>  Protaras is a zone of silence, tranquility and a graceful family holiday. </li></ul><p>  Hotel Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 (Cyprus, Protaras) is most suitable for parents with young children looking forward to a budget holiday.  It provides its guests with an excellent choice: those who do not like the scorching sun, relax near one of the pools, and those who are ready to expose their bodies to ultraviolet radiation go to the beach, which is only 400 m away. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  You should not expect a large number of attractions from the town, which 50 years ago was a small village, standing on the site of the ancient Greek policy that had sunk into oblivion.  It is unlikely that the remaining ruins will impress those who saw the real ruins, but not for their sake tourists come to Protaras.  Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 *, according to vacationers, corresponds to the "troika" in its status, and you should not expect more from so many stars in a young developing resort, although the beaches and surrounding nature are beyond praise. </p><h2>  Description Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * </h2><p>  A good hotel is one half of a pleasant stay.  It is pleasant to return from the beach to the air-conditioned room, where there is a shower cabin with hot and cold water, a soft bed and a refrigerator with chilled drinks.  Although there are many conflicting reviews about the Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * in Protaras, they all boil down to one thing: these are budget three-star apartments that have everything you need to relax. </p><p>  In Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * (Protaras), you can rent a room in a five-story building or in detached single and two-story bungalows.  It‚Äôs easier to choose based on the desire to be closer to the pools (then it‚Äôs living in houses) or away from the children's fuss near them (in the main building). </p><p>  The territory, according to guests, is quite well-maintained and clean at Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * (Protaras, Cyprus).  The photo below demonstrates this. </p>

    <p>  Most of the reviews of tourists have complaints about cleaning, and there is some truth to this.  Workers can wipe the floor once a week, make up the bed and fold towels every day, but this is not enough for a three-star establishment, such as the Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * (Protaras).  Reviews of many guests agree on this, but only those for whom life is more important than beautiful beaches and the ancient history of the island really complain. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Hotel Facilities </h2><p>  How many people, so many points of view.  That's about the infrastructure of the Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * in Protaras, reviews of tourists disagree.  Rather, this is due to the fact that the hotel is more suitable for families with children and is not recommended for lovers of thrills and dances until the morning. </p><p>  Here customers are provided with the following services: </p><ul><li>  Free parking. </li><li>  Laundry and hairdresser. </li><li>  You can rent a car or bike. </li><li>  Restaurant and bar. </li></ul><p>  As the guests of Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * (Cyprus, Protaras) rightly note, the service at the hotel is unobtrusive, bearing in mind the rare cleaning and changing of bed linen. </p><h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  What Cyprus is famous for is its coast.  If you drive along all the beaches of the island, you can see a strange feature: the sand on them seems to be whiter from one to another, which seems impossible.  But actually it is. </p><p>  Beaches in Protaras (Cyprus), Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 *, reviews from lovers of the sun and the sea are praised, and there are the following reasons for this: </p><ul><li>  Firstly, because they are within reach. </li><li>  Secondly, there are two of them - smaller and larger. </li><li>  Thirdly, they are located on the banks of a beautiful bay. </li><li>  Fourthly, the hotel in Protaras Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 is located so that from it to other beaches of the resort in less than 15 minutes by bus. </li></ul>

    <p>  As vacationers note, the entrance to the sea on the beaches directly next to the Jacaranda Hotel, although gentle, there are stones.  They are quite clearly visible in clear water, but couples with children should be careful. </p><h2>  All the best for children </h2><p>  On the island in every hotel they try to allocate a place for a playground, despite the level of their "stardom".  Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * (Protaras, Cyprus) is not far behind in this.  Reviews of holidaymakers praise both children's animation, and the playground and pool. </p><p>  Usually, choosing a family hotel, especially a budget one, parents are guided by the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  Proximity to the sea, so as not to torment the baby for a long walk in the sun. </li><li>  The quality of the beach, that is, its cleanliness and well-being: deck chairs with umbrellas, toilet and shower stalls and other signs of "civilization". </li><li>  Logging into the sea also matters.  A shallow dive and sand underfoot is the key to safe bathing. </li><li>  Possibility to order a children's menu. </li><li>  Availability of entertainment for the child. </li><li>  Is there a children's pool and playground, a games room. </li></ul><p>  This hotel has all these conditions, which is why both parents and children who are vacationing here love and positively describe it in their reviews. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  What else tourists like to write about is food, and rightly so.  It makes no sense to relax in a foreign resort and not try the local cuisine.  Cypriots love to eat and treat others. </p><p>  On the food in the hotel Jacaranda Hotel Apartments 3 * (Protaras, Cyprus), the reviews generally agree: hearty breakfasts, delicious dinners and monotonous dinners, although this is also a moot point.  Whether it is true or not, one can find out only by removing the number in it.  In fact, if every time you take a new dish from the menu, as some hotel guests advise, the food will not be full and will not seem the same from one lunch to another. </p>

    <p>  The most fastidious gourmets will be pleased that next to the Jacaranda Hotel there are small cafes and restaurants with an abundance of both local and international food.  In their reviews, vacationers especially recommend trying a meze dish, consisting of numerous snacks that should be correctly alternated.  For example, various sauces with bread are served first, after which salads are brought, and in the end - meat or fish.  It happens that the number of snacks exceeds 20 units, so one person can‚Äôt eat it, except that he is a Cypriot. </p><h2>  Entertainment at the hotel </h2><p>  Although Jacaranda has only 3 stars, vacationers note that you can have a good time in it.  There are: </p><ul><li>  Pool divided by a bridge and islets into parts. </li><li>  Children's swimming pool. </li><li>  Playhouse and playground for kids. </li><li>  Children's animation. </li><li>  For adults, live music is played in the evenings and buffets are served. </li><li>  You can relax from the sun on the terrace or in the small garden. </li><li>  Billiards, table tennis and a court, darts, aerobics and a sauna await those who are used to spending time with health benefits. </li></ul>

    <p>  Water sports await active people at the beach, and diving await fearless ones.  According to hotel guests, the best place to dive is Liberty, a ship that sank near the resort of Protaras in 2009.  You can learn to use scuba diving in Green Bay, taking a few diving lessons right near the shore. </p><h2>  Attractions nearby </h2><p>  Hotel Jacaranda is close to interesting places.
