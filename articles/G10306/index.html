A powerful wakeboarding parachute will give you an unforgettable experience.  Professional kiteboarding instructors are ready to tell everyone what Kite Boarding is.  The pristine lagoons of the <span>Maldives</span> with their open spaces create ideal conditions for both amateurs and professionals.  On water, a kiteboard is like a wakeboard or surfing. </p><h2>  May weather </h2><p>  In May, when the Russians have many days off, some will want to realize their dream and fly to the Maldives.  And it is real.  But whether you can enjoy your vacation fully depends on how quickly the Maldivian spring ends and the next wet season begins.  The southwestern monsoon to the hulhanga will come into its own, bringing rain and wind, and the serene ocean begins to storm, large waves rise.  It is impossible to guess the weather in the Maldives in May - whether you have sunny days or not depends on nature. </p><p>  If the onset of bad weather is delayed, you can swim and sunbathe.  Despite the riot of nature, the heat does not subside and remains at the level of +29 ... + 32 <sup>¬∞</sup> C, and since the humidity goes off scale, rising above the 80% mark, breathing is difficult and very stuffy.  From damp, clothes directly on the body become wet.  Heavy rains pour mainly in the evenings and nights. </p><p>  You can spend time on vacation doing snorkeling and diving, spa treatments and admiring the delightful May sunsets.  Many believe that at this time of the year they are especially beautiful. </p><p>  Even a healthy person needs several days to adapt, and for tourists with heart disease, blood vessels, respiratory tract, rest during the rainy season and high humidity is contraindicated. </p><h2>  Impressions of Russian tourists from holidays in the Maldives </h2><div class="photo" data-original="uk.hotels.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Island view with hotel" class="if uuid-3219038" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/51366/3219038.jpg"></div><p>  According to reviews of Sheraton Maldives Full Moon Resort Spa, this hotel has beautifully maintained grounds and decent food.  Mali is so close that it can be seen from several places.  Some are glad that it takes only 15 minutes to get to it, others are not happy. </p><p>  Some tourists lived in a bungalow with 4 rooms, and they say that the partitions are too thin, so the great audibility prevented them from falling asleep.  There are no such problems in the villas.  Service at Sheraton Maldives Full Moon Resort Spa is at a high level and does not cause complaints.  True, there is not always a Russian-speaking staff. </p><p>  This is not to say that this hotel was lost in the vast ocean, but other islands with technical facilities and hotels are not far away.  Those to whom this does not bother can get great pleasure from the rest.  If you do not rest on the All Inclusive program, you will have to pay pretty decent money for the pleasures, for example, up to two hundred dollars for dinner in a restaurant. </p>
