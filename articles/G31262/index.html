Another thing is the purpose of trips to China.  In most cases, China is visited for shopping.  Sightseeing tours are also in demand, because China is a country with a rich history.  No country in the world can boast of so many attractions listed in the authoritative UNESCO List as China.  Some travel to the Celestial Empire to test the effectiveness of treatment with acupuncture and other methods of alternative medicine.  The others are attracted by the mysterious Tibet and the mythical Shambhala.  And quite a few are going to conquer the highest peak in the world - Everest - from the PRC, not Nepal.  But now is the time to discover beach China!  Read about the best <span>sea ‚Äã‚Äãresorts in</span> this country in our article. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China resorts with beaches" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084898.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Tours to China </h2><p>  The Russians living in Eastern Siberia and the Far East have long mastered the beaches of China on the Yellow Sea.  But citizens from the European part of the Russian Federation were scared away for a long time by a long and expensive flight, as well as a lower level of service compared to Turkey and Egypt.  But time takes its toll, and the tourism infrastructure of the PRC began to develop rapidly.  In recent years, like mushrooms after rain, new resorts in China have appeared with beaches, hotels, and entertainment centers.  To get customers, tour operators offer Russians permits to the PRC, which can be compared to a hodgepodge.  There is only a little bit: shopping, and excursions, and acquaintance with Chinese acupuncture, and streaming exotic dishes.  And complements this "gallop across the Middle Kingdom" 5-7-day <span>beach vacation</span> in one of the sea resorts in China.  Such a tour will cost an average of 22 thousand rubles per person, if the ticket is ‚Äúburning‚Äù, and accommodation is expected in a 3-star hotel (with breakfast). </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The best resorts in China with beaches </h2><p>  Which of the proposed options to choose?  Which seaside resort of China is considered the best?  The most fashionable area is Hainan Island.  The Chinese government is very interested in promoting this place.  Therefore, if you plan to go exclusively to Hainan (up to 15 days and as part of an organized group), you do not need a visa to the PRC.  You can subtract one and a half thousand rubles from the budget.  Budget tourists will certainly be interested in the resorts of the Yellow Sea.  This is Beidaihe, Qingdao, Dalian.  But you should remember that you need to come here, as in Sochi - from June to the end of September.  It is during the summer period that the sea temperature is +25 degrees.  Well, tropical palms of Hainan Island can easily replace relic fragrant pine trees.  A longer bathing period is observed in the south-east of the country.  Alternatively, consider Hong Kong, where beach vacations can be combined with shopping. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tours to China" class="if" height="429" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084914.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hainan </h2><p>  We begin a review of the best seaside resorts in China.  Hainan Island leads in terms of climatic characteristics, infrastructure development, and level of service.  This former place of exile of the Chinese nobility is now called "East Hawaii."  The word "Hainan" itself is translated as "Land beyond the South Sea."  The island is located in a tropical climate zone and is ready to receive vacationers all year round.  There is everything that travel agencies lure to <span>Thailand or the Dominican Republic:</span> lush palm trees, warm turquoise water, white sand of beaches, all kinds of rambutan coconuts and other exotic fruits.  Hainan was the first to attract the attention of foreign holidaymakers who fly to China every winter.  <span>South Sea</span> do not even try to search on the map.  There is no such water area.  Geographers call the sea washing the shores of Hainan South China.  The capital of the island is Haikou. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hainan Resorts" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084926.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sanya </h2><p>  Luxury hotels and fashionable resorts are concentrated in the south of Hainan.  But for the exotic should go to the northern tip of the island.  Two indigenous peoples - Miao and Li - are completely unlike the Han people.  You can watch the amazing folklore shows that they organize for tourists, as well as try the delicacies of local cuisine in the Bethel ethnic minority park.  Sanya resort is considered the most fashionable holiday destination on the island and throughout China.  The only drawback of the local beaches is their location across the road.  Otherwise, tourists give Sanya the highest ratings.  Snow-white sand, clear water, European standard of rest.  On three sides, Sanya is surrounded by picturesque mountains, and on the fourth stretches the unclouded expanse of the sea.  Even in January, the thermometer on Hainan does not fall below +22 degrees.  High season in Sanya is observed in early February.  The Chinese from the north love to come here to celebrate the Lunar New Year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China's best beaches" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084924.jpg" width="534"></div>

    <h2>  Yalongwan </h2><p>  The <span>resorts of</span> Hainan Island are not limited to Sanya alone.  Twenty-five kilometers from it lies an extensive crescent-shaped bay, which the Chinese call Earth Paradise (Yaoichi).  But on the maps it is called by the city on the coast - Yalunvan.  This resort is the center of the most expensive and fashionable hotels.  The beaches of Yalunwan are considered better than in Sanya.  Seven kilometers of white quartz sand!  The coastal strip is so wide that there is no feeling of crowding even in high season.  Edging the beaches are mangroves and coconut groves.  And from the sea, five islands and a coral reef reliably shelter the coast from storms.  The transparency of the water in Yalongwan Bay is 10-15 meters.  This, along with the lack of strong currents, makes the resort a Mecca for divers and snorkellers. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="China south sea" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084958.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Dadonghai </h2><p>  This bay on Hainan Island is not as clean as Yalongwan Bay.  But this resort "never sleeps."  For a rich evening life and fun without borders, young people come to Dadonghai.  The beaches of the resort represent a typical picture of the tropical coast: green palm trees, white sand, <span>turquoise sea.</span>  However, in Dadonghai most developed infrastructure of outdoor activities.  Kites, water skiing, scooters, bananas and other entertainment are present in large numbers.  Dadonghai was chosen by Russian tourists.  Therefore, it is difficult to feel the language barrier.  On the streets of the resort you can often find signs in Russian.  Hotel staff and restaurant waiters often speak our language.  There are many treatment centers in the resort where traditional Chinese medicine is practiced. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sanya Resort" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084972.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beidaihe </h2><p>  Good resorts in China with beaches stretch in the south-east of the country, along the coast of the Yellow Sea.  Beidaihe stands out among them.  The beauty of these places is legendary.  The beach of the resort consists of golden sand.  And it is surrounded by mountains covered with pine trees.  Crystal air, filled with the aroma of heated needles, created Beidaihe the glory of a medical resort.  The most developed infrastructure in the western part of the resort.  At the eastern end of the beach you can find deserted places and enjoy the sea and the sun in complete solitude.  This resort is also chosen and even settled by our compatriots.  Reviews call it the ideal place for family vacations, as there are many attractions for children: dolphinarium, water parks.  Adults will also find a lot of interesting things for themselves in Beidaihe.  You should visit the two-headed mountain Lenfengshan with its caves and hidden trails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Yalongwan bay" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1084944.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hong Kong Resistance Cove </h2><p>  Only recently returned to the bosom of the Celestial Empire, the peninsula still pleases guests with British quality of service for tourists.  From all three sides, Hong Kong (aka Hong Kong) is washed by the South China Sea.  And in terms of climatic characteristics, it is not inferior to Hainan.  The best beaches of China in this corner of a vast country are located in the Resistance Bay.  The bay is so named because the British once courageously repelled an attack by pirates.  The beach of the Resistance Bay is equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay: dressing rooms, showers, wooden flooring.  The promenade is teeming with restaurants and upscale hotels.  The main attraction of the resort are the giant statues of the goddess Tin Hau and Kwun Yam, which patronize the fishermen.  Jonks of the latter, gliding along the calm waters of the bay, are a wonderful sight. </p><h2>  Dalyan </h2><p>  And what resorts in China with beaches can be advised to lovers of pebbles?  This is Dalyan - a city on the coast of the Yellow Sea.  For our compatriots, it is also interesting because it has the Russian quarter.  Dalyan has several beaches.  One of the best is considered "Shell".  You can get here using the cableway, which is laid over the territory of the zoo.  If you get tired of swimming in the sea, you can see the performance of trained fur seals.  The pebble beach of the Tigers bears such a name because of the marble sculptures of large wild cats.  However, they do not attract many tourists here, but unusually high tides.  Near the beach there is a unique "Polar Aquarium", where you can observe the inhabitants of the Arctic Ocean and Antarctica. </p>
