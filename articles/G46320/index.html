What to see in Innsbruck: ski resorts, museums, galleries and castles</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the place where the confluence of the Zill and Inn rivers takes place, the main city of Tirol - Innsbruck - lies on the southern slopes of the Nordkette ridge.  People in these territories have lived since Celtic times, but as a city this settlement became known from the 13th century, when the Duke Leopold III began to adjudicate at the place where Hofburg is now located.  His grandson in the mid-1490s turned this inconspicuous alpine town into one of the most famous in Europe, making it the imperial capital.  Over time, Innsbruck did not cease to be in the spotlight.  Today it attracts thousands of tourists.  Here you can see the unique architecture, visit numerous museums, galleries and exhibitions, get acquainted with the history and culture of the city, taste all the delights of an excellent ski resort and enjoy the view of magnificent landscapes. </p><p>  What sights does Innsbruck offer its guests in the first place?  Of course, these are <span>architectural monuments of</span> history that have managed to survive to this day.  We will get to know the most significant of them in more detail. </p><h2>  Hofsburg Imperial Palace </h2><p>  One of the first places in the list of "Main Attractions" Innsbruck assigned the imperial residence of the rulers of Tyrol - Hofsburg.  This beautiful castle developed along with Austria.  It was built in the 15th century for its own use by the Duke Duke Zygmunt Rich.  Having inherited the castle, Maximilian almost completely changed this structure, turning it into one of the most beautiful palaces in Europe, built in the late Gothic style.  In accordance with fashion, luxurious chambers periodically changed their appearance.  In addition, each successive sovereign supplemented the palace complex with more and more new buildings: additional towers, chapels and castles were erected.  Having come to power, Maria Theresa in the 18th century turned the palace complex into a baroque realm.  This is how we see Hofsburg today.  Its beauty does not leave anyone indifferent, it is beautiful both from the outside and from the inside.  In the luxurious rooms you can see old royal furniture, chandeliers, gold stucco moldings, various luxury goods and much more. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights innsbruck" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390124.jpg" width="600"></div>

Innsbruck considers this landmark emblem and symbol of the city.  Built at the beginning of the 15th century by Frederick IV, the building did not attract attention until Maximilian I, having come to power, ordered the construction of a royal loggia (bay window).  From it, the Habsburgs watched tournaments, performances and various events held on the square.  The roof of the bay window is held by two columns, but they did not glorify this structure, but 2657 gilded copper tiles.  Thanks to this decoration, the building got its name. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="golden roof innsbruck" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390126.jpg?1399346788463" width="375"></div>

    <h2>  City tower </h2><p>  Next to the Golden Roof on Herzog-Friedrich-Stra√üe, there is another attraction of the city - the city tower.  This gothic building, 56 meters high, attracts many tourists with its extravagance.  Its construction was carried out in two stages.  The lower part was built in the 15th century and has a cylindrical shape.  An addition in the <span>form of a roof</span> in the Renaissance style the tower received by the end of the 18th century.  Its observation deck offers magnificent views of the local landscapes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in innsbruck" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/390374.jpg?1399371917916" width="375"></div>

Innsbruck offers to visit a no less impressive building - the Ambras castle, which was once a symbol of Tyrolean power and glory.  The building that we see now was built at the end of the 16th century on the orders of Archduke Ferdinand II.  The castle consists of two parts: the lower fortress with an entrance gate and a spacious courtyard and the upper palace.  Both parts are interconnected by the Spanish Hall, an attractive feature of which is the original <span>coffered ceiling,</span> mosaic doors, wall murals and mosaic doors.  The castle has preserved the gallery of portraits of the Habsburgs, dressing room and weapons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="what to see in innsbruck" class="if" height="405" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390130.jpg?1399346917563" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Hofkirke - the court church </h2><p>  But that is not all.  Innsbruck never ceases to amaze its guests.  Another building located in the very center of the city rightfully occupies a place in the tourist booklets - this is the Hofkirke court church.  The building was erected by order of Ferdinand I as the mausoleum of Maximilian I, who in the last years of his life even drew a sketch of the sarcophagus with his own hand.  The church fathers considered that the height of the sarcophagus at the altar level is an insult to the church, so it remained empty.  Now this tomb, surrounded by 28 bronze statues, is one of the first places on the list of ‚ÄúMost Popular Attractions‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Innsbruck offers its guests to visit other <span>architectural buildings of a</span> religious nature.  There are 5 monasteries and 11 churches in the city, among which the Cathedral of St. James cannot be missed, which we will dwell on in more detail. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sights innsbruck" class="if" height="302" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390131.jpg?1399347115951" width="472"></div>

    <h2>  Cathedral of St. James </h2><p>  For many years, this cathedral was a modest parish church, built in a strictly Gothic style at the beginning of the 12th century.  After the establishment of the diocese of the city, the construction turned into a Cathedral, but failed to survive to this day in its original form.  The earthquake of 1698 almost completely destroyed it.  When restoring the architectural monument, baroque elements were added to the interior and exterior decoration.  Now it is a unique building, the facade of which is rich in windows of various shapes.  A large dome crowns it, and small domes adorn two attached clock towers.  The vaults of the Cathedral depict drawings telling about the life path of St. James.  The visitor‚Äôs eyes are attracted by a bright blue organ, decorated with gilding, the sound of which even today thrills every listener. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of innsbruck with landmarks" class="if" height="454" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11651/390133.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  For connoisseurs of architecture of a religious nature, a map of Innsbruck with sights will help to get acquainted with other similar structures. </p><h2>  Museums of the city and its environs </h2><p>  Innsbruck museums deserve special attention, allowing you to plunge into the past of the city, get acquainted with its identity and culture, learn something new and interesting.  The magnificent museum of bells "Grassmayer" offers a magnificent collection.  Already from the name it becomes clear what is at stake.  For four centuries, a foundry has been operating, led by representatives of one dynasty.  It will be interesting to visit the Imperial Hunt <span>Museum</span> or the <span>Anatomical Museum.</span>  Of particular interest is the Swarovski Museum in Innsbruck.  Once in this place, you understand that the heads of giants exist not only in fairy tales, because the attraction is located in one of them!  Inside the museum has the appearance of a labyrinth - seven rooms are interconnected by rather narrow corridors and stairs.  In these rooms you can see the crystal in different variations.  The pearl is the faceted crystal ‚ÄúCentenary of the Anniversary‚Äù with a size of 3 million carats. </p>

    <h2>  Alpine zoo </h2><p>  After visiting the architectural sights of the city, the question arises: "What else to see in Innsbruck?"  Alpine Zoo spreads on Mount Nordkette, gathering almost all the animals living in the Alps, and having no analogues around the world.  Here visitors will meet with 150 species of animals located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 4 hectares.  The zoo allows all guests to fully appreciate the beauty of the wildlife of the Alpine mountains.  Here you can hear the "aria" of wolves howling bells, ringing, admiring the "dance" of fish in the aquarium and much more.  A great addition to this will be a unique view of the city and the surrounding mountains. </p><h2>  Ski vacation </h2><p>  Do you have a weakness for ski resorts?  You are fabulously lucky!  Because this city is also a center of winter recreation and sports.  <span>Innsbruck ski resorts</span> are a magnificent combination of all the charms of high-class relaxation and sophistication of one of the most attractive cities in the world.

    <p>  Especially popular is the easily accessible village of Eagles, located 7 kilometers from the city of Innsbruck.  The ski resort is located at an altitude of 900 meters and successfully combines measured rural life and urban rhythm.  To the west lies the equally popular Mutterer-Alm ski area, sheltered on the slopes of Saile.  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe central part of Tyrol is the tract Axamer-Litzum, located 9 kilometers south of Innsbruck.  At all ski resorts there are slopes of varying difficulty, including for beginners.  The season lasts from December to April.  The exception is Stubai, where you can ride almost all year round. </p>
