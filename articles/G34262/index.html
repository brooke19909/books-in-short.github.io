    <h2>  Average salary of a guide </h2><p>  We will immediately take the bull by the horns and deal with the most burning issue.  Perhaps after this section, most readers will not even want to delve further into the topic.  So why bother? </p><p>  Conductor's salary is hourly.  According to the rules of Russian Railways, there is a limit on the number of shifts per month - 15, the norm of hours at the same time is 176. </p><p>  The amount of payment depends on the category of train (they pay more for work on <span>branded trains,</span> on international flights), season, range, complexity of the flight, the number of night crossings, the region and much more.  There may be surcharges for length of service, referral, for the implementation of a sales plan, premiums, in some regions a district coefficient is charged. </p>

    <p>  For 2017, the minimum payment is about 11,500 rubles, and the maximum that you can really count on is 33,000 rubles.  If we talk about the average salary of a long-distance train conductor, then it amounts to a little more than 22 thousand rubles a month.  Such data are given for Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  If these figures do not scare you, let's study the topic in more detail. </p><h2>  Benefits for Russian Railways employees </h2><p>  But not a single salary conductor of Russian Railways.  Work in this structure is largely motivated by benefits.  They are provided not only to guides, but to all workers on the <span>railway.</span>  There are several groups of benefits: </p><ul><li>  social; </li><li>  labor; </li><li>  payroll; </li><li>  labor protection; </li><li>  social guarantees. </li></ul><p>  As you can see, there are a lot of them.

    <p>  Education (higher or retraining) is paid in absentia.

There are assistance programs for young employees. </p><p>  <span>Salaries are</span> indexed annually (even twice in 2017), holidays are paid at a higher rate, and annual paid leave (28 days) is provided. </p><p>  Workers are paid special clothing, medical examinations and medical examinations with travel and accommodation. </p><p>  Young mothers are paid an additional allowance beyond what is provided by the Social Insurance Fund.  Pay it up to 3 years. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The company partially compensates for the costs of: </p><ul><li>  treatment in sanatoriums; </li><li>  child education; </li><li>  sports activities for employees and their children. </li></ul><p>  Loans and subsidies with preferential terms are provided for those who purchase housing. </p><p>  After retirement, employees retain the right to a number of bonuses (subject to the development of the necessary length of service).

The applicant must have at least secondary education.  Special training is also needed, which can be obtained at a school, college or technical school in the direction of "Passenger carriage guide."

    <p>  For those who want to try themselves in this profession and find out how much the conductors actually receive, there is the opportunity to become a temporary employee.  Such sets are held every year during the peak load in the summer months, when additional trains are formed. </p><p>  As you can see, there are enough requirements, despite the fact that the guide‚Äôs salary is not high even with heavy workloads.  Nevertheless, only candidates who meet all the set requirements and really want to work on the railroad are hired for this position. </p><p>  Experienced people say that the profession of a Russian Railways conductor combines several: you need to be both a waiter, a loader, a janitor, and a psychologist. </p><h2>  Requirements for a candidate </h2><p>  The gender for the job seeker vacancy does not matter.  Education, as already mentioned, is not lower than secondary (11 classes of the school), and profile education is also needed.  There is an age limit: from 18 to 45 years for women and from 18 to 50 years for men.  An <span>excellent state of</span> health is also required. </p><p>  Work experience is desirable, but without experience it is quite possible to get a second guide.  A sanitary book is also required. </p><p>  To work on international flights, knowledge of a foreign language is required. </p>

In addition, you still need to prepare the car for the road, and after the trip, put it in order and pass it. </p><p>  For an uninitiated person, this profession looks simple and even primitive, but in fact it requires a huge amount of a wide variety of skills, because there are all kinds of situations on the road. </p><h2>  Disadvantages of the profession </h2><p>  The work of the conductor is considered quite difficult both in the physical and in the emotional aspect.  People are different, often conflict situations arise, the regimen of the day is torn.
