Credit brokerage companies, Moscow: assistance in obtaining a loan</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Finding a bank, getting a loan, and most importantly, getting it is not an easy task, especially when it comes to rather impressive amounts.  Nevertheless, brokerage companies in Moscow can help in this matter, the rating of which is annually compiled on the basis of consumer feedback.  Before choosing the appropriate office for the provision of such services, it is worthwhile to understand in more detail who the brokers are.  How safe is it to work with them?  And is there any benefit to this? </p><h2>  Who is a loan broker? </h2><p>  In fact, this person is an intermediary who helps in obtaining a loan for a certain monetary reward.  By and large, the loan broker negotiates with the bank and represents the interests of the client, the latter can only come to the credit institution at the appointed time and put a signature in the agreement. </p>

    <p>  However, it should be borne in mind that credit brokerage companies in Moscow cannot guarantee a 100% probability of obtaining a loan to those customers who previously had delays in loans.  Simply put, if a borrower has a bad credit history, even the best broker in the city will not be able to completely clear it. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How does collaboration work? </h2><p>  Before you consider the rating of brokerage companies in Moscow, it is worth a little more to study the procedure for contacting a specialist.  It should be noted right away that today in the Russian Federation there are more than 3 thousand companies providing such services.  Some are officially registered, while others operate without a license. </p><p>  If a client seeks help in obtaining a loan from Moscow brokerage companies, then cooperation is built according to the following algorithm: </p><ol><li>  A person makes an appointment with a specialist. </li><li>  The broker reviews the credit history of the client and evaluates his approximate chances of a successful loan. </li><li>  The specialist draws up a list of banking institutions that are most likely to agree to provide a borrower with a loan for a certain amount. </li><li>  The client chooses the most interesting conditions and the bank with which he wants to start cooperation. </li><li>  The broker agrees with the credit institution and informs the borrower where he will need to drive to conclude the agreement. </li><li>  The borrower signs a contract and receives a sum of money, after which his specialist is awarded a fee. </li></ol>

If the answer is yes, then it is better not to contact such an office.  Since if the bank refuses, the client will not receive an advance payment back.  Most often, scammers act in this way, which disappear immediately after receiving a reward. </p><p>  Employees of reliable companies never ask for any prepayment.  And the amount of interest is usually not more than 2% of the loan received.  Nevertheless, it all depends on the complexity of the situation.  If the borrower has a very bad credit history, then it will not be so easy to find a bank that agrees to start cooperation.  In this case, the percentage of remuneration increases. </p><h2>  Can a broker really help in obtaining a loan? </h2><p>  Most often, those borrowers who already have problems with credit organizations turn to specialists.  Usually these are people who, due to some circumstances or simple reluctance, did not pay the previous loan on time, which in turn led to a decrease in the credit line. </p>

    <p>  It is worth saying that the lists of brokerage companies in Moscow can be found on every corner.  However, this does not mean that any of the proposed organizations can really help in obtaining loans.  Most of these companies employ inexperienced specialists who do not know all the intricacies of obtaining loans, provided that the client does not have a good history of loans. </p><p>  If you apply to a brokerage company with a high rating and positive reviews, then the chances of receiving money at a percentage increase significantly. </p><h2>  Where is more profitable? </h2><p>  When compiling the rating of Moscow brokerage companies, first of all, the tariff rates of offices are taken into account.  The most profitable organization was recognized by IT Invest, in which the client gives 0.035% for a standard transaction.  However, in this case, the minimum amount on the client‚Äôs account must be at least 9 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth noting almost the same rate at BCS if the client purchases a package called "Start".  In this case, the minimum invoice amount can be any.  It is worth considering the rating of brokerage companies in Moscow, which are also distinguished by reliability and fairly favorable rates. </p><h2>  Finam - United Optimum </h2><p>  The transaction fee for this organization is also 0.354%, but the fee cannot be less than 177 rubles per month for the provision of services.  The minimum total amount on the client‚Äôs account must be at least 2 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  Wales - Capital-Universal </h2><p>  By contacting this organization, which occupies one of the leading positions in the rating of brokerage companies in Moscow, the client can count on a rather favorable commission from the transaction, which today is 0.036%.  At the same time, there is no reward for monthly customer service and a minimum threshold for the amount in the client‚Äôs account.  However <span>, depository services</span> will amount to 200 rubles per month. </p><h2>  Alfa-Bank - Optimal </h2><p>  In this company, the percentage of the transaction is 0.04% without commission for services.  In this case, the client can deposit any amount into the account.  Provided the depositary will be charged about 0.004% annually. </p>

    <p>  It is also worth paying attention to the programs of VTB 24 - Investor Standard (0.0413%), Uralsib - Capital Basic (0.0472%) and Promsvyazbank - Dent (0.05%).  In all other organizations, the stakes will be higher. </p><h2>  Black loan brokers </h2><p>  Today, activities of such organizations are not regulated, therefore, a large number of fraudsters can be found on the market, cooperation with which can lead to disastrous consequences. </p><p>  You can identify a black loan broker by the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  High commission.  Very often, scammers demand too high rewards. </li><li>  Lack of company information.  Fraudsters never register companies officially.  In addition, they often do not have a fixed landline telephone, as they do not rent offices. </li></ul>
