    <h2>  Mentions and History </h2><p>  The first mention of the city dates back to the beginning of the 10th century.  In the oldest chronicle of England, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, it is mentioned that a monastery was located on the site of the current settlement.  Already at the beginning of the XII century, in order to educate the <span>population of England</span> in the city, the construction of the country's first university began, which later became the most popular educational institution not only in the state, but also in the whole world.  It was thanks to students who came to this territory from all over the country that Oxford became a real city. </p><p>  In 1355, a pogrom was committed, as a result of which the city on the Thames with an ancient university lost 63 students.  Because of this, the settlement (or rather, its administration) had to pay 470 years (almost five centuries) a fine to an educational institution. </p><p>  At present, there are about 160 thousand people in Oxford, of which about 30% are university students.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city is 45 km <sup>2</sup> . </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Climate </h2><p>  The city on the Thames has typical English, with frosty snowy winters and warm, humid summers, the climate.
