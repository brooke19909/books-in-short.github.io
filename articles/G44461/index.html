Workshops with photos</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  How to make an elastic band for hair?  Such a question is often asked by girls with long hair.  A variety of elastic bands are able to modify the hairstyle, they can be selected both for a casual outfit and for evening out.  There are options for little girls and schoolgirls, and there are original products for adult ladies. </p><p>  Our article on how <span>to make an elastic band</span> for hair with your own hands.  For the basis of any product, they take a purchased simple elastic band without any decorations and decorate it depending on the wishes, the chosen color and style.  You can wrap the elastic completely with a cloth, or you can only add a central decorative element of fabric, ribbons or lace.  Often a bright brooch or button, beads or rhinestones are sewn into the middle.  Let's consider some interesting ideas on how to make an elastic band for hair in different ways. </p><h2>  Felt-based elastic </h2><p>  This option is suitable for beginner masters, since doing such a craft is quite simple.  Take a small circle cut from felt as the basis.  In this case, we see that yellow was used in the sample in the photo below.  To decorate the gum, you need to prepare many identical pieces of pink ribbon, a package of small decorative lace flowers, beads for the middle design and a fluffy white pompom. </p><div class="photo" data-original="lc.pandahall.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="a simple flower on an elastic band for hair" class="if uuid-2713660" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2713660.jpg"></div><p>  The decoration of the product begins with the attachment of pieces of tape bent by loops.  First, the edges of the tape must be melted with a candle or a lighter, so that subsequently the threads at the edges do not pour in.  You can grab the loops with stitches to the felt base or stick with a glue gun.  The next step is to place the flowers tightly against each other around the inner circle so that the ends of the ribbon are not visible.  It remains at an equal distance to glue the half beads or sew round beads (you can use rhinestones or pebbles, beads or other decorative material) and set the fluffy ball in the very middle.  When everything is ready, from the back, sew the craft on an elastic band. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Contrast bow </h2><p>  Before you make the gum for the hair itself, think about what color ribbons will be needed so that the product harmonizes with clothing and accessories.  To make such a beautiful bow, as in the photo below, you need to buy a wide and narrow ribbon of light chocolate color and white organza.  To connect all layers of the craft, a beige button is used, on which a bright crown with rhinestones can be glued. </p><div class="photo" data-original="gaberibbon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="contrast bow for elastic bands" class="if uuid-2713603" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2713603.jpg"></div><p>  Next, we consider in more detail how to make an elastic band for hair from satin. </p><p>  Begin work on a wide ribbon.  Do not cut the line immediately so as not to make a mistake.  It is better to first fold the bow, consisting of several turns, leaving small beveled edges at the beginning of the work and at the end.  Immediately melt them so that the trimmed sides look neat and the threads do not roll in when using the elastic.  At the center point, make a few threads matching the tone to lock the bow. </p><p>  The next step will be the selection of a wide strip of organza, folded in half.  To do this, stepping back a bit from the edge, stitch the entire length of the fabric with stitches, tighten the thread and sew to the bottom ribbon.  Lastly, they attach a thin ribbon bent with eyelets, and all layers are connected with a decorated button. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Three layer beaded bow </h2><p>  Before you make a beautiful elastic band for hair, as in the photo below, pick up a wide and thin ribbon of white color and medium width with a contrasting pattern.  The central holder of all layers selected red bright heart. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="multilayer bows" class="if uuid-2713613" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2713613.jpg"></div><p>  Long ends are left only on a thin ribbon located on top of two bows.  3 beads are strung on each hanging edge, matched in the same color scheme as the ribbons.  The edges are tied on tight knots so that the beads do not fall when moving. </p><h2>  Kanzashi flowers </h2><p>  How to make small elastic bands for hair to look spectacular?  The kanzashi technique will help.  This is the manufacture of beautiful floral elements from simple satin ribbons.  Flowers consist of 5 identical petals (two white and three red) and two leaves of green ribbon.  Let's see how to make such elements. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="flowers for gum" class="if uuid-2713598" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2713598.jpg"></div><p>  To create a petal, you need to cut the squares of white and red.  Then each folds in half diagonally.  Further on each side make a couple of folds, collecting the edges in the center.  It is most convenient to use tweezers to hold the tissue together.  Then the lower edge is trimmed with scissors and melted with a lighter, pressing all the layers with tweezers.  One petal is ready!  Similarly, they do all the other parts and glue them to each other with a glue gun, attaching a small pebble for beauty in the center. </p><h2>  How to make leaflets </h2><p>  After making the main flower for the gum, the girl starts working on the leaves.  To do this, fold the green ribbon 10 cm long in half.  We leave the bent edge intact, but from one of its corners we draw a straight line to the opposite on the other side and cut it with scissors as outlined.  Get a triangle.  Again the trimmed edges are melted and pressed to each other with tweezers or fingers.  Hold a little and they are firmly glued without glue. </p><p>  It remains only to turn the workpiece to the other side and attach the leaves under the flower made earlier.  Here you can use the glue gun to connect the parts together and attach the jewelry to the gum itself. </p><h2>  Kansashi Bowknot </h2><p>  Now we will consider how to make bow ties in the form of elastic bands for hair.  It will take a base to place the finished petals.  It is most convenient to cut it from a sheet of felt, matched to the color of a satin ribbon.  How to make petals using the kanzashi technique, you already know.  To make this hair elastic, you will need to make 12 identical elements and attach them to the felt base in the form of two connected triangles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="small petal bow" class="if uuid-2713655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2713655.jpg"></div><p>  Between them place a central brooch with shiny rhinestones and a beautiful bow can be installed on an elastic band. </p><h2>  Craft for a beam </h2><p>  A beautiful elastic band for a daughter to put on a bun of hair is made from different elements connected in one composition.  These are white flowers using the kanzashi technique, and large multilayer details from contrasting colors.  Arrange the collected elements symmetrically, leaving room for a large bow. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="beautiful elastic band" class="if uuid-2713607" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2713607.jpg"></div><p>  The gum looks very impressive due to the combination of different types of petals and fabrics, however, all the details look harmoniously together.  Additional elements selected are blue beads and large rhinestones. </p><p>  As you can see, making an elastic band for hair with your own hands from ribbons and fabric is easy.  The photographs presented in the article will help to bring the described work to life easier.  You can vary and combine different types of parts in one product.  The main thing is to choose fabrics and decorative elements that look together harmoniously, then the finished gum will turn out beautiful and made with taste.  Good luck </p>
