This is the Mikhailovsky Bank, reviews of which will be presented later.  The institution began its work in 1994 in the Volgograd region (the city of Mikhailovka - hence the name).  Already in 2008, the office opened in the capital, and in 2013 the institution showed an authorized capital of 252 million rubles. <br>  About how the Mikhailovsky Bank works today, customer and employee reviews - read this article. </p>

    <h2>  Structure </h2><p>  In general, the bank is managed by several authorities.  Firstly, this is a meeting of shareholders at which common, most significant issues in the institution are decided.  Secondly, there is a board of directors and a bank board.  These elements are engaged in executive activities and are accountable to the shareholders meeting.  In particular, there is a <span>chairman of the board</span> - a person who is directly responsible for the activities of the board, who personally makes the most important decisions.  Thirdly, further in the hierarchy are structural divisions specializing in solving certain issues. <br>  Such a structure can be said to be typical of banking institutions.  With it, Mikhailovsky Bank can most effectively fulfill all current tasks and make decisions on more global, key moments in development. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Service list </h2><p>  If you look at the list of services that the institution provides its customers, it is typical for the banking sector.  There are three groups of entities that may be of interest to the bank's services: these are private (individuals) individuals, companies (legal entities), and also financial organizations.  Each of them presents certain types of services such as lending and <span>depository activities,</span> cash services, securities trading, transactions with bills and others.  Mikhailovsky Bank (customer reviews confirm this) has its official website, which contains a description of tariffs and available options. </p>

    <h2>  Ratings </h2><p>  To understand a little more about this institution, you need to pay attention to the polls in which it participated.  After all, the fact is that each bank constantly receives ratings from agencies and companies that make up rating lists on certain issues.  Due to this <span>, bank customers</span> who have not previously been served by them can find out at least approximately what they are dealing with. <br>  Of course, the Mikhailovsky Bank, which reviews are not so easy to find, is not so large an institution that there is a lot of information about it.  In the rating, where the volumes of <span>assets of</span> Russian <span>banks</span> were estimated, it takes only 535 place (1.56 billion).  In another list, where the size of deposits of citizens and companies is noted, this structure is in 505 place (316 million).  If we talk about loans, the bank takes 544 lines with a total of 75 million rubles issued. <br>  For a small regional bank from Mikhailovka, this, of course, is the expected result - it is clear, after all, that they do not expect to occupy leadership positions in the all-Russian market. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Customer reviews </h2><p>  As for how his institution responds to the institution, then with this everything is quite predictable.  Indeed, Mikhailovsky Bank does not have a lot of characteristics: people write that at first they were afraid to invest their money here, due to its obscurity.  But in general, cooperation with the institution attracts with its simplicity and reliability.  The bank has a small network and not many customers, but with respect to the employees it can be said that everyone who addresses is appreciated here.  Moreover, this applies to both those who invest, and the people who arrange loans. <br>  We can note positively the desire of the management of the structure to expand the network of influence and, thus, provide comfortable service for each client.  The bank has one branch in Moscow and several in Volgograd (including the central office).  In the Volgograd region, the network of ATMs “Mikhailovsky” is expanding, which allows us to talk about comfortable services for residents of the region covering this institution. </p><h2>  Internet banking </h2>

    <p>  Despite the fact that we are talking about a relatively small structure, the bank has its own Internet banking for <span>corporate clients.</span>  It is quite simple and performs only basic functions that can be claimed by companies and organizations.  But with the help of this online platform, a whole series of operations and functions interacting with corporate clients is greatly simplified.  Perhaps in the future a similar platform will be open for individuals who are served here. </p><h2>  Employee Reviews </h2><p>  There is practically no information on the network from people working for the Mikhailovsky Bank.  Reviews may not be left due to relatively small staff.  It can also be assumed that there is not such a large staff turnover, but this is a good indicator.  The second factor also plays in his favor: at the time of writing, there were no open offers on job sites with Mikhailovskiy Bank.  Employee reviews, for this reason we could not find. <br>  In general, the institution has been successfully operating on the market for a rather long period of time, it can be concluded that the employees here have acceptable conditions, since there has not yet been any major scandal.  Otherwise, it would be written about on many sites with reviews. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  Summarizing all of the above information, which, alas, is not so much, we can draw the following conclusions.  Those characteristics that we were able to find are generally praised by Mikhailovsky Bank: feedback on loans, deposits and other services that the institution provides are positive.  We were also unable to find information that customers are improperly treated here or are conducting some fraudulent transactions.  Let's look at the obvious facts: the bank has been operating for many years, even with a relatively narrow circle of customers.  For all this time, he has been building up his assets (as data from public sources on the financial performance of the institution may indicate), which proves the profitability of his work.  Therefore, to answer the question whether it is worth contacting this bank if you are satisfied with all the conditions, you can positively. </p>
