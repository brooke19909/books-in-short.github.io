A well-thought-out program allows you to save money profitably, receiving a small percentage with enviable regularity.  The amount depends on how large the client‚Äôs savings. </p><p>  The Cosmos cashback card from Home Credit also provides <span>additional income</span> .  This is a relatively small benefit, determined by the amount of user spending.  A specific benefit program has been developed.  This is the Cosmos cashback card from Home Credit: almost a third of the amount spent can be returned back to the client.  The offer applies to a limited number of outlets, but their list is quite extensive.  The offer is valid in several hundred partners of the bank.  Refunds vary from store to store.

    <h2>  Benefits </h2><p>  If you pay attention to the program that describes in detail how to use the Cosmos card ‚ÄúHome Credit‚Äù, you will notice that the greatest benefits are associated with the ‚ÄúPlatinum‚Äù status.  In this case, the client gains access to a number of specific privileges and can count on especially large discounts.  In addition, it is possible to take advantage of some advantageous offers developed not by the bank, but by the Visa payment system.  The service life of such a card is longer than that of any other bank by two years.  The first year of service is free of charge.  When this period expires, the use becomes paid, but for platinum debit cards tariff plans are more than affordable.  This is partially offset by bonuses and discounts provided by partner stores on the Cosmos card from Home Credit. </p><p>  Among other positive aspects of using the card are high limits on cash withdrawals.  These indicators are higher than in most similar proposals of other banking institutions.  The card is available to users if they fulfill the conditions established in the banking program.  They are quite simple, accessible to people whose income level is average, so the card as a whole is optimal for the masses.  The larger percentage is accrued on the balance, the more at the end of the billing period on the money card.  The first five times you can cash money from a card without a commission, even when using ATMs of other banks.  This is really profitable, it allows you to quickly get the right amount without spending extra money. </p><h2>  For lovers of saving and spending </h2><p>  Based on the positive points described above, we can understand why there has been an increasing number of people recently who want to know how to draw up a Cosmos card ‚ÄúHome Credit‚Äù.  Indeed, given favorable offers, the program seems extremely tempting.  In addition, as the bank draws attention, if the user wants to cash out a small amount from the card, the commission that he will pay will be minimal.  There are no restrictions on the lower border - you can withdraw exactly the amount that the cardholder needs.  Money is issued in rubles, interest for the service is not charged. </p><p>  The bonus program deserves special attention.  Many partner stores on the Cosmos card from Home Credit give additional discounts, and some of the spent is returned back to the user after a period of time.  Cashback varies - it depends on the particular store, the current offer, and on the amount of the transaction.  Nevertheless, such an opportunity is always a benefit.  You can use it in several hundred stores, of which the most visited are M.Video, L'Etoile, Daughters and Sons. </p><h2>  Are there any disadvantages? </h2><p>  Cosmos from Home Credit is a relatively convenient financial offer, but it also has some disadvantages.  In particular, service using SMS messages will have to be connected for money.  Of course, the same Sberbank also charges a fee for these services, but nevertheless, in most modern banks, an SMS package is provided for free.  In addition, if there is a need to transfer money from bank to bank, Home Credit will take a high percentage for such an operation.  To do this, you have to go to the office, issue an order, only after that the transfer will be completed. </p>

    <p>  Another aspect is the procedure for transferring points on the Cosmos card from Home Credit.  The procedure is not easy, and for the first time it is better to use the help of the operator through the hotline so as not to make mistakes.  This will allow you not to lose your profit and wisely use the offer, as they say, "in full." </p><h2>  How to get the? </h2><p>  As can be seen from the conditions of service, to get a card, you must contact the bank office.  Here the user draws up the papers laid down under the service contract, signs them personally, only after that the credit company includes him in the number of program participants.  It is currently not possible to place an order through the bank‚Äôs website.  To get a card, you need to come to the Home Credit department with your passport.  Typically, an application is filled out by a bank representative, and the user only signs on the application and indicates the date of filling out the documentation.  This activates the release process and shows that the potential user of the service agrees to the service tariffs.  Usually the procedure takes no more than ten minutes.  However, as can be seen from the reviews of the banking structure, in many branches, especially at the end of the working day, one may encounter the queue problem.  When planning a trip to Home Credit, you should be prepared to spend at least half an hour at the office, since queues often drag on for 10-15 minutes. </p><p>  Interacting with the operator, it can be noted that the client is interested in instant card issuance.  An alternative is the personalized plastic card Cosmos from Home Credit.  It takes some time to wait for the nominal: sometimes just a couple of days, and sometimes two or even three weeks.  As a rule, the manager of the credit structure at the time of placing the order notifies the maximum possible length of the waiting period.  When the card is prepared for use, it is sent to the office where the client left the application.  After that, the manager contacts the phone number specified by the user, you can come for your payment plastic.  But the applicant receives the instant issue card as soon as the paperwork process is completed.  However, please note: the rules and rates for these cards are slightly different.  Nominal is more profitable and in general has more opportunities for application.  Some stores do not authorize transactions on instant cards, and also do not approve the presentation of such a card when making an expensive purchase. </p><h2>  "Benefit" to everyone's benefit </h2><p>  As can be seen from the description of the program, ‚ÄúHome Credit‚Äù allows you to get some benefit when using the ‚ÄúCosmos‚Äù card through the ‚ÄúBenefits‚Äù bonus program.  Benefit get those who make purchases from partners of the financial structure.  The system logically resembles cashback capabilities and allows you to get back almost a third of the spent (in some cases). </p><p>  Stores provide points for different conditions.  In some it will be a percentage of the perfect purchase, while in others they give a fixed amount of bonuses, and the amount of the check does not matter.  Home Credit additionally accrues bonus points to those who make payments through a virtual personal account.  You can thus receive a reward by paying for housing and communal services or fines, as well as transferring money for any service.  The period of accrual of bonus points depends on the particular participant in the program, in the general case this happens on the third or fifth day from the date of the transaction.  The longest period for crediting points is a month and a half.  The Bank warns that in rare cases, the period may even stretch for 70 days.  If points on the bonus program did not arrive on time (as can be seen from the reviews about the card, this happens), you need to contact the support service via the hotline.  In addition, chat is constantly working on the company‚Äôs website, where operators can answer the client‚Äôs question. </p><h2>  Bonus Features </h2><p>  As you can see from the list presented on the bank‚Äôs official website, you can get a bonus by making a purchase on the Litres website, as well as when concluding transactions on Aliexpress.  Home Credit offers bonuses when making purchases in fashion stores - this is the popular BeFree, accessible to the general public Otto, and the convenient virtual LaModa catalog.  You can get a certain amount from the purchase back in the <span>form of bonuses by</span> paying with a Home Credit card in Red Cuba and the Technosila, M. Video, and Media Markt equipment stores.  In a word, there are really many opportunities, and the program partners are those outlets where most of our fellow citizens regularly make purchases. </p>

    <p>  Bonus exchange is carried out by analogy ‚Äúfor one bonus - one ruble of a check‚Äù.  In this case, the conversion is made in 10 days.  To use the program, you need to fill out a request through your personal account on the bank's website.  After the receipt of the corresponding application, the conversion process begins, upon completion, the user receives a notification. </p><h2>  Visa to the world of benefits </h2><p>  When choosing the ‚ÄúHome Credit‚Äù ‚ÄúCosmos‚Äù premium card, the user gets the opportunity to use special offers developed by the ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù payment system.  In particular, this is a popular action "Creative weekend", in which you can go to the most significant events in the world of art.  Only to participants of this payment system the opportunity is available both without the need to wait for their turn and without the need to pay for tickets. </p><p>  Holders of the Cosmos card from the Visa payment system have other advantages: you can count on discounts at a wide variety of establishments and institutions.  These are no longer partners of a particular bank, but working with the payment system of the company.  In addition to shops, special offers are made by service salons, hotels and entertainment facilities.  In Russia, cardholders are especially interested in special price tags for services introduced by the Azimut hotel chain and Ascona chain stores.  You can also get special offers at the Sunlight jewelry store chain or when you visit the RIO Oceanarium. </p><h2>  The best for those who want to be the best </h2><p>  As can be seen from the description, Home Credit has developed the Cosmos card for those who want to use the premium offer of the financial structure.  The program allows you to make good profits and not just save what you earned, but also increase it without putting any effort into it.  If on the card at the end of the billing period the amount varies from one hundred to five hundred thousand, then the bank charges 7.5% of this value.  If there is even more money, then the interest rate varies from 3 to 7.5%. </p>

    <p>  For the first year, the bank does not charge money for the card at all, and subsequently you will have to pay for services per month: one month costs 99 rubles.  If on the card every day there is an amount in excess of ten thousand rubles, or the user makes a transaction using the card in the amount of five thousand, then this month becomes completely free for him.  True, 59 rubles will have to be paid for SMS services of the bank. </p><h2>  Profitable and affordable </h2><p>  When applying for a card issue, the user can have no doubt: nothing will have to be paid.  The main card is first published completely dissolute.  Any citizen of our country can get it if his age is 21 years and older.  To confirm your age and citizenship, as well as to have with you all the necessary personal data to conclude an agreement with a credit company, you must be with your passport when visiting the office.  The questionnaire, which the company manager will fill out, focusing on the client‚Äôs documents, is available for public inspection on the bank‚Äôs website.    ,        ‚Äì , ,        . </p><h2>  Some features </h2><p>   ¬´¬ª   ¬´ ¬ª       500  .    ,    ‚Äì    ,    .  1 %      ,   ,           .   ,    , ‚Äì  .     ‚Äì            .      , ,      .         .    ,     ,      ¬´¬ª   10 %. </p><p>    ,    ,    . ,    ‚Äì           .     ,      ,    ,    .             .      ,          . </p><h2>    </h2><p> As many customers of the bank note, the service at Home Credit is at its best.  When registering for participation in financial programs, the user leaves a contact phone number for communication, as in any other banking structure, after which he may encounter a number of calls from the technical service, operators offering new profitable tariff options.  If a person is interested in receiving information in this way, he saves his number in the customer database, and if he does not want to be distracted, he simply informs the manager of his desire to exclude the phone number from the database.  After that, there will be no anxiety on the part of the bank: neither SMS, nor intrusive calls.  Many people note this as an undoubted plus, especially clearly visible in comparison with a number of other financial companies, whose clients constantly complain about calls, spam and advertising mailing.  In addition, the bank carefully saves its database, so no unauthorized persons have access to customer contact information.  You can not be afraid for your safety. </p>

    <p>  As you can see from the reviews, many draw up cards by placing money on a deposit in Home Credit - this banking structure offers quite favorable interest rates in cooperation with it, especially if the client has an impressive amount.  You can transfer your salary here, and then, when issuing a card, the client receives an additional bonus (at the moment - 500 rubles).  In addition to debit cards, you can issue credit plastic.  This is quite beneficial, although many prefer to avoid such cards. </p>
