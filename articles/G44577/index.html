    <p>  Where is cheap housing in Russia?  For the same reasons, affordable real estate can be purchased in Makhachkala, Magas.  Here the cost of 1 square.  meter is 26,000 rubles.  But even because of the low cost, not all citizens want to move to these cities from calmer areas of the country. </p><h2>  Settlement Features </h2><p>  Since the government plans to resettle isolated cities, a decision has already been made to eliminate about 340 points where people will be relocated.  Housing has become affordable in these regions.  For example, in Asbest (Sverdlovsk Region), an apartment with 3 rooms (50 sq. M) costs 1 million rubles, therefore, for 1 sq.  m is taken 20,000 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  When the house is ready for operation, an act of its transfer and acceptance is drawn up.  The buyer must put a signature that fixes the ownership of the housing.  After receiving the certificate, the apartment becomes "secondary".  Such real estate is private, state and municipal. </p><p>  To choose a suitable apartment, you need to pay attention to several important criteria: </p><ul><li>  cost: in the primary market, the price per 1 sq. km.  the meter is determined by the construction stage, and on the secondary apartments have a fixed indicator; </li><li>  terms: when buying a "secondary" apartment, you can enter it immediately, but from the "primary" you will have to wait for the completion of construction; </li><li>  investments: for secondary housing requires less investment, since the object is already considered residential; </li><li>  assortment: more options are presented in the secondary market; </li><li>  Risks: when buying an apartment on the secondary market, the transaction is associated with the company, which may cause risks; </li><li>  registration: in order to register in a new building, you must have a certificate of state registration; </li><li>  investment income: if you purchase housing at the construction stage, then after its completion you can get a high income; </li><li>  mortgage: not all financial institutions work with the primary market; </li><li>  the effect of new housing: the advantage of the primary apartment is legal ‚Äúcleanliness‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  The advantages of new buildings and secondary housing </h2><p>  Primary and secondary housing offers benefits.  New buildings have the following advantages: </p><ul><li>  modern materials are used; </li><li>  houses are durable; </li><li>  the apartments are spacious; </li><li>  convenient layout; </li><li>  equipped communications. </li></ul><p>  But the demand for such housing is still connected with the cost.  A new building has a lower price than the same object of the secondary market.  <span>New buildings are being built</span> using the new safety rules, as well as using technologies and materials.  Such an object has a warranty period.  A period of 5 years is established on walls, windows, doors, and 3 years on engineering systems.  If during this period there are any problems, then you can contact the construction company and demand the elimination of the malfunction. </p>
