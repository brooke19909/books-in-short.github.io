One of them is Znamenskoye-Raek.  The estate is located in the Tver region, near the city of Torzhok. </p><p>  This is a work of the architect Nikolai Lvov, the author of the projects on which the Nevsky Gate and the Holy Trinity Church in St. Petersburg were built.  Description of the Znamenskoye-Raek estate, the history of the estate, the current state of how to get to the architectural monument of the 18th century - all this is presented in the article. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stilarhitekturi.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Znamensky Rake" class="if uuid-2678103" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678103.jpg"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  <span>Manor Znamenskoye-Raek</span> is located 40 km from Tver and 15 from Torzhok.  You can get from Moscow via the M10 highway.  You need to drive Klin and, not reaching 20 km to Torzhok, turn left at the village of Mednoe.  In the direction of the estate Znamenskoye-Raek there are signs.  You can get there by public transport. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="56.9552723" data-lng="35.25315279999995" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="16"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/6/5/2/7/6527.png"></div><p>  Electric trains depart from Moscow to Tver every day from the Leningradsky railway station.  You can get to the terminal, and from there order a taxi.  The train from Moscow to Tver is 1 hour 40 minutes. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Traveling by rail is, of course, not the only way to get into the estate.  Transport connection between Moscow and Tver is excellent.  You can also get by bus to Znamenskoye-Raek. </p><p>  How to get to the estate?  There are many options.  Buses run from the Paveletsky <span>railway station, the</span> Novoyasenevskaya, VDNH, Krasnogvardeiskaya, Tushinskaya <span>bus</span> stations, and from the Rechnoy vokzal metro station.  You don‚Äôt need to get to the final one - get off at the "Maryino Village" stop.  To the estate Znamenskoye-Raek will have to walk another three kilometers on foot. </p><p>  The attraction is located a little away from the Leningrad highway.  This is one of the most beautiful estates in the country.  For many years, restoration work has been carried out on the territory of the Znamenskoye-Raek estate.  The current state of this architectural monument is slightly above average.  Although there are many visitors, especially in the summer.  Excursions are regularly held. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dickhunter.narod.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamenskoye rake Torzhoksky district" class="if uuid-2678109" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678109.jpg"></div><h2>  Title </h2><p>  "Znamenskoye-Raek" is a word that is fraught with many mysteries.  Researchers argue about its origin to this day.  There is a version that the name of the estate Znamenskoye-Raek in the Tver region came from the word "paradise".  The places where this architectural complex is located are painfully picturesque.  There is a legend that Catherine II, having been here, exclaimed enthusiastically: "This is paradise!" </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  What else can the name of the estate mean?  "Paradise" is archaism.  In the Dahl dictionary, this interpretation is given: "a box with moving pictures."  In other words, a puppet theater. </p><p>  Znamenskoye-Raek is a manor that really resembles something of a fake.  Surprisingly, filmmakers ignored the architectural ensemble, drowning in emerald greenery in the summer.  It seems that it was in such a manor that the sophisticated Turgenev girls should live. </p><p>  A lot of sad events in the history of the estate.  Znamenskoye-Raek will probably soon serve as a decoration for some historical film.  But restoration work is still underway. </p><h2>  Landlord </h2><p>  The estate was built in the 18th century.  Ivan Fedorovich Glebov, who held the post of Governor-General of Kiev in the mid-18th century, is not the only resident of the Znamenskoye-Raek estate.  His relatives lived on the estate for some time.  But little is known about them. </p><p>  Here once held grandiose festivities, points.  The estate was visited by the most famous people of Moscow and St. Petersburg.  After the death of Glebov, the estate brought a good income to his widow. </p><p>  This was one of the clan noble estates, of which many were built in Russia.  In the second half of the 18th century, people lived in it, who did not leave a trace in history, and therefore it is worth telling more about the first owner. </p><p>  Ivan Fedorovich Glebov, as already mentioned, was the Kiev Governor-General.  He held this position from 1762 to 1766.  Later he became Governor-General of St. Petersburg. </p><p>  Since 1751, Glebov was engaged in the resettlement of residents from Serbia in Russia.  During the seven-year war he served in the army, took part in the battle of Zorndorf.  Here he distinguished himself and was awarded the Order of St.  Alexander Nevsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In recent years, Glebov spent in the Tver region.  He lived for several years in the estate, which is discussed in this article.  But buried in Staritsa, on the territory of the Assumption Monastery. </p><p>  The main object on the estate is the Church of the Sign of the Mother of God.  This temple was built in 1766.  About six years later, the wife of the former Kiev governor-general was tonsured a nun.  Glebov made a family division of the estate.  There was no magnificent palace with a colonnade here. </p><div class="photo" data-original="stilarhitekturi.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Manor Znamensky rake scheme" class="if uuid-2678102" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678102.jpg"></div><h2>  Elizaveta Petrovna Streshneva </h2><p>  This lady was known in Moscow society primarily for her steep disposition.  She was a representative of the old boyar family of the Streshnevs.  But most importantly, it was thanks to this woman that the estate appeared, which today is included in popular excursions in the Tver region. </p><p>  When Glebov made the division of the estate, a luxurious architectural ensemble was not yet in his plans.  The idea arose later.  The estate was built according to the project of the architect Lvov for Elizabeth Petrovna Streshneva, the second wife of Ivan Fedorovich. </p><p>  She was the daughter of an general-chef.  They named it in honor of the then ruling empress, daughter of Peter.  There were nine children in the Streshnev family.  All of them died at an early age, except Elizabeth.  The old nobleman loved his only daughter very much, indulged her in everything.  The first and only time he showed severity when the seventeen-year-old daughter announced her intention to marry Glebov, who by that time turned 34 years old.  He was against this marriage. </p><p>  Nevertheless, Elizaveta Petrovna married the former Kiev Governor General.  Their wedding took place a year after the death of Streshnev.  She didn‚Äôt want to marry Glebov out of great love.  Elizabeth understood: this man is the only man she can manage, while respecting him. </p><p>  Glebov was in love with his young wife all his life.  For her sake, he built a luxurious estate in the Moscow region - Pokrovo-Streshnevo.  For his beloved wife, he ordered a project of the Znamenskoye-Raek estate from Lviv. </p><p>  Glebov hoped that in the estate, among the Tver forests, the beautiful Elizabeth would entirely belong to him.  He was extremely jealous.  However, Streshneva did not live long in this estate. </p><p>  After the death of her husband, she moved to a estate near Moscow, which over time turned almost into a museum.  Pokrovo-Streshnevo was rebuilt in a classic style.  The rooms of the house were decorated with portraits of representatives of two noble families - the Streshnevs and the Glebovs.  But this is a completely different story. </p><p>  But let us return to the Znamenskoye-Raek estate, more precisely, to the man, thanks to whose talent this unique architectural ensemble appeared.  Documents that would confirm the authorship of Nikolai Lvov were not preserved.  However, it is enough to look at other buildings designed by this architect, as all doubts dissipate. </p><div class="photo" data-original="konakovo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamenskoe rake main house" class="if uuid-2678105" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678105.jpg"></div><h2>  Nikolay Lvov </h2><p>  The architect of the estate Znamenskoye-Raek at the end of the 18th century was widely known both in Moscow and in St. Petersburg.  He was a very versatile person.  I found time not only for my main activity, but also for literature.  In addition, he was fond of music. </p><p>  Nikolai Lvov was born in the family of a poor Tver landowner.  At the age of 18 he entered the Preobrazhensky Regiment.  From a young age he was engaged in self-education, and by the time the estate was built, he was known in Moscow and St. Petersburg as one of the most witty and erudite people. </p><p>  The most famous architectural works of Lviv are concentrated in St. Petersburg.  There are several temples in the Tver region, built according to his designs.  For example, Borisoglebsky Cathedral in Torzhok. </p><p>  Lviv was a fan of Italian art.  Proof of this is the Znamenskoye-Raek estate.  Description and photos are presented in this article.  They are very reminiscent of descriptions and images of Italian estates. </p><p>  <span>Nikolai Lvov</span> paid great attention not only to decorative elements, but also to ventilation and heating.  He wrote several monographs on construction.  One of them is dedicated to stoves and fireplaces. </p><p>  Architectural structures in St. Petersburg, erected according to the projects of Nikolai Lvov: </p><ol><li>  Post Office Building. </li><li>  Church of St. Elijah the Prophet. </li><li>  Holy Trinity Church. </li><li>  The estate of Gabriel Derzhavin. </li></ol><p>  In addition, more than twenty buildings were preserved in Moscow, Gatchina and Torzhok. </p><h2>  Manor building </h2><p>  Preparatory work began in 1781.  Six years later, the foundation was laid.  It took twelve years to build.  This process was led by a colleague of Lviv, Franz Ivanovich Butsi.  Three more architects took part in the construction, among whom was an Italian master. </p><p>  Solemn lighting of the estate took place in 1798.  This event resulted in a festival that lasted three days.  The owner of the estate Rajek organized a ball grandiose: with fireworks, boating and other entertainment, fashionable at that time.  Even the most sophisticated guests were struck by the luxurious interior of the palace. </p><p>  The estate and its surroundings at the end of the 18th century, of course, looked different, not like it is today.  But something remained unchanged.  A wide alley led from the Petersburg tract to the estate.  It ended at the front gate, which resembled the Arc de Triomphe. </p><p>  The structure was decorated with elegant vases on the attic.  Approaching the gate, travelers saw a huge oval courtyard with outbuildings.  Today, tourists are walking along the same path.  True, there is no longer a magnificent garden, and in one of the wings there is a hotel. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mobile.twitter.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamenskiy rake front gate" class="if uuid-2678106" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678106.jpg"></div><h2>  Colonnade </h2><p>  It was difficult to surprise the garden and the front gate of the guests of the estate, representatives of the noble families.  The main attraction of the estate was the colonnade.  This is an unusual building, made in the Doric style, and today tourists see the Znamenskoye-Raek estate. </p><p>  The double colonnade combines the outbuildings with the main house.  Single - with gate.  An unusual gallery consists of 136 columns.  It is not known how much the construction of Glebov‚Äôs estate cost.  But of course, he had to spend a lot of money in order to build this "golden cage" for his young wife. </p><p>  The architecture of the main house is presented in a restrained style.  The building and other buildings make up a single architectural ensemble.  Columns of different heights.  However, they all have the same diameter.  The architectural composition impresses with its clarity and thoughtfulness.  clarity of form. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shkarupatanya.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamenskoe Rake Colonnade" class="if uuid-2678107" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678107.jpg"></div><h2>  Wings </h2><p>  In one of these buildings lived courtyards.  In another there was a greenhouse and a theater.  The courtyard resembled the Palace Square configuration.  In the center of it was a sculptural composition with a built-in fountain.  On holidays, on the orders of the estate owner, guns for fireworks were installed around the perimeter of the courtyard.  Peacocks roamed imposingly at the fountain. </p><p>  In the estate Znamenskoye-Raek held high society receptions.  Here, as already mentioned, Catherine the Great once visited.  Then she exclaimed a phrase, thanks to which the prefix "Raek" was added to the name of the Znamenskoe estate. </p><h2>  main hall </h2><p>  The estate resembled a miniature palace complex.  In the main house there was a front staircase, an oval-shaped lobby, and a huge hall in which guests danced and had leisurely idle conversations in the evenings. </p><p>  Architects thought out every little thing.  They arranged the light ceiling in such a way that the first sun's rays fell on the lower step.  Then they gradually rose.  The last rays illuminated the upper step. </p><p>  In the main hall, the architect, in love with the work of Italian masters, dreamed of making an open dome.  However, the Russian climate did not allow him to realize this idea.  The upper dome was painted blue, and the guests had the feeling that they were under an open cloudless sky. </p><p>  The decoration of the house was striking in its rich decoration.  The doors were mahogany.  Maroon fireplaces.  The parade, as expected, was decorated with portraits of Russian rulers. </p><p>  In 1813 an <span>inventory</span> was made of the <span>property.</span>  The extensive list includes many portraits, in addition, medallions, mirrors. </p><h2>  Garden and Ponds </h2><p>  Behind the house was an English garden of 22 hectares.  On the one hand, it was part of a manor composition.  On the other hand, it harmoniously blended with the surrounding landscape.  The main avenue led to the river. </p><p>  Ponds with cascades were arranged in the garden.  In the center of the uppermost, on a small island, planted three pine trees.  One of them has survived to the present day. </p><p>  Elizaveta Petrovna Glebova was a real socialite.  But this did not stop her from becoming interested in painting.  She painted several landscapes, including a picture depicting a pond with pine trees.  Thanks to her work, our contemporaries know what the garden looked like on the Znamenskoye-Raek estate in the early 19th century. </p><p>  The magnificent park was once decorated with arbors, marinas, baths, pavilions.  An elegant eight-column rotunda was installed near the main house.  And by the river there was a small building resembling a copy of an ancient temple. </p><p>  Fedor Mikhailovich Glebov died in 1799.  Elizaveta Petrovna spent several years in the estate, then moved to Moscow.  She outlived her husband for forty years.  They had three children, but none of them lived to adulthood. </p><p>  After the death of Elizabeth Petrovna, the estate passed to her distant relative.  Then the widow of Admiral Dubasov owned the estate.  Under the heirs of the estate, the process of destruction began. </p><h2>  XX century </h2><p>  What happened to the estate after the revolution is easy to guess.  She was nationalized, but first plundered.  Fortunately, they did not burn it, like most of the estates in Russia.  At first, there was a boarding house for civil servants.  Later, a pioneer camp, and a colony for minors. </p><p>  During the Great Patriotic War, a hospital was built within the walls of the Main House.  It is noteworthy that the legendary pilot Maresyev was treated here. </p><p>  In the eighties in the former noble estate was a dispensary.  Towards the end of the last century, the estate turned into almost ruins.  It was in such a deplorable state that Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who was here in 1996, remembered these places. </p><div class="photo" data-original="shkarupatanya.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamenskaya church" class="if uuid-2678108" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678108.jpg"></div><h2>  Restoration </h2><p>  Restoration work began in the 2000s.  Their company ‚ÄúConcor‚Äù finances them, to which the state has transferred the estate for long-term lease. </p><p>  In Soviet times, the main building in the estate was repaired more than once, but in a very peculiar way - wall paintings with high artistic value were repeatedly covered with cheap paint.  During the restoration work, the decoration of the noble house was partially restored.  In 2007, a mini-hotel was opened in one of the wings. </p><p>  There is a law "On objects of cultural heritage (historical and cultural monuments) of the peoples of the Russian Federation."  All restoration work is carried out in accordance with it.  That is, the goal of any construction activities that are carried out on the estate is to restore its former state, to recreate the situation of the late 18th century as much as possible.  And like any cultural monument, the estate is always open to visitors. </p><p>  Classical music concerts and art exhibitions are held at the Znamenskoye-Raek estate.  The address of the estate: Torzhok district, the village of Raek. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  Getting to the estate yourself is easy.  But it is worth remembering that it is not open for visiting on any day.  If you want to visit the sights of Torzhok, and at the same time to visit the legendary estate, go on a trip on Wednesday or Thursday.  Excursions to the estate are also held from Friday to Sunday.  But on weekends, there may be traffic jams on the M10.  Ticket price - 80 rubles. </p><div class="photo" data-original="krasivye-mesta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Znamenskoe Rake Park" class="if uuid-2678110" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/39254/2678110.jpg"></div><h2>  Reviews </h2><p> It is not known how long the restoration work will continue, but there are still many visitors to the estate.  Reviews about the trip to once one of the richest estates in Russia are mostly positive. </p><p>  On the estate there are many gazebos.  There are pavilions and grottoes.  On the main avenue, where royal people used to walk, you can go to the Logovier river. </p><p>  Tourists who visit here recommend a walk in the garden.  Although he is not particularly well-groomed today, there is a connection with nature.  Tours are held several times a day.  They involve visiting the main house and outbuildings.  You can visit the park any day.  Admission is 50 rubles. </p><p>  There are no restaurants or cafes on the estate.  Prices at the hotel, which is located on the estate, are quite high - renting a room per day will cost from 4800 to 6700 rubles. </p>
