Experiments on crossing humans and animals</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, the whole world literally turned upside down.  It was a period of crazy ideas, experiences and discoveries.  It was during this period of time that scientists seemed to be on the verge of the greatest discovery.  For the first time, the news that a cross between a human and an animal will occur appeared in 1909.  The biologist Ilya Ivanovich Ivanov said at the World Congress that creating a monkey man is quite possible.  And, he was not the only scientist dealing with this issue. </p>

    <h2>  Who and when was involved in the creation of the monkey man </h2><p>  In 1910, the surgeons Voronov and Stein made the first attempts at transplanting the glands of a monkey to a person.  The xenotransplant business gained such momentum that Voronov had to open his own monkey nursery in southern France. </p><p>  Rozanov Vladimir Nikolaevich, a well-known surgeon who operated at the time of Stalin and Lenin, also conducted numerous experiments in this area.  He transplanted glands of chimpanzees to people and, as it seemed, it promised a stunning success.  Local newspapers constantly published stories about how the glands of the primate can cure dementia, reduced potency and aging.  But were these attempts successful?  Over time, the world came to the conclusion that these experiments were just a placebo.  That is, the effect that was observed after xenotransplantation was nothing more than self-hypnosis. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Traces of unseen beasts </h2><p>  In the writings of Bernard Aivelmans, a biologist and a famous zoologist, there is a huge amount of mention of the so-called "yeti".  Whether snowmen really existed is still not known exactly.  A large number of scientists are of the opinion that the yeti actually lived near human settlements, but there are no less skeptics who deny this.  Once two cowboys managed to film a female snowman.  The famous plot of Patterson - Gimlin, on which the yeti is clearly visible, circled the whole world, however, scientists were found here who refute this event.  They believe that, since it is impossible to cross people with animals, the photos and videos presented by many eyewitnesses are nothing more than a montage. </p>

    <p>  There is one more evidence of the existence of at least one bigfoot.  In the pre-revolutionary forests of Abkhazia, an unusual woman was caught by one prince.  Her height was more than 2 meters, in addition, she was all covered with wool and could not speak.  Some scholars believe that experiments on crossing humans with animals could lead to the birth of such an individual.  She was forcibly brought to the settlement and kept locked up for a long time, as she was very aggressive.  There are facts confirming that the snow woman had an intimate relationship with men (people in the settlement) and gave birth to at least 4 children from them.  Khvit - one of her sons, subsequently had his family and children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Strong work force </h2><p>  It is known that at the beginning of the 20th century there was a catastrophic shortage of <span>labor.</span>  Joseph Stalin, learning that in Germany they conduct certain <span>experiments on people</span> and animals, decided not to hesitate either.  Under his leadership, numerous experiments were carried out on people.  Crossbreeding with animals was supposed to help create incredibly hardy, and at the same time quite obedient monkey people.  In addition, according to scientists, such a creature was supposed to reach full maturity in just 4 years.  Stalin planned that the new workforce could not only mine coal, build railways, but also fight if necessary. </p><h2>  First attempts </h2><p>  The first experiments of the French scientist Sergei Voronov were aimed at rejuvenating people.  While studying in Egypt, he drew attention to the eunuchs.  They looked much older than the rest of the men.  At this point, the scientist thought about the effect of the sex glands on the state of the body.  In 1910, Voronov was the first to successfully transplant a chimpanzee testicle to an elderly English aristocrat.  Local newspapers wrote that the effect of xenotransplantation was not long in coming, and after some time the Englishman looked several years younger.  In this case, the question arises: why is this method of rejuvenation not used in modern transplantology?  Obviously, this was actually <span>a placebo effect.</span> </p><h2>  Secret experiments of Professor Ivanov in Guinea </h2><p>  Almost at the same time, the Kremlin also began to wonder whether it is really possible to interbreed humans and animals.  All scientific activity in this area was entrusted to two biologists - Ilya Ivanov and Vladimir Rozanov.  At that time, they were already successfully engaged in artificial <span>insemination of animals.</span>  Vladimir Rozanov, like his French counterpart Voronov, carried out operations on transplantation of the genital glands of chimpanzees.  The difficulty was that the demand for transplantation was so huge that the scientist lacked monkeys. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  In 1926, Dr. Ivanov and his son went on an expedition to Guinea.  They needed to catch females and males of chimpanzees for experiments.  In addition, they were faced with the task of persuading at least a few <span>African women</span> to take part in the experiment.  Ivanov wanted to try to impregnate the woman with chimpanzee sperm, and the chimpanzee female with human seed.  However, it was impossible to find a resident of Guinea who agreed to such experiments, even for a lot of money.  Then the scientist, along with the Kremlin, decided to do it secretly.  Under the guise of inspection, several African women introduced chimpanzee sperm.  How this crossing of animals and humans ended is unknown.  Soon, the learned Ivanov left Africa and went to conduct experiments in the Abkhazian town of Sukhumi. </p><h2>  Sukhumi Monkey Reserve </h2><p>  In 1927, in Abkhazia, in the small and little-known town of Sukhum at that time, in order to crossbreed animals and humans, a monkey reserve was created. </p>

    <p>  From Guinea, Ivanov brought the first chimpanzees and gorillas, among whom were two large and healthy females.  The professor tried to impregnate them with human sperm.  After some time, the female monkeys died.  At autopsy, it turned out that conception never happened.  At that time, Ivanov did not yet understand why the experiments were not obtained.  Modern genetic scientists explain this quite simply. </p><h2>  Does a chimpanzee <span>person look like</span> </h2><p>  It turns out that despite the fact that humans and monkeys have a lot of similarities, there are also significant differences.  A man has 23 pairs of chromosomes, which in total gives 46. A chimpanzee has 24 pairs, that is, 48 ‚Äã‚Äãchromosomes.  If such individuals produce a descendant, then he will have an odd number of chromosomes - 47. Such an individual will not be able to give offspring, since the set of chromosomes will be 46 + 1 - one chromosome will be without a pair. </p>

    <p>  An example of such a barren animal is the mule.  It is known that his parents are a donkey (having 31 pairs of chromosomes) and a horse (32 pairs of chromosomes).  In science, the generation of offspring from parents who belong to different species is called interspecific crossbreeding.  Humans and animals can only be crossed if they have the same DNA, similar karyotype and anatomical features. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, it turns out that the crossing of animals and humans under normal conditions is impossible due to significant differences in their karyotypes.  It is proved that 18 pairs of chromosomes of humans and monkeys are almost identical, but the rest have a lot of differences.  Sex chromosomes, which are responsible for the future sex of the offspring, also differ significantly. </p><h2>  The impossible yesterday became possible today </h2><p>  The experiments on the crossing of humans and animals probably did not stop and never will stop.  <span>Genetic engineering</span> scientists have found that Professor Ivanov was right in some way.  <span>The crossing of man and animal</span> can really bring great benefits to mankind.  However, this is not about mutants and snowmen at all.  Here we are talking about stem cells that can be obtained from hybrid embryos. </p>

    <p>  Modern medicine really needs stem cells, because with their help you can cure many diseases.  The stem cell is able to self-renew and divide, while creating any cells of all organs and tissues.  Moreover, experiments in genetic engineering prove that stem cells in the body are responsible for youth and longevity.  By the age of such cells in the human body becomes much smaller, tissues lose their ability to self-renew, organs work much weaker. </p><h2>  Secrets and mysticism of experiences </h2><p>  Despite the huge amount of evidence, there were no less secrets in this field of research.  For example, after Ivanov‚Äôs death, all documents and materials on crossbreeding were hidden and strictly classified.  The question arises: if the experiments did not bring any positive result, why did the Kremlin classify all materials?  Crossbreeding animals and humans has always been a mystery.  There is evidence that during the experiments in Abkhazia many women participated.  They were fertilized voluntarily with chimpanzee sperm.  But to find such a woman and ask her about the course of the experiments was impossible.  What happened to all those people who participated in the experiments, and where did they go? </p><p>  At the moment, in many countries experiments on crossing animals and humans are prohibited.  However, does this mean that they are not being held?  Who knows, maybe in the next century, science will still see the chimera? </p>
