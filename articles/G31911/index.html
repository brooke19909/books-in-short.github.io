The city is the cultural and business center of the republic and ranks 31st in the list of the largest cities in Europe in terms of population.  The history of the village is rooted in ancient times.  However, the oldest building that has been preserved on the territory of the city is a residential building, built in 1774. </p><p>  Only in 1803, William Goeste, a Scottish architect serving in Russia, drew up a master plan for the development of the city.  However, it was not immediately realized, and only in 1819 after a number of amendments was made, the plan was approved, and the direction of the city's construction was determined.  The territory of the borders of the settlement was increased. </p><p>  Today Ufa is a large city with a population of more than 1 million.  On the territory of the settlement there are many monuments, parks, entertainment venues, including the Ufa circus. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  For the first time, the temporary circus building opened its doors to visitors in 1906.  It was located in those years in the Gostiny Dvor area.  Later, for the money of the merchant D. Klyauznikov, the capital structure of the circus was erected at the address: Uspenskaya street, 67. </p><p>  The modern Ufa circus opened its doors in 1968 already on October Avenue.  Unlike the previous circus, the modern one has a huge arena and can simultaneously accommodate 2 thousand visitors.  The building is equipped with make-up rooms, rooms for keeping animals, domestic premises for artists. </p>

    <h2>  Interesting Facts </h2><p>  In pre-revolutionary times, local authorities were against the construction of the circus and hardly allowed mobile troupes to enter the city.  And when, nevertheless, the decision to erect the building was approved (in 1906), the Duma gave a clear order: ‚ÄúThere shouldn't be any athletes fighting in the circus,‚Äù although such performances attracted the most visitors. </p><p>  The building of the first capital structure of the Ufa circus has survived to this day and is located on Kommunisticheskaya street, 67. The old circus worked until the Civil War, in 1930 a factory school was located here.  In the mid-60s, the building was transferred to accommodate the branch of the correspondence department of the financial and economic institute.  Later, students of the Institute of Physical Culture began to study in the building.  By the way, this is happening to this day. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Under the project of the Ufa State Circus, circuses were erected for 7 years in many cities: in Donetsk, Krivoy Rog, Kharkov, Bryansk, Novosibirsk, Voronezh, Perm, Lugansk and Samara. </p><p>  The circus building was once closed for repairs, which lasted from 1993 to 1994.  On the eve of the opening, a visor collapsed at the building.  Then no one was hurt, but there was a lot of noise around this event and the official opening after the repair was postponed. </p>

    <h2>  Circus today </h2><p>  Every year, a metropolitan Christmas tree is held in the circus, which attracts artists from the republic and Russia.  Troupes come from other cities and countries. </p><p>  Since March 11 this year in the Ufa circus the program ‚ÄúSailing - the world of white tigers‚Äù has attracted many visitors.  The show was like an exciting but dangerous journey into the world of wildlife.  The program also featured other animals, a variety of tricks and illusion numbers. </p><p>  In June 2017, the new program ‚ÄúLasta Rica‚Äù was presented at the Ufa Circus.  The performance was prepared by the <span>Perm Circus</span> under the direction of Maykhrovskaya E. Throughout the performance, the clown May entertained the audience.  Seals and penguins, monkeys, horses, royal poodles and geese also performed in the arena. </p><p>  Prices in the Ufa circus have always been affordable, from 500 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  Last news </h2><p>  To date, the circus doors are closed.  The establishment is under threat of closure for more than one month.  The reason for this decision is that the building does not comply with fire safety standards.  In addition, the entire building and the roof of the structure are in disrepair.  Supporting structures may collapse at any time.  The roof leaked, and water fell into the switchboard.  The building does not even have a fire warning system for visitors. </p><p>  After lengthy checks and trials, the Supreme Court of Bashkortostan approved the decision of the district court to close the circus. </p><p>  Since the commissioning of the building (1968), there has never been a major overhaul.  As a result of the meeting in the Russian State Circus, it was decided to allocate funds for the repair of the building, but they will arrive only in 2018.  The fate of the employees and members of the troupe is unknown, perhaps they were sent on vacation. </p>
