We prepared for the event very responsibly.  In addition to sports complexes, they built a lot of other objects.  Among them was the hotel district - ‚ÄúVelvet Seasons‚Äù.  One of its parts is the Alexander Garden.  Sochi today can be called a real tourist destination. </p><h2>  Separate town </h2><p>  The service sector in the domestic market has become noticeably better.  Now, in order to spend time comfortably in a foreign land, you can not carry a navigator and a map.  Everything you need when traveling in an unfamiliar area is located nearby.  The hotel town ‚ÄúVelvet Seasons‚Äù took care of this.  The facility was built specifically for the Olympic Games.  The complex is located near the park, which allows guests to quickly and conveniently get to the main attractions of the region.  Twelve kilometers is the distance from the hotel to Sochi Airport.  "Alexander Garden" (hotel) is also included in the tourist town. </p>

    <p>  Great location attracts many guests.  Just a few hundred meters away is the train station.  From there it is easy to get to the urban village of Krasnaya Polyana.  This is a resort point where they enjoy skiing.  They also get acquainted with local attractions. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Event center </h2><p>  Near the hotel there is a park "Southern Culture".  Here are interesting and atypical flora samples for our area.  The reserve is like a labyrinth of paths along the side of which exotic plants grow. </p><p>  Ten minutes is the time it takes to overcome the distance between the park and the Alexander Garden Hotel.  Sochi is proud of this natural greenhouse.  It will be interesting not only to biologists, but simply to people who admire the beauty of nature.  Fragile Japanese sakura, tall Chinese palm trees grow in the reserve.  You can relax under the branches of three hundred year old oaks. </p>

    <p>  Another place that attracts tourists is Skypark AJ Hackett Sochi.  The entertainment complex is located on top.  True extreme supporters have fun here.  Jumping into the abyss, <span>free fall</span> and flying through the gorge - a challenge for thrill-seekers. </p><p>  Close to all these points is the hotel "Alexander Garden".  Sochi is a big city, but the complex stands at the intersection of the main tourist routes.  This place is practically the epicenter of the main events of the region. </p><h2>  Name history </h2><p>  When the object was just beginning to be built, each of its sections received its own name, which was somehow connected with the sights of Russia.  One of the buildings was named after the park in Moscow, which is located under the walls of the Kremlin.  Capital <span>Alexander Garden</span> begins its history since 1812.  It spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 hectares.  Today it is a place for walks and meetings.  It is always calm and beautiful there.  The same positive atmosphere prevails in the hotel. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Another advantage of the structure is the sea nearby.  About 600 m is the distance from the coast to the Alexander Garden Hotel.  Sochi is famous for its beaches.  It should be noted that the hotel management took care of the comfort of the guests, so the complex has its own coast.  You can rent rollers, bicycles and scooters there.  It should be noted that the coast is clean, and the water temperature in August rises to 25 degrees. </p><p>  Embankments are lit by beautiful lanterns.  Along the road there are shops where you can calmly sit and enjoy the view of the Black Sea. </p><h2>  City in the city </h2><p>  First, the object was erected for the guests of the resort town.  Journalists, athletes and politicians received the "Alexander Garden" (Sochi).  Successful people left reviews, and they are well versed in the quality of such services.  Impressions were usually positive. </p><p>  Now the hotel accepts simple vacationers.  Organize business meetings and working conferences in the building.  They book rooms both for the weekend and for a long time.  There is everything that a capricious tourist will need. </p>
