But not so long ago there was an opportunity to even swim in a hot spring in Shadrinsk, created on the basis of well No. 315. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ural-n.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Mineral water Shadrinsk" class="if uuid-2256010" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2256010.jpg"></div><h2>  Unique water </h2><p>  About 30 wells with mineral water were drilled at the Shadrinskoye field, some of them are being operated.  And these sources are located over 60 square kilometers.  But the most interesting thing is that the composition of the water in each source is unique and inimitable.  And this means that each water has its own individual composition, a set of micro and macro elements, and taste.  And all the water in the mineral wells of the Kurgan region is similar in composition to the waters of Borjomi and Essentuki. </p><h2>  Shadrinskaya No. 315 and how it all began </h2><p>  Initially, the Shadrinsk hot spring was used exclusively for the extraction of drinking water.  It belongs to the canteen and has the XII group.  The depth of the well is 285 meters, and the temperature is +40 degrees.  It is displayed on the surface of the earth by self-effusion.  Mineralization from 8.7 to 9.6 g / l. </p><p>  However, it turned out that well No. 315 gives water abundantly, and it was decided to approach the issue comprehensively - to organize here water treatment procedures for everyone.  The first visitors could not say that everything was comfortable - there was only a pipe with beating water and a barrel in which they bathed. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="ural-n.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This is a building complex" class="if uuid-2256013" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2256013.jpg"></div><h2>  Comfort and wellness </h2><p>  Over time, with the support of local authorities, a swimming pool appeared near the hot spring in Shadrinsk, where you can swim all year round.  The bowl is in the open air, because the temperature of the water in it is always stable, at a level of plus 38-39 degrees. </p><p>  The healing effect is achieved not only due to the presence of minerals of natural origin, but also due to the presence of metasilicon and carbon dioxide in the water, which allow useful minerals to penetrate the human body. </p><p>  Today, the hot springs of Shadrinsk (Verkhnyaya Polevaya) are a landscaped area, a hotel, baths, rest rooms and warm dressing rooms, a cafeteria. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vita-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dressing room for guests" class="if uuid-2256016" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2256016.jpg"></div><h2>  Indications and contraindications for visiting the source </h2><p>  Naturally, like any other procedure, a preliminary consultation with a doctor is required, this also applies to the Shadrinsk source. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Indications </p></td><td><p>  Contraindications </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Problems with the nervous system, osteochondrosis and sciatica </p></td><td><p>  Thromboembolic disease, epilepsy and diabetes </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Arthrosis and other pathologies of the musculoskeletal system </p></td><td><p>  Colds and inflammatory processes in the acute stage </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Gastrointestinal diseases </p></td><td><p>  Fungal diseases </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Bile duct and liver problems </p></td><td><p>  Pathology of the kidneys and gallstone disease </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Respiratory problems </p></td><td><p>  Chronic diseases of the respiratory system during an exacerbation </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Gynecological diseases </p></td><td><p>  Abortion and bleeding, the period after the birth of the child, skin and sexually transmitted diseases. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  Cardiovascular problems (also as preventative measures) </p></td><td><p>  Coronary artery disease, hypertension </p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Infrastructure and additional services </h2><p>  Shadrinsk Hot Spring is an open-air pool bowl.  The pool is 12 meters long and the depth is shallow, only 1.1 meters, in some places it reaches 1.5 meters.  For lovers of night swimming night illumination is provided.  Do not be afraid of salt deposits at the bottom of the pool, they have a therapeutic effect, especially in the presence of pathologies of the musculoskeletal system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vita-travel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="This is a rest room" class="if uuid-2256027" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44541/2256027.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the wellness center allows you to enjoy air massage and hydromassage.
