    <p>  A device that controls the flow of fluid into the radiator is a valve or valve, which can be automatic or manual. </p><p>  Indoors, there is always heat exchange with the surrounding space.  This leads to the outflow or influx of heat from the room, and, consequently, to a decrease or increase in air temperature in it. </p><p>  To restore the heat balance in the room, it is necessary to increase or decrease the amount of heat coming from heating devices.  The temperature regulator on the battery installed on the supply pipelines will perfectly cope with this task. </p><h2>  Mechanical temperature controller </h2><p>  This device consists of a valve and a sensing element (thermal head).  They function smoothly without extraneous external energy.  The thermal head is equipped with a drive, a regulator and a fluid element, which can be replaced by an elastic or gas one. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="heating temperature controller" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26665/1081759.jpg" width="458"></div>

    <p>  In the heating system, it automatically controls the boiler and other actuators (valves, pumps, mixers, etc.).  The main goal of the electronic temperature controller is to create a temperature regime in the room, which was previously determined by the user. </p><h2>  Principle of operation </h2><p>  The electronic temperature heating temperature controller is equipped with a temperature sensor, which is installed in a place free from direct exposure to heating appliances, it provides the device with information about the thermal condition of the room.  Based on the received data, the electronic device controls the elements of the heating system. </p><p>  Distinguish between digital and analog thermal relays with temperature control.  The former are most widespread due to their functionality.  Thermostats of electronic type are: </p><ul><li>  With closed logic. </li><li>  With open logic. </li></ul><p>  Closed logic is a constant algorithm of work in time and a rigid internal structure, independent of changes in environmental factors.  Only certain programmable parameters can be changed. </p><p>  An open logic temperature controller is a freely programmable device characterized by a wide range of functions and settings; it can be configured for any operation and environmental conditions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="temperature-controlled electric batteries" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26665/1081765.jpg" width="450"></div>

    <p>  Unlike devices with closed logic, these devices are not so widespread.  It is justified by the fact that their management requires a certain qualification degree.  Therefore, far from every ordinary citizen can understand the modes and settings of electronic temperature controllers.  Open logic has been widely used in the industrial segment, but over time it can become an integral element in the life of any person. </p><h2>  Installing the thermostat on the battery </h2><p>  During the installation process, it is very important to follow the instructions and do not place devices of this type in niches, behind decorative grilles and curtains.  If for some reason this is not possible, a remote sensor is installed. </p><p>  It is inefficient to install a thermostat for cast iron batteries, since they heat up and cool down for a very long time. </p><p>  Before proceeding with the installation of temperature controllers, it is necessary to disconnect the riser and drain the coolant from the heating system. </p><p>  Only after that it is possible to proceed to the installation of this device, it is recommended that they be performed in the following sequence: </p><ul><li>  Horizontal piping is cut off at a certain distance from the heater. </li><li>  The cut off piping and shut-off device are disconnected. </li><li>  The nuts and shanks are disconnected together with the nuts of the valve or valve. </li><li>  Shanks are wrapped in radiator plugs. </li><li>  Piping is installed at the chosen place. </li><li>  The harness is connected to horizontal pipelines. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how does the thermostat on the battery work" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26665/1081764.jpg" width="431"></div></li></ul><h2>  Customization </h2><p>  Setting the thermal relay with temperature control is as follows: </p><ul><li>  All windows and doors are tightly closed in the room to minimize heat leakage. </li><li>  In a room where a certain temperature value is required, it is necessary to install a <span>room thermometer.</span> </li><li>  The valve opens completely, for which the thermostat head rotates all the way to the left, in which case the radiator will operate with maximum heat dissipation, the temperature will begin to rise in the room. </li><li>  As soon as the temperature becomes 5-6 ¬∞ C higher than the initial one, you need to close the valve, for this its head turns fully to the right, after which the air will gradually cool in the room. </li><li>  After the temperature reaches the desired value, the valve slowly opens by rotating the regulator head to the left.  In this case, you must carefully listen as soon as you hear the sound of water and feel a sharp heating of the thermostat housing, stop the rotation of the head and remember its position. </li><li>  Setup is complete.  The room temperature will be kept accurate to 1 ¬∞ C. </li></ul><h2>  Thermostats on electric radiators </h2><p>  In the conditions of the modern work of utilities, when in the cold season in apartments far from always the temperature is necessary for a comfortable feeling, many switch to electric heating appliances.  They can perform both the function of an additional and the main heat source. </p><p>  As a rule, today many manufacturers produce <span>electric batteries</span> with a temperature controller, which allows you to set an individual temperature in each room.  Electric radiators are a convenient alternative and a great addition to central heating. </p>
