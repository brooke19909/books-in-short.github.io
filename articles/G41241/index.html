The fabulous Zanzibar, famous for its beach holidays, delights with its amazing nature and unique attractions. </p><h2>  A bit of history </h2><p>  A distant island located in the Indian Ocean in the X century was captured by the Persians, who forced the indigenous population, considered cannibals, to convert to Islam.  And to this day, many residents adhere to Muslim traditions.  In the Middle Ages, the hunt for Aborigines begins: they are forcibly sent to work in Asia.  Later, the Portuguese captured the archipelago, and in 1853, Said ibn Sultan moved his residence here and made the city of Zanzibar, the sights of which awe foreign visitors, the capital of the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>  The island, which is living off the slave trade and ivory mining, is on the rise, majestic architectural monuments are being built to make its appearance unique.  In 1913, the British, who took possession of the territory, banned the slave trade. </p><p>  After the uprisings and bloody wars in 1964, the archipelago gains independence and unites with Tanganyika in Tanzania. </p><h2>  A true paradise adventure </h2><p>  Europeans traveling on exciting tours to Zanzibar should know that there is no international airport on the island.  The area, located 35 km from the African coast, can be reached in 15 minutes by small plane or ferry. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Traveling to exotic places is an expensive pleasure.  Tours to Zanzibar that have become popular, which will turn the minds of vacationers, will help to get acquainted with the colorful archipelago and its features.  You will appreciate the picturesque nature, ancient monuments and enjoy all the opportunities for recreation. </p><h2>  Stone city </h2><p>  The capital of paradise, which will not leave anyone indifferent, is Stone Town - the oldest city protected by UNESCO.  Unlike other villages, all houses here were built only of coral stone.  Since no one had any development plan, and the owners of the dwellings set them up as it was convenient only for them, the capital began to resemble the labyrinths of winding streets, which tourists are now happily wandering around. </p>

    <p>  The large shopping center, which is the heart of the island, also has another name - Zanzibar.  Sights of the Stone Town are of great interest to vacationers.  The capital of not only the islands, but also the slave market, stores several chambers in which unfortunate slaves were kept. </p><p>  In a small English cathedral in honor of the great <span>explorer of Africa</span> D. Livingston, a wooden crucifix is ​​installed under which his heart is buried. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Unique metropolitan architecture </h2><p>  All tourists dream of walking along the narrow streets, looking at the Arabic-style dwellings and beautiful mosques.  The historical part of the village is intended only for pedestrians, since not a single car can drive between 150-year-old houses.  Their carved gates, graceful loggias, openwork verandas give resemblance to palaces.  The unusual architecture of the city was influenced not only by Indian and Arab cultures, but also European.  In addition, there are religious attractions of Zanzibar - mosques, Catholic and Hindu temples. </p><p>  Unfortunately, some buildings are in poor condition, others are destroyed by time, and once they were captivating with luxury and sophistication.  Amazing by a mixture of architectural and cultural traditions, the bustling city, which has retained its originality, is filled with aromas of exotic spices coming from the bazaar. </p><h2>  Popular Attractions </h2><p>  The fortification, which was built on the site of the Portuguese fortification, is a favorite place for tourists. </p>

    <p>  The world-famous Palace of Miracles, which appeared in 1883, is not in vain carries such a name.  The unique complex, which became the residence of the Sultans, for that time was a real curiosity: the first elevator on the island worked here, the lamps were on, water was laid.  Now in the palace there is a museum, the exhibits of which tell about the rich history of Zanzibar. </p><h2>  What to see more? </h2><p>  The former capital of the island, the tiny village of Kizimkazi, is located in the east of the archipelago, on the shores of the picturesque bay of the same name, you can get here by taxi.

    <p>  Here is an old mosque with richly decorated columns, as well as the ruins of the palace of the Persian ruler.  But not only historical monuments attract the attention of tourists.  Dolphins splashing in the bay, accustomed to people and swimming with them for a long time. </p><p>  The white sand beach of the village is considered one of the best in Zanzibar, and many foreigners even compare it with places of rest in the Maldives or the Seychelles. </p><h2>  Turtle Island </h2><p>  Not far from the capital is the island of Prizon - the former slave market owned by the Arabs.  Officially called Chang, it is a tiny piece of land in the ocean, which can only be reached by water.  The British, who bought it, built a prison, but not a single prisoner appeared during this time, and the building was converted into a hospital to prevent terrible infections from appearing on the archipelago.  Since the 20s of the last century, the island received another name - Quarantine.  Soon, all the buildings turned into hotels, and Europeans began to come to rest. </p>
