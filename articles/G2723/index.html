    <h2>  Reviews: Kleopatra Ada Hotel 4 * (Alanya, Turkey) </h2><p>  Since today it is very important for many people choosing a hotel in one country or another in the world to get the opinion of tourists who have already been here, we have summarized the reviews of our compatriots staying at Cleopatra Ada 4 *.  In general, we can say that the hotel complex is consistent with the declared "star rating" and the cost of living.  However, according to most vacationers, it is more suitable for unpretentious tourists and those who came to Turkey for the first time.  And now, in order. </p><p>  As for the rooms, here our compatriots did not have any complaints.  All rooms, although small, are comfortable and well-furnished.  No one complained about the breakdown of air conditioners, refrigerators or plumbing.  The vast majority of guests were satisfied with the quality and regularity of cleaning the rooms, regardless of whether they left a tip to the maid or not.  The only thing is that for the extra dollar you have more chances to return to the room to find on your bed a funny figurine of towels. </p><p>  If we talk about food in the Kleopatra Ada Hotel 4 *, here the opinions of tourists differ.  However, in fairness it should be noted that a similar picture is often observed in the best five-star hotels of the Republic of Turkey.  So, as for the Cleopatra Ada hotel complex, many travelers have found the menu here is quite diverse, and the food is delicious.  Our other compatriots didn‚Äôt particularly like the dishes offered to them in restaurants.  Some claim that they even had to go to dinner at nearby cafes, where they cooked much better than in a hotel.  Be that as it may, many tourists noted the fact that the hotel manager, along with several administrators, had breakfast and lunch almost every day in the main restaurant, Cleopatra Ada.  This suggests that the staff carefully monitors the quality of food offered to guests. </p><p>  As for the beach, the hotel guests did not really like the fact that sunbeds and umbrellas are paid here.  So, for two sun loungers and a parasol a day you will have to pay about $ 6.  When checking into a hotel, you can immediately redeem the right to use a similar beach set for the entire period of residence.  Our compatriots found the beach itself very good.  So, it is completely sandy with a gentle and comfortable entry into the water.  Also, many appreciated the fact that to go to the beach just five minutes on the strength. </p><p>  Most of the hotel guests were satisfied with the staff.  However, some of our compatriots were a little puzzled by the fact that the majority of Cleopatra Ada employees do not understand Russian.  But all the staff is fluent in English, so it is quite possible to communicate with them.  In general, most of the guests of the hotel complex are Europeans - Germans, Swedes, etc. There are not so many Russian tourists here as in other hotels in Alanya. </p>
