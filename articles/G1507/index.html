It is very fast and convenient. </p><h2>  Bridge Resort Hotel (Adler): reviews </h2><p>  When choosing a place to stay, we are guided primarily by the reviews of other vacationers who have already managed to visit a particular place.  After all, it is not always possible to gather true information on hotel sites.  No hotel will tell the truth about its shortcomings.  Therefore, in order not to receive a lot of disappointments upon arrival, it still makes sense to get acquainted with the reviews of people.  However, always remember that each of them is subjective. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel bridge adler description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1348781.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It should be noted that vacationers speak very well about the complex.  As a rule, everyone is very satisfied.  People even note a rather high service that the Bridge Hotel (Adler) can boast of.  The advice of tourists who have repeatedly rested here may be useful to beginners.  So, vacationers recommend that when you make an online reservation, just before the trip, ask them to confirm the availability of the rooms.  Unfortunately, with all the advantages of service, incidents also happen.  For example, relatives book two rooms next to each other.  And when you settle, it turns out that the rooms are on different floors, which is not very convenient. </p><p>  All vacationers are very pleased with the food, noting a good menu and excellent cooking.  However, some people advise you to arrive early for lunch when ordering a buffet, because then you can not find a good dish. </p><p>  The entire staff is very friendly.  Vacationers note a good quality cleaning every day. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel bridge adler tourist tips" class="if" height="333" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1348789.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <p>  The guests are pleased with the close location of the beach, which is important for a seaside resort, especially since there are a lot of kids among vacationers.  The beach is sandy and pebble.  Umbrellas and sunbeds are free, but sometimes they are not enough for everyone.  Some complain that outsiders, who are not related to the hotel complex, are freely allowed in to the beach.  There is also no toilet in the coastal zone, however hotel managers assure that work is already underway on its installation. </p><p>  In general, the proximity to the sea completely compensates for all the minor flaws. </p><p>  As for children's animation, vacationers are quite happy, although they note that the playground and children's room are not enough for such a large and populated hotel. </p><p>  Do not be bored here and adults.  Every evening, especially in the summer, the staff arranges entertainment programs for vacationers.  The convenient location of the hotel allows you to visit entertainment venues and restaurants outside the complex, there are many near the hotel.  Although many tourists simply do not have time to go beyond the borders of the hotel, the life of vacationers is so rich here. </p><p>  Experienced tourists are advised to pre-arrange with the administration rest with animals.  In principle, the hotel is prohibited from settling with them.  However, there are several rooms for pets.  Therefore, with prior agreement, this issue can be resolved. </p><p>  A good level of service and room decor are noted even by those who are used to relaxing in foreign resorts.  It is encouraging that domestic seaside resorts have reached a certain level.  In general, the Bridge Hotel is in full compliance with its four-star level. </p><p>  Separately, I want to note the modern base that the Bridge Resort Hotel (Adler) has.  The staff reviews once again confirm the fact that the administration of the complex is trying to keep the interests of vacationers.  Of course, there are some minor flaws, judging by the reviews of tourists, but I want to believe that the management will soon take care of eliminating them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel bridge resort adler reviews" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1348795.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  In favor of the complex is the fact that there are a lot of vacationers here, and you need to book a room long before the trip, there are also regular customers who have been visiting this particular hotel for several years. </p><h2>  Excursions </h2><p>  The hotel is open all year.  If in summer the interests of people are directed towards the sea coast and everything connected with this, then the rest of the time vacationers can take various sorts of excursions that will help you pick up at the local tour desk.  Not to mention that you can just take a walk and see the local attractions.  <span>Olympic Park is</span> worthy of special praise <span>,</span> which is recommended for all vacationers to visit.  Those who are accustomed to comfort can take bike rides or travel by car by renting equipment at the hotel.  Such a service is provided here. </p><p>  For children and their parents, a visit to the Mayak water park will remain unforgettable.  All the nuances of family vacations are taken into account here, you will be satisfied with visiting water attractions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bridge hotel adler photo" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/1348806.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  One of <span>Adler</span> ‚Äôs main <span>attractions</span> is the Southern Cultures dendrological park.  It operates year round.  The park is interesting in that almost all the plants of the world growing in the subtropical zone are collected on its territory. </p><p>  It makes sense to visit the Aquarium and the Iceberg Winter Sports Palace. </p><p>  From November to the end of April, Adler for vacationers does not become a sea resort, but rather a ski resort.  At the hotel you can rent all the necessary equipment and go skiing.  The hotel organizes such trips.  For those who are just taking their first steps and do not really know how to ride, there are professional instructors who will teach the basics of this sport. </p><p>  In the warmer months, tourists can please themselves not only with mountain walks, but also with jipping.  For horse lovers there are horse clubs. </p><p>  Before the Olympics, Sochi and Adler underwent significant restructuring and improvement.  Currently, these are beautiful resort towns, which really have something to see.  And the Bridge Resort hotel has a good quality-price ratio. </p><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><p>  Based on the reviews of vacationers, we can conclude that the Bridge Hotel in Adler is at a decent level, in which democratic prices are harmoniously combined with good service and food.  Therefore, it makes sense to consider it as an option when preparing for a vacation.  Couples with children will especially like it, because there is everything you need for a good family vacation. </p>
