    <h2>  Screen </h2><p>  The first thing you should pay attention to is nothing more than a smartphone display.  The HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim has average specs.  In any case, many owners were satisfied.  The diagonal is 5 inches - this is normal for a gaming and working device.  But the resolution is a bit small - 960 by 540 pixels.  Movies in high quality will be quite difficult to watch. </p><p>  But the screen of HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim is touch and capacitive.  It is protected by a special glass, which does not allow the smartphone to quickly scratch and damage.  Working with such a phone is a pleasure.  Especially when you consider the fact that even in sunny and clear weather the image on the display will be clear and bright. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Dimensions </h2><p>  Smartphone HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim reviews and receives for such indicators as its size.  It‚Äôs not enough to know what diagonal is on the screen.  The dimensions of the device itself are also extremely important.  Especially when you consider that many people prefer to wear the phone in jeans and pockets.  Some devices are not subject to such storage. </p><p>  Fortunately, the HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim is quite suitable for this.  After all, his dimensions are not so big by modern standards.  Height is 145.5 millimeters, width - 72. But this device cannot be called thin in any way.  The phone is 10.3 millimeters thick.  Bigger for a modern smartphone.  But this is better than an ultra-thin, but huge option. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 700 dual sim feature" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979781.jpg"></div>

    <p>  It‚Äôs convenient to carry the HPC in your pocket or purse.  The HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim weighs quite a lot - 150 grams.  This means that you can always feel the device in your pocket.  And you won‚Äôt need to think whether you took the phone with you or not.  In the hand, this model is very good.  It is convenient to handle with both children and adults.  And all this despite the size and weight. </p><h2>  System and processor </h2><p>  The HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim specifications are at a fairly high level.  And the most important points for any phone is the device‚Äôs operating system and its processor.  They are responsible in most cases for the versatility of the smartphone.  Of course, the launched content also depends on it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In our case, we can say that everything is on top here.  The processor has 4 cores, each of 1.2 GHz clock frequency.  Quite a high rate for a modern phone.  The operating system of HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim is familiar and familiar to everyone and everyone - ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù.  True, the version is not entirely new - 4.2.  But if necessary and desired, it can be easily updated to 4.4.  Newer versions are not recommended.  This will avoid problems with the operability of the device, as well as contribute to the ability to run many games and applications.  Often this is exactly what all customers need. </p><h2>  RAM </h2><p>  There is such an important feature in HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim, as RAM.  Without it, now you can not imagine a single gadget.  RAM along with the system and processor is responsible for the operability of the phone.  And the more, the better.  But do not forget about the harmony of all characteristics.  After all, even a lot of RAM will not give any sense if the rest of the components are weak.  And vice versa. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 700 dual sim reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979780.jpg"></div>

    <p>  HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim reviews are not the best ones for RAM.  After all, many believe that it is not enough.  We will be offered only 1 GB of RAM.  For a gaming smartphone is not enough.  But, based on practical data and research, this is enough to comfortably and quickly work with the phone.  And even launch quite new and powerful games and applications.  In principle, RAM is more than enough for a budget phone.  Do not expect anything special from this device.  Speed, quality of work and versatility - these are the things that glorify this model. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Capacity </h2><p>  HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim, a review of which is presented to our attention, can not be imagined without free space.  Something that allows you to record personal data, as well as install programs on the device.  In this situation, as in most cases, it is customary to assume that the larger the space indicator, the better.  And in practice the way it is. </p><p>  But at HCH this indicator is not so high.  Upon purchase, we will receive only 8 GB of space.  And then, of these, 1 GB will "go" to the operating system.  The result is 7 gigabytes for personal data.  Given the ‚Äúweight‚Äù of current documents and files, this space is simply negligible.  And this fact upsets many.  Sometimes, because of him, you have to refuse to buy in general.  But do not despair.  After all, our model provides for the expansion of free space on the device. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="smartphone HTC Desire 700 dual sim" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979779.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Memory card </h2><p>  It's about installing and using a device such as a memory card.  You can connect it, unfortunately, not on all smartphones.  But the HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim phone does.  If there is a shortage of space, just insert a microSD card into a special slot.  At the moment, this is the most common and successful option.  The maximum allowable amount for adding is 64 GB.  If you wish, you can try to connect 128 GB, but, according to many owners, various kinds of malfunctions and malfunctions will begin to happen more and more often with the phone. </p><p>  Getting rid of this behavior is sometimes very difficult.  And for this reason, experts advise not to fill the memory card completely with data.  Even if it is 64 GB.  Leave free about 1-2 gigabytes of space.  This will prevent the system from getting out of control constantly.  So, no harm to the device‚Äôs performance will be done. </p><h2>  Camera </h2><p>  Another important feature for a modern phone is nothing more than a camera.  After all, it is always convenient when this "technique" is at hand.  Moreover, it is also a telephone in combination.  Buyers are paying great attention to this moment. </p><p>  The thing is that HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim has more than one camera.  The first is called rear.  Located on the back of the device.  And shoots with 8 megapixel quality.  This is pretty much for a budget phone.  This fact pleases buyers.  And the second is frontal.  But its quality is not happy - only 2 megapixels.  In principle, taking a selfie or video call now is not a problem.  And good quality on the ‚Äúfront‚Äù camera is not necessary at all.  Indeed, for photos and videos, the rear option is used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 700 dual sim specifications" class="if" height="288" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979860.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Incidentally, there is autofocus and flash.  Also there is <span>a face recognition system</span> and smiles.  All this will make your pictures clear, bright and simply magnificent.  With HSBC, you can shoot videos in Full HD.  But just to begin, solve the problem with a shortage of space on the phone.  This video takes up too much space.  But, nevertheless, the quality of the camera necessarily parades everyone and everyone. </p><h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim receives reviews for its battery.  It is important for many that the phone works for a long time.  And it‚Äôs not a secret to anyone that it‚Äôs the battery that is responsible for this feature.  But, unfortunately, there are few phones with a good battery.  And "HRC" refers to just such models. </p><p>  The battery capacity by modern standards is not very large - only 2100 mAh.  But, as practice shows, such a device works for a long time and efficiently.  For example, in standby mode, ‚Äúidle‚Äù - 2 months.  And with active use - 4 days.  In the case of an ongoing unified conversation, you can count on 17 hours of work. </p><p>  The phone charges quickly.  One and a half hours are enough for a full charge.  This is not so much as it might seem at first glance.  Thus, if you need a smartphone with a good battery, and even at an attractive price, then HPC is a great option.  Most importantly, do not expect anything special from this model.  Something that does not meet the characteristics. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 700 dual sim review" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979859.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Price tag and overall quality </h2><p>  Well, we already learned the main characteristics of the HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim.  As has been said repeatedly, we have before us a budget smartphone.  But how much does it cost?  What do customers generally think about quality? </p><p>  Such a phone will cost about 8,000 rubles.  Sometimes you can find options for 5-6 thousand.  With the hands of "HTC" is bought for 3-4 thousand rubles.  In principle, as many buyers note, the price for a new smartphone is not that high.  Yes, and so good. </p><p>  The quality of the device as a whole also pleases everyone.  When dropped, the phone does not crash.  After all, he is well protected.  The touchscreen is also on top.  True, once a year you need to do a screen calibration.  But this is not a problem for the modern buyer.  After all, the operating system has this setting.  So, HRC is a durable, reliable and high-quality model that will please you more than once. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  As you can see, with HTC Desire 700 Dual Sim, each characteristic is important.  But do not worry about them.  After all, the technical specifications are at their best.  Many people ask themselves whether it is worth paying attention to this model.  Everyone must decide this on their own.  And only for myself as a whole. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="htc desire 700 dual sim phone" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/979775.jpg"></div>
