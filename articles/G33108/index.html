    <h2>  Who is this device for? </h2><p>  Weak hardware stuffing refers this device to entry-level solutions.  But at the same time, against the background of analogues, he has one important feature - this is a curved screen.  It is for her that the potential owner of this device will have to overpay.  There are several color options for the design of the body of this gadget.  The most interesting of them is the LG Magna Titanium.  Reviews most often it is precisely such a performance that is allocated.  Therefore, this device is designed for those who want to get a stylish unusual device with a curved screen.  But at the same time, high performance is not needed to solve potential problems.  It is for such potential owners that this device was created. </p><h2>  What comes with a smartphone? </h2><p>  Familiar configuration boasts a smartphone LG Magna H502F.

    <h2>  Smartphone ergonomics </h2><p>  The curved touch display is the main feature that this device can boast of.  Its diagonal is 5 inches.  The lower part of the display is occupied by four control buttons.  In addition to the three standard buttons ("Home", "Back" and, of course, "Menu"), there is also a button that provides switching between SIM cards.  Even lower, on a strip of plastic, is the logo of the manufacturer.  In the upper part of the gadget there are: a speaker, touch elements and a small peephole of the front camera.  There is an audio port connector on the top rib, and a micro-USB on the bottom.  On the back cover there is a peephole of the main camera, its LED backlight, manufacturer‚Äôs logo, loud speaker, volume control and device lock buttons.  Although it is made of plastic, it looks like metal.  The most interesting in this regard is the smartphone LG Magna H502F Titan.  Reviews highlight this particular color scheme of this gadget. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  But what about the processor? </h2><p>  The time-tested central processor is used in <span>LG Magna.</span>  <span>Reviews</span> about MT6582 (namely, such a chip is used in this gadget) confirm this.  Its hallmark is a very high degree of reliability.  Smartphones based on it have been used for more than one year and characterize it only from the best side.  Another plus is excellent energy efficiency.  Unused computing power is disabled when idle, and modules that do not need a maximum level of performance automatically reduce their clock frequency to 300 MHz.  But the disadvantages include a low level of performance.  The composition of this semiconductor crystal includes four computing modules of the architecture "A7".  Each of them can accelerate when solving the most complex problems to 1.3 GHz.  The chip itself is manufactured using a 28-nm process.  The capabilities of this chip are enough to solve most everyday tasks.  An exception to it are the most demanding applications of the latest generation, which are based on 64-bit computing.  This CPU can only process 32 bits of information.  This is where problems arise with the launch of new software. </p>

    <h2>  Display and video accelerator </h2><p>  The curved touch screen is the highlight of the LG Magna smartphone.  Reviews indicate this feature.  Such a constructive solution in practice should facilitate the process of controlling this device.  But here the bend is very small (its radius is 3 mm).  That is, visually notice this feature of this device is not so simple.  The diagonal of the screen in this gadget is 5 inches.  Its resolution is 1280x720.  That is, the picture on the screen is displayed in 720 p.  The display matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmanufactured using the most progressive technology at the moment - ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù.  Allows you to significantly improve the color rendering of the device, and also improves the autonomy of the device.  Another feature of this screen is the complete absence of an air gap between the surface of the display matrix and the touch panel.  This further improves image quality.  But for the processing of graphic information in this device, the Mali-400MP2 graphic accelerator is used.  This is a time-tested solution that boasts reliability and energy efficiency.  But he has problems with performance.  When solving problems at the elementary and intermediate levels, no questions arise for him.  But with the most demanding software of the latest generation there will definitely be problems. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  A reasonably high-quality 8 megapixel main camera in the LG Magna H502F.  Reviews highlight the quality of the photos obtained with its help.  But it should be noted right away: to get really high-quality photos, you need a normal level of lighting.  Although there is a single LED backlight in this device, its capabilities are extremely limited.  Among other features of the main camera, it is necessary to note the presence of an autofocus system.  She records videos in the format of 1080 r (that is, in a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080).  At the same time, their quality is quite good with a normal level of illumination.  <span>The front camera is</span> based on a 5 megapixel sensor element.  She has expanded viewing angles, there is LED backlight.  This allows using it to take very high quality ‚Äúselfies‚Äù.  Well, with such a simpler task as video calls, she generally does an excellent job.  Another ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of the front camera is the ability to control using gestures or keywords. </p>

    <h2>  Information storage subsystem </h2><p>  1 GB of RAM, the most common DDR3 standard to date, is installed in the LG Magna phone.  The reviews indicate that about 700 MB of them are occupied by the operating system and its processes.  Somehow to reduce this value will not work.  Therefore, the user can count on only 300 MB.  For 2-3 entry-level tasks this will be enough.  Well, for the most demanding modern applications, these 300 MB will be clearly not enough.  Therefore, you can‚Äôt count on playing Asphalt 8 on this gadget.  The capacity of the internal drive is 8GB.  About half of them (that is, about 4GB) the user can use to install software or to store personal data.  There is also a slot for installing a flash card.  Its maximum capacity can be in this case 32 GB.  If the capacity of the built-in drive and external flash card is small, it is most rational to use free cloud services to store the most valuable personal information (for example, photos or videos). </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  The battery capacity of 2540 mAh boasts LG Magna H502F.  Reviews clearly indicate that this battery capacity is enough for 2-3 days of operation with an average level of load on the gadget.  If you activate the maximum energy saving mode, you can count on 4 days of confident and stable operation of the device.  Well, in the case of maximum load on the smartphone, one charge of the battery will be enough for 7-9 hours.  As a result, it can be noted that in terms of autonomy, this device does not stand out from the competition.  A certain solution, which will significantly increase the battery life of this device, may be the purchase of an additional external battery.  This will allow you to avoid problems with discharging the battery at the most inopportune moment for this. </p>

    <h2>  Interface set </h2><p>  An impressive set of information transfer tools is installed in the smartphone LG Magna H502.  Reviews highlight such of them: </p><ul><li>  The device fully supports all existing mobile networks, that is, GSM (or 2G), 3G and LTE (the second name of this 4G standard). </li><li>  There is bluetooth in the gadget.  This transmitter allows you to connect an external wireless speaker system to your smartphone.  It can also be used to exchange small files with a similar mobile device. </li><li>  Also this device is equipped with a Wi-Fi transmitter.  This is the main way to receive and send data to the "global web."  In this case, the speed can reach impressive today 150 Mbit / s. </li><li>  The navigation system in this smart phone uses two methods at once to determine its location.  The first one is GPS.  It uses a signal from satellites and allows you to accurately determine the location of the device.  The second is A-GPS.  In this case, you need to connect to the Internet. </li><li>  The main wireless port is micro-USB.  He charges the device and synchronizes with the computer. </li><li>  In addition, there is an audio port.  It outputs an audio signal to an external stereo system.  Also, if there is an appropriate plug, it can receive an audio signal from an external microphone. </li></ul><h2>  Software </h2><p>  "Android" one of the most recent versions - 5.0 - is installed out of the box on the LG Magna H502.  Reviews highlight this feature of this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù phone.  Only here all the possibilities of this version of system software to fully reveal on such <span>hardware is</span> definitely impossible.  The operating system is designed to be installed on the latest versions of central processors, which would be based at least on the A53 architecture with support for 64-bit applications.  MT6582 with A7 architecture and support for only 32-bit applications is installed in the same smartphone.  Simply put, the newest programs optimized for 64-bit applications will not run on this device, although software seems to allow this. </p>

    <h2>  Gadget price for today </h2><p>  Initially, the cost of the devices in this series was 240-250 dollars.  Against the background of direct competitors with a conventional display, this cost was really overpriced.  Now, after a year and a half from the start of sales, the price has dropped to $ 180 for LG Magna Titan.  Reviews, however, still indicate that the cost of the device continues to be overstated.  The key highlight of this gadget is its curved screen.  And visually notice this bend is very difficult.  Overpaying for such an innovation is not entirely reasonable.  It is better to buy a device with a conventional display and similar characteristics.  At the same time, its cost will be only 80-100 dollars, which is almost two times lower than the current one. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Be that as it may, the high price is the main drawback of LG Magna.  Reviews often indicate this.  To pay 180 dollars for such hardware and software is a lot.  Such a high cost is not compensated even by the highlight of this gadget - a curved screen.  The second significant minus is the lack of support for 64-bit applications.  This limitation, as noted earlier, is due to the model of the central processor, and somehow it will not work around it.  The rest is a pretty good entry-level smartphone.  It has a productive central processor, a large diagonal of the touch screen, an acceptable degree of autonomy - everything in this smartphone is well balanced and works perfectly.  This is once again confirmed by the reviews of the owners of this gadget. </p>
