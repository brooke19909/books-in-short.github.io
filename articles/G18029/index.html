Helsinki Metro</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Despite the developed railway transport system, in Finland there is a metro only in the capital, which is due to the small size and small population of other cities.  In addition to the status of the only subway in Suomi, the Helsinki Metro is also located at the northernmost coordinate among other underground stations in the world, which certainly makes it unique and interesting. </p>

    <h2>  Comfort ride </h2><p>  <span>Helsinki metro</span> scheme consists of two lines, but 99% of tourists do not need to reach the second one, so it will be difficult to get lost.  Everywhere there are signs indicating the direction, in Finnish and Swedish.  There are no turnstiles in the subway, but a trip with a hare can be very expensive.  Periodically, the territory at the entrance and in the trains is checked by controllers, and the amount of the fine for stowaways is huge.  So at the entrance you should be careful - there is a risk of accidentally passing by the payment terminal.  The border is indicated by a bright yellow stripe on the floor, after its crossing the ticket must be already valid. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="subway train" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2100975.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Only a small part of the stations (mainly in the center of the city) is underground, while a large open type.  So, for example, to the station "Kulosaari" (Kulosaari), located separately on the island with a zoo, the road leads through the bridge and offers an interesting panorama of Helsinki.  The metro scheme, however, allows you to ride from one end to the other, enjoy the view of the stations and, without getting lost, return. </p><p>  A one-way trip will take no more than 25 minutes, trains arrive every 1-2 minutes at rush hour and after three to four minutes at normal times. </p><h2>  Functional </h2><p>  The Finnish metro is notable for the presence of elevators.  Any passenger can use it instead of the escalator, while the elevator does not rise strictly vertically, but diagonally along the lift.  Helsinki's city transport company once deemed such convenience necessary, and now satisfied passengers, including people with disabilities, freely use the elevator. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki Metro" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2100968.jpg"></div>

    <p>  A one and a half meter track allows the use of wide, comfortable trains.  The metro is built in good Scandinavian traditions - with the ability to preserve personal space.  Due to the arrangement of seats, the wagons accommodate themselves more than passengers, and in calm hours they assume a comfortable seating arrangement. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Security </h2><p>  As in the whole world, the metro cannot have the title of the most peaceful place, but to the honor and dignity of the Helsinki City Hall it should be noted that it is still not a center for collecting criminal layers of society.  Ordinary passengers can feel relatively calm, and tourists are advised to look after their wallets. </p><h2>  Decor </h2><p>  The stations are decorated in a minimalist style, without unnecessary decor and with a boring finish.  If the decoration contains decorating elements, then, as a rule, with a few exceptions, they look no less ascetic than the cave of an ancient person.  Several stations are still knocked out of the usual way of life of Finnish builders and indulge passengers with beautifully fan-shaped signposts on the ceiling as a decoration or a huge stone block hanging from above. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki City Transport Company" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2100819.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  Working hours </h2><p>  The hours of operation of the Helsinki metro station depend on the time of year.  A diagram showing the exact time of opening and closing, the beginning of train movement can be seen on the official website of the subway.  There is a table for the summer (from June to August) and the rest of the year, however, only in <span>Finnish.</span>  On average, the metro starts at 5:30, and ends at 23:00 or at 23:30 on weekends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  sights </h2><p>  Moving by metro, you can visit famous Finnish sights.  So, the first metro station "Rautatientori" (Rautatientori) overlooks the central station, built in 1860, next to which there are various public transport stops in Helsinki, within walking distance are a theater and an art museum. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki city" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2103479.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The University of Helsinki (Helsingin yliopisto) used to be called Kaisaniemi, was renamed only two years ago, so old guides should be guided by the previous name of the station.  It houses Senate Square, the Cathedral and, of course, the university itself.  Connoisseurs of flora and fauna are advised to visit the botanical garden and park. </p><p>  The Kampii station overlooks the bus station and the shopping mall. Shopping enthusiasts should also visit the Itakeskus station, near which there is the largest mall in all of Scandinavia, which includes more than 240 stores. </p><p>  Korkeasaari will appeal to children and adults alike, but it is better to come there in the summer.  The island has a well-known zoo, the largest in all of Finland.  Animals are located in comfortable and spacious enclosures made for habitats in the natural environment. </p><h2>  An airport </h2><p>  When planning a vacation, it‚Äôs nice to pay attention to the metro scheme.  Helsinki is a small city, but the airport has been moved a little beyond. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki metro map" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/64128/2088657.jpg"></div></h2><p>  From the Campi bus station, you can get to the airport by passing one metro station to the Rautatientori railway station and from there transfer to the 615th bus or Finnair bus for 6.20 euros.  Drive about 20-30 minutes. </p><h2>  Train Station </h2><p>  Trains departing from Helsinki Central Station in various directions in Finland.  There is also the dispatch of high-speed long-distance trains "Allegro" and "Leo Tolstoy" to St. Petersburg and Moscow.  The station building is connected to the Rautatientori metro station, so guests of the Finnish capital should not worry about how to get to the hotel.  Passengers of the Allegro train who want to get to the airport can use a faster and more convenient way - get off at the Tikkurila station (one stop earlier than the final stop) and travel for the airport for free with their ticket.  It takes about 80 minutes. </p><h2>  Fare </h2><p>  Tickets can be purchased via mobile phone or at the payment terminal at the stations.  There are two types of machines: for the sale of single tickets and for the issuance of travel cards. </p><p>  You can buy ordinary one-time tickets in coins, but payment of tickets takes place only in a non-cash way, by card.  Vending machines accept Visa and MasterCard payment systems.  In 2017-2018, a one-time pass costs 2.90 euros.  In addition, the city transport company Helsinki offers to purchase tickets valid for 1-7 days, or a card for a long period.  Examples of tariffs and price differences can be seen in the table below. </p><table align="center" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" class="if" style="width: 692px; height: 212px;"><tbody><tr><td><p>  Number of days </p></td><td><p>  Ticket price </p></td><td><p>  Cost of travel </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  1 </p></td><td><p>  9 ‚Ç¨ </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  2 </p></td><td><p>  13.50 ‚Ç¨ </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  3 </p></td><td><p>  18,00 ‚Ç¨ </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  4 </p></td><td><p>  ‚Ç¨ 22.50 </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  5 </p></td><td><p>  27,00 ‚Ç¨ </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  6 </p></td><td><p>  31,50 ‚Ç¨ </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  7 </p></td><td><p>  36,00 ‚Ç¨ </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>  14 </p></td><td></td><td><p>  28,70 ‚Ç¨ </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>  thirty </p></td><td></td><td><p>  54,70 ‚Ç¨ </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>  An alternative to a standard pass can be a three-day Helsinki card for 66 euros (or 72 including peripherals), a two-day for 56 euros and a one-day for 46 euros (children‚Äôs cards cost exactly half the price), giving free travel on all types of transport, discounts to most museums and other attractions of Helsinki, free travel to the Suomenlinna fortress, free access to some museums. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki public transport" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24396/2103480.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  Final word </h2><p>  The metro in the city of Helsinki is a convenient and ergonomic way to get around.  Tourists will like the intuitive driving directions, the lobby, made in the best traditions of Finnish design and never late for the spacious metro trains that arrive every 2-4 minutes. </p><p>  City guests prefer to purchase one-two-day tickets in order to save money on visiting all the stations of interest.  Sightseeing buses from St. Petersburg more often make a stop within walking distance to the Kampi, Helsinki University and Rautatientori stations.  There are signs in the subway and on the street in Finnish and Swedish, but there are brochures for tourists at information points, including in Russian. </p>
