    <p>  For those who have not yet decided what to see in the capital of Catalonia, we can recommend using very convenient for tourists bus routes called “Bass Touristik”.  They consist of three lines that cover the most interesting places in Barcelona.  Buses run on them with an interval of ten minutes.  At any stop, you can go out and see what interests you, and then continue the journey to the next.  A trip along each route is accompanied by an audio guide in a variety of languages, which is also quite convenient.  Of course, walking around the city is no less interesting, but you can go round the bus and have time to see much more interesting places. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Attractions of the capital of Catalonia </h2><p>  There are a lot of attractions in Barcelona.  It is rightly called the cultural capital of the country.  Here once lived and created such celebrities as Salvador Dali, Gaudi, Picasso.  All sorts of eras and styles mixed in the city.  And there are so many attractions here that it is simply impossible to see them all in one vacation. </p><h2>  Gothic Quarter </h2><p>  One of the main items on the list of interesting places in Barcelona is the Rambla.  Its length from the square of Catalonia to the coast of the sea is 1.2 kilometers.  The most famous pedestrian street of the city is at the same time one of the most beautiful places in the city.  There are always crowds of holidaymakers here, and along the shops and cafes are street vendors and living statues.  On the Ramble there is an old market called Boqueria, which translates only as an abyss.  Passing by this picturesque place is simply impossible, because the bright counters simply lure tourists to themselves.  Many beautiful legends and signs will be associated with the Rambla Boulevard.  One of them says that everyone who gets drunk from the fountain, which is located near Plaza Catalunya, will certainly return to Barcelona again. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of catalonia population" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2024976.jpg"></div>

    <p>  Near the Rambla Boulevard is the center of the Old Town, which is known as the Gothic Quarter.  It represents the intricacies of medieval streets and alleys.  It was from here that the history of Barcelona once began.  In the area of ​​the Old Town, a record number of ancient buildings and churches are concentrated.  This is the church of Santa Maria del Mar, the Cathedral and much more. </p><p>  Many buildings of the quarter are dated XIV-XV centuries.  And at the same time, on its streets there are a large number of cozy modern cafes, restaurants and clubs.  The entire Gothic quarter is a monument of the Roman era. </p><p>  Its main building can rightfully be called the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Holy Eulalia.  In the people it is better known as the Cathedral, which is a very high structure.  Its longest spire rises 93 meters.  The building is both elegant and massive, it is made in the style of Catalan Gothic architecture with multi-level openwork arches and ornaments. </p><p>  No less interesting for tourists is the central square of the quarter, named after St. James.  It is located on the site of the Roman Forum.  Today it houses the neoclassical city hall and the Palace of the Government of Catalonia.  On Sundays, residents come to San Jaume to dance, and all kinds of events are held here during the holidays. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of catalonia regions of spain" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2024964.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The hallmark of the historic center is the famous <span>Bridge of Sighs,</span> which is known far beyond the capital of Catalonia (photos are given in the article).  It was built in the early twentieth century by Jean Rubio.  The purpose of its construction was to unite the Palace of Government and the residence of the President of Catalonia.  The bridge is next to the Cathedral. </p><h2>  Museum of History </h2><p>  Among all <span>regions of Spain, the</span> capital of Catalonia is the most interesting and popular among tourists.  It is Barcelona that is visited annually by the largest number of travelers; no other city in the country enjoys such popularity among vacationers.  This is largely due to cultural and historical monuments.  To learn more about this beautiful city, you should visit the Museum of the History of Barcelona.  The exposition of the institution opens up an opportunity for visitors to see the historical panorama, covering the period from the time of the Roman Empire to the present.  The main building of the institution is located in the palace of the fifteenth century.  The glass windows of the museum contain unique artifacts that have survived to this day or were found during excavations. </p><p>  It is also worth visiting the Museum of Frederic Mares, where you can see a large collection of sculptures from the ancient Roman period to the twentieth century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of catalonia regions" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2024963.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The cultural heritage of the city consists not only of ancient attractions.  In the art gallery you can see classic works familiar to our eyes.  To this day, followers of Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali live and create in Barcelona.  In the halls of the gallery are collected original works of contemporaries, and in the courtyard of the building unusual sculptures are presented. </p><h2>  Jewish quarter </h2><p>  In the thirteenth century, many Jews lived in Barcelona who successfully conduct business and flourish.  The Jewish community was the richest in the whole city.  But the situation has changed a lot after some two hundred years.  All Jews were expelled from the city in general hysteria associated with the terrible disease that at that time consumed all of Europe.  Currently, in the area of ​​the Gothic Quarter, you can see the small district of El Col, which once lived the Jewish community.  The local streets still have a medieval spirit.  Antique shops operate here and street performers perform. </p><h2>  Picasso Museum </h2><p>  The Picasso Museum is the most visited among similar institutions in the capital of Catalonia.  In Spain, it is difficult to find a more famous person than Pablo Picasso.  In the museum you can learn a lot about the creative path of the founder of cubism, as well as see his work created in different creative periods.  It is difficult to imagine, but the exposition of the institution consists of 3,500 works of the greatest artist. </p><h2>  Park Guell </h2><p>  Many experienced travelers recommend starting sightseeing with a visit to Guell Park.  And not because this place is the hallmark of Barcelona, ​​but because the park really has a lot of interesting things that you will not see in any other place. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of catalonia general information" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2024962.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The park is dotted with the creations of world famous architect Antonio Gaudi.  Miracles begin already at the entrance, where there are gingerbread houses of bizarre wavy shapes.  Next you can see the famous mosaic lizard, which is a symbol of Barcelona.  A long bench, a columned hall - everything here has a wavy, sinuous shape, it seems that it hit a completely different planet.  The wonders of the park are simply impossible to describe in words, unusual buildings just need to be seen. </p><h2>  Magic fountain </h2><p>  Walking along the streets of Barcelona, ​​you should definitely see one of the best modern creations in the city - this is the Magic Fountain.  Tourists from all Spanish resort regions come to see its beauty.  The capital of Catalonia is associated with a wonderful fountain for many.  In the evening, guests of Barcelona have the opportunity to admire the beauty of the play of the light of music and water.  The show does not leave anyone indifferent.  The most amazing view opens from the terrace of the National Museum. </p><h2>  Tibidabo Hill </h2><p>  In Barcelona you can find many picturesque places, however, if you want to admire the panorama of the city from a decent height, then you simply can not find a better place than Tibidabo hill.  Here you can have a great time walking along the slopes covered with forests, as well as stop by the Museum of Natural Science or try to find a way out of the landscape maze.  The main pearl of the hill, located at the very top is the Temple of the Sacred Heart. </p><h2>  Spanish village </h2><p>  All tourists will certainly go to the hill of Montjuic.  Translated, its name sounds like a Jewish mountain.  The hill is a favorite place for walking for all residents and tourists.  In this area there are many interesting sights, the inspection of which will take at least one day.  For many centuries, the hill was considered a strategic object, which is confirmed by an ancient fortress built on the very top.  In anticipation of the 1992 Olympics, sports facilities were also built on the hill.  Here you can see the <span>Spanish village.</span>  Skillful architects in a small area managed to build copies of buildings located in various parts of the country.  Here you can admire the castle gates from Avila, buildings from Aragon and Castile, as well as Andalusian, Valencia, Basque and other thematic neighborhoods. </p><h2>  Modern buildings </h2><p>  No less interesting are the modern buildings of Barcelona.  One of the city's most futuristic buildings is the Forum.  It was built in 2004 for the Forum of Cultures.  The structure is made in the form of a triangle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="capital of catalonia attractions" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/20328/2024981.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The building of the Palace of Catalan Music is also interesting.  Although it is not included in the list of “mast si”, it is certainly worthy of your attention.  It was built in the Art Nouveau style, but at the same time, there is a vivid mixture of all kinds of architectural elements, intricate decorations, fancy columns, which gives the impression that this is not a building, but a frozen melody.  In general, the bizarre <span>architecture of Barcelona</span> amazes with its beauty and originality of ordinary inhabitants, accustomed to standard faceless buildings. </p>
