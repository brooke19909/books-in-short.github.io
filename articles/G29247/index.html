    <h2>  Halkidiki, Kassandra: resort specifics </h2><p>  The hotel we are describing is located in the village of Loutra.  This is in Greece, on the peninsula of Halkidiki.  A few words should be said about this fabulous place.  On the map, Halkidiki looks like a palm with three fingers protruding into the sea.  These small peninsulas have their own names.  The westernmost ‚Äúfinger‚Äù is called Kassandra.  In ancient times, it was called Pallini or Flegra.  And when in the fourth century BC, King Kassander (brother-in-law of Alexander the Great) founded a settlement and port here, the peninsula was named after him.  Of the three ‚Äúfingers‚Äù of Halkidiki, this is the most populous.  Fifty towns and villages are located in a continuous line along its coast.  On the very southern edge, the village of Agia Paraskevi is perched.  It is famous for the fact that near it, right in the middle of a pine forest there is a thermal spring, which has no analogues in the properties of healing water.  So, the Aphrodite Hotel (Halkidiki, Kassandra) is located five kilometers from the village of Agia Paraskevi, but only seventy meters from its spa.  A visit to it will help strengthen the cardiovascular system, heal loosened nerves, improve skin condition and get rid of rheumatism.  Balneological procedures will bring more benefits if combined with the use of unique honey, which bees make only in this region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Halkidiki Cassandra" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1574298.jpg" width="600"></div>

The last renovation took place in 2007. This is a very small hotel with a welcoming, almost family atmosphere.  It consists of a residential building, a swimming pool with fresh water, a sun terrace with <span>shade canopies</span> and a bar.  The hotel is located on a flat top of a low hill.  The restaurant's terrace offers enchanting views of the mountains covered in pine forests.  And the water surface of the Aegean Sea can be admired directly from their rooms.  In good weather, according to reviews, the holy Mount Athos is visible, and across the bay - the neighboring "finger" of Halkidiki - the Sithonia peninsula. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aphroditi Hotel 3 Greece Halkidiki" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1574289.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Where guests are accommodated </h2><p>  In the small hotel Aphroditi Hotel 3 * there are only forty-six rooms.  All of them belong to the same category - ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù, but vary in size and, accordingly, capacity.  Double Room (with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãnineteen square meters) is designed to accommodate two guests.  You can choose a room with one matrimonial or two twin beds.  Triple Room is a bit more spacious (twenty-two square meters).  The Quadruples room has the same area.  A sofa bed is provided for two additional guests.  The rooms have everything you need for a good rest: air conditioning, cable TV, small refrigerator, telephone, hairdryer.  Bed linen is changed twice a week, cleaned every day.  All rooms have spacious balconies, and those on the ground floor have terraces.

The floor is tiled, which is nice in the hot season.  The furniture in the rooms is of high quality, made of pure wood.  Air conditioners are installed very competently.  They do not blow on the bed, so you can sleep with the air cooler on.  Wi-Fi also pleased guests.  Wireless Internet access in the hotel is absolutely free.  Wi-Fi pulls from the rooms and throughout the hotel.  So many guests with a laptop could sit on sun loungers under a canopy by the pool.  Another pleasant surprise was that there was a hairdryer in the bathroom with a shower, and an electric kettle in the bedroom.  Upon request, an iron with ironing board is available at reception. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aphroditi Hotel 3 reviews" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1574297.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Dining at the Aphroditi Hotel 3 * (Greece, Halkidiki) and reviews about it </h2><p>  Breakfast is already included in the room rate.  Morning meals always represent the same set of dishes.  This is a <span>continental breakfast,</span> that is, the choice is not very large.  There are boiled eggs, scrambled eggs, cheese, toast, cereal, butter, jams.  Breakfast is buffet style.  The staff does not follow who takes how much, and you certainly will not leave hungry.  For twelve euros per day, you can buy dinner at the hotel.  And evening meals are fundamentally different from morning ones.  They are very diverse, rich, with gourmet Greek and European cuisines.  They give both fish and meat.  The food is very tasty, and tourists recommend having dinner at the Aphroditi Hotel 3 *.  In the restaurant you can eat both in the hall and on the flower-covered terrace.  In the village of Loutra there is only one supermarket, but there are many cafes and taverns. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Aphroditi Hotel 3 road to the sea" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1574295.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Beach and Pool </h2><p>  Reviews say that on the second line is Aphroditi Hotel 3 *.  The road to the sea will take about five minutes, but you will have to go back up.  This is the only inconvenience of the hotel.  But on the sandy beach of the village of Loutra, vacationers will feel like kings of the coast.  There are very few people here.  There are no loud music, rattling <span>water scooters,</span> bananas, parachutes and screaming children.  But the beach is very equipped: there are changing cabins, showers.  Sun beds and umbrellas are paid there.  Near the equipped beach there is a "wild".  There is no one there at all.  Expanse for lovers of privacy.  Along the shore, you can walk to the small church of Panagia Faneromeni, which preserved ancient frescoes and contains a miraculous icon.  And within walking distance from the hotel "Aphrodite" is the famous hydropathic center Agia Paraskeva.  In addition to medicinal baths, you can swim in the indoor and outdoor thermal tanks with hydrogen sulfide, visit the sauna, hammam, jacuzzi and undergo a massage.  The hotel has a swimming pool with a children's section. </p><h2>  Services </h2><p>  Hotel "Aphrodite" provides its guests with a free secure parking.  Internet is also available for free use.  The hotel has a warm atmosphere.  If guests leave very early, they are brought to their room a breakfast tray and a thermos with hot coffee.  The hostess of the hotel is a very nice woman.  She will easily keep your luggage in the storage room, help you book excursions and arrange car rental. </p>
