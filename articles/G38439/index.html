It is especially difficult for mothers, because they need to dress their child so that it does not freeze in the morning and does not suffer from heat during the day.  Quite effectively, this problem helps to solve such a familiar and familiar wardrobe item as a sundress.  Knitting for a girl with a description and patterns for knitting these clothes is quite simple and quick. <br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress with knitting needles for a girl with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1396657.jpg" width="398"></div>

    <h2>  Yarn selection and patterns </h2><p>  Inspired by the photographs and planning to make a real masterpiece, the craftswoman can suddenly (somewhere in the middle of the process) discover that her project is too complex, irrational, or even completely impossible.  Among knitters, this situation is not uncommon.  It is especially sad when money and time have already been spent on the purchase of yarn, the development and miscalculation of the model.  As a result, instead of making her daughter happy with a new thing and getting practical and nice clothes, the craftswoman hides her ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù at the bottom of the deepest drawer. </p><p>  The most common causes of this phenomenon are: </p><ul><li>  Bad choice of yarn.  For example, you do not need to knit a warm sarafan from acrylic for a girl with knitting needles (the description of such models usually involves the use of wool mixture).  Also, do not buy hard and spiky, completely woolen materials. </li><li>  Too complex pattern that can not be adapted and recalculated. </li><li>  Failure to comply with the proportions of the model (excessively long or, conversely, a short skirt, deep armholes, wide shoulders). </li><li>  Incompatibility of the chosen pattern and model (several different patterns that "quarreled", the use of melange yarn, which led to the "smearing" of the ornament, and other incidents). </li><li>  Unfixed errors at the very beginning of the project, which do not allow to continue working. </li></ul><p>  To avoid these and other misunderstandings, it is worthwhile to adequately assess your abilities, understand the purpose of the product, and also take into account the type and specificity of the material.  Often, a sundress with knitting needles for a girl (with a description of an openwork or solid pattern) is knitted from yarn of medium thickness with a moderate content of natural fibers.  A thread with a composition of 50% wool and 50% cotton (bamboo, linen or acrylic) with a thickness of about 350-400 m per 100 grams should be considered optimal. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Knitting sundresses for girls with knitting needles with a description, photo and patterns </h2><p>  Usually <span>children's sundresses are</span> knitted from the bottom up.  The only exceptions are those that begin with the manufacture of raglan coquette.  In this case, they start work, performing the neck, and complete the design of the bottom line. </p>

    <p>  The craftswoman will need about 300 grams of yarn, as well as circular knitting needles of the appropriate size, to knit a sundress with knitting needles for a girl (a description and patterns can be found later). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="legend" class="if" height="180" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/29489/1396729.jpg" width="535"></div>

    <p>  The work begins with a set of loops for the first row (their number can be calculated according to the previously performed control sample).

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To obtain a fitted silhouette, it is necessary to perform uniform contraction of the loops through an equal number of rows.  How to calculate the decrease: </p><ol><li>  Subtract the chest circumference from the length of the bottom line (for example, 84 - 44 = 40).  Abbreviations should be made in six places (therefore 40/6 = 6.5). </li><li>  The length of the skirt is divided by the number obtained (42 / 6.5 = 6.5). <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress for girls knitting patterns and description" class="if" height="470" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1396660.jpg" width="420"></div></li></ol><p>  Thus, it turns out that every 6.5 cm it is necessary to reduce one loop at six points in the row.  That is, with each such reduction, the web will taper by 6 loops. </p><h2>  Knitting coquette </h2><p>  After the skirt is ready, you need to knit a few centimeters according to scheme A.2.  Here you should get openwork holes that can be a simple decorative element or used to thread the lace.  At the next stage, the canvas should be divided into two parts (front and back), closing on the sides for armholes of 5-7 loops.  Next, it is required to perform several rows of front stitch (given the fact that the model is children's, it is not necessary to knit corners for a yoke). </p><p>  Then you need to decorate the <span>sundress for the girl</span> with an openwork yoke <span>with</span> knitting needles (diagrams and description illustrate the necessary order of work). </p><p>  Using a control sample, you need to calculate the number of loops that will need to be taken to form armholes.  Roughly this gap is usually equal to the width of the front or back. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  The yoke is knitted according to scheme A.1.  Here you need to pay attention to the icon, which looks like a black triangle, tilted to the right.  It means cutting one loop.  The scheme does not provide nakidov to balance the total number of loops, since the yoke should gradually narrow to the neck.  Thus, you get a neat and beautiful dress with knitting needles for a girl.  It is possible and necessary to work creatively with the description and pattern of the pattern.  Depending on the size of the product and the thickness of the thread, you can reduce the yoke loops more often or less than the model developers recommend. </p><h2>  Knitting finish </h2><p>  When all the elements are completed, the open edges of the dress should be crocheted.  The first row necessarily includes only single crochet, and starting from the second, you can perform any suitable binding.  A fairly simple pattern is used here: arches of four air loops are tied into every second loop of the base.  Such a strapping looks good only when working with a thick thread. </p><h2>  Jacquard ornament - a classic of the genre </h2><p>  For those craftswomen who want to create a traditional dress with knitting needles with a description of a girl of 3 years old, it is worth choosing yarn in two contrasting shades.  One color will be the main, the second is the ornament.  If desired, you can experiment with several shades. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sundress knitting with a description of a girl 3 years old" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1396661.jpg" width="393"></div>

    <p>  This model fits quite simply, much easier than the previous one.  Here is a very simple silhouette that should not cause difficulties even for beginners.  The main decoration of the sundress, as well as the most difficult stage in the work, is the execution of the jacquard pattern. </p><h2>  How to knit a sundress for a girl with knitting needles </h2><p>  With a description of the ornament and patterns to cope with the work will be much easier.  At the very beginning, the density of the web should be carefully calculated from the control sample.  This is important, since the obtained indicators will help to calculate the place of the beginning of the ornament. </p><p>  The first rows (lower edge of the skirt) are knitted with a garter pattern on circular knitting needles.  Then enter the second thread and perform a narrow strip of the pattern according to the scheme M.1. <br>  After that, the colored thread is cut and the tail is fixed.  Then, at the same time, the front and back parts are formed, evenly reducing the loops to obtain a fitted silhouette.  You can tie a simple even sundress. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pattern for sundress" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1396662.jpg" width="342"></div>

    <p>  In accordance with the calculations made in advance, the colored thread is again introduced and the formation of the ornament is started: schemes from M.2 to M.7 are used sequentially. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="jacquard knitting pattern" class="if" height="489" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1396663.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  What to look for when working with jacquards </h2><p>  Performing colored ornaments, it is necessary to observe the correct thread tension.  Weakening cannot be allowed, as the loops will look messy, and the pattern will simply blur.  At the same time, do not overtighten the threads (especially broaches on the wrong side), because then the canvas will become uneven and will be tightened. </p><p>  So that skeins of different yarns do not get confused, some craftswomen unwind small balls and pin them with pins to the wrong side of the canvas. </p><p>  Carried away by the formation of the ornament, one should not forget about knitting armholes and necks.  At the end of the work, when the shoulder seams are sewn, all open edges of the product must be tied with columns without a crochet. </p><h2>  Sundress for the little ones </h2><p>  This model is also quite simple and very similar to the previous one.  Classic snowflakes are used here as a decorative element. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knitting sundresses for girls with knitting needles with a description" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40072/1396664.jpg" width="392"></div>
