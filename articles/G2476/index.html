  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The luxurious capital of Monaco</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Monaco is a unique <span>European state.</span>  It is included in the few list of principalities that have not lost their sovereignty since the time of feudalism.  Today it belongs to one of the most popular tourist centers.  The Principality consists of four parts: <br>  - Monaco-Ville ("old city"), <br>  - La Condamine (port city), <br>  - Monte Carlo ("new city"), <br>  - Fontvieille. </p><p>  The Principality of Monaco occupies a very small territory that can be crossed in an hour of walking.  The capital of Monaco is even smaller, but despite this there is everything for cultural leisure and entertainment: restaurants, dance clubs, stadiums where Formula 1 competitions are held and more - all this attracts many tourists. </p><p>  Among the 30 thousandth population, 5 thousand are the <span>natives of Monaco</span> Monegasques.  Being one of the best resorts on the <span>Cote d'Azur, the</span> Principality receives about 3 million tourists a year.  That is why the main source of income for the country is the tourism business.  Some people consider it a matter of honor and prestige to have an account at the Bank of Monaco, and many, on this basis, register their companies on one of the principal streets of the Principality.  This fact prompted the managers of the top to greatly increase rental rates.  Today, the capital of Monaco provides for rent areas with very high rates even at the European level. <strong></strong></p><p>  The capital of Monaco, with the same name as the country, is a center for tourism, political events and business.  Even an ordinary walk among magnificent palaces, houses <span>of the Middle Ages</span> and beautiful green alleys will become memorable. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Monaco residents consider the Oceanographic Museum, which was erected thanks to Prince Albert I, to be their pride. The money for its creation was taken from a profit in one of the casinos.  On the basis of the museum, a research center was created, the leader of which was the world famous Jacques Yves Cousteau. </p><p>  On the coast of the principality is an exotic garden of Monaco, which attracts not only plants unusual for these places, but also beautiful landscapes that mesmerize the observer.  The garden cannot be overlooked, because it is located at the entrance to the capital. </p><p>  Being created almost a hundred years ago (1913-1933), the Monaco Garden stores the most unusual plant specimens, for example, Mexican cacti that are uncharacteristic for these latitudes.  The variety of flora is striking: several thousand species are represented here.  The specimens that lived for about 100 years, that is, from the very beginning of the garden, are particularly attracting attention. </p><p>  The garden also houses the Observatory Cave (Grotte d'Observatoire) and the Museum of Anthropology.  The cave has become the site of a huge number of unique archaeological finds, among which there are stone tools belonging to an ancient man, as well as the bones of ancient animals. </p><p>  To date, the cave has become one of the main attractions that the Monaco garden offers to view.  It seems that nature has done everything possible to make people admire its capabilities: huge underground halls, inside of which there are many of the most unusual in shape <span>stalactites and stalagmites.</span> <strong></strong></p><p>  The capital of Monaco has a well-developed infrastructure.  Connection with the French railways, bus routes with Nice, Cannes and Menton, creates chic prospects for independent excursions. </p><p>  Monaco residents love to eat, so any restaurant will offer you a chic menu with Western dishes.  The cuisine was particularly influenced by such a close neighborhood of France.  Tourists especially note Barbagiuan <span>(fried dumplings</span> with an unusual filling) and Stocafi (gourmet fish dish). </p><p>  A visit to Monaco will not leave indifferent a tourist accustomed to luxury and the sea.  Perhaps this is exactly what you need. </p>
