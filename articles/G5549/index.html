And immediately found his audience.  The actors “Know Me If You Can” (which is the name of this picture) played the modern story of a free retelling of the story of the Count of Monte Cristo.  This is a certain analogue of the famous Turkish telenovela “Ezel”, all the events in which last as many as 130 episodes.  Ukrainian producers met only 32. But the series did not become less interesting from this, and after the end of the next series, the audience, with bated breath, expected the story to continue ... </p><h2>  Story line.  Homecoming </h2><p>  The series “Know Me If You Can”, the actors of which told another heart-breaking tragedy of life, combined a thriller, a love story, crime.  Director Aleksey Gusev made a film based on the script of Anastasia Kasumova.  Actors "Know me if you can" <strong> </strong>  the main roles were selected very carefully: Evgenia Loza, Yuri Stoyanov and Ivan Stebunov. </p>

    <p>  The whole story begins on the day when Ilya Avdeev (actor Yaroslav Zhalnin) returns home after serving in the army.  He has been dreaming about this for a long time, because a small seaside town is his native land, where his parents are waiting for him (his mother was played by Irina Rozanova, and her father by Boris Shcherbakov) and his great love is Alice (actress Evgenia Loza).  Young people have a real strong feeling for each other.  They dream of their happy future years, boundless and cloudless, and begin preparations for the wedding. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Story line.  Prodigal father </h2><p>  Closer and closer this day, the day of the creation of a new family.  Suddenly, the girl is found by her fraud father (actor Sergei Zhigunov), from whom she escaped.  Alice could not endure the life during which her father forced her to participate in all her scams in her young years.  She ran away from her father a few years ago and has since said that she is an orphan.  Unfortunately for the girl, her dad is returning: he came up with a plan to rob the casino, and now he again needs the help of her daughter and best friends of her fiance, who worked in this casino - Denis (actor Sergei Peregudov) and Alika (actor Timur Efremenkov). </p>

    <p>  The actors of the series “Know Me If You Can” showed the friendship of three guys, in which only the hero <span>Yaroslav Zhalnin</span> (later - Ivan Stebunov) turned out to be a sincere person </p><p>  Now Alice does not want to step back on the criminal path, but she really needs money to treat her younger sister.  Little Sveta dies of cancer, so Alice agrees to help in the robbery, especially since her father promises her money to treat her sister. </p><h2>  Story line.  Crime happened </h2><p>  During the planned robbery, a guard was killed in the casino, with his little son.  Unexpectedly for Alice, the police arrested her beloved man - Ilya Avdeev, who was accused of robbery and murder.  In court, a girl has to testify against Ilya, because she was given a condition: either a boy’s reservation, or the painful death of a younger sister.  After the trial, Wojciechowski writes to Alice the address where Svetlana is located, and the bag where the money should be for the girl’s treatment.  But, finding her sister, Alice discovers that instead of money, packs of chopped paper are in her bag. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  New life, new face ... </h2><p>  The next stage of life was very difficult for the protagonist of the series <strong> </strong>  “Get to know me if you can.”  The actors and the roles they played showed people in different life situations and how each person reacted to what happened and how he tried to cope with the inevitable.  Ilya Avdeev, according to a court decision, should spend 15 years in prison.  Already within its walls, the guy understands that both his beloved girl and best friends betrayed him.  This is a shock for him; he does not know how to be. </p>

    <p>  The actors “Know Me If You Can”, which appeared in subsequent episodes, at first seemed redundant here.  But only at first ... </p><p>  In prison, by chance, the guy gets acquainted with the criminal authority Roman Uvarov (actor Yuri Stoyanov), who patronizes Ilya.  He protects him and helps to get out after eight years, "giving" the young man a new face.  For all, Ilya died in custody during the riot.  A new man returns to the seaside town - Nikita Gromov (played by Ivan Stebunov). </p><h2>  Adventure continues.  On the other side of the movie camera </h2><p>  These are the events that took place in the film “Know Me If You Can.”  Actors, whose photos began to appear on the pages of glossy publications with enviable constancy, became even more popular and loved by the audience.  The shooting took place on the Crimean peninsula and in Kiev.  The director of the film decided that the tape should be saturated with sea landscapes, so many scenes were shot at sea.  In the series there are many episodes on sailboats and a yacht, there are shootings.  The main action was the relationship of the heroes - all those feelings that they had for each other. </p>

    <p>  Actors “Get to know me if you can try to prepare for the work as best as possible.  Ivan Stebunov, who played Ilya Avdeev after plastic surgery, watched the series Ezel.  He wanted to catch the right mood and get the emotions he needed.  Irina Rozanova, who played the mother of Ilya, is blind in the plot of the film.  To start, we considered different options: glasses or plastic makeup.  But the actress refused and played herself, not hiding behind anything.  She decided to play with her eyes open, without dark glasses. </p><p>  It was rather unusual to see Yuri Stoyanov in the role of a seasoned criminal authority, to whose sweet and touching smile all the fans of Gorodok got used to.  But he was able to show an intelligent, solid, cunning man who, even doing a good deed for Elijah, looked far ahead. </p>
