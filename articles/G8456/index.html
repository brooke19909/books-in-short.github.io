And all because he is able to give even the simplest along with elegance and chic.  If the reader dreams of this thing, we offer a master class in knitting boleros with knitting needles.  Description and schemes, the choice of yarn and tools - all this and much more you will find in the article. </p><h2>  Yarn selection </h2><p>  Traditionally, too thick and stiff thread is not used for knitting the studied product.  Therefore, it is important to be very careful when choosing the right yarn.  Experienced knitters recommend first of all to consider acrylic, polyester, angora or mohair. </p><p>  For spring or summer, you can knit openwork bolero with knitting needles.  Then you need to purchase a thin yarn, for example, iris.  Color can be any.  However, the most interesting look is the bolero in the classic tone - black, gray, beige, brown.  Sometimes you can choose a brighter yarn - red, emerald, blue or one that is better than others suitable for a particular person. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.loveknitting.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bolero knitting scheme" class="if uuid-2978834" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2978834.jpg"></div><h2>  Tool selection </h2><p>  To get a good tool, professional knitters recommend focusing on the selected thread.  Therefore, it is more reasonable to buy material for knitting bolero with knitting needles first.  The diameter of the spokes and the thickness of the thread should match.  Only then will the implementation of the intended product bring pleasure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In addition, it is important to note that experts advise paying special attention to metal tools.  It‚Äôs more convenient to work with them.  However, before buying, they should be examined for defects, check the tips.  They should be well-turned. </p><h2>  Learning patterns </h2><p>  Experienced craftsmen, telling beginners about how to knit boleros with knitting needles, focus on choosing a pattern.  They recommend not using too large an ornament, avoiding large braids and plaits.  In addition, the conceived product is better to knit in a single pattern.  Then it will look really impressive. </p><p>  The most suitable pattern for a bolero are considered various gum options.  And you can also choose a pearl pattern, in which vertical and horizontal rows alternate along one front and back loop.  Two more simple and interesting patterns, which are also distinguished by experienced craftsmen, are the front surface and garter stitch.  In the first, the front rows are knitted with facial loops, and the wrong ones are the wrong ones.  In the second, only facial loops are knitted on both sides throughout the fabric. </p><div class="photo" data-original="" data-author=""><img itemprop="image" alt="we knit bolero with knitting needles" class="if uuid-2978830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2978830.jpg"></div><h2>  Model measurement </h2><p>  In order not to be mistaken with the size of the conceived product, it is necessary to take measurements from a beautiful person, on which bolero will be made with knitting needles.  A woman, girl or girl should undress to underwear.  Then with the help of a centimeter tape we measure the following parameters: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ul><li>  the estimated length of the product is from the base of the neck to the lower edge of the bolero; </li><li>  the length of the sleeve; </li><li>  product width - from the cuff of one sleeve to the other through the back; </li><li>  girth of the widest part of the arm. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bolero Knitting Patterns and Description" class="if uuid-2978839" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2978839.jpg"></div><h2>  Loop and Row Calculation Technologies </h2><p>  The parameters taken earlier will not help to connect the bolero at all.  And all because even to get a loop will succeed only with the third, and even with the fifth attempt.  Therefore, experienced masters recommend that you calculate the required units in advance: </p><ol><li>  To do this, we knit a sample of the selected pattern measuring 10x10 centimeters. </li><li>  We carefully consider the number of loops and rows in it. </li><li>  Divide the previously taken parameters by 10. </li><li>  Multiply the numbers obtained by dividing horizontal measures by the loops in the sample.  Vertical - in rows. </li><li>  If necessary, round off the totals.  And then we check with the selected pattern (scheme).  It will be possible to make boleros with knitting needles beautiful and neat only if the horizontal and vertical rapports are observed, that is, the pattern will not be interrupted. </li></ol><h2>  First option </h2><p>  To tie the bolero across, we draw on the knitting needles the number of loops equal to the widest part of the arm. </p><ol><li>  Having tied the sleeve, we subtract from the estimated length of the product the current number of loops.  Thus, we find out how many loops need to be added. </li><li>  We pass to the back and continue to knit the fabric, adding a new one after the first and before the last loop. </li><li>  When we add all the missing, we knit with an even cloth. </li><li>  Approaching the end of the part separated for the back, by the familiar technology, we begin to reduce the loops. </li><li>  Then we knit a sleeve of the desired length. </li><li>  We break off the thread and hide the tip from the wrong side. </li><li>  We take a hook and draw new loops around the circumference, distribute it to the circular knitting needles. </li><li>  We knit cuffs of the required length. </li><li>  And finally, we complete the work. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="knitted bolero for women" class="if uuid-2978842" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/66469/2978842.jpg"></div><h2>  Bolero like a regular jacket </h2><p>  To associate this variant of a product, it is necessary to measure: </p><ul><li>  product length; </li><li>  armhole height - from the lower edge to the armpit; </li><li>  neck width; </li><li>  sleeve length; </li><li>  chest circumference through the most convex points. </li></ul><p>  Then we start knitting bolero with knitting needles.  The algorithm of actions is as follows: </p><ol><li>  In this case, it is better to choose a lace pattern.  Because the finished product will be seamless. </li><li>  We collect on the knitting needles the number of loops equal to the circumference of the chest. </li><li>  We knit forward - back to the armhole. </li><li>  Separate the back and two front shelves.  Each part is completed separately. </li><li>  Sew the bolero along the shoulder seams. </li><li>  We collect new loops along the armhole line and knit the sleeves of the required length. </li></ol><p>  As you can see, the technology in both cases is simple and affordable even for beginners.  It is only necessary to have the desire to bring the idea to life. </p>
