  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase mobile Internet traffic: conditions and ways to increase</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  A few years ago, mobile operators could not offer their subscribers tariff plans with unlimited Internet access.  Today everything is changing.  Every year the number of favorable tariffs increases.  Among them, such tariff plans began to appear on which Internet access is not limited to any packages. </p><p>  However, not all people are interested in unlimited offers from mobile operators.  Many subscribers continue to use tariffs with limited gigabytes and megabytes and often wonder about how to increase mobile Internet traffic with the full exhaustion of the main package. </p><h2>  Beeline traffic extension </h2><p>  Beeline provides 2 options for renewing the Internet.  The list of services of a mobile operator has the option “Extend speed” with different traffic packets.  In Moscow, for example, you can connect 1 GB or 4 GB to your tariff.  Additional traffic is provided at the highest possible speed.  When this package ends, the service begins to be provided at a speed of 64 Kbps until the end of the billing period. </p><p>  Another way to increase traffic on Beeline is to enable the option "Auto-renew speed."  It is very convenient, since nothing needs to be done with it after the exhaustion of the main package.  Everything is automatically activated if there is a sufficient amount on the balance sheet.  Thanks to this option, subscribers are never left without the Internet. </p><p>  In Moscow and the Moscow Region, when you connect "Auto-Renew Speed", you can choose the most suitable package size: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><ol><li>  For 100 Mb.  This amount of traffic is suitable for subscribers who are not too actively using the global network.  At Beeline, you can increase <span>mobile Internet</span> traffic in this way for those who mostly correspond with friends on social networks and applications. </li><li>  5 GB.  This is a fairly voluminous package.  At the same time, it is very profitable.  An option for 100 MB in Moscow and the Moscow Region costs 100 rubles, and an option for 5 GB costs 150 rubles. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.redmadrobot.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="increase beeline traffic" class="if uuid-2659569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659569.jpg"></div><h2>  Connecting options from Beeline </h2><p>  Before you increase traffic, check the compatibility of the selected options with your tariff plan and connected services.  The option “Prolong speed" cannot be connected on such tariffs as "Internet for computer", "Internet for tablet", "Zero doubts", "Welcome".  The same list includes tariff plans of the “All” line, indicated by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. </p><p>  “Auto-renewal of 100 Mb speed” is available to you if one of the following tariff plans is connected on your phone - “All 1”, “All 2”, “ALL”, “Welcome”, “Zero doubts”, “All in one 1” , "All In One 2."  The option with auto-renewal speed of 5 GB has a different list of compatible tariffs.  It can be connected to “All in one 3”, “All in one 4”, “All in one 5”, “All 3”, “All 4”, “All 5”, “Internet for computer”, “Internet for tablet. " </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The teams allowing to increase traffic on Beeline, in Moscow and the Moscow Region, the following <sup>* are</sup> installed: </p><ul><li>  "Prolong the speed of 1 GB" - * 115 * 121 #; </li><li>  "Extend the speed of 4 GB" - * 115 * 122 #; </li><li>  "Auto-renewal speed of 100 MB" - * 115 * 23 #; </li><li>  "Auto-renewal speed of 5 GB" - * 115 * 23 #. </li></ul><p>  <sup>*</sup> <sub>In other regions, Internet traffic packages may vary in size, so it is recommended that you first check with the operator to connect them.</sub> </p><h2>  Options at MTS </h2><p>  The Mobile TeleSystems company offers its subscribers who are faced with Internet access restrictions to use the “+ Internet” service.  It is presented in several versions, differing in traffic packages and cost.  Here is a list of options that answer the question of how to increase traffic on MTS: </p><ul><li>  "+ 3 GB" for 300 rubles; </li><li>  "+ 5 GB" for 400 rubles; </li><li>  "+ 10 GB" for 500 rubles .; </li><li>  "+ 20 GB" for 600 rubles. </li></ul><p>  The listed options monthly increase the basic package of Internet traffic.  At the first connection, the subscription fee for the next 30 days is immediately deducted from the phone number.  After this period of time, the monthly fee starts to be charged daily.  On the first option, its size is 10 rubles, on the second - 13 rubles, on the third - 16 rubles, and on the last - 20 rubles. </p><p>  The “+ Internet” options are mutually exclusive with a wide range of services.  These include the following: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  "Internet VIP"; </li><li>  Internet Maxi </li><li>  Internet Mini; </li><li>  "Internet Super"; </li><li>  "BIT"; </li><li>  SuperBIT et al. </li></ul><p>  How can I increase traffic on MTS?  In addition to the “+ Internet” options, the mobile operator has another opportunity to extend access to the global network.  The corresponding service is called “Turbo-button”.  It exists in several versions: </p><ol><li>  For 100 Mb.  Connection cost - 30 rubles.  The duration is 24 hours. </li><li>  For 500 MB, as well as for 1, 2, 5 and 20 GB.  These options are similar in that they are activated for 30 days.  The difference between them is not only in the volume of traffic, but also in the cost, which is recommended to check with the operator for your region.  In Moscow, the cost is from 95 rubles.  up to 900 rub. </li><li>  Unlimited for 3 and 6 hours.  These "Turbo buttons" allow you to spend traffic unlimitedly for a specified period of time.  An option for 3 hours costs 95 rubles, and for 6 hours - 150 rubles. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="mts-help.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase traffic on mts" class="if uuid-2659584" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659584.jpg"></div><h2>  How to connect the MTS options </h2><p>  How to increase Internet traffic at MTS?  This can be done by connecting options through your account or using the provided commands: </p><ul><li>  “+ Internet” at 3 GB - * 111 * 1417 * 1 #; </li><li>  5 GB - * 111 * 1517 * 1 #; </li><li>  10 GB - * 111 * 1617 * 1 #; </li><li>  20 GB - * 111 * 1817 * 1 #; </li><li>  100 Mb Turbo Button - * 111 * 05 * 1 #; </li><li>  500 Mb - * 167 #; </li><li>  1 GB - * 467 #; </li><li>  2 GB - * 168 #; </li><li>  5 GB - * 169 #; </li><li>  20 GB - * 469 #; </li><li>  “Unlimited for 3 hours” - * 637 #; </li><li>  “Unlimited for 6 hours” - * 638 #. </li></ul><p>  You can also use the special application for smartphones “My MTS”.  This is a handy program.  With it, subscribers can not only manage their services, but also select and change the tariff, replenish the balance of a mobile phone, control costs, manage multiple numbers at the same time.  The interface is simple, and the application launches very quickly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pocketnow.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Commands for Renewing Internet Access" class="if uuid-2659635" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659635.jpg"></div><h2>  Services "Tele2" </h2><p>  Beeline and MTS are very popular operators, but at the same time a considerable number of people choose Tele2.  Subscribers of this company are often interested in how to increase traffic.  On Tele2, an extension of Internet access is possible by connecting options either for a month or until the end of the day.  In services designed for a month, as a rule, a rather voluminous packet of traffic is offered.  In Moscow and the Moscow region, subscribers can connect packages of 5 and 3 GB.  In other regions of Russia, conditions may be different.  In the Altai Territory, for example, not too voluminous options are available - only 2 GB and 500 MB. </p><p>  Options until the end of the day include small packets of Internet traffic.  In Moscow and the Moscow Region, subscribers activate 500 and 100 Mb.  Such packages are most convenient when there are only a few days left before updating the conditions of the main tariff.  If it is still very far from the start of the new billing period, it is recommended that you opt for options that are calculated for a month.  You can completely disable the tariff plan with the main package of Internet traffic and reconnect it. </p><p>  Those subscribers who did not set up their tariff plan and did not turn off additional services may not even think about how to increase traffic.  On tariff plans and Internet options, automatic renewal of access is provided.  After the exhaustion of the main traffic to the tariff plan, additional packages begin to connect.  Before automatic renewal, subscribers are usually notified via SMS that they will be connected with an additional package after a while.  To save money on the account, the option with automatic renewal can be disabled and activated at any convenient time in the future. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ksonline.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to increase traffic on tel2" class="if uuid-2659579" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659579.jpg"></div><h2>  Connection methods on Tele2 and some nuances </h2><p>  Options on Tele2 are connected in the same ways as other mobile operators.  It is very convenient to activate services in your account, because if necessary, you can compare different options, read the detailed conditions. </p><p>  When there is no access to the Internet and your personal account, the question of how to increase the amount of traffic becomes even more relevant.  Connection can be made thanks to the commands.  It is recommended to find out the command in advance and put it in the phone book, so that in the future this combination of numbers does not need to be searched.  Each service has its own team. </p><p>  If you first decided to use any option, be sure to check the combination of numbers on the official website of the mobile operator and read the conditions.  The fact is that each region has its own rules.  Here's an example of some of the differences you may encounter: </p><ol><li>  One of the services, united by the name “Add Traffic”, is connected using the command * 155 * 231 #.  After sending this combination of numbers, Moscow and Moscow region subscribers receive a package with 5 GB of additional Internet for 30 days.  The amount of 250 rubles is debited from the balance. </li><li>  With the introduction of a similar command, Altai Territory subscribers receive a 2 GB packet.  The connection charge is 200 rubles. </li></ol><h2>  What does Megaphone offer? </h2><p>  At Megafon, options that extend Internet access are provided for different devices - for smartphones, tablets and modems.  Subscribers can activate “Prolong Internet XS”.  This service is designed to connect a minimum package of additional traffic.  It provides only a few tens of megabytes.  The cost depends on the region.  Traffic by option is provided in two versions (depending on the region) - either until the end of the day, or during the billing period of the original option (tariff plan).  Service activation is possible an unlimited number of times. </p><p>  Another answer to the question of how to increase Internet traffic on Megafon is connecting the option “Extend Internet 1 GB”.  It was created for a number of Internet options from the Internet line (S, M, L, XL).  It also acts on some other options and tariffs.  You can find out about the compatibility of the “Extended Internet 1 GB” service with other tariff plans on the official website of the mobile operator in your personal account. </p><p>  The third option created by the mobile operator is “Prolong 5Gb Internet”.  This and previous services are provided during the billing period of the original option or tariff plan.  For the new period, the residues are not transferred.  They just burn out. </p><div class="photo" data-original="energysmi.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to extend the Internet at &quot;Megaphone&quot;" class="if uuid-2659586" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659586.jpg"></div><h2>  Connecting options on the "Megaphone" </h2><p>  For independent connection of options it is best to use your personal account.  There you can see whether the selected service is available for activation.  You can also contact any nearby MegaFon communication salon.  Describe your problem to employees.  They will recommend the most suitable options for you, quickly connect the selected service, explain all the conditions and nuances. </p><p>  Megafon, like other mobile operators (MTS, Tele2, Beeline), can increase mobile Internet traffic using the following commands: </p><ul><li>  to connect the option “Extend Internet XS” send a short command * 372 #; </li><li>  if you need to activate the service “Prolong 1 GB Internet”, dial * 370 * 1 * 1 # on the phone; </li><li>  in order to activate the largest packet of Internet traffic (5 GB), send the combination * 370 * 2 * 1 #. </li></ul><h2>  Operator MOTIV </h2><p>  Few people know about the existence of such a mobile operator as MOTIV.  It works only in 4 regions of our country - in the Sverdlovsk, Kurgan regions and in the Yamalo-Nenets, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Districts.  Almost all tariff plans of this operator have Internet packages.  When used up, the speed drops to 64 Kbps.  To restore it, the operator’s list of services includes a “Turbo-button”.  It is valid only 24 hours, but it provides Internet traffic without bandwidth limit.  The cost of activating the “Turbo Button” is 60 rubles. </p><p>  For those who do not know how to increase the speed of traffic, here are a few ways: </p><ol><li>  Using the command * 114 * 151 * 1 #.  Upon successful connection, a corresponding notification appears on the display of the mobile phone. </li><li>  With the help of SMS service.  Create a message by writing the number “1” in it and send it to number 1005. </li><li>  At the service office or through the contact center.  Employees of the company can help connect the “Turbo-button”.  When contacting you will need to provide a phone number, contract number, personal account number, passport details, code word. </li><li>  Through the IVR service.  Dial ## 914 and press the call key.  You will hear a greeting from the autoinformer, which will inform you that you are in the Service Management service.  Then dial 1 # to go to the service order section and 150 # to activate the “Turbo buttons” directly. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Services of the company &quot;Motive&quot;" class="if uuid-2659588" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659588.jpg"></div><h2>  Operator "Iota" </h2><p>  Not all people opt for well-known operators.  Some choose "Iota."  This mobile operator offers quite favorable tariff packages in order to attract subscribers.  For those cases when the traffic ends, the company did not provide for full access blocking, but a speed limit of up to 64 Kbps. </p><p>  In order to continue to use the Internet normally, the operator advises connecting the “5 GB” option, valid until the end of the billing period.  You can do this in your account. </p><h2>  Low traffic savings </h2><p>  Fast traffic consumption is one of the most pressing problems for Internet users.  It is solvable thanks to the services and options of mobile operators, but I don’t really want to spend additional amounts to connect packages with megabytes or gigabytes.  For this reason, it is recommended to <span>save traffic.</span>  In modern browsers, there are special functions and applications for this, which both speed up loading and compress content.  Thanks to the use of these functionalities, you can rarely think about how to increase the speed and traffic on Beeline or any other operator. </p><p>  A certain part of the traffic is spent on displaying to users of commercials, banners, which are full of sites.  In order to save money, connect special programs that block such content.  You can find them in browsers.  They are called extensions.  Browsers support them for the reason that they help to expand the functionality and meet the needs and requests of users. </p><p>  A significant part of the traffic can be spent due to the automatic playback of videos, GIF-animations on social networks.  For example, users of VKontakte are faced with a similar problem.  Spending traffic in this direction can be avoided.  In the settings of this social network, disabling automatic playback of such content is provided. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.itadidasol.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Ways to save traffic" class="if uuid-2659610" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/40126/2659610.jpg"></div><p>  If you are thinking about how to increase mobile Internet traffic, then first read the terms of the tariff plan.  Some operators provide for the exchange of minutes and SMS messages.  If you have extra packages with minutes or messages on the tariff, exchange them.  In return, you will receive a small packet with Internet traffic.  It is possible that he will save you from the need to connect any additional paid option or service to extend access to the global network. </p>
