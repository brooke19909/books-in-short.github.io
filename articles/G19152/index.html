  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What heating radiators are best used for gas and solid fuel heating methods?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When installing a water heating system, great attention should be paid to the choice of heating radiators, since they play a significant role in heat transfer, as well as maintaining a given temperature in the room.  The type of your heating is also important here, since the choice of the material from which it will be most rational for you to mount the heating system depends on it. </p><p>  When answering the question which <span>heating radiators are</span> better, it will be difficult to answer.  The fact is that every metal or alloy from which sections of modern radiators are made has its own advantages and disadvantages.  However, in some cases, the disadvantages of one material may be an advantage in another, with different types of heating. </p><p>  If you live in an apartment with central heating, then cast-iron radiators are traditionally used here, which have been successfully installed for more than a dozen years and have proven themselves on a very good side.  Cast iron has a high heat capacity, which allows it to warm the room well enough, and the temperature of the coolant can reach 90 degrees, which is completely safe for it.  Therefore, in central heating systems, when answering the question of which radiators are better, we can safely say that they are cast iron.  The only drawback of such batteries is their obsolescence and inconvenience in maintenance if you use the old type of cast-iron radiators.  Today, there are also modern cast-iron heating systems that are distinguished by good design and modern style.  The only heavy weight of this metal makes its installation a rather laborious and expensive process.  In all other respects, it is a wonderful radiator that will serve you faithful and long service.  Remember also that cast iron has good resistance to corrosion processes, and is not afraid of aggressive substances that may be present in the liquid coolant. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Which heating radiators heat the room better and more efficiently when using a solid fuel boiler?  This is also a rather serious question that can only be answered by one who understands the properties of the material used and the principle of heating with different types of fuel.  In the case of using coal and firewood as fuel, the heating process will be lengthy.  For high-quality heating of such a room, you can use steel and <span>aluminum radiators,</span> which immediately begin to transfer heat to the room, since this metal quickly heats up.  However, this can also serve as some disadvantage, since after the boiler attenuates and the heating of the water ceases, such radiators cool down quickly and the heat disappears.  What radiator stove is better to use in this case in order to keep the heat as long as possible in your room?  To do this, you should return to cast iron again, since it continues to radiate heat as long as possible even after the boiler with coal and firewood has long gone out.  In houses with conventional <span>solid fuel boilers,</span> this is the only right option in order to eliminate the need to get up at 3-4 a.m. and put another batch of firewood into such a boiler.  With good cast-iron radiators, you can be sure that with a good warm-up they will keep heat well until morning. </p><p>  But <span>which heating radiators are better to</span> use in the case of autonomous <span>gas heating.</span>  Here it is most rational to use just aluminum batteries, since they are most fully suitable for this type of heating in their technical characteristics.  It is with such radiators that the possibilities of automatically maintaining a given coolant temperature will be realized as efficiently as possible. </p><p>  Each owner, in the end, decides for himself which heating radiators are best suited in his house.  The main thing to remember is that cast iron remains the most rational solution in houses with solid fuel boilers, and with autonomous gas heating, steel or aluminum batteries will be the most suitable option. </p>
