Well, what a vacation can be without entertainment.  That is why there are water parks on the island of Tenerife, and they are all diverse.  By the way, here is located the largest of those available in Europe.  This article will talk about what water parks are in Tenerife, where you can have fun and enjoy your vacation with your whole family. </p><h2>  History of Siam Park </h2><p>  Just looking at the photo of the Siam water park in Tenerife, you can feel the beauty of this place.  At the moment it is the largest of all water parks that only exist in Europe, in addition, it is among the ten most beloved children's places of entertainment around the world.  It was built relatively recently (construction began in 2004) by the Kisling family, which also owns the famous Loro Park. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.isango.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Waterpark Siam" class="if uuid-2867507" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867507.jpg"></div><p>  Before its creators decided to start designing a new vacation spot, they visited about fifty of the most famous water parks around the world in order to fully adopt the design and experience of already successful projects.  In total, the construction cost 52 million euros, but each coin was worth it, because just looking at the photo of the Siam Park water park in Tenerife, you seem to plunge into the atmosphere of fun. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Architecture </h2><p>  Of particular note is the way the Siam water park was built in Tenerife.  In total, it spreads over an area of ‚Äã‚Äã185 square kilometers, where most of the buildings are made in the style of Southeast Asia, namely Thailand.  Now its territory is more reminiscent of a certain full-fledged separate country, which has its own tourist infrastructure, ponds, interesting underwater inhabitants and much more.  You can really wander around it all day and still not inspect. </p><p>  As already mentioned, the culture of Thailand was taken as the basis of the Siam water park in Tenerife, so that all the designs were designed to immerse visitors in the history of the ancient and beautiful city of Siam.  In addition to the slides, there is its own small floating market, dragon statues, restaurants with traditional cuisine and much more.  By the way, when the park was first opened in 2008, the royal family of Thailand was present at its opening, which gave permission to use the word "Siam" in the name. </p><h2>  The most famous attractions </h2><p>  As you know, the most popular places in the water park in Tenerife "Siam Park" are its water slides.  In total, more than 25 descents are presented here, which fill the blood of visitors with adrenaline and allow you to have fun from the heart.  In addition, the water temperature is constantly artificially maintained at 25 degrees, so visitors feel quite comfortable, because there are no special thermal differences.  This also helps in cases where the weather on the island is unstable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This water park in Tenerife is designed for families, so people of any age can visit it, and they will certainly find an interesting pastime for themselves.  You just need to take into account that many slides, especially extreme ones, have age restrictions, and therefore it is better for small children to stay in children's pools and small but safe attractions. </p><h2>  Hill "Giant" </h2><p>  One of the most interesting slides of this water park in Tenerife is undoubtedly the Giant.  In itself, it is shaped like the head of a Thai deity, from which two large pipes depart.  It is both an open and closed attraction, which is built in the form of a funnel.  At the very end, the visitor is simply thrown at great speed into the large pool, but since you can ride it only on a special bun, the visitor does not get any pain. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thingstodoontenerife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Power tower" class="if uuid-2867503" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867503.jpg"></div><h2>  "Tower of Power" </h2><p>  This attraction is a unique analogue of the Kamikaze hill in the Tenerife water park.  Its height is more than thirty meters, and it consists immediately of several pipes, which are located almost vertically.  To even climb on it, you need a lot of courage, because adrenaline when flying down from almost a height of ten floors will be generated in huge quantities.  The peculiarity of this slide is that it first starts in a closed pipe, which then changes to an aquarium with fish and sharks, which you can try to admire.  True, at such a tremendous speed it is hardly possible to enjoy the beauties, but it's still worth a try. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.huffingtonpost.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hill of Kinnaria" class="if uuid-2867509" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867509.jpg"></div><h2>  Kinnaria </h2><p>  For those who in life love to ride at tremendous speed along steep turns, you should definitely visit the Kinnaria slide.  This is where you really have to scream very loudly, because throwing from side to side will be at gigantic speed.  In addition, it will always seem that it will be possible to simply fall out of an open slide after a new bend. </p><h2>  "The Dragon" </h2><p>  If you have nerves of steel, then be sure to at least once go down the "Dragon" hill.  This attraction is called the most extreme in the park.  Just imagine how you are thrown out of a closed pipe at an incredible speed into a huge inclined funnel in which it starts to wind in all directions.  It will be incredibly difficult to keep from screaming, but there will be enough impressions for a very long time.  By the way, even experienced extreme lovers almost never dare to re-launch right away. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thingstodoontenerife.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dragon Hill" class="if uuid-2867505" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867505.jpg"></div><h2>  "Quick descent" </h2><p>  Although there are not many water slides for the family in the park, they are nevertheless available.  One of the most popular is "Quick Descent", which is designed immediately for a group of people.  Just imagine a trip down one of the six lanes with your head down a stepped hill - you can definitely get a lot of emotions here.  In addition, during the descent it will be possible to talk with nearby family members. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.attraction-tickets-direct.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Quick descent" class="if uuid-2867495" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867495.jpg"></div><h2>  "Palace of the waves" </h2><p>  But besides the slides in the Siam Park there are other types of entertainment.  One of them is the beautiful "Palace of the Waves", which is a huge pool, near which an artificial beach is made.  Even the waves were specially imitated here, so you can even try surfing if you wish.  After the slides, this pool is the most wonderful place to relax, because if you wish you can swing on the waves and simply sunbathe. </p><h2>  "Lazy river" </h2><p>  Well, when the extreme is already completely tired, and you want to relax and be too lazy, you should go to the "Lazy River".  It passes through the entire park, so, slowly floating on a rubber circle, you can enjoy all the beauty and attractions of the park, its beaches, vegetation and even waterfalls.  It will be interesting not only for children, but also for their parents, so you should take some time and simply enjoy the world around you. </p><h2>  "The Lost City" </h2><p>  This attraction was made specifically for children.  This children's town is built so that the child can play enough.  The downside of this place is that you will have to look after it yourself, so parents at this time can be quite bored.  There are several small slides on which kids will safely descend, and the city is filled with various riddles that will be interesting to solve in order to find out all its secrets. </p><h2>  "Volcano" </h2><p>  As you know, in Tenerife is located the active volcano Teide.  However, the last time he erupted in reality in 1909, but on the Volcano show you can admire groups of six people to imitate this magnificent natural phenomenon, which is constructed using water and lasers. </p><h2>  Rafting </h2><p>  Surprisingly, for lovers of rafting, there is also something to do here.  There is one amazingly long attraction in the park called the Mekong River.  This hill surprisingly imitates a real river with various rapids, bends and even obstacles that add credibility to it.  In general, the final result is fully consistent with the real river, so it‚Äôs not even clear whether rafting takes place in an artificial slide. </p><h2>  Subscription cost and time </h2><p>  Those who want to relax in this water park will have to pay a lot, but in general the price is really worth it, because it is built really high quality.  By the way, for the fifth year in a row he has been considered the best in the world, so if you want to feel extreme, then you should choose "Siam".  So, an adult ticket will cost 37 euros in 2018, and 25 euros for a child under 11 years old. </p><p>  This park operates on two types of schedules - summer and winter.  In the summer period, which lasts from the beginning of May to the end of October, the park is open from 10:00 to 18:00, and in the winter - until 17:00. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Aqua Roller Coaster" class="if uuid-2867511" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867511.jpg"></div><h2>  Aqualand Waterpark in Tenerife </h2><p>  There is no doubt that Siam Park is truly magnificent, but it is rather inconvenient to go there with small children, since most places are designed for adults, and childcare services are not provided.  For such people, the best option would be to go to a completely different park.  So, let's now consider the Aqualand water park in Tenerife.  In general, he really does not reach Siam, but by Russian standards it is a good enough place to relax.  It was built back in 1975, so you will not find particularly extreme slides here, but there are plenty of children‚Äôs.  Yes, they are already a little outdated, but travelers with children here still have something to do. </p><h2>  Dolphin show </h2><p>  Those who decided to go to this particular water park in Tenerife should definitely see its main attraction.  Surprisingly, this is not a roller coaster at all, but the island‚Äôs best dolphin show.  It does not last long, about half an hour every day at 15:30, but a visit will bring a lot of emotions.  By the way, this performance is far ahead of the famous show in the "Logo Park" and is among the best in the world.  If you wish, for extra money you can swim with dolphins or just play with them, so the children will really like this entertainment. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.advartis.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Dolphin show" class="if uuid-2867510" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/46104/2867510.jpg"></div><h2>  Price and opening hours </h2><p>  I must admit that this water park is also not cheap, although it is older.  A ticket for adults will officially cost 28 euros, it should be bought even for children over 11 years old.  The ticket price for a child from 5 to 10 years old will be 20 euros, but for kids - eleven and a half euros.  But for this price you can fully ride on any roller coaster and look at dolphins. </p><p>  This park operates all year round, and in season, that is, in July and August from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  In all other months it closes at 17:00.  Please note that water attractions always stop working half an hour before the park closes. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Water parks on the island of Tenerife, judging by the reviews, are one of the best in the world.  Yes, now Siam Park is universally recognized as the best, and therefore attracts a greater number of visitors, but Aqualand also tries not to be inferior to it.  In general, they simply tried to divide their consumer audience by choosing different directions.  But each of them is beautiful in its own way, so it‚Äôs simply worth choosing whether you want extreme sports or family vacations, and then choosing the most optimal option for yourself, because finding what to do in each of them is quite simple. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  So, as you can understand, water parks in Tenerife really exist, and not even one.  Of course, the first place for several years has been occupied precisely by Siam Park, in which there are many extreme slides and other interesting places.  Yes, indeed, less than 30 slides seem relatively small for a park that spans more than 150 square kilometers, but its founders initially focused on quality, not quantity at all.  Here, every centimeter was well thought out, so you should not be afraid at all, because safety is at its best.  The only negative is that there are a lot of people here during the tourist season, so you have to wait your turn for the descent. </p><p>  Well, for family relaxing entertainment, there is Aqualand, which is designed for an audience that does not require extreme sports, but simply wants to have a good time.  Looking at any photos from Tenerife water parks, it becomes clear that, having been to the Canary Islands, you should definitely go here at least once in order to enjoy a good rest and get a lot of impressions that will remain for many years. </p>
