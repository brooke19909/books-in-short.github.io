Already more and more devices are appearing with a location function.  Even with the fact that they have an increased cost, such devices are in maximum demand.  Moreover, this feature is in no way associated with the appearance of such a module, since it was used earlier.  Due to it, it becomes possible to maximize the desired effect and result from the radar.  What is meant?  Due to the location recognition function, you can quickly and in a minimum time find out where the cameras are located stationary, the layout of which has long been known.  Moreover, conventional detectors constantly make a sound, ‚Äúthinking‚Äù that various dangers are located near the machine.  This is due to the large number of magnetic disks, walkie-talkies, and other radars that provoke a trip.  That is why drivers previously had to turn off their device and focus on the camera database and location transmitter. </p><p>  Now on the market there are a large number of well-known radar detectors, but one of the most popular among competitors is SUPRA DRS-iG68VST.  Reviews about him in most cases are good (more on this below).  The average cost is 5500 rubles.  It can not be called too low, but for active drivers the price will quickly pay off. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  This manufacturer supplies the market with an extensive range of such devices.  However, it should be distinguished from it a good and expensive model among the entire line - DRS-iG68VST.  Due to the high cost, the device should have an excellent appearance.  In this regard, the device did not fail.  The first impression of the radar may not be entirely positive - it looks like a bar.  However, the assembly used high-quality plastic, which has a glossy surface.  Due to this, it may seem that the device is quite expensive.  At the corners there is a chrome strip that adds solidity. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra drs ig68vst" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1673512.jpg" width="579"></div>

It is divided into two types of installation.  They are both traditional.  One involves the use of a suction cup on the windshield, and the second - a sticky rug, which is placed on the dashboard.  According to consumer reviews, sometimes the SUPRA DRS-iG68VST radar (a review of the device will help determine the purchase) fell with both types of mounts.  In the event that the device is constantly in the car, it is best to choose a mat, and if the driver needs to take it home, the suction cup will ideally show itself.  The radar received a special fastener that allows you to not peel off the entire structure from the glass. </p><p>  What else is included with the SUPRA DRS-iG68VST?  Instruction, staff cord for charging.  The latter has an impressive size, so the driver does not have to think about placing the device.  Charging is carried out from the cigarette lighter.  Consumers do not complain about this aspect.  Therefore, we can say with confidence - no complaints arise. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra drs ig68vst reviews" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1673513.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Device features </h2><p>  Since the design of the SUPRA DRS-iG68VST has a pretty decent look, the device is not fully assembled ergonomically and conveniently.  Due to the fact that the body is glossy, it is strongly reflected on the windshield.  Unfortunately, this effect is present in any lighting, so the consumer can only come to terms with it. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The device differs from its competitors in that it has a display on the rear side, which faces the driver.  Basically, the screen is placed on the front of the structure.  Often, radars are created in such a way that the consumer, when using, has to hang it quite low and constantly look at the upper part of the case in order to fully operate the device.  SUPRA DRS-iG68VST, which is configured quite easily, does not have such problems.  However, the control buttons are located exactly there, so there is some discomfort. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra drs ig68vst review" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1673514.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Description of details </h2><p>  The device screen is good.  It is clear and contrasting, therefore it is of excellent quality.  The location detection module is Chinese, but it works stably and without failures. </p><p>  The device is made using such technology that the radar is able to clearly and quickly recognize existing cameras and not only. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra drs ig68vst customization" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1673515.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Functions </h2><p>  Before you start using the SUPRA DRS-iG68VST radar, you need to understand in which modes it works.  By default, which means the main one, is Smart.  It is not considered a separate and independent regime.  Its task is to automatically select the necessary. </p><p>  What affects switching?  The higher the speed of the car, the better the sensitivity of the radar.  According to consumer reviews, the maximum mode always allows you to 100% detect ambushes from the traffic police.  The manufacturer also promises that there are practically no false positives, although there are some complaints about this nuance. </p><p>  There are several modes of operation. </p><ul><li>  <em>Track.</em>  When working in this mode, the SUPRA DRS-iG68VST radar operates at the maximum level, respectively, quite a lot of false positives are noted. </li><li>  <em>City 1.</em> Automatically selected.  It has a fixed speed, it is impossible to change it. </li><li>  <em>City 2.</em> Automatically selected.  It warns only about cameras, while there are a lot of false positives. </li><li>  <em>City 3.</em> Selected manually.  According to consumer reviews, it must be said that this mode is considered the most popular among Moscow residents.  It recognizes all cameras, radars and Arrows.  In general, this is not all the device‚Äôs functionality, but there are no more ‚Äúdangers‚Äù in the capital, so this is not a minus.  Moreover, there are practically no false positives. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="supra drs ig68vst protein reviews" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31247/1673516.jpg" width="600"></div></li></ul><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  The SUPRA DRS-iG68VST is equipped with a GPS system.  It is necessary in order to improve the device and make it more modern.  The described device is popular with consumers because it has an impressive database of cameras and a location sensor.  The device is able to adapt to working conditions.  It also warns about all available cameras in advance. </p><p>  Experts note only one drawback - a lot of false positives.  However, professionals specify that it is better to play it safe than to skip.  According to experts, some nuances of design can scare away the consumer.  For example, the case is a little shiny, the mounts are too weak.  Moreover, the price may seem high.  But I must say that the SUPRA DRS-iG68VST Belka device, whose reviews are excellent, copes well with its direct duties and quickly recognizes the "shelters" of road patrols. </p>
