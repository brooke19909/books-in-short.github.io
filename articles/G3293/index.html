  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a rosary from improvised materials</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Before you start making rosaries, first decide what you will use them for.  If for reading prayers, meditation and other religious rituals, then your attribute should have the appropriate number of beads.  For Buddhism, this number is 18, 21, 27, 54 or 108, for Hinduism - 50, 54, 108, for Islam - 11, 33, 99 plus a weight, for Catholicism - 50 divided by five dozen, for Orthodoxy - 33, 103 or a multiple of 12 or 10, for the Old Believers - 109. </p><p>  In the event that the rosary will not be related to religion, but become only a calming attribute in your life, then the number of beads does not matter at all. </p><p>  For example, in the thieves 'world it is customary to have the so-called <span>loose</span> - <span>leaf beads,</span> which, according to the thieves' legends, helped pickpockets to train sleight of hand. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a rosary</strong> : we <strong>determine the material for manufacturing</strong> </p><p>  Rosary can be made from completely different materials.  The easiest way is to go to the nearest store selling all kinds of jewelry and buy some beads or a bracelet.  At home, you simply disassemble the product into its constituent elements (beads), in which holes have already been drilled, and string them on a fishing line or strong thread as you need. </p><p>  You can don‚Äôt buy jewelry, but donate old grandmothers or even your own beads that you don‚Äôt wear for the rosary. </p><p>  <strong>How to make rosary from bread</strong> </p><p>  Bread, or rather, its crumb, is a popular "building" material among prisoners.  Various crafts are made from it: dominoes, <span>chess pieces,</span> ashtrays, as well as beads for beads. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The crumb of low-quality <span>wheat</span> or rye <span>bread</span> should be kneaded in the hands until it becomes plastic, like plasticine (this takes about two hours of continuous work).  So that after drying the bread products do not crack, sugar should be added to the crumb initially.  Moreover, the better the bread, the more sweet sand you need to add.  Then beads or plates are molded from the plastic crumb.  If desired, you can add dye to the bread.  For example, if you want to get black rosaries, use ashes from burnt paper, and for colored rosaries you should add ink extracted from the rods of ballpoint or <span>gel pens.</span> </p><p>  In addition to the method described above, inventive prisoners make magnificent rosary beads from molten plastic parts of ballpoint pens and disposable <span>razors,</span> hard rubber and even from instant noodle packages such as Doshirak and Rollton. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a Plexiglas rosary</strong> </p><p>  At the construction market, buy Plexiglas (about 90 to 90 mm in size and 5 to 10 mm thick).  Then determine what size and shape you want the beads on your rosary (you can see photos of finished products on the Internet and choose what you like).  Then we transfer the sketch to the sheet in the box at the required scale.  Now we take a ruler, plexiglass and that sharp instrument with which you will begin to draw contours from it from a sketch on it.  Care should be taken as plexiglass is very easy to scratch. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Take a file for metal and start cutting elements carefully, taking care not to leave the marking.  Now you need to grind and polish each bead.  For grinding use sandpaper.  Start with 240 grains and finish the 1000 process. Next, use a piece of genuine leather to polish.  When your beads become smooth, beautiful and shiny, drill holes in them into which the thread will go. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a rosary classic</strong> </p><p>  Prepare the required number of beads of the same size and color and one larger bead (it may even have a different shape or even not have the shape of a ball).  All beads, except the main one, should be strung on a thread or fishing line.  For durability, tie a knot after each bead put on.  Now thread both ends of the thread into a large bead, tie two or three knots and cut the ends with scissors (you can even melt them).  Rosaries can be decorated with a brush if desired.  To do this, assemble a bundle of threads and insert it before tying the knot.  Make another fixing knot, straighten the brush and trim with the scissors of its edge. </p><p>  <strong>How to make a rosary loose-leaf</strong> <strong><br></strong> </p><p>  Flip rosary is an open loop in the form of a flat ribbon from rectangular or cross-shaped plates dialed onto a thread.  In order to make such an attribute, take two threads and tie at one end.  Then string the plates (in each for this you need to do two pairs of holes).  The plates can be alternated with bead balls. </p>
