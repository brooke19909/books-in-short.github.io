Many are interested in the question: ‚ÄúWhy does it happen that they cost much more?‚Äù  The rarity of such copies is that in certain years their circulation was minimal, and the price of them increased sharply because of this.  So, you need to understand what rare coins of modern Russia are.  The list of them is growing every year, and the price rises higher and higher.  Currently, Sberbank of Russia is considering coins of 2001 and 2003, this option is very profitable when investing its assets by buying money from the entire population. </p><h2>  What is collecting? </h2><p>  Collecting coins is a very exciting activity that can interest anyone.  Over time, their value increases, especially if they are rare.  In order to start collecting, you must first find rare coins, but this is not so simple.  For example, going through your wallet, certainly not everyone will be able to find at least one such instance. </p>

    <p>  The collection of money found should be stored very carefully, that is, you need to purchase a special album with plastic sheets, which are divided into pockets.  This is done so that the coins do not touch each other and are not rubbed.  With the help of transparent sheets, the collection will be viewed very easily, and it can also be shown to friends without having to remove the coins once again. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Coins in the album must be accompanied by information, the following data must be indicated there: </p><ol><li>  A type. </li><li>  Sizes. </li><li>  Design parties. </li><li>  Mint. </li><li>  Year of coinage. </li><li>  Alloy. </li></ol><h2>  Materials needed by collectors </h2><p>  Many collectors consider numismatics not just a hobby, but an investment.  Currently, <span>coins are minted</span> not from <span>precious metals,</span> as before, but from cheap alloys.  Before you start making your own collection album, you should get the following materials: </p><ol><li>  Felt tablecloth - it is needed in order to lay out coins on the table. </li><li>  Tweezers with rubber tips - you will need it for the accurate handling of valuable items. </li><li>  A bright lamp with white light - it will allow you to consider everything to the smallest detail. </li><li>  Album for coins - about it was written a little higher. </li><li>  Cotton gloves are pure white. </li><li>  Two loops are needed in order to carefully consider everything. </li><li>  Card catalog - it can be maintained simply in an Excel document, this is necessary in order to keep track of all its valuable copies. </li><li>  Several transparent cases - needed for transporting coins. </li></ol>

In 2001, the minimum circulation was issued for copies of 50 kopecks, one and two rubles, they were produced in literally several pieces.  The price of one such coin is not less than 300,000 rubles.  Obtaining them in the delivery is quite difficult - it is almost impossible.  It is for this reason that this year's coins are now rare, and the price of them is becoming even higher every day. </p><p>  Because of such a high cost, you can ‚Äúrun into‚Äù scammers and counterfeiters, which is why, when collecting coins, you should be extremely careful.  In order not to fall into the trap of scammers, when buying, you need to carefully check them for authenticity with specialists. </p>

    <p>  Rare coins in most cases can only be seen at special numismatic auctions.  But you need to remember that everyone has the hope that everyone can be theoretically lucky, and someone will accidentally get such a valuable copy in the sale, by selling which you can become rich. </p><h2>  Unique coins of 2003 </h2><p>  In 2003, very few coins were issued in one ruble, two and five.  The price for them, of course, is less than in 2001, about 10,000 rubles, or a little more.  In 2003, coins were issued in a total circulation of 15,000 pieces throughout the country, which is why they become a rarity. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In 2003, several coins were made without the logo of the <span>mint of the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãof St. Petersburg.  This fact increases their cost.  The purchase and sale of such coins is a matter of profit for fraudsters who lure real rarities from the population. </p><h2>  Unique coins of 2011 </h2><p>  Currently, the most popular copies are those that were released in 2011.  If we consider the rare coins of modern Russia, the list of 2011 has not yet been compiled, because their types are not yet sufficiently studied and it is not known whether they will ever be collectible or not.  But collectors are now interested in the future fate of coins issued in 2011. </p>

    <p>  There is a high probability that in 5 years the cost of coins in <span>2011</span> will become much higher.  But only time can show it.  Currently, of course, there are some exceptions - the price is a bit higher.  First of all, such exceptions are marriage - they do not have mint marks, deviations from the norm or stamp shifts.  For example, a coin that has two eagles costs about 250 thousand rubles.  In the same year, valuable copies were issued with a face value of 25 rubles, but they did not get into use, since they were bought up by collectors.  Thus, rare coins of modern Russia, a list with a photo of 2011 will appear a little later, while there is no data about them. </p><h2>  Unique coins of 2012 </h2><p>  In 2012, a large circulation of ten-ruble coins was issued, as well as anniversary and commemorative ones.  Currently, it is not yet known what price will be on 2012 coins.  To date, for copies of this year, the cost is approximately equal to the face value.  It is possible that soon collectors will be able to collect rare coins of modern Russia.  The 2012 list has not yet been compiled, because at that time very few memorable and anniversary copies were issued. </p><h2>  Unique coins - 10 kopecks </h2><p>  Collectors currently really appreciate the rare coins of modern Russia (a list of 10 kopecks, for example), because for many types in numismatic catalogs the price is quite high.  One of the varieties in St. Petersburg costs 2 thousand rubles. </p>

    <p>  In decimal coins, the most valuable is the reverse, that is, the reverse side.  It depicts George the Victorious, but if you take a closer look, you can see that there are folds on the cloak.  Almost all of these coins are made with horizontal folds on a cloak fluttering in the wind.  A valuable instance will have vertical folds, it costs about 2 thousand rubles, no less. </p><p>  It is still unknown how such coins appeared.  Currently, there are completely different versions, ranging from faulty equipment to conspiracy theory. </p><h2>  Rare coins of modern Russia, 2014 list </h2><p>  In 2014, 87 commemorative coins appeared, which greatly pleased collectors.  A detailed study of the rare coins of modern Russia (2014 list) will seem special, because some of them are made of precious metals, for example, of 999 gold. </p>
