They consist in obtaining a temporary residence permit and residence permit.  This requires finding a suitable place where a person can be registered.  After receiving a PRT, registration is a mandatory process.  For this, a foreigner can purchase housing, as well as register with relatives or friends.  Only with a residence permit can a person continue to legally live and work on the territory of the Russian Federation, use various services and get a formal job. </p><h2>  basic information </h2><p>  Every foreigner arriving in Russia must take into account some rules governing the legality of his presence on the territory of the Russian Federation.  Initially, he must obtain a temporary residence permit, and after that it is necessary to register in some residential premises located on the territory of Russia. </p><p>  The features of this process include the following: </p><ul><li>  the first stage of obtaining Russian citizenship is obtaining a RVP, and after that you need to register in the housing where the foreigner lives, and this process is carried out within 7 days; </li><li>  a permit is issued for a maximum of three years, and it is impossible to extend it, therefore, the procedure for obtaining it must be repeated; </li><li>  the chosen address must be real, otherwise, after verification, the FMS representatives may refuse to issue a residence permit; </li><li>  You can use your registration for your own living space or rental housing; </li><li>  a residence permit is a significant reason; </li><li>  if an apartment belonging to other persons is selected, then prior to registration it is necessary to obtain permission from all co-owners. </li></ul><p>  After obtaining a SIA, registration in a dwelling is an obligatory process for any foreign citizen planning to temporarily reside in Russia, find a job or obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation.  After obtaining a residence permit and obtaining a residence permit, a foreigner can count on obtaining Russian citizenship. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="rusarminfo.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="after receiving rvp need registration or registration" class="if uuid-3099186" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099186.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do after issuing a RVP? </h2><p>  RVP is a permit allowing a foreigner to legally stay on the territory of Russia for a period of three years.  With this document, a person can leave the country on a temporary basis, after which he can return to Russia without problems and difficulties.  To carry out various activities, employment or obtaining public services, you only need to have your passport and RVP with you. </p><p>  RVP is canceled if a foreigner leaves Russia for a period exceeding six months.  After receiving a PRT, registration in the Russian Federation is a simple and legal process.  In this case, a person gets the opportunity to find an official job in Russia.  He may apply to various state organizations for a patent or other documentation.  He may be registered with the Federal Tax Service for tax purposes.  Without official registration, the above actions cannot be completed. </p><p>  Registration at the place of residence after receiving the RVP is issued directly at the migration service.  Employees of this government agency often carry out field raids, the main purpose of which is to confirm that the foreigner actually lives at the specified address.  If he does not use this premises for permanent residence, he will be held liable.  Punishment is also provided for the owner of the property, which provided its property for registration of a person. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.expatica.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="documents for registration after receiving the rvp" class="if uuid-3099190" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099190.jpg"></div><h2>  The nuances of getting RVP </h2><p>  A temporary residence permit in Russia is considered easy to obtain.  To do this, the following rules are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  a document is issued exclusively at the migration service; </li><li>  in order to obtain a PRT, it is required to prepare a certain set of documents, which is checked by employees of the organization within 60 days; </li><li>  FMS branches are located in each region of the country, so submitting documentation is not difficult; </li><li>  if a foreigner receives a negative answer, he will have to leave the country, and he will also not be able to register in Russia. </li></ul><p>  After receiving the RVP, it will not be difficult to register if there is a suitable room for this. </p><h2>  What are the responsibilities? </h2><p>  As soon as a foreigner draws up a RVP, he will be faced with the fact that he will have certain rights and obligations.  Obligations include the following: </p><ul><li>  compulsory registration of foreign citizens after receipt of the RVP is necessary, and for this you need to choose only suitable housing, which can be privatized or municipal; </li><li>  registration is required at the place of residence within 7 days after receiving the document; </li><li>  annually a foreigner must confirm his stay in the country, for which he must come to the FMS department by filling out a special application; </li><li>  Every year, the Federal Tax Service returns a declaration containing information on the size and sources of income of a foreigner; </li><li>  12 months after receiving the RVP, you will have to register with the Federal Tax Service; </li><li>  if you plan to move to another city in the country, then you must first obtain special permission; </li><li>  even if a foreigner has a residence permit, he will not be able to count on receiving any benefits from the state. </li></ul><p>  A foreigner should not be in the country just like that, so he is obliged to find a place for employment, to work and pay taxes.  If he lives in Russia for six months without a source of income, then representatives of state bodies can revoke his permission to stay in the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.rt.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="registration at the place of residence after receiving the rvp" class="if uuid-3099183" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099183.jpg"></div><h2>  Other restrictions </h2><p>  While staying in Russia, foreigners are faced with other significant restrictions.  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  temporary registration after receipt of the RVP is mandatory, and it must be done within 7 days after obtaining permission, but it is not always possible for foreigners to buy real estate or register in the housing of relatives or friends; </li><li>  it is unacceptable for a foreigner to commit any offense, since if he becomes a participant in the lawsuit or even is held accountable for an administrative offense, he will lose his RVP, therefore he will be deported to his native country; </li><li>  the right to vote in elections or referenda is not granted to these people, since for this it is necessary to first obtain Russian citizenship; </li><li>  a person should work and live in the region where he executed the documentation; </li><li>  if a person moves to another region without prior notice to the FMS, he will be held liable in the form of a large fine, and it is also possible that the RVP will be canceled. </li></ul><p>  Therefore, every foreigner planning to stay in Russia for a long time should know what responsibilities and restrictions he will have to face. </p><div class="photo" data-original="refugee.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="temporary registration after receiving the rvp" class="if uuid-3099196" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099196.jpg"></div><h2>  Registration Rules </h2><p>  Registration at the place of residence after receiving the RVP has some features: </p><ul><li>  for registration in any real estate you need to obtain the consent of all owners of this property; </li><li>  if a foreigner acquires an apartment or a house, then he does not need any permission, therefore, he needs only a current extract from the USRN, confirming that he is the owner of this object; </li><li>  a statement is drawn up in the form of the FMS, which indicates the exact address where the person will actually live; </li><li>  it is allowed to register even in real estate obtained on the basis of a lease, but such an opportunity should be provided in the text of the agreement. </li></ul><p>  All these nuances should be taken into account by all foreign citizens.  The registration period after receiving the RVP is only 7 days, so you will have to take care of finding a suitable property in advance. </p><h2>  What documentation will be required? </h2><p>  The list of documents for registration after receipt of the RVP must be clarified directly with the FMS staff.  In different regions, the requirements may vary slightly.  The following documentation is required by default: </p><ul><li>  an application for registration after receiving the RVP, drawn up in the approved form, so it is advisable to take an empty form directly at the FMS office; </li><li>  a certificate confirming that the foreigner actually lives in real estate, which is indicated in the application; </li><li>  passport of a foreign citizen; </li><li>  RVP received no earlier than 7 days ago; </li><li>  notarized translation of a passport; </li><li>  certificate proving that a fingerprint examination was carried out; </li><li>  if the foreigner plans to register in housing that belongs to other people, then you will have to obtain consent for this process from all co-owners or registered persons; </li><li>  if the owners of the property have no family ties with a foreigner, then documentation is needed confirming that the landlord does not receive any payment from the visitor; </li><li>  if people are relatives, then you need to prepare documents confirming this fact; </li><li>  duty receipt; </li><li>  a leaflet of arrival, which is issued to a foreigner at the time of crossing the border; </li><li>  registration card to fill out when visiting the country; </li><li>  a certificate from the Federal Tax Service at the place of residence, which confirms that the person was registered with this government agency. </li></ul><p>  The above documentation may be supplemented with other papers if the migration service employees have additional questions.  Where to do registration after receiving the RVP?  To register at the place of residence, a foreigner will have to contact the FMS department again.  The application must be completed by the foreigner personally by hand. </p><div class="photo" data-original="english.vestnik-migranta.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="registration of foreign citizens after receiving a rvp" class="if uuid-3099194" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099194.jpg"></div><h2>  Other documents </h2><p>  The documents for registration after receiving the RVP depend on which real estate is registered.  Therefore, the following points are taken into account: </p><ul><li>  if a person has good financial capabilities, then he can buy an apartment or a house in Russia, after which, without the need to obtain any permissions, it is easy to register in this object; </li><li>  if the registration is made out in housing owned by relatives, then the consent of all co-owners is required, and documents confirming the existence of family ties between the two persons are also required; </li><li>  if a foreigner is registered with an outsider, then the permission of each owner of the object, certified by a notary, is needed; </li><li>  registration is permitted even in a municipal facility, but under such conditions all registered persons must agree with this process. </li></ul><p>  Even if one co-owner or tenant does not agree with the registration of a foreigner in this housing, then registration will be refused.  Additionally, housing standards for each person are taken into account.  What kind of registration is needed after receiving the RVP?  It may be permanent or temporary, but in the latter case, it is important to renew the registration in a timely manner so that a situation does not arise when a foreigner is in the country without official registration at the place of residence. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rbth.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="after receiving the rvp registration or registration" class="if uuid-3099193" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099193.jpg"></div><h2>  Registration Dates </h2><p>  The registration period after receipt of the RVP is 7 days.  It is during this period of time that a foreign citizen must apply to the FMS with the necessary package of documents for registration. </p><p>  The registration process is carried out within one day, so this procedure does not have to spend too much time. </p><h2>  Registration cost </h2><p>  After receiving the RVP, registration or registration is required, and this procedure is paid, so you will have to bear the following costs: </p><ul><li>  state duty for registration of a foreigner in housing located on the territory of the Russian Federation is 1.6 thousand rubles; </li><li>  first you have to pass an exam, which confirms that the foreigner knows Russian well, and for this you will have to pay 5.3 thousand rubles .; </li><li>  in addition, it is necessary to undergo a medical examination to make sure there are no dangerous infectious diseases or other health problems, and the cost of this process may vary in different regions, but the standard price is 2.5 thousand rubles. </li></ul><p>  During registration, other expenses may occur, for example, when contacting a notary to translate a passport or certify other documents.  If a foreigner cannot understand all the features of the procedure, then he will have to contact a representative who requires a fairly large amount for his services. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="registration period after receiving the rvp" class="if uuid-3099189" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099189.jpg"></div><h2>  The nuances of the process </h2><p>  Upon receipt of the RVP, registration must be completed within 7 days.  If a foreign citizen is not able to perform the prescribed actions on time, he will have to face the negative consequences of his decision.  They are represented not only by paying a large fine, but also by canceling the RVP, so the person will be deported to their country. </p><p>  The features of obtaining a residence permit by a foreigner in Russia include: </p><ul><li>  an important point is the collection of the necessary documentation, and it is advisable to contact relatives and friends with this question in order to prevent mistakes; </li><li>  registration is permitted both in privatized housing and in a municipal apartment; </li><li>  even if registration permission is not obtained from one tenant or co-owner of residential real estate, then registration of the foreign citizen at the place of residence will be denied; </li><li>  a foreigner must prepare for certain expenses, since registration in an apartment located in Russia is a paid process. </li></ul><p>  Some notaries in large cities offer a unique service.  It lies in the fact that they provide assistance to foreigners in the process of registering a SFA and residence permit, as well as during registration in any real estate.  Such services are paid, but at the same time they allow you to easily perform the desired procedure on time. </p><h2>  What are the problems? </h2><p>  After receiving the RVP, registration or registration is required for a foreigner, but at the same time he may face some difficulties.  They are as follows: </p><ul><li>  many foreigners sometimes simply forget about the need to obtain a residence permit after issuing a RVP; </li><li>  even if the deadline of 7 days was missed if there was a good reason, a person is still held accountable, so he is forced to pay a fine, and often he is expected to be deported altogether; </li><li>  difficulties often arise with obtaining permission to register in any real estate from all co-owners of this property. </li></ul><p>  Because of such difficulties, it is advisable that a foreigner prepare for all necessary actions before visiting Russia directly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="sputniknews.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what registration is needed after receiving the rvp" class="if uuid-3099195" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/67143/3099195.jpg"></div><h2>  Reasons for refusal </h2><p>  There are various reasons for the presence of which the FMS staff may refuse to register a foreigner in any real estate.  This is usually due to the following reasons: </p><ul><li>  serious errors were made in the process of filling out an application or other documentation; </li><li>  all the necessary documents were not collected; </li><li>  there is no written consent from all owners of the selected dwelling; </li><li>  information entered in the documentation is false; </li><li>  There is no quota in the region. </li></ul><p>  Under such conditions, a foreigner will lose his RVP, so he will be forced to return to his country, otherwise he will be deported by force. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  After receiving the RVP, registration or registration must be carried out within 7 days.  To do this, you can choose privatized or municipal housing.  A foreigner must prepare for this purpose the necessary number of documents that are transferred to the employees of the FMS.  Under certain conditions, he may be denied registration. </p><p>  Only in the presence of RVP and registration in the territory of the Russian Federation can a foreigner use various state services, officially get a job or perform other important actions necessary for each person.  Therefore, every foreigner must prepare for a trip to Russia in advance. </p>
