    <h2>  Traveling in the Kirov region </h2><p>  Among the architectural sights of Kirov (Kirov region) there are cultural objects of different erection times.  One of the most beautiful and historically significant is the mansion of the merchant T. Bulychev.  This building has a mysterious architecture, because it does not look like a merchant's house.  The mansion is more like a palace that came to Russia from an oriental tale.  And even the fact that the regional FSB is located in this building cannot dispel thoughts about the Moors.  The facade of the mansion is so unusual that it does not fit into the architecture of the city. </p><p>  One of the most popular places in the Kirov region is the village of Velikoretskoye.  A legend is associated with this place, according to which in 1383 the image of Nicholas the Wonderworker appeared on the banks of the Great River.  After this incident, local residents began to be healed.  Among others was a resident of the village of Ivan, who had not stood on his feet for almost twenty years. </p><p>  A chapel was erected at the site of the miraculous phenomenon, and a little further - a temple.  Since then, a procession has been held here annually to take the icon of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker to the site of the appearance of the miracle. </p><h2>  To the dinosaurs </h2><p>  Among the museums of the city of Kirov distinguish paleontological.  It was opened in 1994, but during its existence a decent collection of fossils dating back to the Permian period has accumulated in it.  The age of the exhibits is more than 250 million years, and many of them have no analogues in the world. </p><p>  Not far from the museum itself is the grand location of the remains of animals.  Its length is more than twenty kilometers along the Vyatka River.  In the warm season, museum guests are taken to the site of the excavation of the dinosaurs. </p><p>  Those who want to be a true archaeologist and paleontologist during their holidays should come to Kirov.  Here everyone will have the opportunity to follow the tracks of dinosaurs, see how the planet was born, which creatures once inhabited it.  There are many similar museums in the world, but only such exhibits as in the Kirov Paleontological Museum are nowhere in the world. </p>

    <p>  During the excursions, each tourist will have the opportunity to visit the first paleontological museum located in Kotelnich.  The guide will tell you what the work of the paleontologist was, what lizards inhabited the planet, how many years they lived and how long it was, and also will answer any questions.  Not far from the first museum is Sokolya Gora.  This is a sandstone formation that arose more than 250 million years ago.  In this place is one of the largest on the planet locations pareiasaurs.  The mountain itself is shrouded in a variety of myths, legends, secrets.  Locals say that in this place they often see UFOs, they met a snowman - here the most unimaginable anomalous phenomena occur. </p><p>  Karst funnels located in the Proval Lake are considered an unusual natural phenomenon.  In their very center, the depth of the lake reaches fourteen kilometers.  The pond has a length of a kilometer.  It has clear clear water, through which the bottom is visible at a depth of up to ten meters.  The bottom is sandy, and starting from a depth of five meters it becomes muddy. </p><p>  Divers, lovers of underwater fishing come to Dips.  This corner of nature is striking in its unusualness, beauty, mystery.  Submerged under water, you can see the huge trunks of trees that are here because of the formation of <span>karst craters.</span> </p><p>  In Kirov there is the Alexander Church - a unique architectural monument, built in 1903 by a Warsaw architect.  For almost 25 years, the building was used to conduct Catholic services, but over the next decades the purpose of the building was lost: the building passed from hand to hand.  Since 1989, its reconstruction was carried out, and the structure was restored to its original appearance.  An organ concert and exhibition hall opened in the building itself. </p>
