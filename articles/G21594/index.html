  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The miracle of engineering or the history of the invention of turbines</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The 12th century was marked by the appearance of the first steam engine.  This was the event when mechanized machines appeared in industry and technology, gradually replacing human labor.  Industrial development did not stand still.  The whole history of its development is characterized by the search for solutions by the inventors of different countries of one task - the creation of a pore turbine. </p><p>  It can be argued that the history of the invention of turbines dates back to the 19th century, when the Swedish scientist Karl Patrick Laval invented the milk separator.  In search of a solution to the issue of increasing speed in this device, Karl invented a steam turbine, which was designed at the end of the XIX century.  The turbine had the form of a wheel with blades, a jet of steam leaving the pipe pressed on these blades and the wheel spun.  The scientist picked up tubes for supplying steam of various sizes and shapes for a long time, and as a result of lengthy experiments, he concluded that the tube should be conical in shape.  This device is used to this day, and has the name "Laval nozzle."  Despite the fact that the invention of Laval was quite simple at first glance, the device, it became a miracle of engineering.  And after a certain period of time, theoretical scientists proved that the invention of steam turbines using the Loval nozzle gives the highest result. </p><p>  The English scientist Charles Parsons also made a huge contribution to the development of industry.  He connected a <span>steam turbine</span> and an electric power generator, so the turbine could produce electricity.  Fifteen years later, Parsons invented a jet turbine with increased efficiency.  Soon, more than three hundred jet turbines were used to generate electricity, and ten years later, the world's first power plant using a jet steam turbine was constructed.  Thus, Parsons improved the invention of turbines using the Laval method.  Parson also built a vessel using a drive from a steam turbine, after which the turbines began to be installed on many ships.  Over time, these turbines have also been used in <span>thermal power plants.</span> </p><p>  Further, the history of the invention of turbines advances to the beginning of the 20th century, when the French inventor Auguste Rato designed a multi-stage steam turbine, in which the optimal pressure drop indicators for each of the turbine stages were calculated. </p><p>  After all, the American scientist Glen Curtis developed a turbine that used a completely new system, it was small in size and reliable in design.  These turbines were used in the design of the propulsion systems of ships, they were installed first on destroyers, then on warships and, finally, on passenger ships. </p><p>  Thus, the history of the invention of turbines reveals several ways of finding a convenient and economical heat engine by scientists of the XIX century.  Some inventors developed a <span>thermal engine</span> in which fuel would burn in a cylinder, so such an engine would fit well in transport.  Other scientists improved the <span>steam engine</span> in order to increase its power and efficiency. </p><p>  Today, the history of the invention of turbines begins with such great names as Laval, Parsons and Curtis.  All these scientists and inventors made a huge contribution to the development of industry and transport communications around the world.  All their achievements were of great importance to all mankind.  And the most important thing was the spread of such a form of energy as electricity.  Currently, the inventions of these scientists are widely used throughout the world in the construction of ships and power plants. </p>
