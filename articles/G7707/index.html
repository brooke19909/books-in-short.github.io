It consisted of several underground groups, which included former members of Narodnaya Volya, which was defeated in 1881. </p><h2>  Activities </h2><p>  During the revolution of 1905-1907, the Social Revolutionaries engaged in terror, defending the interests of the petty bourgeoisie.  During this time, they carried out 263 major terrorist attacks, which killed many people.  Of the officials alone, 7 generals, 2 ministers and 33 governors were affected.  During this period, the party numbered about 63 thousand people, and the total of Social Democrats was about 150 thousand. </p>

    <h2>  Views </h2><p>  The Socialist-Revolutionaries from the very beginning of their political currents believed that Russia was very different from Western Europe.  As a result, their vision of transformation and the direct road to socialism was different from what was happening in the west.  A typical Social Revolutionary is a revolutionary whose views were largely borrowed from the Narodniks, the immediate predecessors of the movement.  However, history has shown them that the social ideas that underlie the party program are absolutely not suitable for making the right decision during the period of revolutionary catastrophe.  This realization led to the fact that from February to October 1917, representatives of the movement departed from their main programmatic provisions and decided to become allies of the liberal-bourgeois forces. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  1917 year </h2><p>  Soon after the <span>February Revolution</span> , party members decided to agree with the political line of the Mensheviks. During this period, a group called the "Left Socialist Revolutionaries" separated.  This, in the opinion of the revolutionaries, meant: they support the idea that Russia and its government are not yet ready for a serious socialist revolution.  That is, their main goal was to strengthen the bourgeois <span>Provisional Government.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Left Socialist Revolutionaries is" class="if" height="440" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19041/416292.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  This led to the fact that party representatives became part of the government system.  This was reflected in the fact that the Social Revolutionaries began to support the decision to continue the war, which, in turn, influenced the land issue, which remained unresolved until the end of the confrontation, that is, until the soldiers returned from the front.  During this period, the Bolsheviks, on the contrary, decided to include the basic views of the Social Revolutionaries in their <span>political program.</span> </p><h2>  Bolshevik VS Eser </h2><p>  This fact, however, did not change the fact that the parties were radically different from each other, since the Bolsheviks had more innovative views.  That is why they were able to master a new picture of the world, which evolved during the most recent events.  The Bolsheviks did not intend to submit to the dogmas of Marxism and were able to become part of the people, worthily representing their interests. </p>

    <p>  Soon the people turned away from those who wore the proud title of "SR".  This was due to the defensive course of the party.  Its representatives supported the continuation of the war and supported the bourgeoisie, which did not raise their authority in the eyes of the people. </p><p>  <span>The party of socialist revolutionaries</span> was an important stage in the development of the revolutionary movement in Russia.  Without it, the revolution would have been more problematic and could have led to completely different consequences, which would undoubtedly affect the current state of affairs and the role of Russia in the international political arena. </p>
