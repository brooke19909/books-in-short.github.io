  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a digital photo frame. What to look for when choosing a device</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The invention of a digital camera gave a person a great opportunity - to create a huge amount of high-quality photographs in a short time.  However, this same invention has created a new problem.  Storing so many photographs in old paper photo albums has simply become impossible.  Using a laptop or personal computer for these purposes is much more convenient, but this method also does not solve the main problems.  The same notorious technical progress came to the aid of mankind.  The invention of the photo frame has become a simple and elegant way out of this situation.  In addition, it perfectly matches the concept of a modern house and fits seamlessly into the interior of your home along with other electronic devices.  Let's try to answer the basic question that may arise during the purchase of this wonderful device, namely: how to choose a digital photo frame. </p><p>  Appearance is the main selection criterion for most people.  Manufacturers put the design of the digital frame at the forefront, because the device will be visible and shown to guests most of the time.  The design and colors of the gadgets on the market today are so diverse that they can satisfy any, even the most fastidious buyer.  How to choose a digital photo frame based on its appearance, the consumer decides, and a device that fully meets his preferences will be found. </p><p>  So, we have decided on the design, but how to choose a digital photo frame based on the characteristics of its main element - the LCD?  First of all, you should pay attention to the diagonal.  For modern photo frames, it ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  However, to meet on the store counter a photo frame whose diagonal would be over 10 inches, is still quite difficult.  Digital frames can be either conventional or widescreen.  These indicators are similar for monitors.  In general, the choice of a photo frame is somewhat similar to the choice of a liquid crystal monitor.  It is also necessary to pay attention to the viewing angle, contrast and brightness.  Screen resolution should be given special importance, because it will depend on this parameter how clear the image will be. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The built-in memory of the digital photo frame is not so important, since its volume is limited and is not able to accommodate a large number of photos.  Of greatest interest to the user is the presence of an integrated card reader that can read information from external media.  The more media types it supports, the better.  <span>How to choose a digital</span> photo frame that is right for you?  Very simple, ask the seller if this model supports the format of the <span>memory card</span> that you use in your camera. </p><p>  Most digital photo frames receive energy from a standard electrical outlet, so if you plan to use the gadget far from it, you should know in advance whether the batteries or batteries you like can use the model you like.  Digital photo frame today is not only a device that allows you to view photos.  Using this gadget, you can listen to music and view video files.  To connect to a laptop or computer, a USB standard is provided in the photo frames.  However, photo frames of the upper digital range often use wireless protocols.  There are even models in which a full-fledged Internet connection is implemented for exchanging data with your friends.  Ceiva is considered the leader in the production of such devices.  How much does a digital photo frame cost?  In the Russian market, the average price of entry-level digital photo frames is around <span>$ 100.</span>  With the addition of new features and an increase in the diagonal, the price can reach up to 400. For a long time, the Genius PF-A001 digital photo frame was considered the undisputed leader.  This device has good functionality, a diagonal of 10 inches and at the same time has a fairly moderate cost.  What is the best digital photo frame everyone decides for himself. </p>
