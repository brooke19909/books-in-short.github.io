A large and beautiful area, its own beach, swimming pools and sports fields - all this is enough to organize leisure.  The rooms are clean, the furniture is new, and the maids are cleaned regularly.  No one complains about the level of comfort here. </p><p>  The food is also at a decent level - nobody leaves the restaurant hungry.  For cooking use high-quality and fresh products.  A huge plus is the availability of special diet food.  True, some tourists complain about a certain uniformity of the menu, although there is always something to choose from.  By the way, you can have lunch right on the open veranda. </p><p>  Special thanks to the guests leave the hotel staff.  Everyone here is polite, funny, pleasant in communication, many understand the Russian language well.  Animators really entertain guests by making their holidays memorable. </p><p>  Former guests recommend the hotel complex Grand Park Bodrum 5 *.  Turkey, Bodrum in particular, is ideal for a rich, enjoyable vacation that will be remembered for many years. </p>
