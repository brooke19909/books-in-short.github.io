    <h2>  Brief historical information about the bank </h2><p>  Loko-Bank (reviews of it can be heard with completely different contents) is a private organization created in 1994 by several successful businessmen.  Initially, the main objective of the company was to provide the necessary services to trade and industrial enterprises, as well as top managers and owners belonging to this group of entrepreneurs. </p><p>  In other words, since its inception, this financial institution has been obliged to solve all the monetary problems arising from the owners of "factories, newspapers and ships", their partners and VIP clients. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Change of course and the formation of a new financial policy </h2><p>  In early 2003, there was a sharp change in the financial and marketing policies of such an organization as Loko-Bank.  Feedback on the new management strategy of the credit institution allows you to restore the full picture of the change in rate.  For example, some clients write that after 2003 they managed to get a loan to develop their business.  Others confidently report earned interest received after the next capitalization of deposits, etc. </p><p>  As you can see, after 9 years, the management of Loko-Bank has dramatically changed its policy.  Neglecting their initial interests, the company decided to expand the number of potential customers.  To this end, she has developed a number of programs aimed at attracting the attention of individuals and legal entities.  This time, the main business of the financial organization was lending to small and medium-sized businesses. </p><p>  Closer to 2007, a loan at Loko-Bank could be taken not only by individual entrepreneurs and legal entities, but also by ordinary citizens.  What services does the bank provide today?  And what is modern Loko-Bank like? </p><h2>  Loko-Bank now </h2><p>  At present, the bank has an impressive retail network with about 50 offices and branches.  All of them are located in 21 regions of the Russian Federation.  According to official figures, among the organization‚Äôs customers there are over 120,000 individuals, as well as about 25,000 legal entities.  All of them have already managed to use the services of the financial institution Loko-Bank.  Moscow is the city where the head office of the bank is located.  It is here that all individuals, <span>corporate clients,</span> as well as representatives of small and medium-sized businesses can enlist the qualified support of the organization‚Äôs employees.  The company‚Äôs office itself can be found at 14. Hospitalnaya Street, 14. In addition to it, there are 14 branches and the same number of ATMs in the capital.
