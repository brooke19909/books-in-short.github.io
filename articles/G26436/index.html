  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Garachico, Tenerife: attractions, what to see, tourist reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are places on the planet that you must see at least once in your life.  They are not very popular in the global tourism business, however, their visit leaves an indelible mark on their memory for many years.  One such place is Garachico, Tenerife. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  In the Atlantic Ocean, the Paradise Canary Islands are lost, which annually receive hundreds of thousands of tourists on their land.  Among them are Tenerife - an island with magnificent beaches and old settlements.  Among them stands out Garachico - a city with a rich history. </p><p>  Garachico, Tenerife, is one of the most picturesque towns on all the Canary Islands, and it is here that, despite its official affiliation with Spain, a truly Spanish spirit is felt.  The coastline arose thanks to volcanic rocks, so the color of beaches and reefs is black.  It is in the crevices that tourists bathe all year round. </p><div class="photo" data-original="teidebynight.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tenerife bays" class="if uuid-3232039" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232039.jpg"></div><p>  Garachico in Tenerife appeared in the eighteenth century.  Throughout this small town there are signs telling a story.  The city has a huge number of various tourist shops, souvenir shops and, of course, a cafe where you can try local food, consisting of fresh local seafood.  In 1706, a volcanic explosion occurred on the island, and most of the buildings had to be restored.  It is all the more pleasant to walk along the small narrow streets with a camera and collect interesting shots for a long memory. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.garahotel.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="view of tenerife" class="if uuid-3232025" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232025.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Inexperienced tourists may wonder how to get to Garachico in Tenerife.  This is best done by car.  There are several companies on the island that provide car rental services.  It is enough to have a driver‚Äôs license and a security deposit with you, and your car.  When traveling to Garachico, you need to focus on the TF-42 highway, which runs along the entire coast.  TF-82 will also lead you to Garachico, however this route is dangerous because it runs through volcanic peaks.  You need to be very careful when moving along the serpentine.  If you or your loved ones are cradled, be sure to take pills or special sweets with you, since stopping on a streamer is dangerous and extremely undesirable. </p><p>  There is an option to get there by bus.  But this is not a good idea, it is better to abandon it if there are other options.  There is no direct bus service, you will have to do two or three transfers, which is not particularly pleasant in the heat.  The total cost of a bus trip is approximately equal to the cost of renting a car, so make a choice in favor of comfort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.canaryislandsinfo.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Tenerife Promenade" class="if uuid-3232034" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232034.jpg"></div><h2>  Palace of the Counts of La Gomera </h2><p>  There are enough attractions in the city, so the question of what to see in Garachico in Tenerife will not arise.  First of all, go on an excursion to the palace house of the Counts of La Gomera, which has another, unofficial name - "house of stone."  Its construction was started in 1666 and at first only two craftsmen were hired - mason Antonio Perez and Luis Marical.  The external and internal decoration of the house is made of volcanic stone, which the masters carefully polished and gave a gentle shape.  It is sad that after the volcanic eruption in 1706, the house was almost destroyed.  It was completely restored taking into account all the unique details.  Now the house is open for visitors every day from 10.00 to 16.00. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Church of St. Anne </h2><p>  In the photo of Garachico in Tenerife you can see a very beautiful high tower.  This tower belongs to the church of St. Anne, which was built at the beginning of the fourteenth century.  It is noteworthy that at first the project was conceived without a tower.  It began to be built only in 1615, and then bells were placed in it.  The volcanic eruption in 1706 destroyed almost everything to the ground.  It took seven years to recover.  Now, for a nominal fee, anyone can climb the tower, enjoy the view of the city and take beautiful photos. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.webtenerife.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Anne's Church" class="if uuid-3232026" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232026.jpg"></div><h2>  Park La Puerta de Tierra </h2><p>  One of the most interesting places to visit in the town of Garachico in Tenerife is the garden park "La Puerta de Tierra".  The park was created artificially, but the architects reproduced all historical interiors as accurately as possible.  A unique artifact installed in the park is the gate that has been preserved to this day.  It was through them that newcomers to the city passed, and through them the people who left it came out. </p><p>  A unique detail of the park is the original press, the mechanism by which grapes were pressed to produce wine.  Also in the territory there is a monument in memory of the founder of the town of Garachico - Cristobal de Ponte. </p><h2>  Monastery of Santo Domingo </h2><p>  The monastery of Santo Domingo is the oldest monastery among all existing in Tenerife, and the most beautiful.  This is a large two-story building, which is decorated with carved Portuguese-style balconies.  Part of the facade and interior is decorated with volcanic stone, this gives the monastery a majestic, unique look.  During the famous volcanic eruption in 1706, the monastery of Santo Domingo did not suffer at all, since it was at a decent distance from the lava flow.  However, in the twentieth century, the building was abandoned and almost forgotten, as due to decay and lack of proper repair, it was destroyed.  Only a few years ago, a group of patrons took over the overhaul of the building, and now a nursing home has been set up in it, which was given the name of the Virgin Mary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="turismo.garachico.es" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Santo Domingo" class="if uuid-3232028" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232028.jpg"></div><h2>  Fortress of San Miguel </h2><p>  During the reign of King Felipe II, a decree was issued on the construction of a fortress that would protect the island from external sea invaders.  So there was the fortress of San Miguel, small in scale, but very skillfully constructed.  The volcanic eruption hit this structure quite a bit, destroying only part of the wall.  The destruction was quickly restored, and the fortress continued to serve as an amulet for the island from corsairs and sea robbers. </p><p>  Today, the fortress is open to visitors daily.  On its territory, several cannons of those times with which you can take pictures were left as museum exhibits.  Sometimes the building of the fortress serves as an exhibition space for artists and photographers. </p><div class="photo" data-original="es.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="San miguel" class="if uuid-3232031" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3232031.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about Garachico in Tenerife, despite the excellent location in the Atlantic Ocean, are very diverse.  It is best to visit these places for people who are interested in history, love walking and want to relax from the hustle and bustle of the big city.  For a quiet relaxing holiday, this place is ideal.  It is better to come here without young children, for whom there are practically no places equipped for recreation and entertainment.  Rather, Garachiko will be of interest to older schoolchildren, since the trip will allow them to see firsthand the historical places and to feel the spirit of events of bygone years. </p><p>  Garachico is a great place for people who appreciate delicious food and drinks.  Needless to say, the wine produced in local Spanish vineyards is considered one of the best in the world.  The cuisine, as travelers report, is beyond praise and conquers not by the complexity of dishes, but rather by simplicity.  All dishes are prepared with fresh seafood in front of your eyes, where you can add spices and olive oil to your taste in the cooking process.  This is also a peculiar attraction of Garachico in Tenerife.  It is worth remembering this.  The island of Tenerife and Garachico are a must to visit, experienced travelers advise. </p>
