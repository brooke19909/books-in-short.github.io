Thus, their total number today is, as already mentioned, 932 people. </p><p>  If we count how many academicians in the RAS were elected exclusively through the Academy of Sciences, then there are 527. The percentage of women is low - there are only 13. 73 scientists have continued their membership since the days of the USSR. </p><p>  The oldest academician is the philosopher Theodor Oiserman, who in May 2016 turned 102 already.  At the opposite end of the list is physicist Grigory Trubnikov - he is only 40 years old.  Of the living members of the academy, the youngest at the time of the election was another physicist - Alexander Skrinsky (32 years old).  And at the most advanced age, the physiologist Lev Magazanik was awarded this title.  He was 85 at the time of election. </p><h2>  Academician with experience </h2><p>  At the moment, the metallurgist Boris Evgenievich Paton is the longest academician of science.  He is 98 years old, he was born in Kiev.  In the capital of the Ukrainian SSR, he graduated from the Polytechnic Institute, becoming a electrical engineer by profession.  He went in the footsteps of his father to work at the Institute of Electric Welding, bearing the name of his father - Eugene Oskarovich.  Over the course of his career, he has authored over 400 inventions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <p>  His research interests are related to the processes of automatic and semi-automatic welding, he also represented and developed theories of creating machines for arc welding, studied the conditions of arc burning. </p><p>  Today, Academician Paton works with cybernetic devices, and also works on the creation of welding robots.  Priority among the problems he studied is metallurgy of welding, as well as obtaining new and improving existing metals. </p><p>  One of his merits is the creation of a special field in metallurgy - special electrometallurgy.  He personally led research in this area, dealing with heat sources in welding machines. </p><h2>  Oncology successes </h2><p>  In 2004, Mikhail Ivanovich Davydov, professor, oncologist surgeon, became an academician. </p><p>  He was praised by the academic community for his success in developing methods for treating various cancers.

    <p>  His merit is the use of new methods - anostomosis (connection of the internal volumes of hollow organs).  Thanks to this, doctors manage to establish interaction between intestinal tracts or vessels.  His new technique is original, while it is as simple as possible in technical performance. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Davydov Mikhail Ivanovich achieved a significant improvement in the effects of treatment of cancer of the stomach, lungs and esophagus.  For the first time in oncological surgery, it was he who began to carry out surgical interventions with a pulmonary aorta or vena cava, achieving excellent results. </p><h2>  The oldest </h2><p>  Theodor Ilyich Oyzerman is today the oldest academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  In May of last year, he turned 102. He was born the year the First World War began in the small village of Petroverovka in the Kherson province, now it is the Odessa region. </p>

To receive an honorary title at this age is a kind of record, at least among the living academics. </p><p>  Lev Girshevich was born in Odessa in 1931.  In the field of his scientific research - the work of ion channels, the effect of neurotoxins on various types and types of receptors.

    <p>  Leyla Adamyan is famous for perfectly mastering all types of gynecological operations known to today's science.  The objects of her research are the use of x-rays in reproductive medicine.  He works a lot on the treatment of pregnant women and children. </p><p>  Thanks to her, modern surgical technologies are used today, which allowed at least two times to reduce the severity and consequences of adhesions that occur after gynecological operations. </p><h2>  Academicians </h2><p>  Another area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge that is traditionally preferred by academicians of the RAS, the list of which is then replenished, is mathematics. </p><p>  Today, one of the most famous scientists in this field is Ludwig <span>Dmitrievich</span> Faddeev, who became a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences back in 1976.  He specializes in mathematical physics. </p>

    <p>  Most of his works and studies are devoted to solving three-body problems in quantum mechanics.  In modern science, this problem is known under his name - the Faddeev equation.  He also deals with the Schr√∂dinger equation.  He wrote two hundred scientific works and monographs. </p><p>  They can be proud that among them there is <span>such a scientist, academicians of the</span> Russian Academy of Sciences.  Mathematicians devote a lot of time to theoretical work, however, it is often appreciated.  In 2008, Ludwig Faddeev received the Shao Prize in Hong Kong annually awarded to the world's best scientists.  He received the award in the nomination "Mathematics" with another compatriot Vladimir Arnold.  Their contribution to the popularization of mathematical physics was appreciated. </p>
