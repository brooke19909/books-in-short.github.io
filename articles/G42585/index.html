One of these models can be safely called the processor Alpine CDE-175R, which received a fairly large number of positive reviews due to its features.  To understand what it is remarkable for, let's look at its main characteristics, as well as analyze the reviews available on the Web. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU6_Buyui3A"><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine cde 175r review and specifications" class="if uuid-2911527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2911527.jpg"></div><h2>  Compatibility with Yandex services </h2><p>  This radio tape recorder is "ground" for work with "apple" equipment, including iPhone of the latest models.  However, its capabilities are not limited to supporting management of embedded applications.  So, if you install the Yandex.Music add-on from an official store that distributes specialized software, the driver will have the opportunity to listen to music from the list of their online playlists created in accordance with current subscriptions.  At the same time, the name of the current track will be displayed on the screen of the Alpine CDE-175R radio, and controls, such as the buttons for moving to the next melody, will work as if playback was carried out directly by the radio itself. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.acidaudio.fr" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine cde 175r car radio" class="if uuid-2911531" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2911531.jpg"></div><h2>  Work with online services </h2><p>  If the travel area has good network coverage from an operator with high-speed Internet, then the user can enjoy online radio stations using the specialized vTuner application.  It contains thousands of radios from around the world, among which you can choose the right one in style and mood.  Volume control and switching between tracks, as in the case of Yandex services, can be performed using the keys of the Alpine CDE-175R 1-DIN radio or its remote control. </p><p>  Another interesting feature is the ability to display messages and notifications from Facebook.  A specific sound signal is emitted.  If correspondence in this social network is important for the driver, then he will not miss a single message thanks to such a well-thought-out system. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine cde 175r review and reviews" class="if uuid-2911555" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2911555.jpg"></div><h2>  The main characteristics of the radio </h2><p>  Many users are interested in the basic characteristics and sound quality more than all sorts of additional features.  The radio tape recorder is able to please even the most demanding listeners, as it has a built-in processor that provides filtering and sound purification.  Using a fairly extensive settings menu, you can achieve maximum sound quality and adjust the output level to the set type of speakers. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The built-in amplifier Alpine CDE-175R can connect 4 speakers with a total power of 200 watts according to the quadraphonic scheme.  Thanks to the processor, it is possible to set the sound delay parameters on each of them and achieve synchronization with a rather large distance of the speakers from each other, for example, if the speakers are installed in a long car like a minivan or a minibus. </p><h2>  Sound sources used </h2><p>  This radio can be called one of the optimal for those who seek not to limit themselves in the media of music files.  So, it can play both discs in the classic AudioCD format with high quality recordings, as well as more compressed MP3 files.  If carrying a large number of obsolete disks is inconvenient, then the entire playlist can be placed on a USB flash drive.  Car radio Alpine CDE-175R understands cards with a capacity of up to 32 gigabytes, formatted according to the FAT32 standard. </p><p>  In addition to these options, as mentioned above, it is possible to connect branded devices from Apple using a special adapter.  For the convenience of controlling any sound sources while driving, it is also recommended to install a special remote control located on the steering wheel, or connect an existing one using the standard protocol. </p><p>  If the device does not fit any connection option, but at the same time has a linear audio output, then the signal from it can be transmitted using the AUX connector.  True, in this case it will be possible to adjust only the volume with the help of the radio controls, but the remaining parameters will have to be set directly on the player. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.drive2.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine cde 175r specifications" class="if uuid-2911560" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2911560.jpg"></div><h2>  Positive feedback about the model </h2><p>  In order to see the main advantages and disadvantages of this equipment, it is not enough to know only its characteristics.  Reviews of the Alpine CDE-175R car radio from verified users will help you learn more about its positive features, among which the following are most often mentioned: </p><ul><li>  High-quality sound even with not too expensive speakers. </li><li>  The ability to play music from a large number of media and devices. </li><li>  The presence of a standard connector for connecting an external control panel. </li><li>  Powerful amplifier with honest output of 50 watts on 4 channels. </li><li>  The presence of an integrated processor that can clean and improve the sound. </li><li>  Nice appearance Alpine CDE-175R and convenient location of controls. </li><li>  The presence of a complete remote control that facilitates the initial setup. </li><li>  The ability to change the color of the backlight in accordance with other elements of the interior of the car. </li><li>  Support for large-capacity flash memory, which can accommodate the entire playlist with your favorite tracks. </li><li>  High speed of processing and execution of incoming commands, no freezes and delays. <div class="photo" data-original="www.hifikulma.fi" data-author=": " data-source="https://www.hifikulma.fi/epages/hifikulma.sf/fi_FI/?ObjectPath=/Shops/FOHI/Products/AlpineCDE175R"><img itemprop="image" alt="alpine cde 175r review" class="if uuid-2911566" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44847/2911566.jpg"></div></li></ul><h2>  Negative points </h2><p>  However, despite such an impressive list of advantages, the radio has some disadvantages.  The first one is not a very convenient front panel mount, which many drivers take off every time they leave the car.  Sometimes it takes a long time to install it back, which takes time before leaving. </p><p>  The second minus is the confusing and complicated menu.  This is partly due to the large number of settings available to the user.  At the same time, they will often have to be used only once - when installing the radio, then you will not need to dig deep into the menu for daily listening.  As the Alpine CDE-175R review shows, it is thanks to this functionality that the radio has a pleasant and deep sound. </p><p>  The third minus is the inability to adjust the equalizer individually for each channel pair.  Therefore, it is recommended to install the same speaker system both in the front of the car and on the rear shelf. </p>
