All of them are located at approximately equal distance from the sea and are located close to the beaches and the city center at the same time.  They also have a similar star rank.  One of the hotels is located in the northern part of Sousse, not far from the beach entertainment center Las Vegas and the chic Five, the Movenpic Resort and Marine SPA.  Two more hotels of the same chain have the word "Salem" in their name.  One of them, "Royal", is located in the southern suburbs.  It is not too far from him to go to the Sousse Mohammed V metro station.  And the Salem Resort Hotel was built halfway between the El Kantaoui Singing Fountains and the city center.  There are several more hotels of the same Marhab chain in Sousse, and in this article we will try to consider the specifics and features of some of these hotels, based on the feedback of Russian tourists who have been there. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marhaba resorts 4" class="if" height="243" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/660201.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Marhaba Resorts Hotel 4 * </h2><p>  This hotel stands right in the center of the vibrant Sousse district.  Therefore, all the entertainment is within walking distance.  After all, this urban area was built specifically for the needs of tourists.  The hotel is intended primarily for vacationers who come to be healthy, as well as for families with children.  There are a lot of services especially for kids - high chairs in the restaurant, games room and playground, animation and so on.  The hotel has good daytime animation on the beach, and in the evening performances and discos.  According to the general impression of tourists, such a ‚Äúfour‚Äù may be losing in comparison with the Dominican Republic, but much better than Turkish hotels of this type. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Marhaba resorts 4 tunisia" class="if" height="244" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/660204.jpg" width="600"></div>
