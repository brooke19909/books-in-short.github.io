Let not an elite, not a new building, but his ... </p><p>  Someone managed to realize their dream earlier, someone later, someone bought a chic apartment with underground parking, someone had a dream come true completely, and now he is the owner of an elite mansion in a cozy area of ‚Äã‚Äãa large metropolis.  However, all of these people have one thing in common - at one time they were all buyers of an apartment or house. </p><p>  Verification of documents when buying an apartment or house, regardless of whether a <span>new building or a secondary housing is</span> put up for sale is not an easy task, because  the amount of required securities can reach up to a dozen.  Moreover, the absence or incompleteness of each of them can threaten you not only with loss of funds, but also with lengthy <span>litigation</span> or hassle.  However, there is no reason to panic, because the list of documents and the procedure for checking them are standard. </p><p>  In this article we will try to tell as much as possible about all the actions that the buyer must carry out, what documents he must collect when buying an apartment, so that the purchase process itself, and, most importantly, his house bought and further residence in it, would not turn him life is a nightmare. </p><p>  So, where to start buying an apartment? </p><p>  The first stage is the preparatory stage.  You already have a certain amount in your hands, for which you want to purchase housing that is convenient for you.  If you are confident in your abilities and confident that you will do without the help of a lawyer or a realtor, then, first of all, you need to study the documents when buying an apartment that the seller represents, make sure that he is the owner of the apartment, compare the data from the property registration certificate with as indicated in the title document.  If redevelopment is done, be sure to ask permission of the relevant authorities. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The second stage is the registration of the purchase of an apartment or apartment building.  Current legislation requires the purchase of an apartment by signing an agreement with a notary, and then this transaction must be registered. </p><p>  For this, in addition to confirming the seller‚Äôs ownership, the following documents are needed when buying an apartment, presented in a notary's office: passports of both parties, written consent of the spouses to alienate and purchase this housing, if there are children, permission of the guardianship council (for the seller), a certificate transferring 1% of the amount to the Pension Fund (for the buyer), certificate of absence of utility debts (for the seller). </p><p>  Experienced lawyers recommend signing an Acceptance and Transfer Act for an apartment or house when concluding a transaction regarding the sale.  This document is an integral part of the contract, an appendix to it.  However, it does not mean that ownership has already passed to the buyer, because  in accordance with the law, a buyer who has already completed all the documents when buying an apartment, signed an agreement and received his notarial certificate, it is necessary to carry out state registration of property rights in the BTI. </p><p>  If you decide to take a chance and invest your money in a new building, then here the buyer must deal with the developer.  What documents should he provide when buying an apartment?  Firstly, the state act on the right to use land, in particular for the construction of this residential building, a building license. </p><p>  When signing the contract, it is necessary to carefully study all of its ‚Äúslippery‚Äù clauses.  And although you are unlikely to be able to change them, however, you will already be aware of them.  This document must necessarily indicate the number of rooms, building number of your future housing, floor.  If you are not satisfied with the layout, then after signing the regulatory contract, before <span>putting the house</span> into operation, you need to coordinate your option with the developer, obtain permission from the relevant authorities, and after that your apartment will be built with the necessary changes.  And most importantly, in the future you will not need to coordinate issues related to overhaul.  That's all, we hope your housewarming will not be overshadowed by anything. </p>
