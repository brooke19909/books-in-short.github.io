There is no doubt that this process will be effective only if the student and the students actively interact with each other. </p><p>  Bilateralness as a feature of the learning process plays a leading role, because mastering knowledge involves the cooperation of teachers and students, during which new information is acquired, skills and abilities are developed, and the creative inclinations of students are brought up and developed. </p><p>  However, although the educational process in pedagogy provides for the interaction of the teacher and students, to get strong and deep knowledge one cooperation is not enough.  It is necessary to think about how to organize the educational and <span>cognitive activities of</span> students, to constantly activate and stimulate it.  It often happens that the teacher during the explanation is forced to make remarks to the students, failing to arouse interest in the material being studied and, thus, not causing the children to acquire new knowledge.  In this case, training will not bring effectiveness. </p><p>  Attention should be paid to such a feature.  If during the interaction of the teacher and students in the learning process provides for direct contacts, then what about homework, which is an important part of domestic education.  In this case, we can hardly talk about cooperation and interaction.  Therefore, the learning process in pedagogy should be built using such methods so that it stimulates and activates the educational and cognitive activities of students in the process of mastering new knowledge, acquiring new skills, developing their creative inclinations, moral and aesthetic views and worldview. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <p>  Challenges facing the learning process </p><p>  The above allows us to formulate the most important tasks of the learning process: </p><p>  - a clear and thoughtful organization of students in the process of mastering scientific knowledge, acquiring new skills; </p><p>  - constant stimulation of cognitive and educational activities of pupils; </p><p>  - work on the development of memory, thinking, creative abilities; </p><p>  - the formation of a scientific view of the world, moral and aesthetic education; </p><p>  - Work on improving the skills acquired during training. </p><p>  Thus, the tasks of the learning process are the result of a teacher‚Äôs deep understanding of the goals that are set for training or education, as well as the conditions and ways in which they will be realized in practice. </p>

    <p>  The learning process as a system consists of the following components: learning objectives, the activities of the teacher, the activities of students, the end result.  The variables of this process include controls: this is the content of the material being studied, and the methods used in the learning process, and visual, educational, technical aids, textbooks (material means), TSO, and <span>organizational forms of learning,</span> which are educational activities of students. </p><p>  Learning objectives and their end result provide for the connection and interdependence <span>of learning tools</span> - both constant and variable.  They create unity and integrity, which have the properties of integration and are subject to common educational goals, which provide for the preparation of the younger generation for an active life and activity in modern society.  The unifying element of all these components is the joint coordinated activity of teaching and learning, the necessary component of which is communication. </p><p>  Therefore, the learning process as a system has a close relationship with the concepts of complexity and integrity.  It consists of many elements that are in close relationship with each other: educational information, goals, means of communication of the teacher and students, forms and methods by which they guide all types of students' activities. </p><p>  The most important and reliable way to get a systematic education is through training.  <span>The learning process</span> in pedagogy is a close cooperation between the student and the learner, which is aimed at achieving the goal set for learning, and designed to be the result of transformations of students' personal qualities. </p>
