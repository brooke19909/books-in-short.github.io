What can I say, Microsoft, like many other electronics manufacturers, actively supports these trends.  Why did the smartphone get such a nickname?  Why praise and scold <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 730 Dual Sim customer reviews?  Read on and we will answer all these questions. </p><h2>  General view </h2><p>  In September 2014, at IFA 2014, Nokia Vice President of Sales Chris Weber addressed the audience with an interesting topic.  He demonstrated the most famous starry selfie of the year, made by the American comedian and actress <span>Ellen Degeneres,</span> and then cursed his quality.  ‚ÄúThe world deserves more,‚Äù Chris said and announced the Lumia 730, which boasts a good 5MP front camera, which is almost 2 times better than most smartphones.  In addition, this model entered the competitive race for Instagram lovers with a convenient selfie editing application, stylish design, good features and 3G support, which makes it possible to instantly share your photo masterpieces without reference to the location.  The target audience of the Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim is, of course, young people. </p>

    <p>  Of the ports Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim has only two - for mini-USB and standard for headphones.  They are located in the middle of the bottom and top of the smartphone, respectively. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  On the back of the case you will find a camera, as well as a speaker located at the bottom right.  This somewhat degrades the sound quality of the latter, since when the phone lies on the surface, the sound is muffled.  In addition, virtually no bass.  So the speaker is loud, but it is of little use for listening to music. </p><p>  The volume ‚Äúrocker‚Äù button and the power and unlock keys are located on the right and conveniently protrude above the level of the case, so they can be easily found by touch. </p>

    <p>  Please note that there are no familiar buttons at the bottom of the screen. </p><p>  This model uses two micro SIM cards, the slots for which you will find by pulling out the battery.  There is also a slot for microSD-cards.  Unlike one of the predecessors of this model - Lumia 1520, here the ordinary user can remove the battery without special tools.  To do this, put the smartphone in an upright position, press the thumb under the camera lens and gently bend the panel with the index finger.  Do not use sharp objects, the whole procedure should be performed only with nails. </p><h2>  Screen </h2><p>  In the Lumiy lineup, the manufacturer can rightfully be proud of their screens.  Without a separate mention of the Nokia OL Lumia 730 Dual Sim HD OLED display, the review will be incomplete.  Its parameters in numbers: </p><ul><li>  diagonal of 4.7 inches; </li><li>  he conveys 16 million flowers; </li><li>  720 x 1280 resolution at 316 pixels per inch. </li></ul><p>  The colors on the display are bright and vibrant, the dark is quite saturated, so that you can safely work with your smartphone even in bright light on the street.  Viewing angles are also quite comfortable. </p><h2>  Interface </h2><p>  Initially, the Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim mobile phone was released with the updated Windows Phone 8.1, known as Denim.  It gives the user all the advantages of tiled design with the elimination of some flaws in the first version.  Necessary applications, a calendar, the Cortana voice assistant, a gallery of your images, missed calls, SMS - all this is available on the start screen.  Of course, it is customizable.  An interesting feature that users liked was the ability of some applications to ‚Äúdisguise themselves‚Äù as a background image, only the inscriptions on the highlighted squares speak of their presence.  The brightness of the screen is adjusted manually and with the help of an automatic sensor, and you can also change its sensitivity - for example, set it to maximum for working with a smartphone even in winter gloves. </p><p>  Conveniently, there is a separate tile for each SIM card, which makes it easy to track calls and messages for each of them. </p><p>  But it soon became clear that the Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim was included in the official list of smartphones suitable for installing Windows 10. This means that Microsoft guarantees its stable operation on this model.  Therefore, fans of new products can safely update their device. </p>

    <h2>  Camera software </h2><p>  In addition to the standard application that is part of Windows Phone 8.1, the Nokia 730 Dual Sim has applications designed specifically for Lumiy: </p><ul><li>  Lumia Camera - has 3 modes: photo, video and Smart Mode.  The latter allows you to make changes to the frame right in the process of shooting - to remove objects, change faces, etc. </li><li>  Lumia Cinemagraph - allows you to create GIF-images. </li><li>  Lumia Creative Studio - a program for simple photo editing, for example for applying filters, cropping, gluing panoramas, etc. </li><li>  Lumia Selfie is the highlight of the model.  The application works with both the front and the main cameras.  It has a timer for delayed shooting, <span>a face recognition system</span> (though glasses often become an insurmountable obstacle for it), as well as features for retouching the face, for example, to increase a smile, whiten teeth, increase eyes and change their color, as well as change the brightness of the picture.  In addition, it has functions for working with a monopod. </li><li>  Lumia Storyteller - a program for creating virtual photo albums.

Many note its compact size, thanks to which it can be used even with one hand, and a bright design.  Older people are happy to use the laconic dark gray smartphone Nokia Lumia 730 Dual Sim gray. </p><p>  Most applications run fast, but their launch often takes more than a second (including those that are designed to work with the camera).  But even resource-demanding games do not freeze in the process. </p><p>  A single glance of the screen is enough to assess the current situation: calls, weather and much more. </p><p>  Free preinstalled Microsoft Office also came in handy for many users. </p><p>  Assistant ‚ÄúCortana‚Äù, although inferior to ‚ÄúSiri‚Äù from Apple, but still knows how to solve simple problems: call numbers from contacts, find answers to questions on the Internet.  However, it should be noted that while it is available only to residents of the United States and China.  You can ‚Äútrick‚Äù the system and set your location in one of these countries, but Cortana will still not be able to speak Russian. </p><p>  The speakers are loud and clear.  The smartphone signal and the interlocutor's speech are clearly audible even in noisy places. </p><p>  Convenient maps make it easier to navigate the terrain, and they work even without the Internet. </p><p>  The cameras allow you to make very good shots, the quality of which is comparable to the results of smartphones with a 12 megapixel camera from other manufacturers. </p><p>  The battery holds a charge of about 1.5 days during normal operation, which is good news for buyers. </p>

    <h2>  Model flaws </h2><p>  Criticism is caused by a non-standard way of removing the back cover: not all users find the courage to do it themselves and the procedure is not very convenient.  Nevertheless, buyers claim that plastic does not leave a feeling of fragility and certainly does not break in the process.  But changing SIM-cards on the fly will be inconvenient. </p><p>  Many were surprised by the lack of the familiar camera shutter button on the right, now this function is completely transferred to applications. </p><p>  But most often, users were disappointed that still not all applications available on Android or iOS can be found on models with Windows Phone.  Many companies do not want to increase budgets for application development for the release of their versions for so far not so many fans of Windows phones. </p><p>  Rarely do users complain about system crashes for no apparent reason and heating of the smartphone while working with Wi-Fi. </p>

    <h2>  To summarize </h2><p>  Advantages of the model: </p><ul><li>  very nice, bright display; </li><li>  convenient size; </li><li>  2 great cameras; </li><li>  good battery life. </li></ul><p>  Disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  all the same, in Windows there are not many necessary applications; </li><li>  performance could be higher. </li></ul><p>  <span>Lumia 730</span> not only performs the declared functions, but also gives the user much more than promised, at an affordable price.  Thanks to this, the phone has become popular not only among young people, but also among the older generation.  It has taken its place between the high-end smartphones Lumia 1020 and 1520 and the budget Lumia 520. This makes it one of the best among the ‚Äúwindshields‚Äù on the market.  In addition, the Lumia 730 is one of the latest phones released under the Nokia brand, with which many probably have a lot of fond memories. </p><p>  In general, for those who are satisfied with Windows, or for those who choose their first smartphone, this is an excellent solution.  And ardent fans of Android and iOS should think carefully before buying. </p>
