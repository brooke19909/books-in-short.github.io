What is the reason for such wastefulness?  After all, a collector is the same businessman!  The ability to think through every step, not give in to emotions and cherish every penny are the main "levers" of his well-being. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="coin 5 kopecks 1981" class="if uuid-2766822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2766822.jpg"></div><p>  Experts advise people in bins in which one (and even more so several!) Soviet five-copeck coin, regardless of the year in which it was minted, be in a hurry to put it up for sale under the hammer. </p><p>  As for the 5 kopecks in 1981, its price will still rise, experts say.  Therefore, the coin should not be put up for sale now at either virtual or any other auctions.  You can only periodically inquire about the current value of a coin without taking serious steps. </p><p>  Such a treasure, experts say, is better to save for a rainy day and hope that this day never comes. </p><h2>  How much does a coin of 5 kopecks 1981 cost at virtual auctions? </h2><p>  The cost of the lot ‚ÄúFive-copeck coin of 1981‚Äù depends primarily on how well it is preserved.  A coin of the same denomination and year of issue, at the disposal of the same owner, may look different. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The view depends on how many people used it before it was in the hands of a particular owner. </p><p>  A person who is not knowledgeable in numismatics will not be able to independently determine in what condition the coin at his disposal.  Numismatists experts will help establish the degree of preservation and the exact value of money to a novice collector.  To obtain comprehensive information on a topic of interest to him, a beginner should contact the experts using the feedback form.  Having uploaded to the virtual auction website a photo (the photo must be high resolution) of the reverse and the obverse of the coin, he will soon receive an answer what kind of coin it is and how much it can be earned for. </p><p>  A novice should be prepared for the fact that the examination may take some time, usually from one to three days. </p><h2>  Coin value may vary </h2><p>  It is known that the price of a five-kopeck coin minted in 1981 changed sharply from year to year - it soared rapidly, then it dropped literally to several rubles. </p><p>  In the summer of 2017, the minimum price of 5 kopecks 1981, put up at a virtual auction, was 600 rubles plus or minus 20 rubles. </p><p>  In August of this year, the average cost of a similar lot reached 334 rubles.  As can be seen from the messages left by collectors at one of the numismatic forums, today they are ready to buy Soviet coins on the terms of their holders and generously pay for a small change that 37 years ago was not considered money at all. </p><p>  It is also known that in 2015, from May to July, the average price of the same coin - 5 kopecks of the 1981 issue - did not exceed five rubles. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Description of the five-cents coin of 1981 </h2><p>  The 1981 ‚Äú5 kopecks‚Äù loose change coin was minted from an alloy of copper and zinc.  The edge, whose width is 1.5 millimeters, has a ribbed structure and is dotted with vertical notches.  The weight of the five-penny coin is 5 grams, the thickness is 1.5 millimeters, and its diameter is 25 millimeters. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allnumis.com" data-author=": Alain Martineau, "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 kopecks 1981" class="if uuid-2766823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2766823.jpg"></div><p>  The obverse depicts a standard set of elements - a symbol of the state (a sickle and a hammer against the background of the globe), illuminated from below by the rays of an ascending star.  The upper quarter of the solar disk appears above the junction of wheat spikelets, fifteen times tied with ribbons (according to the number of union republics).  At the point of convergence of the tops of the ears there is a five-pointed star.  The lower part of the obverse is abbreviated "USSR". </p><h2>  Distinctive characteristics of the reverse of a five-copeck coin </h2><div class="photo" data-original="coins.lave.ru" data-author=": Talkabout75, "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 kopecks 1981 price" class="if uuid-2766824" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2766824.jpg"></div><p>  The layout of the reverse of the coin of 5 kopecks in 1981 is noticeably different from the design developed for the trifles of larger denomination.  Here, as on other coins, the denomination is applied. </p><div class="photo" data-original="picclick.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="5 kopecks 1981" class="if uuid-2766825" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2766825.jpg"></div><p>  The difference between a five-copeck coin and all other bargaining coins of the Soviet Union is that the figure ‚Äúfive‚Äù occupies almost half of the reverse area.  Immediately beneath the number is the word ‚Äúcents‚Äù, which indicates the year the coin was put into circulation. </p><p>  Along the edge of the coin, wheat sheaves traditionally "spike" (one on each side), forming an open wreath around the main inscriptions.  At the bottom, the spikelets are decorated with a shell, and a little higher are entwined with oak foliage. </p>
