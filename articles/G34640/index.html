For tourists it is guaranteed a fascinating journey through the charming streets and wonderful sights of the city. </p><h2>  City of Toledo </h2><p>  Sights in Spain, both architectural and historical, are in almost all cities, all of which are of particular interest to tourists.  Toledo can be called a museum that stores the imprints of several eras, brutal wars, religious and political events. </p><p>  This is the ancient capital of the state of Spain, as well as one of the most wonderful places on the planet.  No wonder the famous painter El Greco, inspired by his love for this city, captured various corners of his in his many works.  The city keeps traces of the most different periods.

They form a kind of labyrinth in which it is quite possible to get lost without having a tourist map of the city or a guidebook with you.  By the way, they can be purchased at the bus station or railway station. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is important for tourists to know that it is impossible to visit all the sights of Toledo in a short time.
