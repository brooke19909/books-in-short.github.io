This article provides information about the <span>River Garden Holiday Village</span> 4 * hotel (formerly called River Garden Residence 4 *). </p><h2>  Belek </h2><p>  Belek is located between the ancient city of Side and fashionable Antalya (35 km). </p><p>  This popular center of international tourism is considered the most respectable, prestigious and comfortable, therefore there are not many noisy young people here, middle-aged tourists, often with children, predominate. </p><p>  People come to this region to admire the amazing nature of the national reserve, and guests of the River Garden Hotel can relax among the green forests of cypress, cedar, eucalyptus and pine trees. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that Belek is called "bird paradise."  More than a hundred species of rare birds live here, including the symbol of Belek - the famous barn owl or owl "tuto-alba" (the same snow-white owl that brought letters to Harry Potter). </p><p>  The reserve is famous not only for birds, but also for Caretta-Caretta turtles (meter-long sea turtles with a large head), which have been sailing to Belek's beaches for 100 million years to lay their eggs here. </p><p>  Belek is a major international golf center, fans of this sport come from many countries here. </p><h2>  Climate and beaches </h2><p>  Belek has a mild Mediterranean <span>subtropical climate.</span>  It is dry and hot in summer (38-40 ° C), wet and warm in winter (15 <sup>°</sup> C). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The sea warms up in summer to 27 ° C, and in winter maintains a temperature of 17 ° C. </p><p>  Tourists living in the Belek River Garden have the opportunity to swim on the beautiful beaches of Belek, which is almost a continuous beach strip for 20 km. </p><p>  All beaches are clean and even, regularly cleaned, well equipped and covered with sand.  There are more blue flags than in Antalya, and magnificent eucalyptus and pine groves descend directly to the sea waves. </p>

The bus is often crowded.  In addition, the last flight at 18.00, so I can’t walk on the beach in the evening. </li><li>  In the cottages an uncomfortable <span>spiral staircase</span> to the second floor is narrow and steep. </li><li>  There is no clear cleaning schedule in the room - the maid can drop in at any time. </li><li>  If there was no cleaning, then ants were noticed in the rooms. </li><li>  Sometimes there is a smell in the toilet. </li><li>  In the evenings it’s boring, animators play lotto, sing karaoke - not everyone likes it. </li><li>  Highchairs in the restaurant must be washed by ourselves. </li><li>  Sauna and hammam were heated only for the purchase of a paid massage session. </li><li>  Freshly squeezed juices are tasteless. </li><li>  After 20.00 you can’t swim in the pools (cleaning is in progress). </li><li>  On TVs, the volume limit is set (so as not to interfere with the neighbors) - so some people have difficulty hearing. </li></ul><h2>  Travel Tips </h2><p>  Experienced travelers give the following tips for travelers planning to relax at the River Garden: </p><ul><li>  Report your discontent to the Russian tour operator, and appropriate action will be taken immediately. </li><li>  On Skype, it is better to speak from the territory by the river or near the reception. </li><li>  You should not buy goods and souvenirs during the "Turkish Nights" (in the neighboring village of Kadriye prices are 5 times cheaper). </li><li>  A good bazaar in Belek is located between Ataturk and Aligentikaya streets. </li><li>  A wide selection of gemstone jewelry can be found at Aspendos Jewelry and Center Kucukbelkis Koyu, which are located between Antalya and Aspendos. </li><li>  Take beach shoes. </li></ul><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The River Garden Hotel Complex is an excellent, tranquil hotel for middle-aged tourists and families with children. </p><p>  Excellent food, the fabulous sea and nature of the reserve, good living conditions and a high level of service contribute to a pleasant stay. </p><p>  Youth and party lovers should choose a different hotel and resort area. </p>
