Not everyone knows how to get to the shopping center, so not everyone you meet can answer your question.  The easiest way to get to the mall is with a branded bus belonging to the supermarket.  It departs from the metro stations Planernaya, Rechnoy Vokzal, and Mitino.  It will not be difficult to find this bus, since it has a plate with the name of the final destination.  Using this bus, you will reach directly to the shopping center.  It should be noted that from Sunday to Thursday (inclusive), the bus makes flights from 9.00 to 23.00.  As for Friday and Saturday, he goes to 00.30. </p><h2></h2><h2>  Regular bus </h2><p>  But a branded supermarket bus is not the only way to get to MEGA Khimki.  How to get to this shopping center?  You can take the metro to a certain station and transfer to a regular bus or fixed-route taxi that goes to this shopping center.  If you reach the metro station "Planernaya", then at the exit you should turn left.  Then go forward, without turning anywhere, to the traffic lights, and then turn left again.
