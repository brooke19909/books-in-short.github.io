The center of culture and education living a busy life is the capital of the region of the same name. </p><h2>  Moors-based city </h2><p>  The mysterious <span>Murcia (Spain),</span> whose sights are little known to travelers, is located on the banks of the Segura River, in the south-east of the country. </p><p>  A modern city with developed infrastructure was founded in the 9th century by the Moors, who turned the village into a ‚Äúgreenhouse‚Äù of the state, and later throughout Europe, creating unique irrigation systems.  Over time, an independent kingdom was captured by King Alfonso X, annexing the fertile lands to Castile. </p><p>  Since the 18th century, the economic growth of the city began thanks to the development of the silk industry.  It was then that the sights that became the hallmark of the city of Murcia (Spain) appeared. </p><p>  In the 19th century, many misfortunes fell on the capital of the region: looting by Napoleonic troops, numerous earthquakes and plague epidemics.  This period of instability lasted a very long time, and only in recent decades did the development of the tourism sector, bringing income to the treasury, begin. </p><h2>  Monteagudo Castle and the statue of Christ </h2><p>  The seventh largest city in the country is positioned as a wonderful place for relaxation and sightseeing, closely related to the ancient history of Murcia. </p><p>  Tourists approaching the resort immediately pay attention to the towering <span>statue of Jesus Christ.</span>  The sculpture standing on Mount Monteagudo is an exact copy of the one that was cast in 1926.  During the revolution, the statue was destroyed, and after 25 years a 14-meter figure of the Savior appeared. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Murcia Spain Attractions" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1362113.jpg" width="600"></div>

The defensive structure built on a high mountain served as an excellent observation post.  The guards on duty around the clock gave signals to the valiant warriors of the city with the help of smoke and fire.  At one time, the fortress served as a prison for criminals, a granary and a warehouse. </p><p>  Ancient Murcia (Spain) is rightly proud of a well-preserved historical monument.  Sightseeing is of great interest among tourists, however, to climb to the top of the cliff on their own is not possible due to the fact that this is a very dangerous place with voids in the ground. </p><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  The unique urban architecture has absorbed several eras, but has not lost its national flavor.  The most famous historical monument is the <span>Gothic cathedral</span> in Murcia, erected on the site of a mosque.  It is noteworthy that the almost one-hundred-meter-high tower decorating the city‚Äôs buildings is made in the best traditions of the Renaissance, and the beautiful facade is a wonderful example of Baroque. </p><p>  Renovated after the destruction in the 16th century, the cathedral is decorated around the perimeter with statues of saints, which gives the grandeur and <span>effect of the presence of the</span> righteous in each service. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral in Murcia" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1362114.jpg" width="600"></div>

The 200-meter construction is particularly stable, and after the use of metal frames, the Old Bridge was significantly expanded. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="old bridge" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1362116.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The main theater of Spain </h2><p>  In the 19th century, Queen Isabel II opened a theater here, which was later named after the local actor H. Romea.  The building, made in the Roman style, is famous not only for its beautiful facade, but also for its elegant decoration, the beauty of which is breathtaking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="romea theater" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1362118.jpg" width="600"></div>
