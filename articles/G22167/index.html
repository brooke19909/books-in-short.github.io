Perhaps the most famous buildings recognized as genuine masterpieces of art were created during the reign of the Mughals.  The people speak of a powerful dynasty like this: "Rulers began as titans, but ended as jewelers." </p><h2>  Agra, preserving the masterpieces of world art </h2><p>  The ancient <span>capital of India,</span> which is a major tourist center, is recognized as a real world treasury, which is famous for the most beautiful buildings protected by UNESCO.  The majestic city of Agra, several centuries ago, was the capital of the Mughal state, and the name of one of the rulers - Shah-Jahan - went down in history thanks to the most famous mausoleum, built in memory of his beloved wife.  Experts attribute the surviving masterpiece to the greatest monuments of not only architectural, but also jewelry. </p>

    <p>  The <span>Mughal Emperor</span> Shah Jahan brought the traditions of national architecture to perfection, and the luxurious Taj Mahal, recognized by hundreds of thousands of tourists, is recognized as the pinnacle of creativity.  For the first time, the masters of padishah used white marble as a building material.  However, not only the mausoleum complex, which produces a stunning effect on visitors, brought glory to the former capital of the country. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A snow-white mosque located in the center of the Red Fort </h2><p>  Here is the Red Fort, shaped like a crescent, whose style harmoniously combines elements of Hindu and Islamic architecture.  It is a unique ensemble consisting of six royal palaces, where there were personal chambers of rulers, and two mosques.  Now an amazing red brick fortification is partially open to foreign guests, and on its territory is a wonderful marble masterpiece.  Arab, Hindu, Persian motifs served as the basis for the style, named after the emperor - shahdzhehani. </p>

    <p>  In the very heart of it is located the decoration not only of the ancient capital of the country, but of the whole of India - the Pearl Mosque erected by ingenious masters during the reign of the Padishah.  Agra is proud of the greatest creation, built under a slight slope.  The shining domes of the building, repeating all the surface irregularities, seem even higher when approaching. </p><h2>  Luxury building </h2><p>  Lined with white marble, the Moti Masjid liturgical structure, towering over a bright red fort, is recognized as one of the most popular tourist spots.  The brilliant dome of the mosque, mesmerizing with special beauty, shimmers in the sunlight under shades that resemble the color of a pearl.  It seems that it is really made of stone that does not require cutting.  That is why the religious and historical landmark got its beautiful name, and the locals often call the mosque "mother of pearl." </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof agra" class="if" height="413" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1564632.jpg" width="600"></div>

The luxury of an architectural masterpiece amazes even many tourists who have seen it.  The amazing Pearl Mosque (Agra) is crowned by lined up three snow-white domes that are incredibly similar to those that adorn the St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. </p><h2>  Aerial architectural design </h2><p>  The building, which appeared in the 17th century and has perfect architectural proportions, seems light and airy due to the color and a large number of passages.  White marble, which lined the domes, so similar to pearl beads, gives them a delightful mother of pearl shade, and the roof itself is erected on the sandy walls of purple.  A monolithic piece of black marble, reminiscent of a prayer rug, is mounted in the floor of the mosque. </p><h2>  Galleries where you can pray alone </h2><p>  Decorated with Persian-style ornaments, the Pearl Mosque (Agra) is famous for its picturesque garden located along the spacious courtyard of a stone masterpiece, and covered carved galleries with passages that are supported by high arches.  A significant number of departments is due to the fact that everyone wanted to be alone in the room and offer their prayers to God at any time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mosques of india" class="if" height="402" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1564633.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Pearl Mosques of India </h2><p>  I must say that Muslim Indian architecture is incredibly diverse, and during the reign of the Mughals, a new era of mosque construction began.  Unique structures arose, the fame of which spread throughout the world.  The first mosque in the country, Cheraman Juma, was erected in the 7th century, and ten centuries later the Moti Masjid prayer building in Delhi, built by the son of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb, appeared.  It received the unofficial name of Pearl Mosque. </p><p>  Agra is not the only city where an example of religious architecture is located, whose domes sparkle in the sun like a gem.  Moti Masjin consists of two minarets and four corner towers.  The mosque is called the chapel of Aurangzeb - the Padishah of the Great Mughals, in which the empire reached its greatest power. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="white marble" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1564626.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  It is believed that the ribbed domes of the bulbous form indicate the origin of the Baroque style in architecture.  Initially, they were gilded, but after the Sipay uprising, the ruined heads of the mosque were restored in white marble, which plays beautifully in the light.  A mini-copy of the building in Delhi is Moti Masjid, built in Bhopal in the 19th century by order of the queen of the city.  During the reign of Sikander Jahan Begum, the influence of the Mughal architecture was noticeably strong, therefore this building is of particular interest to tourists. </p><p>  A visit to distant India gives a lot of positive emotions and genuine aesthetic pleasure.  Acquaintance with architectural sights plunges into the mysterious atmosphere of antiquity, and everyone who has visited the country, bewitching with a special flavor, keeps it warm in its heart. </p>
