The powers themselves arise and disappear from the <span>political map of the world.</span>  It may happen that one state joins another, or maybe vice versa: once a single country is split into pieces, like once the Soviet Union.  More often, such changes occur with capitals.  After all, even with the inviolability of state cordons and political stability, the country's government can decide to transfer the main city to another locality.  One does not have to go far for an example: in 1997, the <span>capital of Kazakhstan was</span> moved from Alma-Ata to Astana.  When the state splits, and some parts begin to exist separately, new administrative centers appear.  In this article we will discuss several issues: which European capital is the largest;  the oldest;  the newest and the best.  Of course, there is no city that could satisfy all these indicators.  But still... </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="list of European capitals in alphabetical order" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1206078.jpg" width="566"></div>

    <h2>  List of European capitals in alphabetical order </h2><p>  In order not to get confused, let's remember all the main cities of this <span>part of the world.</span>  There are currently forty-four states in Europe.  Total 44 capitals.  And if you consider Turkey, which at least the edge, but still "stands" in Europe, then all forty-five.  Some capitals are huge both in area and in population.  In others, all residents know each other by sight.  But about the sizes later.  Now we’ll just list which capitals in European countries.  If we recall the cities with the letter "A", then it will be Athens, the Dutch Amsterdam and the high mountains of Andorra la Vella.  The list with the letter “B” is more extensive.  These are Bucharest, Belgrade, Brussels, Berlin, Bratislava, Bern and Budapest.  No less than capitals and the letter "B".  It is a city-state of the Vatican, Vaduz, Vilnius, Warsaw, Vienna and Valletta.  Next up are Dublin and Zagreb.  Three capitals with the letter "K" - Copenhagen, Chisinau and Kiev.  The four main cities begin with the letter “L”: Lisbon, Luxembourg, Ljubljana and London.  The same amount - on the "M": Moscow, Madrid, Monaco and Minsk.  Alphabetically follows Oslo.  By the letter "P" we have Paris, Podgorica, Prague.  Under the letter "R" means Rome, Riga and Reykjavik.  Here are the capitals whose name begins with "C": Sarajevo, San Marino, Skopje, Stockholm and Sofia.  There are two main cities under the letter "T" - Tirana and Tallinn.  And closes the alphabetical list of Helsinki.  If we consider Turkey to be a <span>European country</span> , then Ankara should also be added to the list.  Although this city is located in Asia. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="European capital" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1205811.jpg" width="600"></div>

Younger settlements appeared, which were located near trade routes and other important highways.  Thus, these “upstarts” very quickly overshadowed the former capitals.  And they drew the glory of the main altar city.  Nevertheless, six European capitals have a very respectable age.  These are Athens, Rome, Belgrade, Lisbon, Skopje and Paris.  And if we take into account that the city, which is a theocratic state, is located right on the Vatican hill in the <span>capital of Italy</span> , their number rises to seven.  Which one is the oldest European capital?  Of course, this is Athens.  The capital of modern Greece was first mentioned in chronicles as far back as the 15th century.  BC  e., that is, about three and a half thousand years ago!  By the way, Belgrade could also claim the title if the contest was held in the category "The oldest city from the European capitals of our time."  It is mentioned in many historical sources at the same times as Athens.  But he was a modest Celtic settlement called Singidunum.  Well, the Eternal City of Rome was founded later than Athens - in 753 BC.  e.  Paris (in antiquity Lutetia), Skopje and Lisbon appeared on the world map also before our era. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="famous european capital" class="if" height="375" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1205802.jpg" width="600"></div>

The largest European capital is Moscow, with its nearly twelve million people.  Second place is taken by London.  It was founded in the year 43 by the Romans.  Now eight and a half million people live there.  Well, Berlin closes the top three.  Three and a half million people live in the new <span>capital of Germany</span> .  Kiev is breathing into her neck (2.8 million people). </p><h2>  The youngest capitals of Europe </h2><p>  This issue needs to be taken seriously.  If we proceed from the fact that the city has recently become the capital, the answer will be as follows: Bratislava.  But this settlement is by no means new.  On the contrary, the city boasts a centuries-old history.  By the way, Bratislava has repeatedly been the capital.  But on the modern map of Europe, she with this status appeared only after the split of Czechoslovakia.  And if suddenly Catalonia achieves independence and becomes an independent state, then Barcelona will become the youngest capital.  But the history of this city is also rooted in antiquity.  But what is the youngest European <span>capital?</span>  <span>This is</span> Madrid.  In 1561, the capital of the Kingdom of Spain was moved from Toledo to a small town. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="The youngest European capital" class="if" height="296" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1205791.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  The best European capital </h2><p>  Citizens of each country believe that their main city is the most beautiful.  And here it’s hard to argue.  But if you interview tourists, which European capital seems most beautiful to them, then most of the respondents will name Prague.  But if we take the factor of well-being and comfort as a measure, the result will be different.  Helsinki.  In the nomination “The Greenest Capital”, Stockholm and Warsaw hold the palm. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="best european capital" class="if" height="394" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1206062.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Other leaders </h2><p>  A city of romance, a haven of lovers, a trendsetter ... As soon as Paris is not called!  This is perhaps the most famous European capital.  Highest above sea level is Andorra la Vella.  And Monaco leads in the number of casinos per capita. </p>
