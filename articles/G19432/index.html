    <p>  There are many positive reviews of people who were dancing here in a choreographic circle, who mastered musical instruments, as well as the art of creating beautiful crafts and origami.  After three weeks spent in this paradise, many do not want to leave, and they would like to stay longer.  Well, the sanatorium is always ready to receive old guests again. </p><h2>  Why is the sanatorium approach so true? </h2><p>  They say that nowadays everything can be cured with the help of tablets, but the sanatorium‚Äôs management does not agree with this point of view, recognizing that there are many other methods that are more useful for treatment.  And in this they are right.  Parents bring their children here and come just because they don‚Äôt want to become hostages of chemicals and turn their children into ‚Äúvegetables‚Äù from a young age. </p><p>  The main goal here is not to drown out the symptoms, as happens most often with medical treatment, but to get rid of the very causes of the disease. </p><p>  The environment and partly our lifestyle influence us in many ways.  For permanent health, it would be ideal to change both.  But often people simply do not have such an opportunity. </p>

To this you can add your own habits of not getting enough sleep or eating irregularly.  A couple more of these factors - and we can talk about ready-made soil for weakening immunity.  The task of the sanatorium is not only to patch up your weakened flesh.  It is not even limited to the spiritual development that you will receive here in full.  The most important thing is to establish a person‚Äôs right habits that will lead him to good condition and the absence of disease.
