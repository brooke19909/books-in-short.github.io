Formation of an insurance pension</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Since 2015, the procedure for calculating pensions has changed.  Now, the calculation of cash payments according to the seniority of a citizen is carried out taking into account the IPC, that is, the individual pension coefficient is calculated based on which a person will receive a certain amount of money every month.  A similar system has long existed in the West and in Europe.  However, if the procedure is quite understandable for the inhabitants of these countries, then this program is not yet completely obvious to the Russians. </p>

    <h2>  The value of the <span>individual pension coefficient (IPC):</span> what is it? </h2><p>  Previously, in order to start receiving a pension, a citizen had only to indicate his seniority and confirm it with documents.  But since 2015, future retirees can independently regulate their retirement income.  For <span>this, the pension</span> is divided into several parts: funded and insurance.  The latter can be fixed and settlement. </p><p>  In this case, a citizen must meet several important parameters: </p><ul><li>  Have an insurance experience of at least 15 years. </li><li>  Reach retirement age. </li><li>  Provide data that confirm that the retirement rate was at least 30 points for the entire length of service. </li></ul>

    <p>  In order to better understand the concept of the value of the individual pension coefficient (IPC), what it is and how it is calculated, it is worth considering in more detail several important aspects.  This is what we will do. </p><h2>  What is the insurance part of the pension </h2><p>  This concept means the conditions for calculating future retirement benefits.

    <p>  Pension insurance part - what is it and what is it made of?  In the process of calculating this part of the pension payment, the algorithm of insurance cases is used.  These include access to a well-deserved rest.  The main condition for such an insured event is the age of the person. </p><p>  Today, men over 60 years of age and the fairer sex, who are already 55 years old, can count on retirement. </p><h2>  How to increase the percentage of the insurance part of the pension </h2><p>  In order to increase the size of an individual pension coefficient, and, accordingly, the volume of insurance, it is necessary to receive a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù salary throughout the entire labor activity.  This means that for the entire time of work, certain percentages must be deducted to the state‚Äôs account, which will be taken into account in determining the points for a particular citizen. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As a rule, up to 22% of the salary is usually deducted for future retirement. </p><h2>  What else does IPC depend on </h2><p>  Continuing to consider the concept of the value of the individual pension coefficient (IPC), what it is and how it is calculated, it is worth considering not only the amount of wages, but also other aspects.  For example, as mentioned earlier, insurance premiums for different citizens may differ depending on the distribution of the funded and insurance part of pension payments.  For some, they make up 6%, while for some they reach 16%. </p><p>  Also, when making calculations, the life circumstances of the future pensioner are taken into account.  If he served or continues to serve in the army or is forced to care for young children or incompetent relatives, then the IPC may be increased.  Today, the state has created a lot of special programs for such cases. </p><h2>  How is the annual IPC calculated? </h2><p>  Prior to 2015, the government had compiled an individual pension coefficient formula, which is as follows: PC = MF / S, where: </p><ul><li>  PC represents the total amount of pension points of a particular citizen. </li><li>  MF - this is part of the insurance (taking into account the deduction of the fixed and funded part of the pension). </li><li>  C represents the value of the IPC at the time of calculation. </li></ul>

    <p>  According to this formula, it is quite easy to independently calculate the amount of accumulated points.  Accordingly, in order to find out what pension compensation awaits a citizen, it is not necessary to contact the FIU.  The only thing that needs to be clarified is the benefit rate, which can be 6%, 10% or 16%. </p><p>  In order to independently calculate the GIPK, it is necessary to use the following equation: GIPK = (SM / MV) * ‚Äã‚Äã10, where: </p><ul><li>  SM will be a payment of contributions at the selected tariff (in percent). </li><li>  MV is a fixed level of making payments, which will be 16%. </li></ul><p>  Thanks to this equation, it is possible to determine exactly how many points a future pensioner could accumulate for all his working activities.  If at the same time a citizen refuses the funded component of pension payments, then he will be able to partially increase the annual rate.  Accordingly, the amount of the allowance will also be higher. </p>

    <p>  As mentioned earlier, the <span>higher the</span> pensioner's <span>score</span> , the greater the share of payments.  However, it is worth considering that there is a maximum <span>IPC (individual pension coefficient),</span> which is 7.38 points.  To receive it, during the year a citizen must receive the maximum salary. </p><h2>  Calculation Example </h2><p>  To make it easier to deal with all the intricacies of the IPC, consider an example.  Suppose a certain citizen decided to independently calculate how many points she could already accumulate for her labor activity and how much she still needed in order to receive monthly payments in the amount of 25,000 rubles. </p><p>  The fixed part of the insurance pension is usually 4559 rubles.  At the same time, a pension equal to 18,300 rubles is accrued to the woman. </p><p>  Accordingly, the amount of payments for the future pensioner will amount to 13 741 rubles (we take away from the 18 300 fixed insurance part). </p><p>  To calculate the IPC, divide 13 741 by 74.28 and get about 185 points.  This is the desired value.  If you make several reverse calculations, it is easy to find out that in order to receive 25,000 rubles a pensioner must accumulate another 90 points per month. </p>

    <h2>  How much is IPC </h2><p>  By and large, the cost of this indicator is a specific number, which is determined by the state annually.  For example, in 2015, the IPC was equal to 64 rubles, and in February 2016, due to the general increase in inflation, this indicator increased to 74 rubles.  This year, the cost of this ratio is 78 rubles with a penny. </p><p>  If a pensioner earns a larger IPC, then only the maximum possible indicator will be taken into account. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Undoubtedly, it seems to every pensioner that the independent calculation of future payments is a very complicated procedure.  In fact, everything is not so scary.  The main thing is to learn how to use the necessary formulas and determine the percentage of parts of the pension.  If necessary, you can visit the Pension Fund and ask for a preliminary calculation of pension payments. </p><p>  Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to understand that the situation is constantly changing.  Perhaps in a few years, the calculation of pensions and their indexation will be carried out using other formulas.  However, seniority will always be an unchanged component of benefits of this type. </p>
