New building in Balashikha</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Magnificent Moscow is upset at a gigantic pace.  Every year new modern complexes appear here, erected according to modern standards.  However, many Muscovites seek to acquire housing not in the polluted capital, but in its suburbs, where there are no environmental problems, and apartments are in no way inferior to Moscow.  LCD "Sacramento" in Balashikha meets all these requirements.  The complex, named after a distant city in California, was built near a pine forest, which makes it possible for the lucky people who bought apartments here to enjoy clean healing air filled with volatile products every day.  This LCD has other features, which are described in detail in our article. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  It is difficult to say for sure how convenient a place has been chosen for the new Sacramento housing complex.  Balashikha is the largest city of the Moscow Region closest to it.  The managers of the developer claim that it is no more than 5 km from its center, but the maps show about 8 km from the Sacramento house to the city administration building.  Gorkovskoye Shosse passes right next to the ZhK, passing into the Enthusiasts highway.  On it to the Moscow Ring Road a little more than 13 km.  For everyone working in <span>Moscow, this</span> could be a big plus if it were not for constant traffic jams, because of which during the rush hours you have to spend more than an hour on the road to the capital or metro stations.  The Sacramento residential complex was erected in a beautiful place, but somewhat detached. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Sacramento" class="if" height="323" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739896.jpg" width="501"></div>  Adjacent to it is the Novsky administrative district, geographically also related to Balashikha, but here all the buildings are of rural type, and there is practically no developed infrastructure.  In this area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBalashikha, gardening partnerships are mainly located and agricultural land extends.  The closest urban community to the complex is VNIIPO.  There is a kindergarten, a church and a number of shops, but the residents of Sacramento need to drive 3 km.  If you move along the Gorky highway in the direction of Obukhovo, you can see new microdistricts in the villages of Shchemilovo and Novaya Kupavna, to which, respectively, 3 and 5 km.  Here in such an environment owners of apartments in Sacramento will live.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Transport accessibility </h2><p>  This issue is a priority for everyone who works in Moscow.  Among such people, real estate in Balashikha is in high demand, since prices here are about half that of the capital, and getting to work / from work is very easy, because the center of Balashikha is located only 5 km from the Moscow Ring Road.  At the same time, there are train stops in the city, where you can get to the Kursk station in 40 minutes, and in just half an hour to the Rimskaya or Ilyich Square metro stations.  There are many shuttle buses in the city that go to various metro stations.  A somewhat different situation with transport in the Sacramento residential complex, although it also administratively refers to Balashikha. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sacramento Balashikha" class="if" height="334" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739898.jpg" width="505"></div>  On the Gorky highway, just opposite the housing complex, there is a bus stop.  Residents of the farthest houses need to walk about 700 meters to it.  Several buses of public transport routes stop here, the interval of which is 20 minutes or more.  They can take you to the metro stations ‚ÄúPerovo‚Äù, ‚ÄúNovogireevo‚Äù, ‚ÄúIzmailovskaya‚Äù and ‚ÄúPartizanskaya‚Äù.  The problem is that, according to the residents of Sacramento, who have already moved into their apartments, at peak times, all buses go crowded, and taking into account traffic jams it takes more than an hour to get to the metro.  Approximately the same situation with a trip to Moscow by train from Balashov.  To get to the train station  platforms, residents of the new LCD need to spend at least 30-40 minutes.

Balashikha, from an environmental point of view, is considered a relatively prosperous city, built surrounded by forests and lakes.  There are few large enterprises polluting the environment.  Some remoteness of the described new microdistrict excludes this unfavorable factor.  Planners allocated a place for the Sacramento a little off the highway, surrounded by a wonderful pine forest.  According to the residents, it is very easy to breathe here, in the forest you can take wonderful walks, have picnics, and pick mushrooms and berries in the fall.  On the other side of the Gorky Highway on the territory of the Novsky District there are several rivers and ponds, the nearest of which is no more than 700 meters from the residential complex.  Two cemeteries are also located here, but they do not interfere with the residents of Sacramento. </p><p>  Perhaps the only drawback to prosperity at Sacramento is the nearby military training ground.  Military exercises are often held here, and gunfire and helicopter flights are arranged even on weekends. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="new building in Balashikha" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739879.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <h2>  Who is building </h2><p>  The developer of the Sacramento neighborhood is GC Morton.  In Russia, until recently, it ranked third in terms of sales of square meters of real estate.  Her most famous projects, commissioned in recent years, are the Butovo, Zavidnoye, Solntsevo Park, Levoberezhny, Mitino Park, Yaroslavsky housing complexes and others.  ‚ÄúMorton‚Äù is famous for building on a large-scale, fast and fairly high quality, it always brings its objects to the end, does not shake the nerves of interest-holders with long-term construction.  But there are features in the principles of the company.  Some of them have already encountered residents of commissioned and populated Sacramento-1.  The main claims relate to the high density of development practiced at Morton Group of Companies, and promises to build a developed infrastructure in the micro-districts being built by the company, to provide comfort there with transport interchanges, and to provide a responsible management company.  In fact, all this is not always and immediately performed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="property in Balashikha" class="if" height="326" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739892.jpg" width="502"></div>  Regarding the Sacramento complex, we can say that the building density is low here, since the conditions allow expanding the territory of the microdistrict towards the forest.  But the rest is not very rosy.  Plus, starting from the first stage, the company postponed the deadlines for the delivery of houses several times.  As a result, the houses of the first stage were late for almost a year.  Perhaps, for Sacramento residents who have already moved into their apartments, and for investors who are still waiting for the keys, the situation will change for the better, since in October 2016 Morton merged with PIK Group of Companies, known as very reliable and responsible developer.  Since that time, the Morton brand has been discontinued.

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  LCD "Sacramento": description </h2><p>  This housing complex differs from the others built by Morton in that it was planned to erect only low-rise buildings, to allocate a large house area for everyone and, thus, create for the apartment owners something between urban and rural life.  30 hectares have been allocated for development, on which 89 houses are planned to be erected.  They are designed for a total of 2100 inhabitants.  Most of the buildings in Sacramento are two, three or four-story.  The new PIK developer began the construction of four buildings in 7-8 floors located in the immediate vicinity of the kindergarten.  Their numbers are 1, 2, 4 and 5. The whole complex is so large that several streets have formed in it - Bereznyakova, Sosnovaya, Dubovaya, Meshchera and Dobroselskaya.  The distance between the houses here is at least 70-100 meters, which creates a feeling of freedom and space.  In addition, near many buildings there is an opportunity to break up small gardens or flower beds, which is so liked by the townspeople who love to mess around with the ground.  According to the general plan, the builder ennobles the territory in the microdistrict, creates lawns, equips ground parking spaces, builds bright multi-functional playgrounds, high-quality sports grounds, cozy recreation areas.  The entire territory of the complex, both from the forest and from the Gorky highway, is fenced. </p><p>  In general, this new building in Balashikha looks very attractive.  It is difficult to find two absolutely identical buildings here.  All of them were built according to individual projects, and each has some zest.  So, there are several cases-boxes in the style of a classic panel building, there are cases like houses in the French province with an attic top floor and a new type of buildings with panoramic glazing of very spacious loggias.  The facades in them are made using seamless technology, which is very important for prefabricated buildings, as it provides heat saving in apartments.  A big plus for new settlers is their own boiler room, which runs smoothly.  Therefore, even in severe frosts in apartments "Sacramento" maintain a comfortable temperature for living, and hot water is supplied around the clock. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="GC Morton" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739881.jpg" width="503"></div>

    <h2>  Infrastructure </h2><p>  This question is one of the most painful for apartment owners in the Sacramento residential complex.  The infrastructure here is still very weak.  In the general plan of the former developer "Morton" was the construction of a kindergarten, school, shops, consumer services, a clinic, a dairy kitchen for children, even a restaurant and cafe in this microdistrict.  At the moment, almost nothing has been built from the listed objects.  In the immediate vicinity of the complex there is one night shop with high prices for all goods, a supermarket "Summer Resident" with goods for the garden, and a Miratorg store with a small assortment.  Pyaterochka, a favorite of Muscovites, is 2 km in the village of Zeleniy, and Magnit supermarket is located in the Novoye Biserovo microdistrict, also located 2 km from the Sakramento residential complex.  Of course, there are many supermarkets and shops with various categories of goods in Balashikha.  You need to go to them either by car, or 6-8 bus stops.  But for car enthusiasts at the exit of the complex right near the bus stop there are two auto parts and enamel shops, a car wash, tire fitting, service stations, several gas stations. </p><p>  So far, only playgrounds and a Chippolino kindergarten have been built for children at Sacramento, about 700 meters from the farthest Bereznyakova Street.  An ambiguous situation arose with the school.  Initially, she was in the general plan.  Subsequently, an apartment building appeared in its place.  According to the statements of the Morton representatives, the school was removed because the building standards for the construction of such social facilities have changed.  The new PIK developer assures residents of the Sacramento residential complex that the school will definitely be, but not in the microdistrict itself, but next to it, at a distance of about 1,500 meters from the last house.  It is there that the land plot meets all the requirements of construction.  The timing of its construction has not yet been determined, but coordination with the Balashikha administration is ongoing.  So far, a special bus has been allocated for children from Sacramento, on which they are taken to the school in the village of Severny.  There is also a stadium and a pool.  The nearest clinics are now in Balashikha.  Getting to them is very inconvenient, but the developer and the city administration insist that they will definitely build their own medical facility in the new complex. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Sacramento property developer" class="if" height="343" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739882.jpg" width="504"></div>

    <h2>  Floor plans </h2><p>  Each apartment in the Sacramento residential complex has a standard layout inherent in panel construction.  In all the buildings of the complex only "odnushki" and "kopeck piece" are built.  Their area is from 33 m <sup>2</sup> to 58 m <sup>2</sup> .  In one-room apartments, bathrooms are combined with a bathtub, in two-room apartments there are combined and separate options.  Kitchens are planned ranging from 8 m <sup>2</sup> to 10 m <sup>2</sup> .  Many of them have access to a balcony / loggia.  For these positions, deviations from the project are minimal. </p><p>  Depending on the number of storeys of buildings, apartments in them are from 8 to 40. Buyers need to pay attention that there are buildings with a different number of sections, therefore apartments on floors can be from 4 to 10 units. </p><p>  There are differences in the design of houses.  In some buildings, apartments are built only with balconies, in others - with glazed loggias, and there are many houses where on the first floors there is neither one nor the other.  But in the basement floors of the Sacramento residential complex, the developer equipped pantries with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã6.3 m <sup>2</sup> to 16.3 m <sup>2</sup> .  They are purchased at the request of interest holders, for a fee. </p><p>  Mandatory are payments for the installation of intercoms, which will be at the door of each entrance.  Elevators are provided only in multi-storey buildings. </p><p>  The apartments are for rent with partial decoration, including glazing of windows, distribution of communications, installation of window sills, sockets, sinks and meters for light and water, cement floor screed, installation of interior doors.  At the request of customers, teams of workers can finish the job. </p><h2>  Construction stages </h2><p>  The Sacramento microdistrict began to be erected in 2010.  The first stage was supposed to be surrendered in 2012, but the state commission accepted it only in 2013.  The keys were given to residents until 2014.  The builder was supposed to hand over the second phase in 2014.  Some of the buildings were indeed accepted by the State Commission on time, but people received the keys until 2016.  Now the construction of the third stage (buildings 1, 2, 4 and 5) is proceeding at a good pace.  In April of this year, workers completely completed the construction of building frames and began to install external walls, balconies, interior partitions.  According to the new general plan of PIK Group of Companies, buildings No. 1 and No. 5 are to be commissioned in June of this year, and buildings No. 2 and No. 4 in December 2017. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="LCD Sacramento Description" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/1739907.jpg" width="506"></div>

    <h2>  Prices, Mortgage Programs </h2><p>  Real estate in Balashikha is attractive not only for its good location of housing complexes relative to the capital, but also for its relatively low cost.  Sacramento offers economy class housing.  Apartments from the PIK developer can be bought at prices: </p><p>  - one-room from 2.2 to 2.4 million rubles; </p><p>  - two-room apartments from 2.9 to 3.2 million rubles. </p><p>  On April 2017, there were on sale: </p><p>  - in building No. 1 there were 16 apartments for sale; </p><p>  - in the building No. 4 of 32 apartments; </p><p>  - in building No. 5 of 20 apartments. </p><p>  In addition, you can purchase real estate in the Sacramento residential complex by assignment or as a secondary housing.  Their cost is set by the owners. </p><p>  Banks are collaborating with PIK on this project: </p><ul><li>  VTB. </li><li>  "VTB 24". </li><li>  UralSib. </li><li>  "Absolute". </li><li>  Sberbank </li><li>  "Revival." </li><li>  DeltaCredit. </li><li>  Gazprombank. </li><li>  "DomRF". </li><li>  Raiffeisen Bank. </li><li>  "Opening". </li></ul><p>  A mortgage is issued for a period of 3 to 30 years.  The initial payment is from 10% to 20%, in Bank Vozrozhdenie it is 0%.  The interest rate in each financial institution is different.  The lowest 10% at DomRF Bank, the highest at 12% at Otkritie Bank. </p><h2>  LCD "Sacramento": reviews </h2><p>  This new building in Balashikha is very popular among young families and everyone who can not afford to buy expensive apartments.  In general, the microdistrict leaves a good impression, but there are also problems here.  The advantages of the project marked by tenants and interest holders: </p><p>  - excellent ecology (near the forest, there are no industrial enterprises); </p><p>  - basically all buildings are low-rise; </p><p>  - low building density; </p><p>  - proximity to Moscow; </p><p>  - the presence of nearby bus stops; </p><p>  - good quality apartments; </p><p>  - acceptable prices. </p><p>  Noted disadvantages: </p><p>  - delays in the timing of delivery of the queues, the long issuance of keys; </p><p>  - there is no developed infrastructure; </p><p>  - The construction of multi-story buildings, which originally should not have been; </p><p>  - the transfer of the school from the territory of the housing complex, the timing of its construction is not defined; </p><p>  - traffic jams on the Gorky highway, which makes it difficult to get to work in the capital; </p><p>  - the presence of a nearby military training ground. </p>
