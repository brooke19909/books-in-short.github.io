Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Rest in Abkhazia always leaves a lot of impressions.  Many tourists share about them in their reviews. </p><p>  Given the fact that the Amra sanatorium reopens after reconstruction, it is now difficult to objectively evaluate many reviews.  But there are a number of points why tourists choose this particular sanatorium.  It is a clean and warm sea, a spacious beach, an incredibly beautiful park, and the whole nature around.  Amazing air: it smells of eucalyptus and boxwood.  The staff is attentive.  As one of Amra's vacationers wrote, a land resembling paradise. </p><p>  Pension "Caucasus" is popular with tourists for its location on the first line, there is a private beach, clear sea, warm water.  Pleasantly surprised by professional staff and daily cleaning: the rooms are always clean.  In the evenings, live music is played.  There is a cafe.  Shops within walking distance. </p><p>  Guests of the sanatorium "Moscow" consider the sea and nature to be magnificent.  The building and the park look very beautiful on the side of the mountain.  Given the power of accommodation is inexpensive.  The balcony offers stunning views.  Plumbing and furniture are old.  According to vacationers, the rooms need a complete overhaul, and the park needs restoration. </p><p>  As for the boarding house "Energetik", vacationers like on its territory a magnificent tropical park with alleys, a wonderful beach and clear sea.  Great location near the market.  Unfortunately, very old rooms, elevator work poorly.  Many note the lack of communication among staff. </p><p>  Tourists speak of the sanatorium Sana, as well as other health resorts of Gagra, as majestic Soviet buildings that need serious reconstruction.  A big plus is the presence of a balcony with outdoor furniture, which offers beautiful views.  In the mornings, morning exercises are carried out for vacationers.  Of the minuses - the beach is very far away. </p><p>  In the ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù boarding house, most vacationers like the wonderful location, silence, large park, clear sea.  Many, judging by the reviews, are satisfied with the food, and the courtesy of the staff.  But, we are sure that repairs and new furniture are simply necessary. </p>
