There are many attractions in the city, and one day is clearly not enough to go around everything.  This is a very interesting city with a long history.  It will be interesting for tourists of different ages to walk along its streets, look at museums, visit fortresses and cathedrals.  But there are interesting places in the city for children, and where to go with a child in Helsinki, you can ask about the travel agency. </p><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  You can get to the capital of Finland by any means of transport, by air, by land or even by sea.  Daily flights from Moscow and St. Petersburg airports are carried out by three airlines: Aeroflot, Finnair and Pulkovo Airlines.  An hour of flight - and you are in Finland.  From St. Petersburg you can come to Helsinki on the Allegro high-speed train, which delivers tourists to their destination four times a day.  Travel time is 3.5 hours. </p>

    <p>  Two high-speed trains still run - the Finnish Sibelius and the Russian Repin.  Lux Express buses run three times a day from the Northern capital of Russia to the capital of Finland.  And this is the cheapest option.  One way ticket -1400 rubles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There is also a reliable connection on the ferry St. Petersburg - Stockholm.  It will be a kind of small cruise.  Departure from St. Petersburg in the evening, and get off the ferry to Helsinki, where you will arrive in the morning the next day, at the South Port (Olimpiaranta, 1).  But this type of transport is more suitable for the warm season. </p><h2>  Hospitable city </h2><p>  <span>The capital of Finland</span> is one of the cities in Europe, which created favorable conditions for tourism and recreation.  The city has many different museums, attractions, architectural monuments.  It is enough to get a Helsinki map, and "where to go and what to see" - as a question, should disappear by itself.  Fans of walks in the city will find for themselves several developed routes that cover all the interesting places that the capital of Finland is rich in.  For those who come just to relax in a big company, they will also find for themselves in a guidebook where you can spend a weekend and get acquainted with Finnish culture.  There are many interesting places in Helsinki where you can go with your child.  In general, you can go to the ‚ÄúFinnish neighbor‚Äù for a weekend from St. Petersburg, because this is always a mini-trip to Europe, which is almost nearby.  The main thing is to decide where you still want to go and what to see. </p>

    <h2>  What is a Helsinki map? </h2><p>  Tourists who do not know where to go to Helsinki in one day can purchase a comprehensive overview package that allows you to see all the best in the city, saving time and money.  This package is called - Helsinki map.  The card is available for 1, 2 and 3 days, depending on how long it is purchased.  This card is a kind of all-in-one ticket.  By purchasing it, tourists in the future receive free admission to the 25 best sights and museums, as well as a city tour and a bus tour with a panorama of the tourist island of Suomenlinna, as well as free admission to SkyWheel and SEALIFE Helsinki. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Budget travel option </h2><p>  For example, if tourists decide where to go to Helsinki without the above card, they will have to pay for each attraction or object of visit: </p><ul><li>  Suomenlinna, sea fortress - museums and tour - ‚Ç¨ 37.00. </li><li>  Panoramic bus tour - ‚Ç¨ 32.00. </li><li>  Excursion along the beautiful canal - ‚Ç¨ 25.00. </li><li>  SkyWheel (discounted entry) - ‚Ç¨ 12.00. </li><li>  SEALIFE (discounted entry) - ‚Ç¨ 16.00. </li><li>  City tour by bus - ‚Ç¨ 28.00. </li><li>  Ateneum Art Museum - ‚Ç¨ 15.00. </li><li>  Temppeliaukio Church (rock church) - ‚Ç¨ 3.00. </li><li>  Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art - ‚Ç¨ 14.00. </li></ul><p>  Visiting these 9 attractions without a Helsinki card, 182 euros will be spent, and in addition, there will also be costs for public transport.

    <h2>  If in Helsinki travel </h2><p>  Sometimes the trip is not planned.  Perhaps this is a business trip, or you were traveling in this city.  In this case, especially no one thinks where to go.  You can just walk in Helsinki, and the streets will lead you to the promenade and the main Cathedral on Senate Square.  Feet will bring you to the Old Market Hall - The Old Indoor Trading Market.  Very beautiful buildings and unusual for their maintenance.  Who would have thought that the Finnish National Theater is located in a building that looks like an impregnable castle.  The beautiful red brick building of the former customs house in 1900 and the same brick, Best Western Premier Hotel Katajanokka, located in the former prison. </p><p>  That's where you just need to look, so it's in the Linnanm√§ki Amusement Park.  This is one of the oldest parks in which there are wooden rare roller coasters, as well as new modern ones.  And those and others work and delight both adults and children.  The park has a tower with a viewing platform.  Climb to it and view Helsinki aerial view is free. </p><h2>  Helsinki Museums </h2><p>  For those who are interested in the culture and life of the country's population, it will be interesting to visit the most popular museums in Helsinki.  Usually such an excursion is performed in the autumn-winter period, when the rooms are more comfortable than in the air.  The most interesting include the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma - Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art. </p>

    <p>  Visitors enter the museum through the spacious lobby with a glazed ceiling.  This place serves as a starting point for stairs, ramps and corridors that are curved to lead to the rest of the building.  The irregular, subtly differentiated spaces of the museum serve as exhibition halls. </p><p>  You can always find where to go to Helsinki.  So, it is interesting to visit Kaupunginmuseo - the Helsinki Museum.  It documents and displays the history of the capital of Finland.  Those who are interested in natural sciences can visit the Finnish Museum of Natural History - the Science Museum of Natural History.  It is interesting for its exhibits Design Museum - Museum of Design. </p><h2>  Ride with children </h2><p>  Arriving in Helsinki with children, many ask themselves: "What to do with a child, where to take him to be interesting?"  Such places are enough for kids and for teenagers.  These are museums and entertainment, Espoo and Vantaa, which can be visited in summer and winter.  In the historical museum of the child, the Vintti workshop may be of interest.  Children learn to build a wooden blockhouse or a wall of bricks.  They will be allowed to grind grain and even work on a typewriter. </p>

    <p>  With a child, you can visit the <span>open-air museum</span> on the island of Seurasaari.  This ethnographic complex is interesting in that it houses 80 buildings brought from all over Finland.  These are peasant estates, shops and workshops.  There is a school, a post station and even a functioning mill on the territory of the complex.  True, this complex operates in the warm season from mid-May to mid-September.  On holidays such as Easter, Christmas and Ivan Kupala Day, festivities take place on the island. </p><h2>  Helsinki in winter </h2><p>  Those parents who came to Helsinki where to go with their child in the winter do not have a question.  They know that there is the largest Serena water park in Europe, which is popular with both adults and children.  It will not be boring for children and adults in the scientific center "Eureka".  The time spent in it leaves a lasting impression. </p>

    <p>  After all, you can sit here in the cockpit, introducing yourself as a pilot, ride a rope on a bicycle, like a circus performer, climb into a bear‚Äôs den.  And in ‚ÄúEric‚Äù there are no prohibitions.  You can touch everything.  The main feature of "Eureka" is a planetarium with 3D films.  You can stroll through the park on the snowy island of Seurasaari.  And if you arrive at Christmas, you should definitely look into the City Winter Garden.  He will surprise with his winter outfits. </p><p>  Helsinki is interesting at any time of the year.  There are so many attractions in it that, having been here once, a person does not experience satiety.  Helsinki is welcoming and incredibly beautiful. </p>
