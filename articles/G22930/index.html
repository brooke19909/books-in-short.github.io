    <h2>  A small essay about the bank </h2><p>  Promsvyazbank, or PSB for short, is considered one of the most influential financial organizations of the Russian Federation, one of the three best banks in the country.  The history of its discovery began more than 20 years ago from the moment when the founders of the Ananyev brothers only had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a large financial empire.  One of the first branches, where the headquarters of the institution is now located, was the central Moscow office. </p><p>  At the moment, PSB is very popular among entrepreneurs, individuals and legal entities.  Regular customers of the organization, whose <span>regional network</span> today has about 300 retail outlets, 200 terminals and 8,500 ATMs, are also more than two million Russians and foreign nationals.  We will tell about what mortgage operates in the Promsvyazbank organization. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Housing Lending: A Brief Summary </h2><p>  PSB is a universal bank that works both with entrepreneurs and with ordinary citizens.  And since the clients of this financial organization are people with completely different income levels, PSB specialists have to work hard to develop programs that are interesting to everyone. </p><p>  Representatives of the public joint-stock company pay special attention to housing lending.  Today, among the products that Promsvyazbank promotes, mortgages with state support are in special demand among young families.  It allows you to resolve the problems that have arisen, as well as get your own, independent of the parents living corner.  So, what do the bank experts offer Russian citizens? </p>

    <h2>  What housing programs are available in the bank? </h2><p>  Currently, PSB has the following <span>loan programs</span> : </p><ul><li>  "New building-State.  program ‚Äù(housing loan with state support). </li><li>  "New building" (with the ability to purchase housing in the primary real estate market). </li><li>  "Secondary market". </li><li>  ‚ÄúTarget security loan‚Äù. </li></ul><h2>  "New building-State.  program "- Promsvyazbank mortgage: conditions for registration </h2><p>  The program involves the purchase of a completely new home on credit at a reduced interest rate (11.4% per annum), without additional commissions, fees and restrictions.  However, like most of the bank‚Äôs similar products, Novostroyka obliges you to make a down payment starting at 20%. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The amount of the loan in this case will directly depend on your place of residence.  For example, potential borrowers from Moscow, St. Petersburg and these two regions will be able to count on a maximum of 8 million rubles, and all the rest - on 3 million. </p><p>  In addition, when deciding on a loan, representatives of the bank take into account the size of the income of all participants in the transaction, taking into account guarantors and co-borrowers (but not more than 4).  The term for such a loan, as declared by Promsvyazbank (the mortgage issued here has a number of advantages) will be no more than 25 years.  The program also allows early repayment of the loan at the request of the client. </p>

    <h2>  "New building" in the primary housing market: conditions </h2><p>  When applying for this program, borrowers can count on a loan ranging from 500,000 to 30,000,000 rubles.  They are required to make a down payment - from 20%.  Moreover, its final size will depend on the price of the selected property or the size of the share, according to the agreement on participation in shared construction.  The minimum loan term is 3 years.  And the interest rate is from 13.8% per annum. </p><p>  Like many financial organizations, Promsvyazbank (a mortgage makes it possible to realize the dream of own housing) insists on applying for a policy.  If, when applying for this program, the borrower refuses <span>insurance</span> recommended by the <span>bank,</span> then the initial rate increases immediately by 6%. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  On what conditions does the Secondary Market program work? </h2><p>  The purpose of this loan can be not only the purchase of an apartment on the secondary real estate market, but also the payment of costs for its overhaul.  Moreover, housing itself is provided to the bank as an expensive security deposit.  The interest rate on such a tempting housing loan will be only 13.35%.  Moreover, as representatives of the financial institution promise, it is one.  The amount, terms and down payment in this case repeat the conditions of previous programs. </p>

    <h2>  What are the conditions of a ‚ÄúTarget Collateral Loan‚Äù? </h2><p>  To approve the Promsvyazbank mortgage under this program, you must submit an application with the obligatory indication of the purpose of the loan.  In this case, it will be the acquisition of housing in the primary or secondary real estate market.  As guarantees, the bank expects the borrower to provide the appropriate collateral (in the form of credit real estate) and the provision of two guarantors.  The rate of the target loan program will be 13.35% per annum, and the amount - up to 30 million rubles.  A spouse may act as a sub-borrower.  And to apply realistically and remotely. </p><h2>  What are the requirements for a potential customer? </h2><p>  Citizens of the Russian Federation can take a loan at PSB Bank from 21 to 65 years old.  They must live and work in the region where the branch of the credit organization is located.  Their total work experience should not be less than a year, and at the last place of work they are required to work from 4 months. </p><p>  In addition, if a 27-year-old man acts as a potential borrower, he should not be called up for military service.  And finally, in the case of a housing loan by the military, the term of his contract should not be less than a year.  These are the requirements when applying for a loan that Promsvyazbank puts forward to its potential customers.  Mortgages for them will be an excellent solution to previous housing troubles. </p>

    <h2>  How to make mortgage payments? </h2><p>  In order to know not only the amount that can be calculated in case of approval of the PSB application, but also the size of the bet, calculations should be made in advance.  Moreover, this can be done at the time of applying for a housing loan with the assistance of a loan manager. </p><p>  In addition, the calculations you are interested in can be done independently using free credit calculator services, for example, ‚Äúcalculator-credit.ru‚Äù or the official website of the financial organization ‚Äúpsbank.ru‚Äù.  Here is an example of how a mortgage is issued.  Promsvyazbank offers to calculate all the data for the selected program based on the amount of the loan or the size of your monthly earnings. </p><p>  So, suppose you choose the Secondary Market program based on your monthly salary.  To perform the calculations, enter the following data: </p><ul><li>  the amount of income (for example, 200,000 rubles / month); </li><li>  loan terms (132 months); </li><li>  bid (13.35%) </li></ul><p>  As a result, we get that the loan amount will be 6,902,064 rubles, and the amount for monthly repayment - 100,000 rubles. </p>

    <h2>  What reviews cause the bank's mortgage programs? </h2><p>  Since housing loans are considered a specific banking product, they are capable of causing completely opposite opinions.  For example, many are satisfied that they are dealing with an institution such as Promsvyazbank.  Mortgages, reviews of which come from such people purely in a positive manner, are issued quickly and taking into account the rules of the bank.  People are satisfied not only with the transparent policy of the credit institution, but also with the service of its representatives. </p><p>  Others, on the contrary, talk about unexpected changes in the rate and terms of the loan.  According to them, at the last moment, the bank makes adjustments to the contract, and customers have to agree to rather unfavorable conditions.  However, the bank responds to such claims that such adjustments are sometimes made in accordance with the rules of the PSB, as sometimes the size of the client‚Äôs income is too small, therefore the compelled risks are eliminated by increasing the terms and <span>the mortgage rate.</span> </p>
