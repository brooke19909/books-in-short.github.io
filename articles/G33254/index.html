    <h2>  Cranberry city </h2><p>  Estonian and Finnish dishes are often complemented by cranberry sauce.  Not surprising.  In these northern territories, useful berry grows in abundance.  The weather in J√µhvi (Estonia) is often sunny in summer.  In autumn, foggy and rainy days prevail.  In the vicinity of Johvi more swamps and swamps.  This <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="53" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">creates</span> favorable conditions for the spread of cranberries. </p><p>  It is no coincidence that we spoke about the shrubs that love the marshland so much.  In the thirteenth century, chroniclers first spoke of Johvi (Estonia).  Attractions of the Middle Ages are not preserved.  Perhaps that is why in the history of the city there are many white spots. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  When the first people appeared on the territory of modern Johvi, cranberries grew more actively than today.  Residents of nearby settlements over time began to call the village j√µhvika, that is, <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="12" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> cranberry <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="13" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> .  Over time, the adjective became an official toponym. </p><p>  But this is just one version.  There is no exact evidence that the city is named after the northern berry. </p>

    <h2>  XIII-XVIII centuries </h2><p>  So, Johvi appeared supposedly in the thirteenth century.  Then it was a small village belonging to the Danish king.  In the XVI <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="1" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">century, the</span> city ‚Äã‚Äãwas already part of Sweden.  And in August 1721, between this northern country and the state, which today occupies one sixth of the earth's land, an agreement was concluded, known in history as Nishtadtsky.  In accordance with the terms of the agreement, Johvi became Russian.  The name also changed <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="39" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> on the map of the Russian Empire it was designated as <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="24" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> Ievwe <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="25" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">"</span> .  But not for long.  One hundred years passed, and Ievwe disappeared from the Russian map.  However, in the future, the inhabitants of the city, as a rule, contrary to their wishes, changed citizenship much more rapidly. </p><h2>  Temple construction </h2><p>  In the second half of the 19th century, Ievve turned from a small village into a significant transit and transshipment point.  A railway station has already been built here, while the emperor appointed a rather well-known <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="40" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">personality</span> in those days <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="40" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">- Sergei</span> Shakhovsky.  The life of the former Baltic city has changed for the better.  At least for the Russian-speaking part of the population.  A monastery was built in Ievva and an Orthodox sports society was opened.  Around this time, the Church of the Epiphany of the Lord appeared here. </p><p>  Transformations also affected administrative division.  We call Ievve a city, while in the second half of the 19th century it had the status of a posad.  The difference between these concepts was then significant.  Posad is in many ways different from the city, including in terms of population.  According to the 1900 census, 1,300 people lived in Ieva.  Moreover, there were no less Russians than Estonians. </p>

    <h2>  World War I </h2><p>  The year 1914 came.  The Estonian population of Ievve was anxiously awaiting decisive events.  The expectations of the Baltic were justified, but at the end of the war.  In 1918, the Germans captured the city <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="64" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkPunctuation">and, surprisingly</span> , did not begin to destroy or rob it, as occupiers usually do in such situations.  They began to build sidewalks and plant trees. </p><p>  The Germans, of course, captured not only this small <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="56" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">settlement</span> .  They occupied all of Estonia (which, however, was not difficult to do), and above all, Tallinn.  And it's not that they were attracted to picturesque places, covered in some places with <span>cranberry swamps.</span>  The Germans sought to persuade the Bolsheviks to conclude a separate peace treaty, which was achieved on March 3, 1918. </p><p>  In 1919, the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="57" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">village</span> was returned the original name <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="41" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> Johvi.  His status was still the same <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="42" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> posad.  Ten years later, there was already a school and a <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="58" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">shakhter</span> school.  The production of oil shale has begun.  Johvi received the status of the city a year before the start of World War I.  In the late 30s, approximately 2.5 thousand people lived here. </p>

    <h2>  Second German occupation </h2><p>  In 1940, Soviet power was established in Johvi.  And soon the Germans reappeared here, who were no longer as friendly as in the past war.  The trees were not planted, the roads were not laid, and when they retreated, they also set up a fire.  Yes, the Germans were no longer the same.  After several years of their barbaric stay and rapid departure in the village of 350 tasks, only no more than a hundred remained.  The life of a small industrial town, meanwhile, continued. </p><p>  The Germans returned to Johvi in ‚Äã‚Äã1945, but now no longer of their own free will.  As prisoners of war, they restored buildings destroyed by their own hands.  They worked in good faith, and therefore many buildings erected in the late forties, and today have a pretty decent appearance. </p><h2>  Johvi today </h2><p>  In 1991, Estonia gained independence.  In the early 2000s, active construction began in the city.  Several new buildings have appeared, including one that is not of interest to tourists <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="43" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">-</span> Viru Prison.  In 2013, a promenade was opened connecting the <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="60" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkYo">remote</span> parts of Johvi.  A large shopping and entertainment center has appeared, the construction of which took more than 2.5 million euros. </p><p>  The main industry in the Estonian town <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="44" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkTypography">is</span> , as before, the extraction of oil shale.  Travelers who have visited megalopolises rich in architectural and historical monuments believe that there is nothing to see in Johvi.  Nevertheless, they recommend visiting a concert hall, a windmill, the city hall and, of course, the local Orthodox church. </p><p>  The Church of the Epiphany of the Lord was built at the end of the XIX century.  His story does not tell us about any tragic events, because he relates to the Tallinn diocese.  While churches began to be massively destroyed in Russia, Germans who had nothing against the Orthodox faith had long settled in Estonia.  Even before their flight, in 1944, probably by accident, they did not burn the temple. </p>

    <h2>  Festival in Johvi (Estonia): "Slavic Light" </h2><p>  Artists from Russia, Ukraine and <span data-annotation-idx="0" data-annotation="2" data-alternate-annotation="undefined" data-kind="mkSpelling">Belarus</span> come to the Estonian city for an annual event.
