And from the old postcards dedicated to the holiday of May 9, the same striped ribbon looks at us.  And why does it bear such a name and where did this tradition come from? </p>

It was she who instituted the Order of St. George, to which bicolor (bicolor) served as the <span>order ribbon</span> .  These colors indicate, in one interpretation, the smoke and flame of battle (black and gold).  Another version says that they were taken in honor of the state symbol, because the black <span>double-headed eagle</span> on a gold background has long served as the <span>emblem of the Russian Empire.</span>  But be that as it may, in fact, since then the black and orange colors of the ribbon have become in our country a symbol of military glory and courage.  The Order of St. George was awarded for courage and heroism.  In those days, there was no question of how to tie a St. George ribbon, because it was a reward.

    <p>  Then there was a big temporary break, since in the first years of Soviet power all previous orders and medals were canceled.  In the Soviet Army, the tape reappeared during the years of World War II as an insignia on the banners of the guard units.  And the tape itself covered the shoe of the Order of Glory.  And then, too, there was no question of how to tie a St. George ribbon. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to tie a St. George ribbon" class="if" height="268" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10640/207592.jpg" width="460"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Today, wearing the St. George ribbon symbolizes memory and respect for the feat of all who stopped fascism.  This tradition appeared not so long ago, but has already become an indispensable attribute of the holiday.  Ribbons are handed out free of charge on the eve of the Great Victory Day, and now the question of how to tie a St. George ribbon worries many.  It‚Äôs easy to attach to a car, but what about clothes?  In fact, do not attach this attribute of courage and valor to it according to the guide on how to <span>tie scarves.</span>  The tape itself can be pinned either to the sleeve of the shirt or to the lapel of the jacket.  Often you can see bicolor fluttering on a handbag or fluttering on the antenna of the car.  In principle, tie-up schemes can help here, since there are no strict standards. </p><p>  Most often, the ribbon is tied with a formal bow.  This is very simple, just remember how you <span>tie the shoelaces.</span>  But if you can‚Äôt add splendor to the bow, you can simply roll up the ribbon, as shown in the figure on the left, and secure it with a pin.  By the way, with the same pin you can attach the resulting bow to the suit. </p>

    <p>  If you follow the unwritten rules, then people who fought, whose families went through the war, as well as those who have veterans of the Great Patriotic War in the family, can tie the St. George ribbon.  But it is difficult to find a family that would not be affected in one way or another by that terrible disaster.  And even if grandfathers and great-grandfathers did not fight at the front, grandmothers and great-grandmothers were certainly <span>rear workers,</span> ensuring Victory, and this work is comparable to a military feat.  Yes, and not the ancestors matter.  Those who are interested in how to tie a St. George ribbon by wearing it express their attitude to the fact that the victory of our people in that war came at a high price, that they remember the feat of soldiers and officers, worship their courage and honor their memory. </p>
