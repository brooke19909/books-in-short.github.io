This is the second most popular question among needlewomen who are looking for how to knit a female cardigan with knitting needles with a description and patterns.  In principle, these two items are similar to each other.  They have the same length of sleeves, they both are not worn on a naked body, have buttons, pockets and belts.  Confusing them is really easy.  But the jacket is nevertheless closer in its characteristics to jackets and trench coats, it is quite short and always fitted.  Cardigans are often long, they can have a wide range of cuts - from strict to oversize.  An example you see in the photo. </p><h2>  Types of Knitted Cardigans </h2><p>  Before you start knitting, you need to choose the most interesting version of a cardigan, knitting with needles, for yourself.  Fashion designers today subdivide all models into 3 groups: </p><ol><li>  On plastic, wooden or crystal buttons - a classic model up to the middle of the thigh or calves.  It goes well with trousers, dresses and other items of clothing. </li><li>  Without fasteners - these are the so-called capes.  They are comfortable, practical, look good with jeans and pants, sometimes made of bulk yarn.  It is recommended to wear them to girls who do not have problems with the figure. </li><li>  With a belt - something in between the first two options.  This cardigan can be worn either buttoned or unzipped.  It goes well with sheath dresses or skinny jeans.  Knits usually from mohair or durable wool. </li></ol><p>  Below you can find several models of similar women's cardigans with descriptions and diagrams.

    <h2>  What yarn is better to knit a cardigan? </h2><p>  Needleworkers who choose which thread to knit cardigans and coats (with detailed descriptions of the knitting pattern in the photo below) should know - this can be done from almost any yarn on the market today.  You can use angora, cotton, wool, mohair, natural alpaca or acrylic to create a beautiful thing.  When choosing, you should focus on the thickness and length of the fiber, its structure, as well as color. </p><p>  Let's look at what other needlewomen for knitting cardigans usually get yarn.  So this is: </p><ol><li>  Alpaca de Italia Seam - a thin thread, which includes 50% alpaca and the same amount of nylon, which does not allow the product to change shape.  Cardigans from it are soft, delicate to the touch and very warm.  Suitable knitting needles - 2-3 mm.  Price - 149 rubles.  for 1 tangle. </li><li>  Cashmere Vita is a thread that contains 35% angora, 40% quality wool, 15% nylon and 10% tencel.  It is very similar to real cashmere, but costs less - 256 rubles per skein. </li><li>  Mohair Classic New Alize is a warm yarn composed of 51% acrylic, 24% wool and 25% mohair.  It is very well pushed, and therefore hard to blossom.  Knit with it should immediately without errors.  Price - 223 rub.  per skein. </li></ol><p>  We do not urge to use only this yarn for needlework.  You can choose in order to knit a female cardigan with knitting needles with schemes and description, any strings.  Ultimately, the created product should be liked by you. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  What knitting needles to use for knitting? </h2><p>  If you decide to knit a cardigan by hand, then remember the right choice of knitting needles.  According to the opinion of professional knitters, who have been practicing for many years and drawing up schemes describing a knitted female cardigan, their thickness should be 1.5-2 times greater than the thickness of the yarn.  As a rule, they recommend using circular aluminum or steel knitting needles No. 3, 4 or 5 to create a stylish thing. Bamboo can also be taken, but you should be prepared for the fact that they can easily bend or break. </p>

    <p>  It is worth noting that when knitting the back and front with one fabric, many needlewomen usually leave slots for the sleeves.  This is correct, since otherwise it will be impossible to wear the product afterwards, you will have to redo everything.  In our case, this is not required, since the two sides of the same cardigan are knitted separately.  Each sleeve has its own sleeve sewn, and only after that they are joined together.  Pay special attention to this! </p><h2>  Interesting ideas for knitting cardigans </h2><p>  Women's cardigans differ in color, pattern and silhouette.  So, modern fashion designers offer fashionistas all kinds of fly-outs, trapezes, products with Asian motifs or colors, long, short.  For example, let's look at a few things created by American craftswomen.  If you are planning to knit women's cardigans with knitting needles, schemes and a description for them you can find in this article. </p>

It remains the case for small - just get to work and complete it.  If you already managed to do this, do not forget to put things in order.  Immediately after stitching all the parts, it is necessary to wash the cardigan by hand with ordinary soap or a few drops of shampoo, and then rinse in warm water.  So that the cardigan does not immediately fall off and fade, it is important to ensure that the temperature of the liquid is the same throughout the procedure. </p><p>  After washing, the cardigan, no matter what yarn it is made of, cannot be twisted.  It must be laid out on a thick sheet or towel, carefully folded into a ‚Äúsausage‚Äù.  Then unfold and leave to dry completely, away from the battery.  You can not hang on a rope, since the product can be deformed under its own weight.  After the cardigan has dried, it is worth ironing.  It is better to do this from the wrong side, through wet gauze or a sheet, at an iron temperature of 110 degrees. </p>
