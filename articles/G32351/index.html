  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The applique 'Dragon' is everywhere: in postcards, on glass and on sofa cushions</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Every year we meet under some zodiac sign.  And all year and in our clothes, and in our interior, and in gifts, there is always a symbol of this creature.  Who knows how true this is, but just the same I want to believe that this will help us become a little happier and more successful! </p><p>  And this year - the year of the Dragon - we will begin to decorate our home with this symbol.  You can, for example, sew an original <span>sofa cushion.</span>  And her application will decorate!  The dragon, the image of which can be sewn or glued with polyethylene to the pillowcase, can be kind and sweet, or maybe strong, formidable.  As you wish, the master who creates the product. </p><p>  If the baby‚Äôs pants on her lap are worn out, or her mother just has such a desire, then the application ‚Äúdragon‚Äù on children's clothes will look great.  Of course, in this case, the <span>mythical creature</span> must necessarily be good-natured and smiling.  Although cute dinosaurs are excellent for these purposes. </p><p>  A special option is a birthday present for those who are born in the year of the dragon.  Here you can‚Äôt do without the original ‚Äúdragon‚Äù gift!  And the first thing to take care of is to make a postcard using the scrapbooking technique.  On the front side of the card, of course, the appliqu√© must be flaunted - a dragon ... with a birthday person's face!  And you know how best to do this? </p><p>  The photograph will need to be ‚Äúadjusted‚Äù using the ‚Äúpublisher‚Äù or ‚Äúphotoshop‚Äù program in size to the dragon prepared for the sticker.  It‚Äôs best not to spoil the photo by cutting, but simply stick it on the inside page of the postcard.  But the application ‚ÄúDragon in Anger‚Äù or ‚ÄúKind Fat Man - Dragonfly sniffs flowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äã(the choice of the plot of the card depends on the character of the birthday person and sense of humor of both participants in the action) is on the first page. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  It is <span>necessary</span> to transfer the location of the person in the photo on a blank sheet from the postcard through the transfer <span>paper</span> , noting the size of the page in the same place.  Having cut out the face on the received template, we impose it on the page on which the paper application is located - the dragon.  After checking the correct location of the hole, the master must carefully cut it.  Now folded, everyone can see such a humorous picture - a cartoon: a dragon with a birthday person's face! </p><p>  In order for the postcard to become even more original, you can add volumes to it.  This effect is achieved quite easily: you just need to stick the ‚Äúscales‚Äù all over the dragon‚Äôs body.  They can be made from a wide variety of materials, both paper and fabric or leatherette.  Each "scale", having the shape of a triangle or half an oval, is glued to the body of the dragon by the base. </p><p>  It is necessary to strictly observe the line along which the "scales" should be aligned.  Sticking should start from the bottom of the dragon, from its tail.  Triangles or semi-ovals of each subsequent row should overlap the base of the previous row, similar to how the scales are located in fish. </p><p>  Before the celebration of the name day, the very room where the guests will gather is also nice to decorate.  You can hang appropriate posters with congratulations on the walls.  Even some especially talented relatives draw up a humorous wall newspaper or a collage of personal photos to this day. </p><p>  The application on the glass also looks great.  For her, it is necessary to depict the intended drawing on a transparent vinyl film with <span>stained-glass paint</span> , circle it with contour paint.  Now you can bravely glue the application on any glass: whether in the door, in the window or on the balcony. </p><p>  The film is glued with water.  After thorough ironing to remove air between the glass and the film, the application holds firmly in place.  But when the holiday is over, it can be easily removed.  Moreover, the glass remains almost completely clean!  This option for decorating glass is much simpler and more practical than the old way of coloring them with watercolors or gouache.  To wash off paint from glass is, alas, a very tiring, time-consuming and thankless task. </p>
