Swedish fortress Nyenschanz and the city of Nyen (Nyen)</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Implementation of the plans of young Peter I would have been impossible without a large open port, which would allow Russia to have maritime communications with European states.  The ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù textbook (Grade 5) talks about the conquest of Ingermanland, and in this article some facts are given about the capture of the Swedish fortification on the banks of the Okhta and Neva.  The real, Swedish, name of the fort sounds like Nyuenkas, but in Russian historiography the fort is known by the name Nyenschanz fortress. </p><h2>  The background of the fortress </h2><p>  From the beginning of the <span>XIV century</span> and for almost three hundred years, the Kingdom of Sweden was engaged in the development of the Baltic lands, which were transferred to it under the conditions of the Orekhov peace.  The Neva and Ladoga lands were not included in the circle of interests of this state.  And only at the beginning of the XVII century it was decided to return the lost land.  To begin with, the Swedish government chose a political solution to the problem.  One of the sons of Charles IX was given the opportunity to occupy the Russian throne.  But this was prevented by a protracted war with Denmark, which ended in 1613. By this time, the opportunity to become king of Russia was lost - young Mikhail Romanov ascended the throne.  But Sweden‚Äôs plans to gain a foothold on the Neva banks were not forgotten, and Jacob de Lagardee, the commander in chief of the <span>Swedish army,</span> suggested that the crown build a fortress to protect the already conquered territories. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nyenschanz fortress" class="if" height="240" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/608596.jpg" width="200"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Building a fortress </h2><p>  The thought of the commander-in-chief was approved by the king and supported by the Swedish parliament - the rikstag.  In 1611, a fortress was built, which later became known as Nyenschanz, which is translated into Russian as "Neva fortification." </p><p>  Of course, the important position occupied by the Nienschanz fortress was quite understandable to the Swedish government.  The entire XVII century was dedicated to strengthening and modernizing the protective structures of this structure.  In 1675, the fort conversion plan was approved by the Swedish king and began to be implemented.  Each peasant of Karelia and Ingermanland was obliged to work out a month by modernizing the Nyenschanz fortress. </p><p>  By the beginning of the new XVIII century, the fortification had the appearance of a pentagon and was located on an artificial embankment shaft up to 19 m high. Two ravelins, five bastions and modern guns made the fort a serious defense structure. </p><h2>  The emergence of Nien </h2><p>  Neva is a trade route known to the Vikings, so it is not surprising that the city of Nien arose and began to develop rapidly near the fortress. </p><p>  This city, according to the projects of Sweden, was conceived as the capital of all its eastern lands - Ingermanland.  The city‚Äôs coat of arms depicted a lion with a sword standing between two rivers, which was explained by the military presence of the Swedes at the mouths of the Neva and Okhta. </p><p>  The convenient location attracted artisans and merchants from all over Europe.  Finns, Germans, Russians, Izhors, and Dutch lived compactly here.  There were Protestant <span>churches, a Lutheran church,</span> and the left <span>bank of the Neva was</span> decorated with an Orthodox church.  A ferry crossing circulated between the shores.  Business and private correspondence was conducted in German and Swedish. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition to trading shops and warehouses, a hospital, a brick factory, a shipyard, a greenhouse and even a nursing home were built in Nien.  There was a ferry between the banks on which the city was built. </p><p>  The heyday of trade and competition among other Baltic cities led to the fact that in 1632 the townspeople asked the Swedish king to grant them the trade privileges that were later granted to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nien city" class="if" height="309" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/24864/608614.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The port became a free zone and was exempt from taxes.  The increase in trade benefits has led to a revival of trade and a prosperous population. </p><p>  For the Swedes, the fort was only the first sign in a network of powerful fortifications, which was intended to strengthen the lands of Ingermanland.  But the beginning of the Northern War prevented the implementation of these plans. </p><h2>  The capture of Nienschanz </h2><p>  The history of the 17th century for Russia began with the declaration of the Northern War.  Peter I well understood the importance of the city of Nien and the fortifications adjacent to it.  Therefore, one of the first military actions of the king was the capture of Nienschanz. </p><p>  Under the command of Field Marshal Sheremetev, the Russian army became in Shlisserburg, and on April 23, 1703, left the city and moving along the right bank of the Neva, approached the place where the Nyenschanz fortress was located.  For reconnaissance, a detachment of two thousand people was sent, in boats that crossed Lake Ladoga and approached the Swedes fortress.  A sudden attack crushed the guard posts of the Swedish army, since the security of the fortification was not prepared and small.  On April 25, the main part of the army approached the fortress.  Part of the army crossed Okhta, and part was located behind, under the cover of the outer shaft.  Surrounding the fortress, the besiegers began to dig trenches to install artillery batteries.  At night, mortars, guns, and shells were delivered to them from Shlisserburg. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="17th century history" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/608626.jpg"></div>

    <p>  On April 26, Tsar Peter and his retinue arrived to take part in the capture of the fortress.  By April 30th, all siege measures had been completed, and a proposal to surrender was sent to the commandant of the fortress.  At 7 pm, fire was opened on the defenders of Nienschanz.  The Swedes fired back until five in the morning, after which they accepted the offer of surrender. </p><h2>  Fortress surrender </h2>

    <p>  The capture of the fortress was fixed by a surrender agreement.  Under the terms of the latter, all defenders were given a way out of the fortress to Vyborg or Narva with banners and weapons.  After the lapse of time, the taken fortress was renamed Schlotburg. </p><p>  The military council, held shortly after the consolidation of the Russian army on the banks of the Neva, decided the fate of Schlotburg.  The city was too small and uncomfortable.  It was decided to expand the construction of a new fortress on <span>Hare Island.</span> </p><p>  Peter personally observed that the Nienschanz fortress was wiped off the face of the earth.  The buildings were destroyed, broken, blown up, erasing the memory of the Swedish fortification.  The city of Nien was also affected by the siege, but part of the houses and the brick factory remained intact, and were subsequently used in the construction of the first buildings of St. Petersburg.  At the site of the former fortress, the king ordered the planting of the four highest mast trees. </p><h2>  Nyenschanz after taking </h2>

    <p>  Contemporaries of the Northern War claimed that it would not be 15 years before everyone forgot about Fort Nyenschanz, but the data of cartographers show that the remains of this defensive structure existed until the 10s of the 19th century.  In 1748, on the site of the Nyenshanz kronverka, the brilliant Rastrelli lay the foundation of the Smolny Cathedral.  A decade later, the inner territory of the fortress will be occupied by the shipyards of the Petrovsky Plant. </p><h2>  Nienschanz Museum </h2>

    <p>  In the early 90's.  Twentieth century Petersburg archaeologists excavated on the banks of the Okhta River near the mouth of the river.  The collected findings made it possible to open a museum, the full name of which sounds like "700 years of Landskron, Nevsky estuary, Nyenschanz."  The museum can present planograms and models of fortifications.  As well as finds that history has preserved.  Grade 5 of the secondary school will significantly increase its level of knowledge by getting acquainted with the valuable exhibits of this museum. </p>
