    <h2>  Reviews about the hotel "Olympic" </h2><p>  Tourists who stayed at the Olympik Praha 4 * hotel write in their reviews that the hotel is decent, but does not reach four stars - a maximum of 3. There are often cases when tourists had to call in to check-in masters to check out certain flaws in their rooms, for example, a blown lamp or a broken door lock.  Another disadvantage is the quality and quantity of items for body hygiene. </p><p>  On the other hand, the hotel meets the price-quality parameters.  This is a very ordinary hotel, which is perfect for people who come to get to know Prague, when the room is needed only so that there is where to leave things and spend the night. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth paying attention to service - the staff does everything to make guests feel comfortable.  Housekeeping is provided regularly and the reception is open 24 hours a day.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.  Whenever possible, the administrator populates holidaymakers on the upper floors, from where you can see the Old City.  But getting to your room is not so easy, especially when there is a large flow of tourists - both elevators are constantly busy. </p><p>  And another huge plus is transport accessibility.  Many people in the reviews highlight such a moment as ease of movement, due to the location of the "Olympic" near the metro station. </p><p>  Opinions differ on nutrition.  Some people think that breakfast is full and varied, while others thought it was the same type and tasteless.  But in restaurants and bars there is where to roam, because the menu is very well thought out. </p><p>  Based on the foregoing, we can conclude that Olympik Praha is a great option for those who do not need frills, looking for an inexpensive and convenient hotel for a few days stay in Prague. </p>
