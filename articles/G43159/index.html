The problem of the technical organization of this process was solved by manufacturers of audio equipment in various ways.  The main focus has always been the desire of developers to provide maximum protection for the headphones used, despite the external operating conditions.  The emergence of new technologies made it possible to approach the solution of another problem - providing comfort for the user himself by eliminating discomfort and performing unnecessary manipulations in the management of the gadget.  In the wake of the new trend, headphones for swimming with an integrated player, working without wires, appeared. </p>

    <h2>  Features of waterproof wireless headphones </h2><p>  Moisture-proof digital music players have a number of design differences due to the aggressive environment and increased demands on physical ergonomics.  Such models usually exclude the presence of wires, since the player is built into the design of the headphones.  Nevertheless, the waterproof player can interact with other signal sources through the Bluetooth module, which is controlled by NFC technology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  As for the protective qualities, they are primarily expressed as a barrier to moisture in direct contact with the aquatic environment.  To do this, the design is covered with a sealed plastic shell, eliminating the penetration of liquid into the body.  Most often, waterproof headphones do not have open connectors at all, and the connection is realized using radio transmission systems.  Unless the battery charging process is organized by direct connection, although this task in the latest versions is solved by means of wireless charging stations. </p><h2>  Device specifications </h2>

    <p>  The operational parameters of such gadgets can be divided into two groups.  The first will include the characteristics of direct sound reproduction, and the second will include the working properties of the device itself.  The sound quality at nominal values ‚Äã‚Äãgenerally corresponds to ordinary players.  So, the reproducible frequency range of the standard version can vary from 100 Hz to 20 kHz, and the sensitivity is 100 dB with slight deviations.  But you should not rely on obtaining purity and depth of the sound stream in accordance with the given characteristics, since operating conditions can distort individual levels of the musical "picture".  As for the second group of characteristics, the headphones for swimming can have a memory capacity of about 4-8 GB.  The ability to use the headset on a single charge usually varies from 30 to 60 minutes.  By the way, some models replenish battery energy in just 3 minutes. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Sony NWZ-W273 Reviews </h2>

    <p>  The modification is designed specifically for swimmers who are actively working with dives.  According to the owners, the device works confidently even at a depth of 6.5 m, while maintaining the tightness of the case.  The development advantages include a long operating time on a single charge, which allows you to train without breaking away from the process.  To this, it is worth adding a 4 GB volume memory and a stylish look characteristic of the entire line of headphones of the Japanese brand.  But there are complaints from users.  Some of them emphasize that the waterproof <span>Sony headphones</span> in the performance of the NWZ-W273 have a distortion in sound reproduction and an uncomfortable shape.  That is, during use, there is discomfort.  Many attribute this flaw to the stiffness of materials.  Among the minuses, a complicated control configuration is also noted, but, as practice shows, you can get used to it. </p><h2>  FINIS Neptune model reviews </h2>

    <p>  A rather original solution, which implements a non-standard sound supply system.  The signal is not transmitted directly to the ears, but through bone vibrations.  This means that the ears remain free, and sound waves enter the skull bone through emitters fixed to the temples.  It turns out a waterproof player with an optimized design that provides a minimum of physical interference during operation, which is confirmed by the owners themselves.  However, the principle of indirect broadcasting of sound still affects its perception.  Users say that the playback quality is consistent with conventional models, but low class. </p><p>  At the same time, many owners of the device note its compactness, lightness and functionality.  With small sizes, Neptune waterproof headphones are equipped with an OLED screen, which adds comfort when controlling the functions of the gadget. </p><h2>  Pyle PWP15 model reviews </h2>

    <p>  Outwardly modest, but productive model of waterproof headphones for the pool.  The device is made according to the traditional scheme of a wireless player with a focus on practical users.  The model received a lot of positive reviews for its lightweight and almost imperceptible design, a wide selection of stylistic designs for the case and long battery life.  In this version, waterproof headphones with a built-in mp3 player can play music continuously for 10 hours. The battery‚Äôs advantages include the fact that it is removable and rechargeable.  For the price, this is also one of the most attractive solutions in the segment - in the domestic market you can buy an audio player for 2-2.5 thousand rubles. </p><h2>  How to choose suitable waterproof headphones? </h2><p>  The first step is to determine the configuration of the headphones.  The simplest is a bezel with an integrated battery, speakers and player.  Such models are cheaper and require a simplified control scheme.  The premium versions are distinguished by the presence of a small display and additional holders that increase the ergonomics of the device.  Next, the optimal performance is determined.  If you plan to use waterproof headphones under water for a short time, then a budget version like the Pyle PWP15 is suitable.  The most durable and reliable models are offered by Sony. </p>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The concept of using headphones underwater for a long time was considered unpromising, since there were many restrictions for such operation of an audio device.  But even today, with the advent of wireless technologies and materials to maintain tightness at a depth of more than 3 m, a number of unresolved ergonomic problems remain.  In particular, <span>wireless headphones that are</span> waterproof even in the upper price segment of more than 5 thousand cannot be called completely balanced in terms of ease of use with the gadget and sound quality.  The fact is that the implementation of modern control systems often excludes the comfort of physical retention of the player.  Improving the quality of reproduction contradicts the same characteristic, since in order to fulfill this condition the mass of speakers must also increase.  Nevertheless, the segment is still just being formed, individual conceptual developments of headphones show examples of solutions and tasks of this kind. </p>
