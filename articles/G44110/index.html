Such a <span>decoration for the garden</span> in the store is not cheap.  But our enterprising people can always find an alternative to expensive goods.  People with creative thinking and golden hands learned to perform garden sculptures themselves from available materials.  For example, from car tires, PET containers, wood.  This article describes how you can make a flower pot of plastic bottles in the form of a swan figurine and funny animal faces with your own hands.  This work does not require much effort and special costs.  Based on this master class, everyone will be able to make an original flowerpot for growing flowers or cultivated plants from improvised means. </p>

    <h2>  Planter swan from a plastic bottle.  Preparation of materials for its manufacture </h2><p>  Before starting the creative process, make sure that you have all the necessary tools and materials.  We present their list: </p><ul><li>  5 liter plastic container; </li><li>  300 ml white PET milk bottles (about 20 pcs.); </li><li>  a piece of rubber hose or pipe made of metal plastic (60-70 cm); </li><li>  the wire is thick and thin; </li><li>  big strong scissors; </li><li>  candle; </li><li>  marker; </li><li>  black and red paint; </li><li>  household gloves. </li></ul><p>  When all these materials have been prepared, you can start making pots from plastic bottles. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  We form the frame of the garden sculpture in the form of a swan figurine </h2><p>  A five-liter capacity will be the basis of the cache-pot (the body of a swan).  Since the purpose of this product is to grow plants in it, you need to make a container for the soil.  Put a 5-liter bottle on its side, with a marker, draw a line of plastic cut in a circle.  Mark the hole from the bottom of the container and almost to the neck. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plastic pots from bottles" class="if" height="210" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/450267.jpg" width="300"></div>  Next, we cut the plastic with a pair of scissors in a line.  You get a bottle with a big hole on its side.  Insert thick wire into the hose or pipe.  Place this structure through the neck inside the container.  Bend the part that remains on the surface, forming the swan neck of the figure.  Make two holes on the plastic next to each other with an awl or burn them with the same, pre-heating on fire.  Pull a thin wire through these holes, grabbing the pipe, and twist its ends from the outside.  Thus, you will secure the hose, which will make the pots made of plastic bottles stable.

    <h2>  Making a feather for a swan from white PET containers </h2><p>  With plastic milk containers, cut off the bottom and neck.  Cut the bottle bodies into 4-5 elements in length, approximately the same in width.  On one side, cut the ends diagonally, giving the workpieces the shape of feathers.  Next, mark the places of incisions on them with a marker to make a ‚Äúfringe‚Äù that visually conveys the structure of the pen.  Use scissors to complete this design.  To make plastic pots from bottles in the form of birds look even more believable, you need to give the pen a rounded shape.  To do this, hold the blank for a few seconds above the candle.  From heating, the plastic will begin to melt, and the "fringe" will wrap.  On the finished feathers, make two holes.  Using thin wire, connect these elements in pairs. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  To design the neck of the figurine, we perform feathers differently.  Only remove the bottom from milk bottles.  Cut them into 4-5 strips, leaving the connection at the top of the neck.  Next, proceed to the stage of attaching the "pen" to the frame of the pots from plastic bottles </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="plastic bottle swan pots" class="if" height="335" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/449697.jpg" width="288"></div>

    <h2>  Decoration of a garden sculpture "Swan" from a PET container </h2><p>  Attach a feather, connected in pairs, over the entire body of the figure with a wire, starting from the tail.  Arrange the workpieces so that they find one on top of the other.  Wear plastic feathers made from bottles with necks around your neck.  They must also be stacked one on top of the other.  Next, the swan needs to form a head.  Pierce one workpiece with a neck in the thread area in two places.  Attach a hose to the wire through the holes.  Screw another one or two caps onto the lid from the milk bottle, placing them as parts of the pyramid.  Screw the construction onto the neck of the last bottle on the neck.  So you made a beak from the caps of a swan. </p><p>  Black paint on the sculpture eyes.  Beak in red.  Paint can be used acrylic, enamel for exterior use or any other waterproof.  Plastic sculpture dries quickly.  Within an hour you can use home-made plastic flower pots from bottles for their intended purpose - pour soil into them and plant plants.  Or, even easier, place flowerpots in them with an already growing flower.  Next, select a place on the site and install your decorative swan there.  Such an original figure will delight you and attract the attention of passers-by. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hanging pot from a plastic bottle" class="if" height="327" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/449698.jpg" width="490"></div>

    <h2>  How to make small hanging flower pots from plastic bottles: preparation step </h2><p>  For flower pots of small shape from PET containers with a volume of 1.5-2 liters, you can make hanging planters.  How to do this, read the next part of the article. </p><p>  According to this description, you can make the product in the form of animal faces.  But according to the same principle, flowerpots with other decorative design or without it at all are made.  For work, we prepare the following materials: </p><ul><li>  plastic bottle; </li><li>  acrylic paints; </li><li>  paper template of the animal's face (bunny, bear, mouse, etc.); </li><li>  marker; </li><li>  rope; </li><li>  scissors. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hanging pot made of plastic bottles" class="if" height="473" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/16344/449691.jpg" width="269"></div></li></ul><h2>  Small pots on pendants: production </h2><p>  Remove the label from the bottle, rinse the remaining glue with hot water.  Cut the upper part of the container, it will not be needed in work.  Place the template on the second half of the bottle, circle it with a marker.  Trim the top of the product along the drawn lines, giving the cache-pot silhouette of the animal's head so that the ears stick out.  On the sides of the workpiece, pierce the holes through which the rope will stretch.  Paint the whole craft with white acrylic paint.  Further, when it dries, fill out the features of the face with different colors: eyes, nose, mouth, mustache, ears.  Pull the rope through the holes on the sides.  Everything, a cache-pot from a plastic bottle (hanging) is ready.  Put a flower pot in it and place it in the intended place. </p>
