Abkhazia and its main resort</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Undoubtedly, one of the closest resorts that most attract Russian tourists is Sukhumi, Abkhazia.  The fate of this city is very interesting, and its roots go back centuries.  Ancient ethnoses lived on this territory during the time of the primitive system, and in the 6th century AD, a city grew here on the Black Sea coast.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to see all the sights that were erected here during the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and Classicism, since it was literally erased from the face of the Earth several times.  Now one of the most visited resorts is Sukhumi.  Abkhazia, although separated from Georgia, still contains many traditions of this wonderful country. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukhumi Abkhazia" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276245.jpg" width="550"></div>

    <p>  The new history of the city begins in the twentieth century, when it was already rebuilt by the Soviet authorities.  Then hotels and pensions were built in Sukhumi, and private development was very popular.  Over the whole century, a lot of luxury villas have grown here, which belonged to the authorities and wealthy people.  So, it is on the territory of Sukhumi that Abkhazia appears before the traveler in the form of strict and at the same time light streets, on which gray faceless Soviet pensions and luxurious cottages that were built before and continue to be built now coexist. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukhumi Abkhazia map" class="if" height="450" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276244.jpg" width="600"></div>

It is a real magnet for all tourists, as well as for researchers who conduct their experiments here and replenish their knowledge.  In the next century, a monkey nursery opened near the garden, which also became a research center at the same time.  It was this place, according to scientists of the USSR, that made a huge contribution to the development of science. </p><p>  On the lands of the city of Sukhumi, Abkhazia also manifests itself in all its high cost, since it is this resort in the whole region that is considered the most fashionable.  But despite this status, there are still a lot of ‚ÄúSovdepovskie‚Äù hotels, cafes and even dining rooms.  However, local entrepreneurs are working hard to ensure that all the institutions of the city have a European level of both conditions and services.  It is worth noting that the most popular hotel in Sukhumi is Ritsa.  Many vacationers note that the prices in it are very humane. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Sukhumi Abkhazia sanatoriums" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10682/276243.jpg" width="471"></div>

    <p>  The green and picturesque Black Sea city is Sukhumi (Abkhazia).  The map of this region shows that it is located in a subtropical climate, and therefore there are no severe winters here.  On New Year's Eve, the temperature drops to +10 degrees, and in summer rises above 30. The sun's rays warm the sea perfectly, and the whole city is buried in the green of eucalyptus trees, palm trees and other tropical plants.  The air here is extremely clean, so people who suffer from respiratory ailments often come here. </p><p>  The city-hospital is also Sukhumi <span>(Abkhazia).</span>  <span>The resorts</span> in this region, oddly enough, are equipped much better than even expensive hotels, and the wellness program in them is very effective.  Most often, people with asthma and heart failure are sent here, as well as in cases where there is a risk of stroke. </p>
