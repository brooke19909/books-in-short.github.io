How to make a rocking chair with your own hands</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Furniture can be made not only from boards, but also from any improvised material.  The only question is how strong, reliable and durable it will be.  Consider how to make a <span>chair with your own hands from plastic bottles,</span> cardboard, wine corks, hoops and threads. </p><h2>  Bottle seat </h2><p>  For the chair you need the same bottles (do not remove the covers).  You make modules out of them so that the furniture is durable.  For one module you will need three bottles.  One bottle should be intact, the other two cut into two unequal parts (the top should be smaller).  Now insert the top with the cork down into the second half.  Insert a whole bottle on top.  Cover it with the second half of the third bottle.  Slice the module rewind with tape. </p><p>  Now fasten two or four modules together with tape or packing tape.  You need to collect as much as necessary for the chair.  To understand what blocks need to be formed, fold the modules in the form of a chair with armrests, and then bandage them. </p><p>  For example, connect the armrests, back, bottom separately, and then fasten all the parts together.  Do not save on packing tape, as the bottles should not be moved. </p><p>  Instead of plastic bottles, you can take iron cans from under the infant formula and make an armchair, a <span>bed with your own hands.</span>  Once the case is ready, fit it with foam rubber.  Sew pillows for the seat and back of the chair separately.  Attach them to the foam.  Cover with fabric for furniture.  Now you can tailor the cloak and decorate the chair.  If you make the case motionless, then the furniture can last several years. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make a chair do it yourself" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/842216.jpg" width="594"></div>

Try to take the longest cord, as knots under pressure from weight can become loose over time. </p><p>  Crochet the ‚Äúseat‚Äù to fit the hoop.  Any pattern or pattern of napkins, even a simple arched grid, will do.  Please note that under weight, the bottom will sag.  Therefore, if you want a hard chair, a napkin in size should be smaller than a hoop.  That is, the bottom is pulled to the base.  You can not knit a seat, but with the help of macrame to make a hanging chair with your own hands. </p><p>  Next, you need to tie or weave the top.  To do this, from cords (the number depends on the weight of the person, and the length on the height of the ceiling) weave a small segment, drag it through the mount.  Start expanding your knitting by weaving cords together.  After 20 centimeters, you braid the gymnastic ring.  In this case, all the cords are distributed in an even amount, and the rest of the space is filled with other polyester segments. </p><p>  Continue weaving all the cords together, forming the back of the chair (resembles a tent).  Next, with the same cords, braid the hoop.  Therefore, the segments must be long and the fastening secure.  In fact, the chair is ready, but for beauty, you can slightly knit the bottom and decorate with a fringe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hanging chair" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/842254.jpg" width="595"></div>

To do this, you need patterns.  They can be of any shape, but the most popular is pear-shaped with an oval end.  Patterns are done twice - on raincoat and upholstery fabric. </p><p>  It is undesirable for the inside to take the lining fabric, since under the weight of the weight it will creep.  Better buy raincoat fabric, it is durable and waterproof.  This is especially important if you have small children. </p><p>  Sew patterns, fill them with special foam balls.  Do this on the street or in the garage, as they magnetize, stick to your hands and scatter in different directions.  The result was an inner bag.  Now you sew a cover from the same nine patterns (six wedges, one top and two halves of the bottom), only sew on the zipper to the bottom or between two wedges.  As you can see, it‚Äôs easy to make a chair bag with your own hands. </p><p>  It is impossible to predict which form is best for the seated person.  Only with the first experience will you be able to understand how many granules need to be poured, what fabric to use, what patterns should be. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself bag chair" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/842226.jpg" width="365"></div>
