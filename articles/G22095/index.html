    <h2>  Periodization of Ancient China </h2><p>  All these dynasties are also divided into several groups. </p><p>  Stages of periodization of state history in Ancient China: </p><p>  1. The first people in the Neolithic era. </p><p>  2. The period with the first three dynasties, when China was fragmented, there was no empire as such. </p><p>  3. Traditional China and the empire. </p><p>  This is where the whole of old China ends, the dynasties as such cease to rule and the last stage begins, covering only the 20th and 21st centuries. </p><p>  However, the period before the Middle Ages dates back to Ancient China, it ends in the Han Dynasty.  The entire period of the existence of Ancient China can be expressed as building the foundation for a great state, for the one it is now. </p><p>  Let us briefly consider below the history of civilization and the periodization of Ancient China, social and state systems, as well as the philosophy of that time and great inventions. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="periodization of the history of the state in ancient China" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2065867.jpg"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The beginning of the story </h2><p>  It is known that the first ancestors of the Chinese lived 400 thousand years ago in the Neolithic era.  The remains of Sinanthropus were found in a cave near Beijing.  The first people already owned staining and some other skills. </p><p>  In general, the territory of China is convenient for life, so history goes back to such a distant past.  The soil is fertile, and the steppe itself is surrounded by the sea, mountains, which could protect people from the attacks of enemies.  Such a convenient location and attracted the first residents who were the ancestors of today's Chinese. </p><p>  Scientists also know that there were two cultures after the synanthropes: Yangshao and Longshan.  There were probably more, but they were mixed together.  Only two archaeologically confirmed. </p><p>  Yangshao culture existed 2-3 thousand years BC.  People of that period lived on a vast territory from Gansu province and right up to the south of Manchuria.  It is known that they could make beautiful colored ceramic products. </p><p>  Longshan was located mainly in the province of Shandong.  In central China, both cultures overlapped.  People, too, possessed the skill of processing ceramics, but their main pride was the ability to make various objects from bone.  On some of them, which were found by scientists, scraped inscriptions are found.  This was the first prerequisite for writing. </p><p>  Further, we can conditionally distinguish several stages of the periodization of the history and culture of Ancient China.  The first three dynasties belong to the stage before the formation of the <span>Chinese Empire,</span> then many dynasties during the existence of the Empire, and the last stage is followed by a system without dynasties and modern China. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Xia Dynasty </h2><p>  The first known dynasty in the chronology and periodization of Ancient China is <span>the Xia Dynasty.</span>  Its founder was Yu, and it existed from 2205 to 1557 BC.  According to some theories, the state was located throughout the east of Northern China, or only in the north and in the center of Henan. </p><p>  The first rulers coped well with their tasks of government.  The main asset of the Xia era is the calendar of the time, which subsequently was admired by Confucius himself. </p><p>  However, decline happened, and it was caused by pressure from the clergy, and the rulers-confessors soon began to neglect their duties as clergy.  Calendar dates began to get confused, the periodization of Ancient China went astray, the social and political structure was lame.  This weakening was used by the emperor Li of the state of Shan, who began the subsequent dynasty. </p><h2>  Shang Yin Dynasty </h2><p>  The period of rule begins in the XVIII or XVI century BC.  e.  according to various theories, but ends in the XII or XI century BC.  e. </p><p>  In total, this dynasty has about 30 rulers.  Li Tang (founder of the dynasty) and his tribe believed in totemism.  They adopted the custom of fortune telling on bones from the Longshan culture, and they also used tortoise shells for predictions. </p><p>  During the reign of Shang-Yin, a centralized management policy reigned under the emperor of the dynasty reigned. </p><p>  The end of the period came when the Zhou tribes overthrew the ruler. </p><h2>  Zhou Dynasty </h2><p>  Zhou is the last powerful dynasty of the first stage in the periodization of the history of the state of Ancient China until the formation of the Chinese Empire, which existed from the 9th to the 3rd century BC. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  There are two stages: Western and Eastern Zhou.  Western Zhou had the capital Zongzhou in the west, and possessions covered almost the entire basin of the Yellow River.  The essence of the politics of that time was that the main emperor ruled in the capital, and his close associates (usually relatives) ruled over many destinies into which the state split.  This entailed civil strife and the struggle for power.  But in the end, stronger possessions enslaved the weaker ones. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient china periodization social order state system" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2065871.jpg"></div>

    <p>  China at the same time defended itself from the constant attacks of the barbarians.  That is why the ruler moved from the western capital to the eastern capital of Chenzhou in the state of Loy in 770 BC, and the period of the history of Ancient China called Western Zhou began.  The move of the ruler conditionally meant a renunciation of power and government. </p><p>  All of China was split into several kingdoms: Yan, Zhao, Song, Zheng, Lu, Qi, Chu, Wei, Han, Qin, and into many small principalities that large kingdoms conquered over time.  In fact, some kingdoms were much more powerful in politics than the kingdom where the main ruler of Zhou was located.  Qi and Qin were considered the most powerful, and it was their rulers who made a greater contribution to politics and to the fight against barbarians. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth highlighting the kingdom of Lou from these kingdoms.  Education and writing reigned in him, although Lou was not very strong politically.  It was here that Confucius was born and lived - the founder of Confucianism.  The end of the Zhou period is usually considered the year of the death of the philosopher in 479 BC.  Confucius wrote the story of Western Zhou in the Chunqiu annals.  Many events of that time are known only thanks to these records.  It is also known that Taoism began to penetrate into China during this period. </p><p>  The end of the dynasty was the fact that all the kingdoms fought among themselves for power.  The most powerful one won - Qin with the ruler Qin Shihuandi, who after the conquest was able to unite all of China and began a new dynasty.  And the ruler Zhou himself lost the status of a heavenly mandate. </p><h2>  Qin </h2><p>  Since the ruler of Qin united all of China, a new stage in the history and periodization of ancient China began.  The era of fragmentation was replaced by the era of imperial rule with the united parts of the whole state. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="periods of the history of ancient china" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2065776.jpg"></div>

    <p>  The era did not last long.  Only from 221 to 207 BC, but it is Qin Shihuandi (the first emperor) who makes a special contribution to the culture of ancient China.  During this period, the Great Wall of China was built - a special treasure of the state, whose greatness is still amazing.  Ruler Qin Shi Huang has carried out many reforms.  For example, monetary and judicial reform, as well as written reform.  Under him, the construction of a single network of roads began. </p><p>  Despite all the advantages, historians distinguish significant disadvantages, which were the reason that the Qin period did not last long.  Qin Shihuandi was a supporter of legism.  Legism is a philosophical school of that period, the essence of which was in very harsh measures for people and punishments for any wrongdoings and not only.  This influenced such a sharp leap in the form of victories over different tribes and the construction of the Wall of China so quickly in order to protect against barbarians and enemy captives.  But it was cruelty that caused the dislike of people and a sharp change of dynasties immediately after the death of Qin Shi Huang. </p>

    <h2>  Han and Xin </h2><p>  The Han Empire lasted from 206 BC to 220 AD.  It is divided into two periods: Western Han (from 206 B.C. to 9 A.D.) and Late (Eastern) Han (25-220 A.D.) </p><p>  Western Han had to deal with the aftermath of the Qin period.  Hunger and mortality reigned in the empire. </p><p>  Ruler Liu Bang freed many of the state slaves who became involuntary under Qin for the wrongdoing.  He also abolished harsh taxes and heavy penalties. </p><p>  However, in 140-87 years BC.  e.  the empire returned to despotism, as under the ruler of Qin.  The ruler of the U-di dynasty again imposed high taxes, which were levied even on children and the elderly (this led to frequent killings in families).  The territories of China by this time greatly expanded. </p><p>  Between Western and Eastern Han there was a span of the Xin Dynasty, led by ruler Wang Man, who managed to overthrow the Eastern Han.  He tried to strengthen his power by conducting many positive reforms.  For example, a specific land area was established for each family.  If it was higher than expected, then part was given to the poor or people without land. </p><p>  But at the same time, there was a mess with officials, because of which the treasury was empty, and taxes had to be increased significantly.  This was the reason for the discontent of people.  The uprisings began, it also served as an advantage for the representatives of <span>the Han Dynasty.</span>  Van Man was killed during a rebellion called Red Eyebrows. </p><p>  Liu Xiu was nominated for the throne.  He wanted to reduce people's hostility to power by lowering taxes and freeing slaves.  The period of Western Han began.  This time also made a significant contribution to history.  It was then that the Great Silk Road was established. </p><p>  At the end of the second century, excitement flared up again among the people.  The uprising of the "yellow dressings" began, which lasted almost 20 years.  The dynasty was overthrown, the period of the three kingdoms began. </p><p>  Although the Han period was a period of recovery, at the end of the era after a twenty-year war, a constant struggle began between the dynasty commanders and other leaders.  This entailed yet another unrest in the empire and mortality. </p><h2>  Jin </h2><p>  The Jin era and subsequent periods can already be attributed to the Middle Ages, but we will consider the very first dynasties to understand what the policy of Ancient China led to and how the rulers had to eliminate the consequences. </p><p>  The population after the Han Wars has decreased several times.  There were also cataclysms.  Rivers began to change their channels, thereby causing flooding and the decline of the economy.  The situation was aggravated by the constant raids of nomads. </p><p>  Cao Cao, who completed the uprising of the "yellow blindfolds", united the fragmented north of China in 216.  And in 220, his son Cao Pei founded the Wei Dynasty.  At the same time, the states of Shu and U emerged. And so the period of the three kingdoms began.  Constant wars began between them, which exacerbated the military-political situation inside China. </p><p>  In 249, Sima Zhao became the head of <span>the state of</span> Wei.  And his son Sima Yan, when his father died, took the throne and founded the Jin Dynasty.  First, Wei conquered the state of Shu, and then U. The period of the three kingdoms came to an end, the Jin era began (265‚Äì316).  Soon, the nomads conquered the north, the capital had to be moved from Luoyang to the south of China. </p><p>  Symya Yan began distributing land to his relatives.  In 280, a decree was issued on an allotment system, the essence of which was that each person was entitled to a land plot, but in return people should pay the treasury.  This was necessary to improve relations with ordinary people, replenish the treasury and raise the economy. </p><p>  However, this did not entail an improvement in centralization, as expected, but vice versa.  After the death of Sima Yan in 290, a struggle began between the owners of large estates - the relatives of the deceased ruler.  It lasted 15 years, from 291 to 306.  At the same time, in the north of the state, the positions of nomads were strengthened.  Gradually, they settled along the rivers, began to grow rice and enslave entire settlements of people. </p><p>  In the Jin period, as you know, the religion of Buddhism began to strengthen.  Many monks and Buddhist temples appeared. </p><h2>  Sui </h2><p>  Only in 581, after a long period of unrest, Zhou Yang Jiang managed to unite the north, fragmented by nomads.  The reign of the Sui dynasty begins.  He then captures the state of Chen in the south and thereby unites all of China.  His son, Yang Di, went to war with some of the states of Korea and Vietnam, created the Great Canal for transporting rice and improved the Chinese Wall.  But people were under painful conditions, because of which a new uprising began, and Yang Di was killed in 618. </p><h2>  Chan </h2><p>  Li Yuan founded the dynasty, which lasted from 618 to 907.  The empire reached its peak during this period.  Rulers of Lee improved economic ties with other states.  Cities and numbers in them began to increase.  We began to actively develop crops (tea, cotton).  Especially in this regard, Li Yuan's son, Li Shimin, stood out, whose policy has reached a new level.  However, in the VIII century, the conflict between the military and power in the center of the empire reached its peak.  In 874, the Huang Chao War began, which lasted until 901, due to which the dynasty ended.  In the years 907‚Äì960, the Chinese Empire was again fragmented. </p><h2>  State and social systems of Ancient China </h2><p>  The periodization of all periods of Ancient China can be considered as similar stages of history in their structure.  The basis of social order is collective farming.  The main activity of people is cattle breeding and crafts (which were developed to a high level). </p><p>  At the top of power was the aristocracy, below were slaves and peasants. </p><p>  The patrimonial heritage was pronounced.  During the Shang-Yin period, each of the relatives of the ruler was given a special title, depending on how close the relatives were.  Each title gave its privileges. </p><p>  During the Yin and Western Zhou periods, land was given out only for use and farming, but not as private property.  And since the East Zhou period, land has already been handed out for private ownership. </p><p>  Slaves were first state-owned and then became private.  Prisoners, very poor community members, tramps and others usually fell into their category. </p><p>  In the stages of periodization of Ancient China's social and state structure, it is possible to distinguish that in the Yin era, the brother of the deceased ruler first inherited the throne, and in Zhou the title passed to his son from his father. </p><p>  Under the ruler, the palace management system reigned. </p><p>  Separately, it is worth highlighting when speaking about the periodization of the history of the state and Ancient China: law already existed, but at the initial stage it was strongly intertwined with religious principles and ordinary ethics.  The patriarchy reigned, revered elders and fathers. </p><p>  In the V ‚Äî III centuries BC.  e.  law was an integral part with cruel punishments, while there was already legism.  And during the Han Dynasty, people again returned to Confucianism and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãharmonious inequality of people depending on rank. </p><p>  The first written sources of law date back to about 536 BC. </p><h2>  Philosophy </h2><p>  The philosophy of ancient China is very different from the philosophy of any other European countries.  If in Christianity and Islam there is a god and life after death, then in Asian schools there was a principle of "here and now."  In China, too, they appealed for kindness in life, but simply for harmony and well-being, and not under pain of punishment after death. </p><p>  It was based on a trinity: heaven, earth, and man himself.  People also believed that there is Qi energy, and there should be harmony in everything.  The feminine and masculine principles were distinguished: yin and yang, which complement each other for harmony. </p><p>  In total, there are several basic philosophical schools of the time: Confucianism, Buddhism, Moism, Legism, Taoism. </p><ul><li>  Confucianism is one of the first schools.  Its founder was Confucius, who lived during the Eastern Zhou.  He did not have the goal of founding a whole religion, but his whole philosophy really liked the Chinese mentality.  He had many students who adopted all his wisdom and knowledge.  It is known that he wrote the most important chronicle, describing the entire stage of the Late Zhou.  This undoubtedly made a huge contribution to history.  The philosopher himself believed that harmony could be achieved in everything.  He appealed to ethics, kindness and decent behavior with education.  He had his own views on the proper conduct of the politics of the time, which, of course, was a little idealized. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="ancient china periodization public order" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2065870.jpg"></div></li><li>  Legism existed during the Qin Dynasty.  Legism and Confucianism have been fighting for almost half a millennium.       :  ,   .             ,     ,    "  ". </li><li> Buddhism is believed to have originated during the Han Dynasty, but it gained the most popularity under the Jin.  Religion came from India.  Practical Chinese did not like the fact that asceticism was the basis of Buddhism, because it seemed impractical for real life.  But many liked the very principles of Buddhism in relation to people and life.  Religion has changed slightly in China, unlike what it was in India. </li><li>  Moism was founded by the philosopher Mosey (470‚Äì390 BC).  The main thoughts of the philosophical trend were: peacefulness, the pursuit of good for more people, the suppression of aggression. </li></ul><p>  Thus, to summarize what has been said, we can conclude: already before our era, Ancient China formulated a certain philosophy and adhered to some religions, which until now in China are an integral part of the spiritual life of the population.  At that time, all basic schools changed and only occasionally overlapped each other depending on the stage of periodization. </p><h2>  Culture of Ancient China: Heritage, Crafts and Inventions </h2><p>  To this day, the <span>Terracotta Army</span> and the Great Wall of China are still considered the greatest assets of China.  The most amazing thing is that they were built under the leadership of the first emperor of ancient China, Qin Shi Huang from the Qin dynasty.  It was then that legalism and cruelty reigned over people who, under fear and pressure, built these truly great structures. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="periodization of the history of the state and law of ancient China" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/47097/2065780.jpg"></div>

    <p>  But the great inventions include gunpowder, paper, typography and a compass. </p><p>  It is believed that Cai Lun invented the paper in 105 BC.  e.  Its manufacture required a special technology, which nevertheless resembles the current paper manufacturing process.  Before this period, people scraped up letters on shells, bones, clay tablets and bamboo bundles.  The invention of paper led to the invention of typography in a later period of our era. </p><p>  The first semblance of a compass originated in Ancient China during the Han Dynasty. </p><p>  But crafts in ancient China, there were countless numbers.  A few thousand years BC.  e.  they began to extract silk (the extraction technology of which has long remained secret), tea appeared, clay and bone products were made.  A little later, the Great Silk Road appeared, they made drawings on silk, sculptures made of marble, and paintings on the walls.  And also in ancient China, well-known pagodas and acupuncture appeared. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  The social and political structure of ancient China (periodization from the Neolithic era to the Han dynasty) had its drawbacks and advantages.  Subsequent dynasties adjusted the way they conduct politics.  And the whole history of ancient China can be described as periods of rises and falls, moving in a spiral.  Moving up, so the "heyday" each time became more advanced and better.  Periodization of the history of ancient China is a voluminous and interesting topic, which we examined in the article. </p>
