  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to hide the number on the "Android": methods, utilities</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Sometimes a situation may arise when you need to hide the number on the android device.  Here we are talking about practical jokes, interviews, appeals to some services or services, etc. Some try to get rid of tracking ways in every possible way.  In general, there are many scenarios, but the result is one - hide the number on the Android. </p><p>  Developers in the latest versions of the platform took into account the wishes of users and provided regular means to perform this procedure.  In addition, there are many third-party applications on Google Play that allow you to hide the number on Android when making a call.  The latter, however, do not always come across with a high-quality code, but there are still enough useful utilities. </p><p>  So, let's try to figure out how to hide the number on the ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù, what steps should be taken to do this, and make it as painless as possible for both the user and his smartphone.  First, consider the option with full-time functionality, and after - third-party programs. </p><h2>  Established funds </h2><p>  We will figure out how to hide the number on Android 6.0 using the classic menu.  In other versions of the platform, the principle is the same, but the designation of the items may vary slightly.  Moreover, getting lost there is quite difficult, so let's get started. </p><div class="photo" data-original="smotrisoft.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how on android to hide the number when calling" class="if uuid-2692203" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2692203.jpg"></div><ol><li>  We open "Settings" either from the icon or from the sliding panel. </li><li>  Next, go to the "Call Settings" section. </li><li>  Then select the item "Advanced Options". </li><li>  Then open the sub-item ‚ÄúCaller ID‚Äù. </li><li>  Click on "Hide number" and you're done. </li></ol><p>  After that, the phone should think for a while, after which a notification window may appear that the new settings have taken effect.  If you hide the number on Android in this way, the subscriber on the other end of the line will not only not see who called him, but will also receive anonymous SMS and messages from the network operator about availability or inaccessibility. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  This method can sometimes fail and at the same time display your real number, but here it is mostly the fault of the mobile operator, not the platform.  In addition, there are very few such cases. </p><h2>  Numbers combination </h2><p>  You can also use a certain digital combination if you want to hide the number on the Android device absolutely free.  This option is in no way dependent on your mobile operator and works on all gadgets running the Android platform. </p><div class="photo" data-original="ilyarm.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to hide the number for free on android" class="if uuid-2692204" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2692204.jpg"></div><ol><li>  Select the number you want to call from the list of contacts. </li><li>  Then click on the item ‚ÄúEdit / Change Number‚Äù. </li><li>  Then enter the combination # 31 # immediately before the number and international code. </li></ol><p>  For example, you are going to anonymously call a subscriber with a phone number of 989 811 31 78. The final version will look like this - # 31 # 9898113178.  A user at that end will receive a ‚ÄúNumber Hidden‚Äù or Unknown notification. </p><h2>  3rd party applications </h2><p>  As mentioned above, on Google Play a dime a dozen utilities of such a plan.  But the most popular are two programs - Try-Out and Hide Caller ID.  They are simple, understandable and have a lot of positive feedback from consumers.  Let's consider them in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Try out </h2><p>  This application works stably with all domestic telecom operators and there are no such problems as in the case with standard means.  The program reliably protects your personal number, and the subscriber at the other end of the line will always receive a notification about a hidden call. </p><div class="photo" data-original="apkpure.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to hide the number on android 6 0" class="if uuid-2692201" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2692201.jpg"></div><p>  The utility is distributed completely free of charge, but with some limitations.  You can use all the features of the application only with the first 10 calls, and then you will either have to buy a key or refuse it. </p><p>  After installation, the program immediately prompts you to hide the number, and if necessary, perform a number of other procedures: change the international code, country or blacklist some subscribers.  Users quite positively respond to this application, but some complain about clumsy Russian-language localization.  But this is not critical, because a consumer of any level can understand the program, even in English. </p><h2>  Hide caller id </h2><p>  This utility perfectly hides personal numbers, and its work also does not depend on the current mobile operator.  At least with the venerable three - MTS, Megafon and Beeline, it works stably and does not allow punctures. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.newstracklive.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hide caller id" class="if uuid-2692202" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/34662/2692202.jpg"></div><p>  In addition, the program can hide all numbers in your phone book from prying eyes and block a specific number for incoming calls.  There is also child protection, which prevents accidental dialing if your phone is in the hands of a child. </p><p>  The program interface is intuitive, simple and even a novice in this business will understand it, despite the lack of Russian-language localization.  In addition, a wizard assistant can be included in the menu, which will guide you through the main functionality of the application and tell you in difficult situations. </p><p>  The utility is distributed under a paid and free license.  In the first case, there are no restrictions, and in the second there is only the possibility of prohibiting the display of your number to other subscribers.  There is no advertising in either the first or second case. </p>
