    <h2>  Design and appearance </h2><p>  We‚Äôll now examine how users and experts rate the appearance of the HTC Desire 526G.  A review of relevant points of view can be carried out by analyzing a fairly wide range of opinions of the owners of this device, presented on thematic online portals. </p><p>  According to smartphone users, the device has a stylish high-quality design, comparable to that which characterizes products that are presented even in higher price segments.  The phone comes on the market in different colors.  Among the most popular modifications in which the smartphone HTC Desire 526G - White is presented.  A review of the opinions presented on the thematic portals allows you to observe a high rating from users regarding the balance of colors between the case and the phone controls. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The phone case in various color modifications is made using bright and fairly contrasting materials.  The HTC Desire 526G Black, the review of which we present in our article, has a black body and, therefore, has a more rigorous and conservative design. </p><h2>  Build quality </h2><p>  The build quality of the phone is also highly rated by users.  The device has a removable back cover, which is attached to the main part of the body through reliable clips.  In terms of ergonomics, the reviews for the HTC Desire 526G phone (a review of the opinions regarding this option allows us to talk about it) are also positive.  The device, according to customers, is convenient to hold in their hands due to the relatively small dimensions and shape of the case. </p><p>  Now let's look at how smartphone users rate its performance.  It depends primarily on the characteristics of the processor installed in the smartphone. </p>

    <h2>  Device performance: processor </h2><p>  The speed of the phone, judging by the range of opinions of customers and experts that can be found on thematic portals, generally corresponds to the performance of competing solutions in its segment.  Thus, launching a demanding game with three-dimensional graphics on the phone can be problematic. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  However, if we talk about applications installed on the HTC Desire 526G device, the review of which can be studied on a large number of specialized resources, then many of the common solutions function very stably.  This is largely explained by the fact that the phone is equipped with a sufficiently fast MTK MT 6582 processor, which has a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz, and also uses the resources of the Mali-400 MP graphics module. </p><p>  Due to the performance of the MT 6582 chip, the main elements of the smartphone‚Äôs operating system interface are stable, users do not notice any noticeable freezes or malfunctions. </p><h2>  Device Performance: RAM </h2><p>  The device has a relatively modest amount of RAM - 1 GB.  However, to run the main applications of this resource is enough.  Even some games load quite well with the appropriate amount of RAM, as well as the performance of the processor and graphics module. </p><h2>  Display </h2><p>  The display of the HTC Desire 526G (an overview of its capabilities is also often found on thematic resources, and this allows you to evaluate the opinions of experts regarding this hardware component of the phone) has a diagonal of 4.7 inches and a resolution of 540 by 960 pixels.  This indicator is not quite outstanding, and this leads to noticeable difficulties when reading text in small print from the device‚Äôs screen. </p><p>  But in terms of color rendering, the display is rated quite highly by users and experts.  There are no noticeable color distortions when viewing the screen at different angles.  The display is bright enough.  You can activate the mode of viewing content with minimal backlight.  This option can be demanded by users who like to read texts at night, and the quality of the image remains high. </p><h2>  Video and sound </h2><p>  Playing video and sound on the HTC Desire 526G Dual SIM device (an overview of this function of the device may also be of importance to the user) can be implemented in a variety of formats.  The smartphone provides high quality playback of multimedia files with a sufficient volume level.  Provided, of course, that the initial quality of the content is also at a sufficient level. </p><p>  If necessary, you can adjust the sound playback using the equalizer.  In general, the quality of the sound played on the HTC Desire 526G phone - a review of the opinions of users and experts may indicate this - is at the level of the leading models in the segment. </p><h2>  Cameras </h2><p>  The phone is equipped with 2 cameras: a front camera with a resolution of 2 MP, and the main one with an indicator of 8 MP.  The second has an LED flash. </p>

    <p>  The quality of images created using cameras, again, is generally at the level of leading segment decisions.  The quality of images in macro mode is well appreciated by users and experts.  Stable operation of specialized applications for working with the camera is noted.  If necessary, using the appropriate interface, you can adjust the exposure, as well as white balance.  You can also set the optimal ISO parameters if the automatic module for selecting the appropriate indicators does not provide the highest quality shooting. </p><h2>  Panoramic shooting </h2><p>  The camera of the HTC Desire 526G Dual SIM smartphone - a review of customer opinions may indicate this - does a great job with <span>panoramic shooting.</span>  According to experts, this may be due to the high quality of software algorithms that combine the frames in the corresponding shooting mode.  By using the camera of the phone in question, you can create panoramas with a 360-degree view.  Such capabilities are not always characteristic of smartphones of the corresponding segment.  Thus, in terms of this function, the smartphone is among the most competitive solutions. </p><h2>  Create videos </h2><p>  Using the camera of the <span>HTC Desire 526G Dual SIM</span> phone <span>(review, reviews</span> regarding the phone confirm this), you can create high-quality FullHD videos.  But the most optimal format, according to many users, will still be HD, since, on the one hand, in practice the quality of multimedia files will not visually differ significantly, on the other hand, it will save disk space.  Video recording is carried out in the common 3GP format. </p><p>  According to users, the smartphone provides a very good quality soundtrack of videos.  Among the most notable features that the phone has in terms of creating video are the use of electronic stabilization, the Time Lapse function.  Thus, from the point of view of creating multimedia content, the phone in question is among the leaders in its segment in combining manufacturability and productivity. </p><h2>  Battery </h2><p>  We‚Äôll study what users say about the battery life of the device.  In general, the corresponding indicator is rated well.  The battery of the device lasts for about 3.5 hours of viewing multimedia content on the screen and for about 22 hours of using applications.  If you use a smartphone to play sound, then the battery will last about 10 hours.  These indicators approximately correspond to the battery capacity, which is 2 thousand mAh. </p><p>  Of course, these indicators may vary depending on the individual characteristics of using the HTC Desire 526G Dual device.  A review of device capabilities by one expert may show results that differ from those obtained by another. </p><h2>  operating system </h2><p>  The device is controlled by the Android operating system in version 4.4.2.  In this case, the OS operates on a proprietary shell from the manufacturer.  The phone has a full-time set of applications, a fairly large number of services from Google. </p>
