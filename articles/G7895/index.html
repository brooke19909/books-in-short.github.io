The hotel is located in a special resort area designed for tourists.  It is located a few tens of meters from the sea.  The nearest airport is about twenty-five kilometers.  Morocco is a new destination for beach vacations and travels, so there are not many Russians in the hotel.  Most often, residents of the Middle East and Europeans rest here.  But the hotel reviews are very positive, and now we will introduce you to them. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="les almohades beach resort agadir 4" class="if" height="328" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/5419/1540784.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Agadir </h2><p>  This ‚Äúwhite walled city‚Äù (namely, its name is translated from Arabic) is one of the most popular resorts in Morocco.  He looks completely European: here you rarely see women with a closed face, and on the streets almost all people are dressed in the usual style for us.  The city has a zoo with free admission, which tourists recommend visiting - the ‚ÄúValley of the Birds‚Äù.  There are also a lot of species of exotic animals.  A pleasant walking area - Mohammed Fifth Boulevard - is popular with European tourists.  This street is very picturesque and conducive to relaxation.  And young people are advised to visit at least one of the resort‚Äôs famous nightclubs.  If you want to see the sights of the old Medina, visit the Lubnan mosque (or Lebanon). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get that nearby </h2><p>  The nearest airport to the hotel is Al Massira, located twenty-eight kilometers away.  As a rule, tourists come by transfer or take a taxi.  By bus, getting from the airport is not very convenient.  I have to do a transplant in the city of Inzegan.  Hotel Les Almohades Beach Resort Agadir 4 * is located near the promenade with a promenade (at the very beginning), various seaside cafes and restaurants, banks where you can exchange money for local currency at a favorable rate, fast foods such as McDonald's or Kentucky Fri Chicken ".  Across the road to the left is a free zoo.  Next to it is a ticket office where you can buy a ticket for a tourist train and take a free tour of Agadir.  If you go through the zoo, then, having left on the other side, you will get to the square where the municipal market is located - ‚Äúbitches‚Äù. </p>
