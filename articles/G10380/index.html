They are attracted to luxury Oriental-style hotels and first-class service at affordable prices.  Of course, rest in the resorts of this country can not be called budget.  However, you can save if you choose a less popular resort. </p><p>  Often, travelers come to Dubai or Sharjah.  But next to them is the sparsely populated, but respectable city of Ajman, famous for its snow-white sandy beaches.  Holidays here are cheaper, and hotels are not inferior in quality.  For example, for tourists who love first-class service, we can recommend Ajman Saray, a Luxury Collection Resort 5 *.  In this article we will tell you all about him. </p><h2>  More about hotel location </h2><p>  Judging by the reviews of tourists, this complex has a favorable location.  Ajman Saray Resort 5 * was built in the central part of Ajman, right on the coast.  It is noteworthy that the local beach is considered one of the best in the UAE.  That is why it is so popular with tourists.  The proximity to the central part of the city does not affect the noise level.  The hotel is always quiet at night, because there are no large nightclubs and bars near it.  There are other first-class hotels on either side of the complex. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="25.421065" data-lng="55.44144000000006" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/5/5/1/11551.png"></div><p>  There are no many attractions in Ajman, as tourists come here for the sake of the beaches, and not for a rich excursion program.  But if desired, guests can always get out to large cities.  Dubai and Sharjah are about 25 km from Ajman, so the journey to them takes less than an hour. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The nearest international airport is in Sharjah.  The distance to it is about 23 km.  However, most of the flights from Russia arrive precisely in Dubai.  Its airport is 32 km from the hotel.  Tourists can get to their hotel from there by taxi.  Or you can always pay for the transfer when buying a ticket.  Then a comfortable bus will pick up guests from the airport. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  A Luxury Collection is a famous hotel chain engaged in the construction of luxury hotels around the world.  Its complexes have become popular due to the unique design, made in the style of the country in which they are built.
