  <section class="page js-page"><h1>So, the pin code. Great and ... terrible</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  It is unlikely that anyone needs to explain <span>what a pin code is.</span>  Just in case, you should clarify: this is a personal <span>identification number</span> that every holder of a plastic card receives.  Without it, you won‚Äôt be able to get money at the ATM or at the store (except in some cases when entering this number to confirm your purchasing intentions is not required). <br><br></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="pin" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/12207.jpg" width="600"></div>  According to banking rules, after reading this four-digit "password" you must immediately destroy it.  Together with the envelope.  Naturally, having previously memorized it.  But since human thoughts are usually preoccupied with something more important, the card is simply wrapped in this very envelope subject to annihilation until such time as it is required to use it.  And this is a gross violation of security.  One of many, by the way. <br><br>  The first prohibited action is already mentioned above: never wrap the resulting plastic in an envelope containing a pin code.  Perhaps, on the way home, fate will play a cruel joke with you, but it will smile at pickpockets.  It is better to immediately bring this short four-digit combination into a diary or cell phone.  Of course, without marking what kind of number it is.  Some citizens consider themselves minions of fate and write it on a paper strip, which is located on the back of the card.  Yes, yes, the one on which you want to put your signature.  Well ... here comments are superfluous. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="How to find out the PIN code of a bank card" class="if" height="317" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/12208.jpg" width="336"></div>  In no case do not announce the PIN code to third parties.  This dry clerical expression means your friends, acquaintances, relatives and even the neighbor with whom you smoke on the landing.  The fact is that any operation carried out using this "password" is considered to be one that the card holder conducted.  Here, by the way, it should also be mentioned that no one in the world has the right to require you to give a pin code: neither a bank, nor an online store where it is decided to pay with plastic for the purchase of a new carrier for a cat, or anyone else .  Be careful: any hint or veiled request to provide this information is a sure sign of an upcoming scam.  And only in your power to prevent it. <br><br><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="forgot a bank card pin" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/10893/12209.jpg" width="310"></div>  Guess three times, <span>how</span> can an attacker <span>know the pin code of a</span> bank card belonging to you?  Very simple: at the time of its introduction.  Either looking from behind when cash is being withdrawn at an ATM, or when a combination is entered when paying for purchased goods in a store.  Therefore, cover your manipulations with your free hand or purse.  This, by the way, is completely not funny. <br><br>  If a person has forgotten the PIN code of a <span>bank card,</span> he will not have anyone to find out from.  It should be understood that in nature it exists in a single copy.  Envelopes with magic numbers are printed in the bowels of financial institutions without any human presence.  Therefore, in the best case, you can delve into your "sclerosis" or cell phone - you at one time wrote down the received code there, right?  At worst, you have to go to the bank again to reissue a new one, and sleep completely calmly.
