    <h2>  Tourist centers </h2><p>  The village of Veseloe is located in the <span>Adler district of Sochi.</span>  South of this settlement is only Abkhazia.  Fun is located in close proximity to the border.  Adler's center is eight, and Sochi is thirty kilometers from the village.  It is believed that Fun is the most unusual place in the Adler district.  The main advantages of this part of the resort area are magnificent beaches, a huge selection of hotels and a completely even relief.  The seaside part of Vesyol is called "State Farm Russia".  Here, there previously existed an agricultural company for growing subtropical cultivated plants.  A little aside lies the Olympic Park.  These two regions are considered the main tourist centers in the Imereti Bay.  Over the past few years, a lot of facilities have been built here.  Among them are entertainment centers and hotel complexes.  The embankment was equipped.  Most of the territory was, of course, given for the construction of Olympic facilities.  In addition, the Formula 1 track now runs here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Relaxation </h2><p>  Tourists who would like to spend a vacation in the Imereti Bay are primarily concerned about the issue of accommodation.  To date, two segments can be noted.  The first should include large hotel complexes.  They were built specifically for the Olympics.  The second segment includes private mini-hotels.  I must say that the latter is quite enough for the formation of healthy competition.  The cost of accommodation is completely different.  In new large complexes, prices rarely drop below 3000-4000 rubles per room per day. </p>

    <h2>  Beaches </h2><p>  The coast of Imereti Bay is a wide pebble strip.  Note that pebbles are sometimes so small that it can be difficult to distinguish from sand.  It is for the sake of the beaches that many tourists go to this resort area.  The main advantage of the coast is few people.  In addition, there is no railway track over the beach (as, for example, in other areas). </p><h2>  "Velvet Seasons" (hotel, Sochi) </h2><p>  This complex is equipped with everything necessary not only for a comfortable stay, but also for a long stay, sports gatherings, corporate and other events.  Here, tourists are offered comfortable pebble beaches that are known far beyond Sochi.  The hotel-hotel "Velvet Seasons" has a five-kilometer promenade.  It is an ideal place for cycling, walking, jogging along the sea.  It is believed that here is the best coast in Sochi.  City hotel "Velvet Seasons" offers rooms of different categories.  On the territory of the complex are equipped children's and sports grounds, restaurants, bars and cafes are working.  Free high-speed internet is available.  This and much more will make your stay here comfortable and enjoyable. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The city-hotel "Velvet Seasons" (Adler) is located in Imereti Bay.  From here you can quickly get to the Formula 1 highway and the Olympic Park.  Adler Railway Station is 10 km away.  Hotel "Velvet Seasons" includes several parts. </p>

    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  "Velvet Seasons" are several residential areas: "Catherine", "Russian House", "Clean Ponds" and "Alexander Garden".  The design and layout of the buildings suggests an absolute lack of car traffic inside the courtyards, where there are places for recreation and playgrounds. </p><h2>  "Russian house" </h2><p>  This quarter is famous for its picturesque nature.  Not far from here is an ornithological park.  The Russian House occupies about 44 hectares.  18 buildings were built on this territory.  Each has its own name.  Names were given to them in honor of gems: "Pomegranate", "Sapphire", "Malachite", "Pearls", "Aquamarine", "Jade", etc. On the territory occupied by the complex, there are bistros, restaurants, beauty salons, lobby bars.  Various shops are open for guests.  There is also a sports bar where matches are broadcast.
