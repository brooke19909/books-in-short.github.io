In those days, they were the property of the boyar Rodion Nesterovich Kvashni.  The name of the village (Spasskoye) came from the monastery, which was located in those places until 1764. </p><h2>  History </h2><p>  The Transfiguration Monastery was donated to the <span>Trinity-Sergius Lavra by the</span> descendants of Vasily Ivanovich Kvashnin, who had the nickname Tush.  The first monastery church was Preobrazhenskaya.  At first, the building was built of wood, but then it was rebuilt in stone.  By the middle of the XVII century, the design completely deteriorated, and it was decided to disassemble it.  The second stone monastery church was erected in the 16th century, and it was dedicated to Andrei Stratilat. </p><p>  In the Time of Troubles, near the Spassky Monastery and the village of Tushino, the troops of False Dmitry II camped.  They plundered and devastated all nearby villages.  The monastery was also ruined.  It was closed in 1764, and the Transfiguration Church turned into a parish for residents of the villages of Tushino and Spasskoye.  A temporary wooden refectory was attached to it, but in 1804-1808 it was dismantled.  Instead, a new, more spacious stone building was erected.  After some time, a multi-tiered high bell tower was added to it.  In the middle of the 19th century the refectory underwent some change, after which an altar was built and a chapel was placed in honor of St. Sergius of Radonezh. </p>

    <h2>  The construction of a new temple </h2><p>  In the 19th century, the church could no longer accommodate everyone.  An increase in the size of the parish prompted the thought of its restructuring or expansion.  In addition, she was not in the best condition.  The fact is that over the course of three centuries, the river bank where the church stood began to creep more and more, and as a result, the building was on the very edge of the cliff.  For these reasons, in 1870 it was decided to build a new church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in Tushino. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The design of the church was developed by the architect Vladislav Osipovich Grudzinsky, who was then a member of the House of State Property.  A construction commission was created, headed by a local clergyman John of Spassky.  After the plan was approved in 1875 in the village of Spas-Tushino, the old-built church was gradually dismantled.  We started from the bell tower and the refectory.  The brick from the disassembled part of the old church went to the construction of the fence around the new construction. </p><h2>  Opening </h2><p>  The Transfiguration Church in Tushino began to be erected with a warm refectory.  By September 1880, it was already completely finished.  Two chapels were immediately consecrated here: one in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, and the second - Abbot Sergius of Radonezh.  A fairly significant amount in the form of donations to the new church was provided by the manufacturers K.E. Prokhorov and V.N. Suvirov, the official P.G. Tsurikov and the local priest John Spassky. </p><p>  Unfortunately, the last of the patrons died in 1881, and did not live to see the completion of construction.  The new abbot of the church Nikolai Buravtsev finished the good deed.  In 1882, the entire plot designated for construction was fenced with a metal fence with stone pillars, and a new cemetery was opened on the lands from the north and east of the church.  Finally, in 1886, on August 6, the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in Tushino was solemnly consecrated by the Metropolitan of Kolomensky and Moscow, Ionian. </p>

    <h2>  Description </h2><p>  I must say that the building was being built at a time when the national Russian traditions of church architecture began to revive.  The temple is distinguished by careful thoughtful proportions and has both refined and restrained decor.  It is a one-headed and fairly high four.  From above, it solemnly ends with large beautiful kokoshniks and a bulbous head, and the three-part aspida, which is strongly advanced forward, gives the temple a significant volume. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Above each of the semicircles is a case with icons.  From the refectory side stands a three-tier bell tower.  The brick walls of the temple are not plastered, so whitewashed and white-stone details of the decor stand out clearly against their background.  On the central altar of the church is a five-tier iconostasis. </p><p>  The Church of the Transfiguration of Our Savior in Tushino stood on the very edge of the watershed hill between the Skhodnaya and the Moscow River.  It was clearly visible for several miles along the Volokolamsk highway, as well as from the banks and nearby villages.  We can say that the church became a kind of architectural dominant of the area at that time. </p>

    <h2>  Post-revolutionary period </h2><p>  From 1881 to 1935, the temple on Volokolamka in Tushino was led by a whole dynasty of rectors of the Buravtsevs.  The last of their representatives, Priest Alexander, was executed by communists in late December 1937.  He was buried in the territory of the Butovo training ground in a common grave.  In the summer of 2000, by the decision of the Council of Bishops, he was canonized. </p><p>  As you know, the 30s of the last century were very destructive for religious buildings.  This misfortune did not go around the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in Tushino.  In 1935 it was closed.  His last rector was <span>Alexander Sokolov,</span> who was arrested and shot two years later somewhere in the Altai Territory.  The place of his burial is still unknown. </p>

    <h2>  Desecration </h2><p>  After the war, various Soviet organizations were housed in the temple building.  In the mid-50s, residents asked the local authorities to resume services.  But the answer to these requests was the destruction of the bell tower and the main dome in 1957 - they simply blew up. </p><p>  Eight years after the events described, the cemetery adjacent to the temple was also abolished.  This entire territory was included in the industrial zone, which stretched along the entire railway line.  The repair and construction department, to which the church lands were transferred, turned them into a real dump, and the temple building itself - into a warehouse of building materials. </p>

    <h2>  Rebirth </h2><p>  The Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in Tushino was returned to the Orthodox Church only in 1990.  The Church and the main throne were consecrated by the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Alexy II.  In subsequent years, chapels were also consecrated in honor of St. Sergius of Radonezh and St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.  The rector of the temple was appointed Fedor Sokolov.  Unfortunately, after 10 years he died tragically.  He was buried right at the altar of the temple reborn from the ashes. </p><p>  As soon as the church was opened, it began to be intensively restored.  First of all, work began on the restoration of its appearance: the head, kokoshniks were repaired, the upper tiers of the once blown up bell tower were built on.  A.I. Tsarev decorated the kokoshniks <span>tympans with mosaic paintings</span> depicting 12 apostles, and icon cases with the composition ‚ÄúDeesis‚Äù. </p>

    <h2>  Completion of restoration </h2><p>  In addition, chapters were erected over each chapel of the altar, which added expressiveness to the silhouette of the temple.  According to the few surviving fragments of the openwork fence, it was possible to completely recreate the form that it originally had.  The main Holy Gates have also been restored. </p><p>  It should be noted that during the construction work, ancient burials were discovered.  Now all the remains of people are buried near the fence, on the south side of the structure. </p><p>  The Church of the Transfiguration of Our Lord is not the only church located in this area.  There are other shrines here.  For example, the ancient Church of the Intercession in Tushino.  Its construction dates back to 1672.  It has also been restored and services are constantly held there. </p>
