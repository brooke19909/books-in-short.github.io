This has its positive and negative properties.  All this will be considered in this article, as well as alternative options in relation to free planning. </p><h2>  Historical aspect </h2><p>  The free <span>layout of apartments</span> gained popularity in Russia in the nineties of the last century.  At that time, a caste of people appeared who wanted to be different from everyone, and they had extra money.  These people began to buy neighboring apartments, unite them, make multi-level dwellings, and also remodel their own apartments to their liking. </p>

    <p>  The economy is developing in such a way that if there is demand, then there will be supply.  Developers adapted to the wishes of customers and began to create a design of apartments with a free layout.  The bulk of apartments today for people with free money are presented with a free layout. </p><p>  But before making the final choice, you need to decide on the pros and cons of such a decision. </p><h2>  The concept of free planning </h2><p>  The free <span>layout of the apartment</span> is a single living area with laid communications during the construction period.  These communications determine where the plumbing rooms and the kitchen will be. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  The other part of the apartment has no walls, and the owner can equip it as he pleases. </p>

    <h2>  In which houses provide free layout of apartments </h2><p>  Monolithic houses are mainly suitable for this type of planning, since external walls are load-bearing in them, therefore internal partitions may be absent.  In brick houses, the internal walls are load-bearing, so there can only be a partial free layout. </p><h2>  Positive properties </h2><p>  When buying an apartment with no walls, the question does not arise how to plan a free-style apartment. </p><p>  In this situation, everyone can decide which room to make more and which less, equip the living room with a separate room or combine it with a kitchen or dining room, make the bathroom separate or shared, and other issues. </p><p>  Thus, acquiring a free-plan apartment, the owner himself decides how many rooms he will have, what will be the living area with the same total square. </p>

    <p>  Freedom in arranging an apartment is the main advantage of this type of layout.  It is this circumstance that determines the comfort of living as an individual and the family as a whole. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In addition, the layout of the apartment on its own adds positive emotions and with close looks at it rallying the family. </p><p>  Such an apartment will be one of a kind, because it is difficult to imagine that someone in this house will create exactly the same apartment design. </p><h2>  Fly in the ointment </h2><p>  Typically, apartments with this layout are several percent more expensive than standard ones.  Developers quickly realized that without investing in the construction of internal walls, you can present the free layout of apartments as the main advantage, that is, use it as a competent marketing move. </p><p>  If in the recent past all apartments were sold only with rough finishing, today some developers already offer apartments with finishing.  This does not apply to the types of apartments under consideration. </p><p>  The main communications will be created by the developer, a door (usually made of good metal), double-glazed windows will be installed, the main part of the costs will be borne by the owner.  Sometimes it happens that even the electrical wiring must be pulled into the apartment from the corridor. </p>

    <p>  In some cases, the family cannot reach a consensus on the layout of the apartment, in this case, the owners turn to specialists to draw up the design of the apartment, and this costs extra money. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  In addition, until today no one has canceled such an organization as BTI.  Despite the fact that the layout is free, the apartment plan still needs to be approved by this organization. </p><p>  In this case, it is necessary to take into account a number of limits that turn free planning into conditionally free.  The main limitations are: </p><ul><li>  Do not move the bathroom and kitchen; </li><li>  it is impossible to attach a balcony / loggia to the living area; </li><li>  heating must not be connected to these non-residential premises (it cannot be connected anywhere in the apartments, despite the fact that many do it); </li><li>  separate ventilation ducts cannot be combined or moved; </li><li>  the living area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment cannot be changed by adding the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe utility rooms to it; </li><li>  room area must be at least 9 square meters.  m; </li><li>  gas pipes cannot be hidden in the walls; </li><li>  All living rooms must have natural light.  In the absence of such a room can only be non-residential. </li></ul><p>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch an apartment when buying is indicated full.  When marking, part of the squares is lost.  Unwillingness to pay those square meters that really will not be possible can be achieved only through a repeated examination of BTI, recalculate and write a claim for compensation. </p><h2>  Repair of the considered types of apartments </h2>

    <p>  In the Russian legal space, the concept of "free layout of apartments" does not exist.  In this regard, it must be understood that the real absence of walls does not mean that they are not in the projects of the developer.  Therefore, the construction of partitions by the owner requires mandatory approval.  If in the future the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãredevelopment appears, then coordination will again be required. </p><p>  Repair of apartments of free planning involves the implementation of vivid design decisions, in which the living area is undergoing significant changes. </p><p>  At the beginning of the repair you need to decide on the style.  It is not necessary to make capital partitions, they can be low, where you can place flower pots or make a bar counter.  In addition, instead of partitions, you can use the installation of cabinets in the places of the alleged walls. </p><p>  You can use mobile or folding partitions. </p><p>  Separate zones can be distinguished using various styles without using partitions. </p><p>  A photo of an open-plan apartment is given above. </p><h2>  We are designing an apartment </h2>

    <p>  In order for a person to feel comfortable in the home, all ergonomic requirements must be observed.  This can only be done with a professional designer. </p><p>  With its help, free-plan apartments are drafted.  The designer must take into account all the parameters and tastes of all family members, as a result of which the entire area should be effectively used. </p><p>  It is necessary to provide for the placement of each room.  You need to start with the entrance and hallway.  Next, you should consider how much time each member of the family will be in each room so as not to interfere with each other. </p><p>  Designing your rooms depends on how much you like the noisy environment.  So, if you like to relax in the bedroom, it should be placed away from the living room. </p>

    <p>  Currently, one of the projects of free-planning apartments is studio apartments.  However, hoods and silent appliances are needed here, since sounds and aromas in such apartments are spreading at high speed. </p><h2>  Redevelopment Documents </h2><p>  The owner of an apartment with a free layout must have the following documents: a project for future work, a registration certificate for an apartment, a conclusion on the structural condition of the apartment.  If transfers of heating pipes, gas pipes, hoods are planned, installation of insulation, changes in non-residential premises of load-bearing structures are planned, then additional design documents are needed. </p><h2>  Finally </h2><p>  Thus, everyone should decide for himself to buy a free-plan apartment or a standard apartment.  There are, of course, undeniable advantages even in a partially free layout.  However, it is necessary to be prepared for the fact that you will have to significantly overpay for the apartment itself, the project and the repair of such a room. </p>
