If we turn to historical data, we can see that on this place land trade routes and caravan trails intersected.  At this intersection, a craft village was formed.  From this village and grew Riyadh.  In 1233, the city was destroyed by the Egyptians.  But already in 1240 it was rebuilt and surrounded by a fortress in which the mosque and the palace of the ruler were located. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Capital of saudi arabia" class="if" height="338" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/11391/72942.jpg" width="599"></div>

    <p>  In the second half of the XVI century, after the capture of bin Abdulrehman Al Faisal by Abulaziz, the city becomes the capital of the state, which the Arabs are trying to create, taking advantage of the weak political influence of Turkey. </p><p>  In 1744, the first Sudanese state was created, which after 73 years was destroyed by the Ottoman Empire.  In 1824, a second Saudi state was created by the Saudi dynasty with its capital in Riyadh.  65 years later, the country was conquered by the Rashid dynasty.  In 1902, the Saudi Dynasty began to attempt to regain power in Arabia with the help of Turkey and Great Britain.  In 1920, the Rashid dynasty was overthrown. </p><p>  Since the XIX century, there has been an active political movement for the unification of the tribes inhabiting the country, and for the liberation from power of Turkey, and the capital of Saudi Arabia becomes its center.  The purpose of this movement was to create a single state with centralized power.  As a result of this, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was created in 1932, the capital of which remained in the city of Riyadh. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

Twentieth century.  The main building was the palace of the emir.  On the narrow winding streets were <span>adobe houses</span> with courtyards.  At this time, huge <span>oil fields were</span> discovered in Saudi Arabia <span>.</span>  The country is turning into one of the richest.  Adobe houses are being demolished in the capital.  The city is practically rebuilt.  Skyscrapers are being built.  On the wide streets are schools, hotels, shopping centers, mosques, private villas.  All ministries and major state institutions are being transferred to the capital.

    <p>  But the capital of Saudi Arabia has preserved the historical sights of antiquity - the Royal Palace of Murabba and the Palace of the Emirs.  One of the modern attractions of Riyadh is the royal stables, and the races of purebred <span>Arabian horses</span> attract not only the residents of the city, but also its guests.  The most ancient and retaining its original appearance is Fort Masmak, built in 1865. </p>
