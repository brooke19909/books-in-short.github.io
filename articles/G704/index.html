Consider the main ones: </p><ul><li>  sound is transmitted only up to five meters; </li><li>  ear pads wear out too quickly; </li><li>  playback quality deteriorates if walls or partitions appear between the device and the sensor. </li></ul><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Reviews about the device are somewhat controversial.  Those who purchased headphones just to listen to music without inconvenience to their family are happy with the purchase.  Those who expected too good sound and quality, respectively, no.  There is little official information about the device, so you have to rely on the information that customers provide. </p><p>  What comes with the Philips SHC1300?  Instructions, batteries, adapter, adapter (6.5 mm) and transmitter.  The manual describes everything quite informatively.  Many of those who purchased these headphones confirm that you must always be parallel to the transmitter, otherwise there will be interference during playback. </p><p>  The modulator looks modest.  He has special bulbs that light up when turned on, as well as four legs that help him to stay steady. </p><p>  Buyers note that the sound, in principle, is clear and good.  You can adjust its quality and volume directly on the headphones themselves.  It's comfortable.  The device is lightweight, does not press on the ears.

    <p>  Wireless devices have one feature.  When the battery runs down, they suddenly begin to hiss and wheeze.  However, the described model does not have this problem. </p><p>  Ear pads, according to many, are terrible in quality.  However, if you use the headphones carefully, you can significantly delay the moment when they become unusable.  Some ear cushions tear after six months, while others - after a couple of years of use. </p><p>  If desired, you can purchase a battery charger.  Thanks to him, you won‚Äôt have to buy a huge amount of batteries, which will significantly save the family budget.  But you have to charge about once a week.  The frequency depends on the quality of the batteries themselves, as well as the frequency of use of the device. </p><h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  According to the manufacturer, the headphones are quite high quality and work well throughout the warranty period.  Sound distortion is likely, but not a single device of this type is safe from this problem.  Before buying, you need to precisely weigh the pros and cons, given that you can only use Philips SHC1300 headphones at home.  As a professional, they will be useless. </p><p>  It‚Äôs best to purchase the device in official stores, and not from suppliers.  Otherwise, there is a risk of buying a fake that will break literally in three months. </p>
