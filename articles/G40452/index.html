Each parent begins to think about the upcoming vacation.  Fresh air, sea, hiking, sports - these are the main advantages of a good rest for the child, and most importantly - diversity.  When deciding where the child will spend the summer months, you can opt for a camp and choose a more suitable option. </p><p>  Some parents, of course, are very distrustful of the various children's camps, explaining this by insufficient control over the children, poor nutrition and poor organization of free time in the camps.  But there are parents who recall with emotion their vacations spent in the camp, hiking, meeting new people, campfire evenings and guitar songs. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Cape of Doom Camp" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31431/2056352.jpg"></div>

Then after 22 km there will be a sign ‚ÄúCape of Roca Camp‚Äù, where the Ozerny base is located, you should turn right and drive about 2 km. </p><h2>  Teaching staff </h2><p>  Leaders Mikhail Shelkov and Alexander Zakharov have a huge <span>pedagogical experience.</span>  Mikhail founded a camp in 2006, which after some time became one of the best camps in Russia. </p><p>  Game technicians Nikolay Bezruchenko and Alexey Zimnukhov create incredible and breathtaking story assignments and actively participate in the life of the camp. </p><p>  Irina Kazakova - master of the guild of artisans.

    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Arriving at the Cape of Doom camp once, I want to return there again.  All the children who visited it write about this.  An incredible atmosphere, new friends, communication, live music create a storm of positive emotions.  Children's camp ‚ÄúCape of Rock‚Äù gives a good mood and energizes for many months. </p><p>  Children write that on the first day of arrival they forget about the bustle and are completely immersed in a completely different world.  Wonderful teachers, unforgettable quests, competitions and, of course, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfavorite music leave an indelible impression. </p><p>  A very important advantage, as noted in the reviews about the Cape of Dora camp, is the change of subject.  Arriving for the second or third time, it will not be boring and monotonous for sure.  Programs change regularly and are no longer repeated.  Therefore, I really want to return there again and again. </p><p>  After two weeks of training and rehearsals, the children prepare a real concert for their loved ones.  On the last day of stay, parents are invited to visit, to see and evaluate all the work done by their child.  Live music, special lighting, spectators and the stage are a real unforgettable sight, as parents write about it. </p><h2>  Parent Tips </h2><p>  Children really like hiking, so you should put more extra clothes with them, depending on the time of year.  They are very interested in spending time outside the territory of a large and cheerful company, making a fire and, sitting around him, singing songs with a guitar.  Around creates an amazing atmosphere. </p><p>  You can buy a ticket via the Internet or come to the office.  It includes a transfer (from Moscow to the camp and back), four meals a day and accommodation.  There is a gift shop on the territory, so if a child has a desire to bring gifts to his loved ones, you will have to pay for them yourself. </p><p>  And, of course, parents should be advised so that they do not forget to put their children the medicines they need.  Although you can go to the medical center around the clock, but if the child needs a special individual medicine, you must either notify the medical staff in advance, or remember to put them with you.  Then the rest will be excellent and no problem! </p>
