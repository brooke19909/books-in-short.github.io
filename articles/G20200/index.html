At the same time, the settlement is urbanized.  Multi-storey residential districts alternate with the private sector and, in fact, represent a single development stretching to Old Moscow. </p><h2>  Historical reference </h2><p>  At the beginning of the 18th century, the Marushka settlement was known as the center of the bristle-brush industry.  Here they made army, horse, head, boot, clothes brushes.  At the beginning of the XIX century, gold lace industry arose. </p><p>  By 1852, the population of the village of Marushkino reached 140 people, and the nearby estate of Sobakino - 57 people.  The main occupations remained lace weaving, brush production and agriculture.  To facilitate crafts in 1899, a training brush workshop was established.  In 1914, the Moscow Regional Agricultural Station was established on local lands to study the local climate, soil, weed vegetation, livestock farming features, and agricultural farming technologies.  After the revolution, MOSHOS continued its work.  In the 1930s, the institution was reorganized into the zootechnical experimental station MOZOS. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The Marushkinsky settlement is the successor of the Marushkinsky Village Council, formed in 1919.
