    <h2>  Negative hotel reviews and shortcomings </h2><p>  But not only Planeta 5 * (Sunny Beach) is famous for its merits.  Reviews are found and not very flattering.  However, this is not surprising, because there are no hotels without flaws.  Most travelers vacationing in the complex note the following disadvantages: </p><ul><li>  The main restaurant is constantly crowded.  There are not enough places, and people are forced to stand and wait until they are free.  The administration does not seek to solve the problem. </li><li>  The rooms are cleaned rarely and poorly.  Often they just take out the trash.  Underwear is changed at best once a week, although it is promised once every 2 days.  Towels can also hang in the bathroom for several days.  Often a change of linen occurs only after paying a tip. </li><li>  Very noisy environment, which is not suitable for families with children. </li><li>  Poor nutrition.  The food is monotonous and quickly bored.  Drinks are served in plastic glasses, which does not correspond to the status of a five-star hotel. </li><li>  The Internet is available only in the lobby and it works even there very poorly. </li><li>  Lifts are not enough, so people living on the upper floors have to wait a long time to get into the room. </li></ul><h2>  How much does a hotel stay cost? </h2><p>  Despite the fact that the "Planet" is considered a five-star hotel, living here is not too expensive.  The cheapest room will cost you 3,500 rubles per night.  The most expensive apartments will cost almost 3 times more expensive - about 9500 per night.  Thus, a week-long vacation will cost 30-100 thousand per room in the resort Sunny Beach <span>(Sunny Beach).</span>  <span>Planeta 5 *</span> does not have single rooms, so it is better to go there together or in a large company.  Then the ticket will cost less and will be approximately 15-50 thousand per person. </p><p>  Does the Planeta hotel justify the 5 stars stated in the name?  Appearance and interior decoration meet high requirements, but the organization of rest does not stand up to criticism.  The rooms are poorly cleaned, the restaurant has no seats, the territory is too noisy and crowded.  Tourists are not advised to visit this hotel with children, however, for youth, these disadvantages will not be so significant.  In addition, the affordable price makes the hotel an attractive option for relaxation, even if you take into account all the shortcomings of the complex. </p>
