This aircraft belongs to the A320 family, which also includes A318, A320, A321.  The Airbus A319 aircraft differs from its “brothers” in the cabin layout.  By reducing the length by 4 meters, the number of rows was reduced by 2. Nevertheless, with a sufficiently wide fuselage, among the other narrow-body aircraft, the Airbus A319 is adapted to install wide seats for passengers or to increase the width of the aisle between the rows. </p>

    <p>  Initially, in 1990, Airbus SAS conducted research on the manufacture of an airliner based on an Airbus A320 aircraft with a shortened fuselage.  The construction program was signed by early 1992 amid two competitors - the Boeing 737-300, as well as the Boeing 737-500.  The first flight of the A319 was made in 1995; in April 1996, Swiss Airlines received the first purchased model. </p><p>  Production of the A319 does not end to this day, as the demand for this model does not fall.  The most important reason for success is the wide choice of seats in the A319 cabin.  The standard scheme of the A319 is 3 on 3 in two rows on the sides.  The capacity of the cabin varies from 120 to 156 seats. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Consider the various options for the schemes of the Airbus A319 cabin, which are used in the fleets of popular Russian airlines. </p><h2>  Varieties of Airbus A319 </h2><p>  In addition to the possibility of expanding the number of seats in the cabin, other varieties of Airbus A319 are also offered to customers: </p><ul><li>  A319CJ - corporate aircraft with increased flight distance; </li><li>  A319LR - passenger modification of the aircraft with additional fuel compartments, which allows you to increase the flight distance to 8300 kilometers; </li><li>  A319ACJ is a corporate aircraft that can carry 39 people on board over a distance of more than 10 thousand kilometers. </li></ul><h2>  Airbus A319 Airlines Russia </h2><p>  “Russia” is the Russian national airline, whose head office is located in the city of St. Petersburg.  The company operates charter flights from a transfer hub at Pulkovo Airport to more than one hundred destinations, which include flights both within the country and abroad, namely to countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.  In total, Rossiya Airlines has 27 Airbus A319 aircraft, which are named after the cities of the Russian Federation. </p>

    <p>  The company has two types of A319 cabin layout, where there is a separation between business and economy class. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  In both versions, the first two rows are a business class with wide seats in both variations. </p><p>  Then in the first layout there is a partition.  She gives the third row enough legroom.  In the second scheme of the cabin of the A319 “Russia” there is no such partition.  In the first layout, the 9th is considered the best, and in the second - the 10th, as they are located after the emergency exit, which allows you to comfortably sit throughout the flight.  The worst are the rows in front of the emergency entrance, as the seatbacks either do not recline, or are limited in movement. </p><h2>  The scheme of the cabin A319 S7 </h2><p>  S7, formerly known as Siberian Airlines, is one of the largest airlines in the air transportation market.  The port of the airline's fleet is Novosibirsk Tolmachevo Airport.  The main office itself is located directly in Novosibirsk.  The route network covers more than 40 destinations in Russia and the same number abroad.  The presence of the company in the OneWorld alliance, a flexible fare system, comfortable aircraft results in more than 11 million passengers a year. </p>

    <p>  The carrier is engaged in a wide network of domestic Russian transportation over fairly short distances, about 4000 km.  In this regard, the S7 fleet is 19 Airbus A319 aircraft.  The layout of the A319 cabin at this company differs from the modifications discussed above - it does not have a business class, and the total number of seats in the cabin is 144. </p><p>  The advantage here is the following ranks - 1st and 11th.  On the front row, the passenger will receive food as quickly as possible, get off and board the plane, where there is a wide legroom for him. </p><p>  A similar situation is with the 11th row.  This row can be deservedly called places of increased comfort.  Near the 10th row there is an emergency exit, which makes it minimally comfortable, but it gives the next row an advantage in the amount of legroom.  The passenger can calmly get out of his seat, without interfering with others. </p><p>  The 24th row is considered the worst throughout the aircraft, since its backs rest against the walls of the toilets, and therefore the seats cannot decompose.  In addition, proximity in itself can cause significant discomfort during a flight. </p><h2>  The scheme of the cabin of the plane A319 airline Ural Airlines </h2><p>  Ural Airlines is an airline that is among the top 10 largest airlines in the Russian Federation.  The central office is located in Yekaterinburg, the airport is also located there, where the air fleet of the company, Koltsovo, is assigned.  The air carrier carries out charter as well as regular flights to domestic and international destinations. </p>

    <p>  In the air fleet of the company are 7 aircraft modification A319.  The layout of the A319 cabin for Ural Airlines is similar to the Rossiya airline - it has 2 rows of business class seats at the beginning of the aircraft with a partition in front of the 3rd row.  The rest of the space is occupied by 21 rows of economy class, which is located according to the 3 + 3 scheme.  The total number of seats according to the scheme of the A319 aircraft of this airline is 136. </p><h2>  Summary </h2><p>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that it is not worth talking about the independence of the A319 model in the A320 family.  Nevertheless, the A319 has interior schemes that vary depending on the modification.  The freedom of choice of changes in modifications allows us to talk about the fact that the Airbus A319 is the base designer for modifications.  This factor plays a significant role in shaping the popularity of the A319 both among Russian airlines and among foreign ones, and also allows you to compete with Boeing in this class. </p>
