Corrugated paper tulips: master class</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Thanks to the corrugated material, the variety of colors and the skill of florists, <span>paper flowers</span> can be confused with real ones from afar.  They are used to decorate rooms for the holiday, bridal bouquets, theater performances, candy souvenirs.  We will consider several ways in the article how to make a tulip out of corrugated paper with your own hands.  Since this flower, despite its simplicity, inherently has a rich palette and variety of shapes. </p><h2>  Flat tulips for greeting cards </h2><p>  It is difficult for five-year-old preschoolers to create candy bouquets right away.  This should be approached gradually.  Start by making tulips for postcards.  First, let the children translate two petal patterns, stems, and leaves onto paper.  Then on a card stick a stalk with leaves and buds. </p><p>  If you look at the tulip patterns, you will see every bend.  A marker or paints also need to draw a longitudinal line delimiting the two petals.  Then, laying a large template on top of a small one, you get a blooming flower.  If you attach a small petal on top, create the buds.  For volume, this petal can be mounted on a small piece of double-sided thick tape. </p><p>  For a postcard, you can make another tulip from corrugated paper yourself.  To do this, translate the template, consisting of one wide and two small petals along the edges, onto the paper.  Overlay the small parts on top of each other and attach to the card.  Stamens can be inserted in the middle. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tulip from corrugated paper" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635598.jpg" width="304"></div>

First you need to translate tulip patterns onto thick paper.  Thanks to the triangular slot, the child sees the bend.  Do three parts and bend in the middle. </p><p>  Then tighten the wire with corrugated green paper, glue the sheet.  On one petal in the middle, glue the wire and on each side also fasten the bent petals.  The result was a simple voluminous tulip with three sides.  You insert such bright flowers in pots to indoor plants, using as a decorative element.  Next, go on to sophisticated flower making. </p><p>  <span>How to make a tulip out of paper?</span>  The master class below will help you understand this issue. </p><ul><li>  On thick paper, translate two patterns with six and four petals. </li><li>  In a small template with a pencil, wrap four petals.  To do this, attach a pencil to the edge of the petal, and begin to gently wind the paper onto it several times. </li><li>  Then form a template into a bud by applying petals. </li><li>  Also come with a six-petal pattern. </li><li>  Glue the bud inside (if the bottom is pointed, it is cut a little). </li><li>  Fingers form, insert the stem with leaves. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper tulips master class with step by step description" class="if" height="281" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635593.jpg" width="225"></div></li></ul><h2>  How to make a bouquet of tulips from sweets with your own hands? </h2><p>  Now with children, you can move on to creating simple candy bouquets.

Wrap it in a small piece of red to create a bud.  Next, wrap a wide strip several times around the skewers and sweets with the same paper.  These will be the petals.  Do not cut off excess paper. </p><p>  In the sepal area, scroll the paper several times, fixing the shape of the flower.  Take the green strip, attach a piece of scotch tape to the base and carefully wrap the entire stem, remembering to attach the leaves.  If necessary, paper can be glued. </p><p>  Next, glue the corrugated paper over the plastic cup for beauty.  Turn it upside down, where you make a few holes.  Insert tulips in them.  Cover the back of the cup with cardboard.  Now, based on the size of the tulips, cut off the top of the petals so that the paper is a few centimeters above the bud. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="] how to make a tulip out of paper master class" class="if" height="310" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635626.jpg" width="321"></div>

    <h2>  Yellow tulips from corrugated paper: a master class with step-by-step description </h2><p>  You can make souvenir gifts from candy bouquets.  For this, each flower is formed from separate petals.  For the bouquet you will need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ul><li>  yellow and green corrugated paper; </li><li>  round sweets; </li><li>  wire; </li><li>  decorative tape; </li><li>  thermal gun or tape. </li></ul><p>  Cut rectangular strips for petals and leaves.  Scissors from one end make round petals, cut corners from the other end.  Now give your hands a convex shape.  To do this, twist the bottom of the petal, stretch the middle neatly to the sides, and round up. </p><p>  For one tulip, form six petals.  Put three petals on top of each other, put a candy, the edges of which were glued with tape.  Put the wire and fasten the flower (the candy is not attached so that it can be easily removed from the bud without damaging the tulip).  Next, check the next three petals in a checkerboard pattern.  Get candy flowers.  Tulips from corrugated paper will be more natural if you pick up a candy with a bright wrapper to match the petals. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="corrugated paper tulips master class" class="if" height="341" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635606.jpg" width="338"></div>

    <h2>  Candy bouquet decoration </h2><p>  Now proceed to the formation of the stem and leaves.  Rectangular strips cut into pointed leaves at both ends.  Now with your hands stretch them in breadth.  Take a pencil or scissors and round the curve of the leaves. </p><p>  Next, form a sepal with a green strip, fastening the edge with glue.  Wrap a tight strip around the wire, gluing with a thermo-gun if necessary.  Next, attach two sheets opposite to each other and stick to the stem. </p><p>  According to this plan, you make <span>paper flowers</span> from other sweets <span>.</span>  You can make a tulip without scissors <span>with your own hands</span> from corrugated paper.  That is, bend a long strip in half, twist and lay on top of each other.  It turns out a double petal. </p><p>  The more flowers you make for a bouquet of different textures, the more interesting it will look.  Collect all the tulips in a bouquet, wrap them with wrapping paper and tie them with a bow.  Please note that sweets are not attached to the flower so that they can be easily reached without deforming the tulips.  If the sweet core is glued with tape, then the flowers will no longer be able to perform a decorative function. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="candy flowers corrugated paper tulips" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635583.jpg" width="500"></div>

    <h2>  Panel of tulips </h2><p>  <span>Unusual paintings are</span> now in fashion <span>,</span> where the image is voluminous and as close as possible to natural objects.  Consider how to make a panel for the eighth of March.  The following material will be required: </p><ul><li>  corrugated paper in two shades of yellow, red, green (two to three shades); </li><li>  thick cardboard or tile for the ceiling; </li><li>  paints; </li><li>  glue. </li></ul><p>  Before making the panel, first make all the blanks: leaves, mimosa, vase, tulips from corrugated paper.  The workshop for making a tulip petal is as follows: </p><ul><li>  cut the same squares of red and <span>yellow</span> ; </li><li>  put a yellow leaflet on the red square; </li><li>  lay the sheets diagonally, that is, so that the corners of the square are turned towards yourself; </li><li>  from the top corner, you begin to spin the paper to the middle (a triangle has turned out); </li><li>  then bend the corner from each edge so that the edges join in the lower corner of the square sheet; </li><li>  twist all the ends (a petal with a yellow middle and a red rim turned out); </li><li>  turn the petal yellow center out. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself paper flowers from corrugated paper" class="if" height="340" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635584.jpg" width="482"></div></li></ul><h2>  Making flowers for panels </h2><p>  Now, from the petals, collect a tulip from corrugated paper with your own hands.  To do this, cut the wire, wrap stamens on one edge.  They can be done in the following ways: </p><ol><li>  Wrap the wire with cotton and paint in yellow. </li><li>  String on thin wire segments of a bead and wind it to the base. </li><li>  From corrugated paper, cut a rectangle, cut into centimeter strips.  Then, with their fingers, along the entire length, you will fuse, and at the end you form a type of lump.  Paint these lumps-stamens in black.  Next, twist the stamen rectangle around the wire. </li></ol><p>  On a wire with a core, “fasten” or glue the lap petals.  Next, green paper tightly wrap the stem, while gluing the leaves.  They can be cut out of thick paper and bent with scissors. </p><p>  Now make mimosa from yellow paper.  Just cut a long strip into thin lines.  And tightly twist it, glue the edge, spread the petals to the sides.  Cut the leaves for them, creating a fringe. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself tulip from corrugated paper" class="if" height="444" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/635585.jpg" width="446"></div>

    <h2>  Mural decoration </h2><p>  Now on the cardboard mark the borders of the vase.  It can be cut out of cardboard or made voluminous.  Cut the plastic bottle in half, wrap with thread or paper.  Glue to the cardboard.  The result is a volumetric vase, which is decorated with decorative elements. </p><p>  Color the background, if necessary, and collect the bouquet.  As soon as you like the composition, immediately begin to stick one element to the cardboard.  All the stems are hidden in a vase.  It turned out an unusual gorgeous panel!  By the way, according to the above workshop, you can make a tulip out of corrugated paper with your own hands, not for paintings, but for a candy bouquet or topiary. </p>
