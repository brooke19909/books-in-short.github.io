    <h2>  About location </h2><p>  As already mentioned, Belair Beach Hotel is very well located.  Only 2-4 kilometers separates the hotel from local attractions.  These include Rodini Park, the Acropolis of Rhodes, the Temple of Apollo, Aegean University, Diagoras Stadium, Clock Tower, as well as the Palace of the Grand Masters, Knights Street, the Archaeological Museum, Mandraki Port and much more. </p><p>  Transport links here are also well developed.

Interestingly, the sandy and pebble coast itself stretches for 5 kilometers. </p><h2>  Service </h2><p>  The Belair Beach Hotel has everything that vacationers may need.  Here is a short list of the most important: </p><ul><li>  Free high-speed Wi-Fi throughout the complex. </li><li>  Private parking (also nearby is public). </li><li>  24/7 front desk.  Accelerated registration is possible. </li><li>  ATM and currency exchange. </li><li>  Luggage storage. </li><li>  Ability to call an individual baby sitter. </li><li>  Laundry and ironing. </li><li>  Several shops. </li><li>  Car rental. </li><li>  Room service. </li></ul><p>  The staff, by the way, speaks Greek and English. </p>

    <h2>  Entertainment </h2><p>  There are many ways to diversify your leisure time at Belair Beach Hotel.  Here is what to do here: </p><ul><li>  Sun terrace and pools (including children). </li><li>  Bicycles for rent. </li><li>  Basketball playground. </li><li>  Mini golf. </li><li>  Outdoor tennis court. </li><li>  Playground. </li><li>  Massage parlor. </li><li>  Billiard room. </li><li>  Playroom. </li><li>  Karaoke. </li><li>  Water sports on the beach: windsurfing, diving, canoeing. </li></ul><p>  I would like to say a little more about the latter.  Ixia is a paradise for surfers.  For them, all conditions are created here, first of all, by nature itself.  It is easy to catch a wave here, since the sea is constantly raging, and the winds do not stop blowing at all. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It is in Ixia that there are three large windsurfing centers - Windserfers World, Surfer's Paradise and Pro Center.  Interestingly, there are Russian-speaking instructors.  Those wishing to come here to study this sport should take this fact into account.  And it is better in this case to go in April, May, September or October.  A good time for beginners - a comparative "calm" reigns at sea, convenient for acquiring the basic skills for conquering waves. </p>

    <h2>  Conditions for children </h2><p>  They are also worth noting attention, studying the description of Belair Beach Hotel.  People with children come here often in the summer, despite the fact that the sea is not quite calm here.  But then the prices are low, and there are all conditions.  And here are which ones: </p><ul><li>  Baby cots. </li><li>  High chairs in the restaurant. </li><li>  Children's playground in the open air. </li><li>  Table tennis. </li><li>  Separate swimming pool, located next to an adult, so that parents are comfortable watching their child.  It is filled with fresh water, and its maximum depth is 50 cm. Area - 31 square meters.  m </li><li>  Children's tennis court with equipment. </li><li>  Game room (mini-billiards, aero-hockey and other entertainment). </li></ul><p>  So even children will not be bored here.  And if adults want to calmly relax and feel full relaxation, then you can invite a nanny to the room, who will take care of the child during their vacation. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <h2>  Nutrition </h2><p>  Belair Beach Hotel, like any decent hotel complex, has its own restaurant.  It is divided into two rooms.  Breakfast and dinner are held in one, and lunch in the second, which is located near the pool.  There is also an "evening bar" in the open.  If possible, it is better to take "all inclusive", since in this case drinks, cocktails and alcohol will be free and in unlimited quantities. </p><p>  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served buffet style.  In the morning cottage cheese (both ‚Äúempty‚Äù and with fruit), scrambled eggs and omelettes, bacon and sausages, various sausages and cheese slices, feta, muffins, buns, rolls, cereals and granola, toasts with jams are served.  And, of course, fruit!  For lunch and dinner, the choice is also wide - a large assortment of meat dishes, salads, fish, side dishes, desserts and ice cream.  They often even organize theme nights - with Greek, Italian and sea cuisine. </p><p>  The service, by the way, is also on the level - at breakfasts and dinners guests are met and escorted to the table.  The waiters are polite and smiling, quickly remove dirty dishes from the tables and replenish the "supplies" at the buffet. </p>

    <h2>  Helpful information </h2><p>  When preparing to fly to Greece at the Belair Beach Hotel, it is important to consider several nuances.  So, check-in starts at 14:00, as in many other hotels.  Check out lasts until noon.  This information is useful to consider when choosing a flight. </p><p>  With children, accommodation is allowed here.  Moreover, for children under two years of age it is free.  Cots will even be provided for them. </p><p>  Now about remote booking.  When implementing it, you will need to provide personal credit card details.  The hotel accepts American Express, Visa and Maestro.  The used card is presented upon check-in along with the passport. </p><p>  By the way, according to the law, cash payments cannot exceed 500 euros.  To find out how to pay for your stay if the final bill is a larger amount, you need to contact the administration. </p><h2>  Impressions of guests </h2><p>  Guests staying at Belair Beach Hotel are happy to talk about what they liked about it.  And here's what they focus on: </p><ul><li>  Settlement does not have to wait long.  Yes, registration of new guests begins at 14:00, but if guests arrived earlier, and there is a free room, they are taken there. </li><li>  View from the window.  He's just awesome!  Even from the windows of rooms with the so-called "side" view, you can fully see the beach and the sea. </li><li>  Apartments.  All rooms are large, nice, not tasteless decorated.  Inside, there is everything you need - from a powerful air conditioner to smart Internet. </li><li>  Staff.  Since there are many vacationers from Russia, the administrators are quite well explained in Russian.  All employees are friendly and helpful, which is good news. </li><li>  Food.  It is tasty and varied - this has already been said before.  But it is also important that after eating there is no feeling of heaviness, but satiety is present and does not disappear for a long time. </li><li>  Entertainment.  During the season, various animated shows are held on site.  And every night something new!  Nights of live music, national dances with songs, performances of Greek pop and rock stars ... You don‚Äôt get bored here. </li></ul><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="belair beach hotel description" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/61988/2083725.jpg"></div></h2><h2>  What else do guests say? </h2><p>  Belair Beach Hotel reviews are numerous.  Above was only about some of the nuances that more often than others are worthy of attention people who have already rested in this hotel.  So here are a few more points that are worth mentioning: </p><ul><li>  Near the Belair Beach Hotel Rhodes there is a very busy traffic.  This is the only negative.  To reach the sea, it is necessary to cross the road, and no one is going to concede.  Yes, and they drive dangerously.  But you can walk 200 meters to the left and go through an unregulated transition. </li><li>  The infrastructure here is really developed.  Nearby are countless cafes, supermarkets and pharmacies.  And if you leave the hotel, turn left and go for 10 minutes in that direction, you can go out onto a busy street where various restaurants and hypermarkets are concentrated.  By the way, souvenirs there are 1-2 euros cheaper than next to Belair Beach. </li><li>  All doubts about whether to rent a car or not, should be thrown aside.  The car here is a must!  It is much more convenient and comfortable to travel around Rhodes in your car.  The whole island can be traveled in a couple of days.  And you can follow your own route, and not ride where all the tourist group with a guide goes.  And the prices for cars here are pleasant. </li></ul><p>  Summarizing, we can say: Belair Beach Hotel, the photo of which is presented above, will definitely appeal to people who want to go to Ixia and stay in a hotel with high quality service and modest prices. </p>
