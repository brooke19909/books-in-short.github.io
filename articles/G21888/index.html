In turn, manufacturers of modern phone models claim that new-generation devices are available with a high-strength display.  However, these beliefs do not apply to owners of newfangled gadgets, who are trying to save them by any means.  If the procedure is not performed at a service center, the question often arises: "How to remove air from under the protective glass?". </p><h2>  Do I need to glue the protection? </h2><p>  A protective film is a thin polymer cloth with a silicone coating that acts as an adhesive base.  Without certain skills, applying a protective film is quite problematic, since it is necessary to simultaneously cover the display with it and make sure that foreign particles do not get stuck between the two surfaces.  A frequent problem with insufficient experience is the fact that air has appeared under the protective glass.  How to remove a foreign element, consider below. </p><p>  The main function of the film is to protect the screen from mechanical stress and scratches.  If the device falls with the display down, the film will most likely not protect the screen from cracks and chips. </p><p>  The tempered material is the usual ultra-thin glass with a silicone coating.  Silicone, in addition to the adhesive function, protects the screen in case of shock or fall.  The main difference between glass and film is its best resistance and, accordingly, protection of the device from mechanical influences. </p><div class="photo" data-original="review.bukalapak.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to get rid of air under a protective glass" class="if uuid-3151973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3151973.jpg"></div><h2>  How to remove air around the edges of the protective glass? </h2><p>  Surely the owners of the phones at least once in the process of using the device came across a loose fit of the protective glass at the edges.  It is worth clarifying that the problem is relevant only when using glass with an adhesive base over its entire surface, and not around the perimeter.  This is the advantage of protective glass with glue only along the contour: in this case, air never remains around the edges. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Since the screen has a rounded surface, and the glass, in turn, is a flat, adhesive layer unevenly adheres to the display.  In places where the contact is not strong, air bubbles may form under the protective coating.  Sometimes this happens just a few minutes after installing the glass.  In this case, you have to solve the problem of how to get rid of air under the protective glass.  High-quality bases are held on the surface of the display, but their installation requires more time and effort. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.youtube.com" data-author=": JOHNSKIES, "><img itemprop="image" alt="under the protective glass air appeared how to remove" class="if uuid-3151952" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3151952.jpg"></div><p>  If the problem could not be avoided, you can try to eliminate it.  Starting from the edge and moving in one direction, the glass is pressed against the screen, making a little effort so that the air comes out.  You do not need to immediately release the glass, you need to hold it a little for better grip with the display.  If after this there is a bit of air, the manipulation is repeated. </p><p>  In the case when the measures described do not give results, liquid silicone can help.  It is applied in a thin layer in places where air enters and fills the voids.  As a result, the glass will not only be well glued, but will not lag behind during prolonged use. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="dRvLSy-XEcc" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=dRvLSy-XEcc" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/8/1/3/15813.jpg"></div><h2>  If air has accumulated in the middle of the screen </h2><p>  What to do if there is air under the protective glass?  Unlike cases with a film, to remove bubbles from under a thicker material, it will take a lot of effort.  There are several ways to do this: </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><ol><li>  You can try to squeeze them out.  To do this, take a plastic card and repeatedly draw it on the display in one direction, expelling the air. </li><li>  With the help of a needle, a portion of glass under which a bubble has accumulated is lifted.  Then the air is pushed out by pressing, and the glass is pressed to the display.  It is important to ensure that air masses do not penetrate under it. </li><li>  Another option is to thread a thin fishing line under the glass and run it over the entire surface of the screen until all the bubbles disappear.  Then the fishing line is removed, returning the glass to its place. </li><li>  Another option to get rid of air bubbles is to warm the protective coating with a stream of warm masses from the hair dryer.  The device is blown from a distance of 30 cm until the glass becomes hot, after which a book press is placed on it.  It is better to do this at night, after 10-15 hours, the bubbles should completely disappear. <div class="photo" data-original="www.yankodesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove air under the protective glass of the phone" class="if uuid-3151951" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3151951.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Despite the apparent simplicity of the process of gluing a protective coating, the procedure requires careful preparation. </p><p>  To successfully remove air from under the protective glass, you need to pay attention to these nuances: </p><ol><li>  First of all, it is worth noting that work should be carried out in a clean room.  If sticking is carried out at home, it is better to do it in the bathroom, because the higher the humidity in the room, the less dust in it. </li><li>  During work, you do not need to rush and exert excessive physical effort. </li><li>  Before proceeding, it is advisable to degrease the hands and the surface of the screen.  In no case should you touch the sticky side of the protective coating. </li><li>  So that you do not have to re-glue the glass every month, and the sensor functions well, it is important to purchase quality goods. <div class="photo" data-original="www.garrettspecialties.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to remove air from under the protective glass" class="if uuid-3151949" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3151949.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Problems replacing film on the phone </h2><p>  We examined how to remove air under the protective glass of the phone.  If nothing comes out or you accidentally ruined the surface, you will have to completely change the element. </p><p>  Before you start replacing the film, you must remove the old one, but this is not always easy.  Since both surfaces are very close to each other, it is impossible to simply pry off the top with your fingernail.  If you use the first thing that comes across, you can scratch the display or phone case. </p><p>  Using a suction cup can damage the phone.  The sensor is attached to the case with a double-sided tape, and if you carelessly move while removing the protective coating, you can damage the cable or break the module.  Therefore, each action must be verified. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mashable.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if air under a protective glass" class="if uuid-3151962" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3151962.jpg"></div><h2>  Safety glass removal </h2><p>  Correctly remove the protective element will help following the procedure: </p><ol><li>  In order not to leave fingerprints and stains on the display, before proceeding to dismantle, you must wash and degrease your hands or wear gloves. </li><li>  On a broken or damaged surface, you should choose an angle with no damage or with a minimal amount.  Then they attach the suction cup by pressing. </li><li>  The same angle is picked up with a thin object (mediator, scapula) to raise the edge.  Do this by gently sipping the suction cup onto yourself. </li><li>  After the angle of the glass is raised, the auxiliary item is moved further to the center of the screen. </li><li>  Then take the glass with your fingers and carefully remove. <div class="photo" data-original="www.truemaxcn.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="air under a protective glass" class="if uuid-3151953" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31654/3151953.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  Sticking new glass </h2><p>  A lint-free cloth is moistened with alcohol and a screen wiped.  This is done for better adhesion to the surface.  After that proceed to the gluing procedure itself. </p><div class="photo photo--thumb js-video-thumb" data-id="VFjrJwNJlVQ" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFjrJwNJlVQ" data-=""><img itemprop="image" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/y/1/5/8/1/4/15814.jpg"></div><p>  The following actions must be performed: </p><ol><li>  With clean hands, they take new glass by the edges, avoiding contact with the surface. </li><li>  Holding it as close to the smartphone as possible, pulling the tongue, remove the protective film. </li><li>  In accordance with the available holes for the camera, speaker and others, the protection is glued. </li><li>  Using a dry cloth, stroking and pressing movements even out the surface and expel air bubbles if they remain.  Then the upper film is removed from the glass. </li></ol><p>  We examined how to remove air from under the protective glass.  If you are unable to do everything carefully, it is better to entrust the matter to specialists. </p>
