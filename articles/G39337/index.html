Despite the constant emergence of new interesting routes, they occupy their certainly high place in the ranking of the most attractive places to stay.  Among our compatriots, tours to Cyprus are well-deserved.  Cyprus has a lot of irrefutable advantages; here you can spend your vacation relatively inexpensively with taste and all the amenities.  Every corner breathes antiquity.  This is a romantic island of myths and legends, the birthplace of the goddess of love Aphrodite.  She was born from snow-white sea foam, and a light breeze brought her to the island of Cyprus.  In those places where Aphrodite set foot, lush flowers bloomed. </p><p>  The resorts of Cyprus are almost never deserted, the island is famous for the fact that 330 days a year the sun shines on it.  The coldest on the west coast is near Paphos, where summer temperatures are 3-4 degrees lower than in Limassol and Larnaca.  The temperature of <span>sea ​​water is</span> rarely below 18 degrees, the swimming season lasts almost a whole year.  The second largest city in Cyprus, Limassol is often referred to as the Cyprus Riviera.  In addition to a beach holiday, here for lovers of antiquities there is an opportunity to admire the fortresses, churches and museums, as well as the ancient ruins of cities.  The main air port of Larnaca accepts the bulk of touring Cyprus and at the same time is the most affordable resort in terms of price. </p><p>  The city of Paphos, the former ancient capital of the island, it is considered the birthplace of Aphrodite.  The city has an atmosphere of bohemia and relaxation.  You can not stop at the charming town of Ayia Napa.  Former small fishing village today is the island’s most popular resort.  Life in this town does not stop for a minute.  Spending holidays in <span>Cyprus, reviews of tourists</span> say that this is a reckless and fun resort.  Hotels, bars, restaurants, clubs and discos are located along the coast all the way to Cape Greco.  Near it, the most picturesque nature and the cleanest water on the coast.  Everywhere vacationers are accompanied by the aroma of a variety of fragrant flowers. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  From the fishing bay of Larnaca you can go on an unforgettable tour - sea safari.  You will spend a wonderful day on a high-speed vessel with a transparent bottom, sailing past the rocks, you will see the habitats of sea eagles.  In the bay of Potamos you can watch dolphins, there is also the only fish farm on the high seas.  Tourists making tours to Cyprus must visit the pirate caves of Ayia Napa.  Moving further towards Cape Cavo Greco, sea caves are visible - palaces of <span>stalagmites and stalactites.</span>  Stopping behind the cape, you must definitely swim in the crystal clear water in the Blue Lagoon, here you can dive and feed the fish. </p><p>  Tours to Cyprus necessarily lead tourists to the island's capital - Nicosia.  Today it is the only city in the world divided by two countries - Northern Cyprus and Southern Cyprus.  Here passes the "green line", which divides the entire island into two states.  The Turkish part of the island is very picturesque.  Developed infrastructure, mosques, many shops, restaurants and bars.  If you are very lucky, you can see a real Turkish wedding.  The fact is that according to Turkish tradition, a wedding is celebrated right in the center of the city.  To get acquainted with the local cuisine of Cyprus is also one of the reasons to make a trip to this island.  This wine, olive oil and cheese, fish on a brazier and octopuses, hung like towels on a rope.  Here life flows in its time, carefree and joyful.  It is in this region that winemaking was born.  Aphrodite herself planted <span>a vine,</span> and Apollo gave the Cypriots a grape press.  The gods created the <span>wine of Cyprus,</span> joining forces.  <span>White sand</span> on the beach, bright sun and gentle wind.  Come to Cyprus, there is always a great vacation. </p>
