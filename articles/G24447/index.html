    <h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Now you can pay attention to the guests' comments on the Augusta Club (Spain) hotel.  Here's what they say: </p><ul><li>  The rooms are small, the two of us are okay, the three of us are cramped, but comfortable and always clean. </li><li>  Friendly, friendly staff will help to resolve the problem.  They really are attentive to everyone without exception. </li><li>  Augusta Club 4 * (Costa Brava) is suitable for both couples and active young tourists, because the hotel is conveniently located near numerous bars and restaurants, but at night noisy parties will not disturb sleeping guests. </li><li>  Tourists who previously vacationed here are advised to buy a tour with breakfast and dinner included, because when comparing a stay at Augusta Club with other hotels on the Spanish coast, guests prefer the former because of its excellent cuisine, which is not inferior to the other advantages of other hotels. </li><li>  Despite the fact that you have to go to the beach for about 10 minutes, the road through cozy streets with inviting shops and shops will pass unnoticed. </li></ul><h2>  Terrain infrastructure </h2><p>  Very close to the hotel are the following beaches that all tourists who have been here recommend visiting: Lloret (0.9 km), Fenals (1.4 km), Santa Cristina (2.6 km). <br>  Within walking distance are an inexpensive supermarket, souvenir shops, establishments with traditional cuisine, cafes, bars, and a market. </p><p>  Nearby is a bus station with links to Barcelona.  The airport, by the way, is located 23 kilometers from the hotel complex. </p>

    <h2>  sights </h2><p>  Not far from the hotel for lovers and extreme sportsmen there is a water park Water World, famous for one of the tallest towers in the world (80 meters) for bungee jumping.  Due to the large number of attractions it is called the "city of entertainment" in which everyone will find something for themselves: from dizzying slides to the pool with sea waves. </p><p>  Santa Clotilde Gardens is located in a picturesque place on a cliff with breathtaking sea views.  Terraces, streams, fountains and waterfalls are truly worth seeing.  National treasure is one of the most successful examples of the Italian Renaissance, where garden architecture is in harmony with vegetation.  An ideal place for memorable shots from relaxation. </p><p>  The fortress of Tossa de Mar, amazing in its safety, was built on a cliff 70 meters above sea level.  Beyond these walls, local residents were forced to defend themselves against the pirates who had taken possession of the coastal waters at that time.  The fortress was a whole city with its church, from which today there are only ruins, and in the former residential buildings there are cozy cafes and hotels. </p><p>  Sant Joan Castle, or St. John's Castle, is located on top of a hill that separates Lloret Beach and Fenals Beach.  The appearance of this castle is inextricably linked with the emergence of Lloret himself.  And although the historical building suffered many partial collapses, today the rebuilt symbol of the city again crowns its hill. </p><p>  Amusement park Gnomo Park.  The main visitors here are precisely the children who happily dive into the labyrinth with slides and dry pools.  The park has rope tracks with different levels of difficulty of the route.  While children are busy on slides, trampolines and swings, adults can take shelter from the sun in a shady picnic area. </p>
