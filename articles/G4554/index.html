    <h2>  Construction </h2><p>  In 2007, the Moscow government decided to extend the Kalinin line, that is, to build Novokosino.  The metro was supposed to open in 2010, but the deadline was postponed several times. </p><p>  Initially, the project of the station assumed the presence of parking lots at the exits for two thousand parking spaces.  The lack of parking is, as you know, one of the main problems of the capital.  Residents of Moscow suburbs leave their cars in yards, where there are not so many places for apartment owners of nearby houses.  Parking near the Novokosino station would solve similar problems in the east of the capital.  It really was built, but today it is designed for only five hundred parking spaces.  However, soon they plan to expand it. </p><p>  Construction began in 2008.  Perhaps due to the outbreak of the economic crisis, the dates were postponed.  <span>The development of the pit</span> began only in the winter of 2010, but in the summer it was already ready.  The platform section was built from monolithic reinforced concrete.  In the photo above you can see what the Novokosino station looks like.  The metro was designed by architects of the Metrogiprotrans company.  Reinforced concrete vaulted coating is the main feature of this pavilion. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Where is the Novokosino metro station located?

    <h2>  Location </h2><p>  This station is located between the Nosovikhinsky highway and Suzdal street.  Nearby is South Street.  The name Nosovikhinsky highway comes from the village, which in the second half of the last century became part of the Railway.  Previously, it was called the Vohonskaya road.  The modern name of the highway was in the 80s of the last century.  Two exits from the Novokosino metro lead to Suzdalskaya Street.  It is named after the city that is part of the Golden Ring - Suzdal is located east of Moscow. </p><h2>  Shopping centers </h2><p>  As in most areas located on the outskirts of Moscow, there are few historical monuments, but many shops and catering facilities.  Here are located the shopping centers "Trio", "Stroy-Magistral", "Novokosino".  The metro is not far from each of them, because they are all located on Suzdal Street.  The three-storey shopping complex ‚ÄúTrio‚Äù is especially popular with locals.  There are many small and large stores, a pharmacy, a communication salon.  On the third floor there are fast food cafes.  In the vicinity of the Novokosino metro station, there is everything that is necessary for life: Sberbank branches, private clinics, and educational institutions. </p><h2>  Haydn School of Music </h2><p>  This school is one of the oldest institutions belonging to the Department of Culture.  The opening took place in 1945.  Then in the name of this institution was not the name of the Austrian composer, and it included only two sections: string and piano.  Until the 90s of the twentieth century, the school was located in the building of an ancient temple.  But the unique historical monument was transferred to the Orthodox Church, and a new building was built for the music school.  The establishment is a five minute walk from the metro station. </p>

    <h2>  Church of All Saints </h2><p>  Moscow is famous for its monuments of medieval architecture.  Metro Novokosino is located near one of them.  There are shops, schools, and restaurants in the area.  But <span>man does not live by bread alone.</span>  The church leadership a few years ago began work on the spiritual development of the inhabitants of this area.  The Church of All Saints was restored, and a Sunday school was opened on its territory. </p><p>  In addition, this building has become a decoration of the local landscape.  The temple was erected in the XVI century, but is an example of ancient Russian architecture, characteristic of an earlier period. </p>
