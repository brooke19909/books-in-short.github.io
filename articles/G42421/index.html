    <h2>  Things to do </h2><p>  Nizhny Novgorod (in Soviet times - the city of Gorky) is rich in historical places and objects of cultural heritage.  There is something to see here.  Founded in 1221 by Vladimir <span>Prince Yuri Vsevolodovich</span> at the confluence of two large rivers, the Oka and Volga (famous arrow), it attracts tourists of various ages and areas of interest to its walls.  Here you can not only enjoy the historical heritage of your native history, but also visit the Krasnoye Sormovo shipyard, visit the museum of the Gorky Automobile Plant, one of the domestic engineering giants, visit IT centers, ride two lines of your own metro, and just wander around central streets, enjoying gorgeous panoramic views of the Volga and Oka. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  By plane </h2><p>  But now you packed your bags, stocked up with a map of the area and a list of attractions that you must visit.  You only have a few days to rest and the logical question arose about how to get to Nizhny Novgorod from Moscow quickly.  You can use the services of air carriers.  Almost all major Russian operators: Aeroflot, S7 Airlines and UTair - direct flights from all three capital airports to Nizhny Novgorod Strigino daily.  The average cost of such a flight will be 4,500 rubles.  Over time, there will be no problems either.  Cruise cars start from the capital from early morning until late at night.  The plane "Nizhny Novgorod - Moscow" is on the way a little over an hour.  Even taking into account the road to the airport, this is the fastest way to get to the capital of the Volga region.  Tickets can be purchased at www.aviasales.ru or www.skyscanner.ru. </p>

    <h2>  By train </h2><p>  How many of us have ever dreamed of falling asleep to a muffled knock of wheels lying on a reserved seat shelf and looking out the window at the scenery of our native country flying by?  Many people now choose to travel by train, just on the basis of these considerations.  The Nizhny Novgorod-Moscow train spends about six hours on the journey, depending on the number of stops.  Moreover, trains come to Nizhny not only from the capital, but from many other cities of our country.  These are Adler, Usinsk, Vorkuta, St. Petersburg, Kazan, Novorossiysk, Yekaterinburg and many others.  A lot of branded trains arrive at the central station of the city: "Swallow", "Strizh", "Malachite", "Nizhegorodets", "Volga", "Vyatka" and "Northern Urals".  Named train "Nizhny Novgorod - Moscow" spends less time on the way than a regular fast train.  This is because the stopping points of such trains are located only in the largest cities in the direction of their route.  "Swallow" flies a distance of 442 km in 4 hours and 13 minutes.  On the way, this branded train has only 6 stops (including the final).  However, there is an even faster option.  On the route of the branded train "Strizh" - "Moscow - Nizhny Novgorod" - there is not a single stop at all.  Travel time of this express train is 3 hours 35 minutes.  The average fare is 1760 rubles.  The ticket can be purchased at www.tutu.ru. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div>

    <h2>  Own car </h2><p>  You can get to the capital of the Volga region by your own transport.  Experienced motorists are always ready to tell you how to get to Nizhny Novgorod from Moscow in your car.  To do this, just turn off the Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) to the Gorky Highway, the M7 highway (European route E22), and then follow the road signs in this direction.  On the way, the autotraveller will pass cities such as Noginsk, Elektrostal, Orekhovo-Zuevo, Vladimir, Vyazniki, Dzerzhinsk and many others.  Bypassing Vladimir and his suburban settlements, a magnificent bypass road was built.  However, be careful not to violate the speed limit.  DPS outfits are often on duty there.  In the absence of traffic jams and not exceeding the speed by car, you can reach Nizhny Novgorod in 4.5-5 hours. </p><h2>  On the boat </h2><p>  How to get to Nizhny Novgorod from Moscow in another way?  What other options are there?  You can buy a ticket for the cruise ship next to Nizhny Novgorod and further along the Volga.  In this case, you will not only enjoy the charming views from the deck of the ship, but also go through those places where you can‚Äôt even drive by car.  But only in time, such cruises can stretch from two days to a week, depending on the excursion program.  The cost of such a trip also depends on this. </p>
