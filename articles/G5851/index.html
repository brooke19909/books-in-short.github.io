    <h2>  Where is </h2><p>  If you have a map in front of you, Monastir (Tunisia) you can easily find on the coast, 150 kilometers from the capital of this state.  As for the Chiraz Club hotel, it is located between the cities of Monastir and Sousse.  The distance to the first of them is 17, and to the second - 13 kilometers.  The resort area in which the hotel is located is called Skanes.  Not far from the hotel there are several interesting <span>sights of Tunisia: the</span> Muslim city of Sidi Bou Said, the ancient Medina, as well as Safari Park.  A big plus of the Chiraz Club 3 * hotel is its location directly on the seashore.  So an excellent fine sandy beach with a gentle entry into the water is literally a hundred meters here.  It belongs to the hotel, so the use of sun loungers and parasols is free. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="map of monastir tunisia" class="if" height="406" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/547998.jpg" width="237"></div>

    <div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get there </h2><p>  Most tourists from Russia arrive in Monastir through the local air harbor named after Habib Bourguiba.  It is located just seven kilometers from the Chiraz Club Hotel.  Since the opening of the international airport in Enfida, the number of flights to the local air harbor has decreased significantly.  However, many charters from Russia still fly here.  If you plan to get to Tunisia through other airports - Enfide or the capital Tunis-Carthage - then from there you can get to Monastir either by intercity bus or train, or again by air.  So, the flight will take you about one hour.  Experienced tourists are sure to recommend on approaching the resort to pay attention to the opening landscape.  You will see colorful ponds serving to evaporate salt, and in winter you can also see picturesque flocks of pink flamingos. </p>

    <h2>  Chiraz Club 3 *: reviews of tourists from Russia </h2><p>  In order for you to have a more complete and accurate picture of this hotel, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the generalized comments of tourists who have been vacationing here this year.  In general, we can say that, according to our compatriots, this hotel is fully consistent with its three stars and is suitable for people who want a great and, most importantly, budget vacation in Tunisia.  But we suggest learning about everything in order. </p><p>  So, as for the hotel rooms, their travelers found it spacious and decently furnished.  The presence of such trifles as devices for drying clothes on balconies, etc., was also pleasing. Furniture and equipment here, of course, are not new, but everything is in normal and working condition.  If there is any problem, then the reception will allow you to quickly solve all problems.  By the way, the staff at Chiraz Club 3 *, according to the Russians, is very diligent and friendly.  The hotel staff will always do everything possible to please you and solve all problems and difficulties.  As for the cleaning of the rooms, we carried out it efficiently and regularly.

Tourists were especially pleased with the presence of a large saltwater pool.  Many guests enjoyed spending time here, preferring the sun terrace to the beach.  Also, according to our compatriots, the territory here is well-groomed and clean. </p><p>  As in the case with most three-star and four-star hotels, about the food in the Chiraz Club 3 * (Tunisia), opinions differed.  So, someone assures that the choice of dishes here was quite diverse, and the food itself was tasty and well prepared.  Another part of the tourists claims that the menu was very scarce. </p><p>  Positive feedback from travelers from Russia was awarded animation at the hotel.  According to tourists, the animation team is well aware of its business and is happy to entertain guests.
