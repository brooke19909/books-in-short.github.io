Its unique identity, the beauty of nature, the warm Adriatic Sea, thermal springs and amazing gastronomy attract tourists from all over the world.  Compared to other resort states of the peninsula, Slovenia can hardly be called a popular destination, but even from this it acquires a special charm. </p><h2>  general information </h2><p>  There is no huge number of vacationers, and there are no widely advertised places.  Silence and solitude reign everywhere.  Resorts, judging by the reviews, are affordable for the average tourist.  Many of them are great for families and children or the elderly. </p><div class="photo" data-original="boardaboat.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Beach and sea" class="if uuid-2541637" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541637.jpg"></div><p>  Geographical location is one of the main advantages of Slovenia.  Rest here is represented by a wide variety of areas, ranging from active sports to wellness.  Slovenia is located in the Alpine-Danube region.  From the north-west it is bounded by the Alps, from the south by the Dinar Highlands.  The mild climate and the abundance of forests - beech, oak and coniferous - create ideal conditions for recreation. </p><h2>  Resorts of Slovenia </h2><p>  The length of the sea line is slightly less than fifty kilometers.  On the Adriatic coast of this country there are many developed resorts.  Of these, the most famous are Portoroz, Piran, Strunjan, Koper.  They have a very developed tourist infrastructure. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.viaslovenia.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Isola Hotels" class="if uuid-2541638" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541638.jpg"></div><p>  In this article we will talk about one of the most popular resorts in Slovenia - Izola, whose photos are presented below. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  This small town is located on the Adriatic coast, between Koper and Portoroz.  Unfortunately, this former fishing port is undeservedly deprived of attention from tourists.  It is impossible to meet the crowds of vacationers.  At the same time, Izola (Slovenia), whose photo of the old city testifies to the Venetian charm of buildings, is a worthy alternative to the more modern and hyped Koper or Piran.  It can hardly be called a noisy tourist center.  The city of Izola (Slovenia) has a total of seventeen thousand inhabitants.  There is no airport.  The nearest air gate located in Ljubljana is 113 kilometers away.  Three times a day, a shuttle bus leaves the airport for Izola. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aldi-utazas.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Walk around the city" class="if uuid-2541645" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541645.jpg"></div><p>  This small Slovenian town has a seaport from which tourists can get to Venice by ferry.  Shuttle buses provide transport links to the nearest cities of many European countries.  By train, you can reach Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.  But keep in mind that train tickets cost more than a bus. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Appearance story </h2><p>  Territories in the vicinity of Izola in Slovenia were inhabited two thousand years ago by histors - some of the Illyrians.  They founded settlements here, the ruins of which can be seen in the village of Korty, located near the city.  Here, from the surrounding hills, a beautiful panorama opens to the smallest seaside town in Istria, which was once an island, which was connected to the mainland by a large stone bridge.  That is why Isola was so named.  And although over time the island merged with the coast, life here today is inextricably linked with the sea and, of course, fisheries. </p><p>  In the era of the Roman Empire, in place of the city of Isola in Slovenia, there was a large port of Aliaetum.  In the Middle Ages, he was dependent on Koper.  In the middle of the thirteenth century, independence was proclaimed in Izola, but after two and a half decades, the town became part of the Venetian Republic.  Since the sixteenth century, with the development of Trieste, the importance of Izola as a port began to decline. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.aldi-utazas.hu" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Isola Slovakia" class="if uuid-2541640" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541640.jpg"></div><p>  After the fall of Venice, the whole territory of Istria became part of Austria.  This situation persisted until the First World War, after which Isola was already part of Italy, and after World War II - already Yugoslavia.  Since 1991, Isola has been one of the cities of independent Slovenia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Tourist info </h2><p>  Isola has always been considered a ‚Äúpoor relative‚Äù of Piran and Koper.  She was better known as the town of fishermen.  However, today mass tourism is diligently developing here.  Holidays in Izola (Slovenia), reviews of which can be read below, are primarily beach.  Although sightseeing will give travelers no less pleasure than swimming in the sea and sunbathing for many hours. </p><p>  On the cobbled narrow streets of the historical center of Izola, numerous art galleries, cozy cafes and restaurants are huddled.  The city hosts cultural events year-round.  In Izola you can experience the true taste of local cuisine and the charm of Istria.  The climate here is mild Mediterranean with warm summers and not very cold winters.  As numerous reviews of Slovenia indicate, Izola is a vivid mosaic of history, traditions and friendly locals. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mulpix.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Sights of Izola" class="if uuid-2541650" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541650.jpg"></div><p>  Since the city is located on the seashore, sailing is the main attraction here.  In Izola, almost all year there is wind.  This has made the resort popular with windsurfers and yachtsmen. </p><h2>  City Tour </h2><p>  Tourists in Izola can take walks along the promenade.  The length of the promenade is two kilometers.  There are many rental points where you can rent a bike and ride it around the city.  Many rent a boat to go fishing. </p><p>  Izola combines Pannonian, Mediterranean and Alpine cultures, which is felt not only in urban architecture, but also in local cuisine.  Since it is a sea town, the main dishes in many restaurants contain seafood.  Judging by the reviews, the local wine very much resembles the original Tuscan counterparts. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.polarsteps.com" data-author=": Eva Speijer, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Reviews about Izola" class="if uuid-2541661" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541661.jpg"></div><p>  Walking around the city, you definitely need to walk to its historical center.  In Izola, there is an observation deck with an amazing view.  Children will enjoy visiting the dolphinarium.  There is a casino in the city, and shopping lovers can make purchases in shops and souvenir shops. </p><h2>  Beaches and the sea </h2><p>  Judging by statistics, vacation in Izola is gradually becoming more and more popular.  And this is not surprising.  The warm Adriatic Sea, clean pebble beaches, delicious local cuisine, a large selection of entertainment - all this attracts people with various interests to the resort. </p><p>  Often this resort is called the oasis of Mediterranean leisureliness.  Simonov zaliv, Svetilnik and Bele Skale are the most popular beaches in Izola (Slovenia).  The photos below confirm their incredible beauty.  They are ideal for families with children.  In general, kids tolerate the local climate very well.  Izola's central beach is free.  It is located near the historic city center.  It is a well-equipped beach, but it is almost always crowded with tourists.  Directly next to it there are several attractions, playgrounds and recreational areas. </p><div class="photo" data-original="mapio.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City of Isola" class="if uuid-2541656" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541656.jpg"></div><p>  City beaches in Izola (Slovenia) are small pebble. </p><p>  The best is considered to be Simonov zaliv.  It is located within walking distance from the city center.  Its advantage is low tourist load.  There is a great park near the beach. </p><p>  Bele Skale, located at the foot of the hill, is wild.  There is no specially equipped swimming area, umbrellas, sun loungers, so those who prefer tranquility and solitude come here. </p><p>  The beach is located at the foot of the hill of the same name.  There are no equipped places to relax with umbrellas and sunbeds, but you can enjoy the tranquility and privacy. </p><p>  The EU blue flag constantly marks the quality of ecology in Izola <span>(Slovenia).</span>  <span>Holidays at sea</span> in this Mediterranean resort will please even the most fastidious tourist.  All beaches are clean and the sea is surprisingly clear.  Sometimes from the shore you can see dolphins, and if you're lucky, even whales. </p><h2>  Hotels </h2><p>  Isola in Slovenia is becoming an increasingly popular destination every year.  There are not as many hotels as in neighboring Koper or Piran.  And those that are are concentrated mainly in the city and in the surrounding Berry.  A feature of local hotels is the lack of comprehensive food: tourists are provided only breakfast, and for lunch and dinner they will have to go to nearby restaurants, which are excellently fed, and the prices are quite affordable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="travelslovenia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Paradise for boaters" class="if uuid-2541655" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/2541655.jpg"></div><p>  The best hotels in Izola (Slovenia) are the four-star San-Simon Resort, Hotel Marina 3 *, Belvedere Casino Resort 3 * and Hotel Delfin.  In high season, the room rate jumps a lot.  This is due to the limited number of hotels.  Therefore, many tourists prefer to book rooms in the spring. </p><p>  Almost all Izola hotels offer free Wi-Fi, developed infrastructure, air-conditioned rooms with traditional filling.  Many of them have a large territory, fully landscaped, which has a pool and free parking. </p><h2>  Private Housing </h2><p>  Some Russian tourists prefer to rent apartments for a vacation period.  In Izola, too, if desired, you can stay in one of the hotel complexes or rent an apartment from a private trader.  In the city center, renting a two-room apartment costs about 50 euros per day.  A more spacious dwelling with a living room, two bedrooms and a terrace, which can accommodate up to four people at a time, will cost from 70 euros and above. </p><p>  According to reviews of Slovenia, Izola is not a very expensive resort.  There is an elite housing, and affordable options that are available to tourists with average incomes. </p><h2>  The property </h2><p>  Apartments in Izola (Slovenia) have different price levels, depending on class and area.  Those who value space and luxury can purchase two-level apartments (160-200 sq. Meters) for about 300-450 thousand euros.  Housing is simpler, for example a two-room apartment with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã34 square meters.  m, it will cost about sixty thousand.  e. The average price range of real estate in Izola ranges from 120-200 thousand.  Townhouses here are approximately 280-490 thousand.  e., although there are higher rates. </p><p>  The price range for cottages within the city is much higher.  The sale price of a private house can start from 295 thousand y.  e. The price of luxury mansions reaches up to a million euros, and sometimes even more. </p><h2>  sights </h2><p>  There are many historical and architectural monuments in Izola in Slovenia.  The most noticeable attraction of the city is the church of St. Moor.  It is located on the highest place of the ancient island and gives the city a characteristic charm.  The church was built in the middle of the XIV century.  Its architecture combines two styles: Baroque and Renaissance. </p><p>  The largest number of Izola attractions is located in Piazza Manzioli.  Here you can see the church of St.  Maria, which is distinguished by an octagonal composition and a vaulted ceiling in the form of a cross, the palaces of Manzioli and Lavisato, in one of which is a large library of manuscripts and books, and in the other - a music school.  On the outskirts of Izola, the ruins of a Roman villa and an old port have been preserved. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Most often tourists come here who prefer a quiet relaxing holiday.  There are no nightclubs or noisy discos in Izola.  The only entertainment is the local casino.  Judging by the reviews, the Russians really liked the cuisine, especially the fresh seafood in restaurants.  Unfortunately, for children who come here quite a lot, the resort provides very little entertainment.  In Izola there is only an amusement park, as well as a water park and a dolphinarium, which are distant from the center. </p><p>  The best time for lovers of sea holidays is July and August.  During this period, the Adriatic Sea is warm.  However, the high season has its drawbacks: a large number of vacationers on the beaches and unreasonably high prices in hotels and in the private sector.  Our compatriots left a lot of positive feedback about fishing, which is incredibly exciting here. </p><p>  The vast majority of Russians who discovered Slovenia, in particular Izola, were satisfied with their choice. </p>
