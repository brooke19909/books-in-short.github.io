The reason for their appearance was the need to control the <span>behavior of people</span> using <span>rules common</span> to most. </p><p>  The concept and types of social norms depend on two criteria: </p><p>  - the method of their creation, occurrence; <br>  - ways to protect them from violations. </p><p>  Based on these criteria, the concept and types of social norms are as follows: </p><p>  1. The rules of law are established and protected by the state. </p><p>  2. The standards of morality.  These rules of conduct depend on how people imagine such moral categories as evil, good, justice, <br>  injustice, honor, dignity, duty.  They are guarded by a person‚Äôs internal faith or the influence of the majority opinion. </p><p>  3. The norms of public organizations.  They are established by the organizations themselves, which initially provide for measures of protection for their protection. </p><p>  4. Norms of customs - these are the rules that have developed in a particular society and become a habit of people as a result of their repeated repetition. </p><p>  5. The norms of traditions are the most stable laws of behavior; they arise when proven fields are supported in a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman life. <br>  time of foundations. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  6. The norms of rituals indicate how to behave during the performance of certain rites (marriage, <span>public holidays,</span> meetings of officials).  Specificity <br>  their embodiment, implementation - entertainment, theatrical design. </p><p>  The concept and types of social norms depend not only on the way they are established in society and on savings from violations.  Their directionality also matters. <br>  The content of the concept and types of social norms distinguish the following: </p><p>  - technical; <br>  - economic - manage <span>forms of ownership,</span> production of material goods and their distribution; <br>  - labor; <br>  - family; <br>  - environmental; <br>  - political - regulate the process of struggle for political power, relations between peoples, classes, etc .; <br>  - religious - manage relations between religions, the conduct of religious rites; <br>  - cultural, etc. </p><p>  The laws adopted in society, there are a number of signs characteristic of them, which help to regulate relations in society, to influence the behavior of people in emerging situations. </p><p>  The concept and signs of social norms: </p><p>  Firstly, these are established rules of behavior in society.  The state, organizations or collective of people indicate how people should behave, what actions to perform, and which not.  In accordance with these patterns, they correct their own behavior, they are equal. </p><p>  Secondly, social norms are general in nature, and not individual, that is, their requirements must be met by all people who find themselves in the field <br>  their impact. </p><p>  Thirdly, they are not only important for all people, but also obligatory for those members of the community who are directly concerned.  Social norms are so compulsory (and not only legal) that those who violate them can be affected by society or the country's leadership.  The state takes measures if a person has violated legal laws, and society reacts in the form of censure, condemnation, alienation in case of moral violation. <br>  The totality and interconnection of social norms make up the rules of the community of people. </p>
