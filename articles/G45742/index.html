    <h2>  Background </h2><p>  The ancient Slavic settlements in the territory of the modern city originate from the 5th century AD.  Some historians believe that it is from this moment that the history of Lviv begins.  Since the 7th century, a region of artisans has been actively functioning in the settlement, which gave it the right to be called a city.  But as this settlement was then called, it remains a mystery to historians.  The settlement was inhabited at that time by the White Croat tribes. </p><p>  In 981, the area around the future of Lviv, during the struggle with the young Polish kingdom, was annexed by Prince Vladimir to Kievan Rus.  From this moment, this territory was included in the economic and political life of the Old Russian state. </p><p>  After the feudal fragmentation of the united Old Russian power of the land, on which Lviv now stands, was first included in the Principality of Galicia, and since 1199 - in the Galicia-Volyn Principality of Monomakhovichi.  The creator of this state is Roman Mstislavovich, the father of the future founder of Lviv, Daniel Romanovich Galitsky. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  The heyday of the Principality of Galicia </h2><p>  The period of the reign of Daniel refers to the political and economic heyday of the Galician state.  And this despite the fact that he had to spend his whole life in the fight against local boyars and external aggressors - Poland and Hungary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lviv city history" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31344/870912.jpg" width="319"></div>

    <p>  But the most severe blow to the West Russian state was dealt by the Mongol-Tatar invasion.  During this bulk many cities of Galicia were destroyed.  Unlike other princes, until the last days of his life, Daniel did not completely accept the foreign yoke.  He constantly looked for ways to resist the invaders, tried to create an alliance against the Mongols, consisting of the rulers of Western countries.  For this, he was even ready to make an alliance with the Catholic Church, although in practice he had never betrayed Orthodoxy.  In recognition of his merits to the faith in the fight against the Mongols, Daniil of Galicia was granted the title of King of Russia by the Pope of Rome. </p><p>  The prince‚Äôs activities, of course, didn‚Äôt really like the Horde khans, who sent one punitive detachment after another to force him to loyalty.  As a result of these raids in Galicia, many cities and settlements were destroyed. </p><h2>  The base of Lviv </h2><p>  Tatar raids served as one of the reasons for the foundation of the city with the beautiful <span>name Lviv.</span>  The history of its creation begins in 1256.  It was then that the capital of the Galicia-Volyn principality, the Hill, was greatly affected by the fire.  In this regard, Prince Daniel decided to build a new large city in an area difficult to access for Tatar raids. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  At the same time, some historians attribute the date of the founding of Lviv to an earlier time - 1247 or 1240.  Accordingly, in these hypotheses this event is dedicated to the marriage of the son of Daniel Leo and to the capture of Kiev by the Mongols. </p><h2>  City name </h2><p>  Almost all historians have the same opinion why the city was given the name Lviv.  The history of the name goes back to the son and heir of Daniil of Galich - Lev Danilovich.  It was in his honor that the great father named the city, which was destined to become the capital of the principality.  According to one version, the name was given on the day of the marriage of Leo with the daughter of the king of Hungary. </p><h2>  The capital of the Russian kingdom </h2><p>  The history of Lviv has taken a new turn since 1269, when Leo became the prince of Galicia-Volyn and the king of Russia.  It was he who transferred the capital to this city from Galich, which had succumbed to repeated destruction, and the burnt Hill.  From that moment, Lviv became not only the main city of the Galicia-Volyn principality, but actually the center of the Russian kingdom. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="lions name story" class="if" height="383" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31344/870553.jpg" width="300"></div>

    <p>  In accordance with its new status, mass construction began in the city.  In 1270, the so-called High Castle was built - the citadel of Lviv.  Although the prince himself lived in the Lower Castle.  The whole social life of the city proceeded on the market, it was he who was his heart.  More and more residents from neighboring and distant settlements flocked to the capital.  So Lviv grew.  The history of the city has become an inextricable part of world chronology. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  After the death of Leo I, the settlement did not lose its capital status.  He remained the main city of the state under the following princes, who simultaneously bore the title of kings of Russia.  This continued until in 1340, with the death of Yuri II Boleslav, the ruling clan stopped. </p><h2>  Lviv as part of the Commonwealth </h2><p>  After the ruling dynasty broke off in Galicia, the <span>Polish king</span> Casimir III declared his rights to the principality, and in particular to Lviv.  In 1340, his troops captured the city and established royal power there.  True, the king granted the city self-government and <span>Magdeburg law,</span> but at the same time, Lviv began to rapidly polonize.  Soon, most of the townspeople were Poles.  A significant part of the population were also Jews.  The history of Lviv from then until 1939 is inextricably linked with Poland. </p><p>  In 1412, the Archbishop's Department was moved to Lviv from Galich. </p><p>  In 1569, Poland and Lithuania formed a union state - the Commonwealth.  As part of its Lions was until 1772, when, due to the first division of the Polish-Lithuanian state, he, like the rest of Galicia, was included in the <span>Austrian</span> Habsburg <span>Empire</span> . </p><h2>  Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria </h2><p>  As part of the Habsburg monarchy, Lviv became the capital of the province, which is commonly called the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.  Despite the fact that the city became part of another state and the governor was appointed from Vienna, the Polish nobility continued to play the leading role in the region. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="r lions story" class="if" height="312" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/871693.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  However, this period can be called the cultural revival of Lviv.  The university was restored, a theater was opened, imperial power supported the fight against church obscurantism.  At the same time, the cultural communities of the Ruthenians began to revive, as the Habsburgs tried to find support in them in the confrontation with the Polish nobility. </p><h2>  An attempt to restore Ukrainian statehood </h2><p>  After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire as a result of the defeat in World War I in 1918, an attempt was made by the Ukrainian intelligentsia of Lviv to restore their own statehood.  It was expressed in the proclamation of the Declaration of State Independence of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic (ZUNR) on October 19, 1918. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="the history of Lviv until 1939" class="if" height="365" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31344/871679.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  But the problem was that the majority of the population of Lviv at that time were Poles, who saw themselves only as part of the new Polish state.  Therefore, the fate of ZUNR was a foregone conclusion.  In November, the troops of the head of Poland Pilsudski already completely controlled Lviv, and soon the ZUNR army was finally defeated. </p><h2>  Ruled by Poland </h2><p>  Thus, the history of Lviv until 1939 turned out to be connected with the Polish state.  The rights of Ukrainians in this period were completely infringed.  Thus began one of the most tragic pages in the history of the region.  It was during this period that a bloody struggle broke out between Ukrainian nationalists and the Polish authorities, the main victim of which was a civilian population among representatives of both one and the other nationalities. </p><p>  In 1939, Poland was actually divided between Germany and the Soviet Union.  Lviv and almost all of Galicia were annexed to the USSR. </p><h2>  Lviv as part of the USSR </h2><p>  Not long entertained by the world of Lviv.  History presented him with a series of tragic events.  The Great Patriotic War began.  Nazi troops occupied the city on June 29, 1941.  The time of the fascist occupation was marked by one of the largest extermination of Jews.  The Soviet troops managed to liberate the city only in 1944. </p><p>  After that, the rapid restoration of the village began.  As part of the Ukrainian SSR, Lviv became the largest industrial and cultural center of the region.  At this time, unlike in previous periods, the overwhelming majority of citizens began to be ethnic Ukrainians. </p><h2>  Lviv after the declaration of independence of Ukraine </h2><p>  Lviv did not lose its significance even after the declaration of independence of Ukraine on August 24, 1991.  True, since then the industrial potential of the city has significantly decreased, but, nevertheless, it has remained the economic center of the region.  The cultural significance of modern Lviv for the country can hardly be overestimated.  Many consider him the heart of Ukraine. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Lviv history briefly" class="if" height="389" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/871689.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Conclusion </h2><p>  As we see, the history of Lviv had a lot of tragic and, conversely, happy pages.  Briefly convey all its vicissitudes will not work.  To study the issue of economic and political development of the city, it takes months, or even years.  Well, in order to understand the spiritual essence of Lviv, one must visit it personally. </p>
