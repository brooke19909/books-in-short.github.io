The best option is a headband.  You can make your own jewelry - not necessarily buy.  Therefore, the question arises, how to crochet a headband with your own hands?  There are a lot of options for designs, colors and patterns.  Even more ways to decorate an already finished product. </p><h2>  What yarn should be used to make a headband </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth deciding which function the dressing will perform.  After that, you can pick up the yarn from which the product will be made.  Thanks to the texture of the thread, color and texture, it is easy to determine how to crochet a headband. </p><p>  The most commonly used yarn is: </p><ul><li>  Acrylic.  Universal material for the manufacture of dressings.  The thread is soft and elastic, so it does not irritate the skin.  The color scheme pleases with variety.  The product can be used in spring or autumn to warm your head and ears. </li><li>  Children's wool mixture.  This option is mild, but over time, the scalp will become irritated, showing a tingling sensation.  But this dressing will be very warm and can be used even in winter. </li><li>  Cotton.  It is usually used to make decorative dressings that are used to decorate hairstyles or to remove hair from the face.  The thread is soft and pleasant to the touch, but not elastic. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="www.mybluprint.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="dressing option" class="if uuid-3202814" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3202814.jpg"></div><p>  Other synthetic and natural fibers can be used if the dressing design requires this. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to improve the functionality of the dressing </h2><p>  Knitwear always has flaws that relate to functionality.  The canvas is not always elastic.  Therefore, you need to use some additional techniques and designs to improve practical moments. </p><p>  A few tips on how to crochet a headband so that the product holds well and fits easily: </p><ul><li>  For good fixation on the head, you need to sew a wide elastic band between the ends of the product. </li><li>  You can add a thin elastic band to the thread, then the knitting is immediately formed in such a way as to stretch later. </li><li>  Sew ribbons or laces to the edges.  By tying the elements on the bow, you can adjust the degree of tightness and the position of the bandage. </li></ul><div class="photo" data-original="makeanddocrew.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="functional element" class="if uuid-3202811" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3202811.jpg"></div><p>  You can modify the standard options, combine several devices at once. </p><h2>  Preliminary preparation and step-by-step manufacturing instructions </h2><p>  Before you crochet a bandage on your head, you need to determine the basic steps of work.  A well-planned algorithm will especially help beginner needlewomen: </p><ol><li>  Prepare yarn, crochet hook and other decoration materials. </li><li>  It is necessary to measure the volume of the head. </li><li>  Choose a pattern and design for the dressing. </li><li>  Knit a few test centimeters to determine the density of the resulting fabric. </li><li>  Tie several rows and try on the workpiece. </li><li>  Sew and finish the finished product. </li></ol><p>  If you follow all the stages of creation, then the dressing will be perfect.  So, the finished work will not have to be redone. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow" style="display: none;"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  The simplest version of a headband for a girl: principles of decoration </h2><p>  You can crochet a headband for the girl using the simplest pattern.  This is a single crochet, more productive and in terms of speed of creation.  Features of manufacturing a simple dressing: </p><ol><li>  Dial a chain of air loops, controlling the length of the element along the ruler. </li><li>  To the number of loops that determine the girth of the product, add another 2 - they will be the basis for raising the pattern. </li><li>  Crochet the crochet thread.  Next, knit a crochet without touching the draped part of the yarn.  Then knit in the same way the yarn and the first loop. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.dmc.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="simple headband with ears" class="if uuid-3202812" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3202812.jpg"></div><p>  Next, continue knitting in this way.  The final chord will remain decoration.  You can tie the ears, like a cat, and sew them on the finished cloth bandages.  In the same way, the muzzle of any animal is formed. </p><h2>  Turbaned Headband </h2><p>  You can crochet a headband for a woman.  First, you should choose an original design that will be unique in design, but simple in terms of execution.  This option is a turban bandage: </p><ol><li>  First dial 18 chain stitches.  Knit with a crochet 13 rows. </li><li>  Only knit the next 20 rows with a pattern of 9 loops out of 17. At the end, extend the last loop as much as possible, begin work on the second strip. </li><li>  Form a loop from the auxiliary thread in the first column of the part that was left without knitting. </li><li>  Next, 20 rows are formed using double tables.  Get the second lane.  Fasten the thread at the end. </li><li>  Cross the bifurcated strips and continue knitting with the loop extended in the first part. </li><li>  Bind with a crochet a minimum of 15 more rows.  Sew the ends of the product. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="theeasydesign.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="crochet turban" class="if uuid-3202805" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3202805.jpg"></div><p>  In the same way, you can crochet a headband for the baby.  The center of the binding of strips is preferably decorated with a small brooch or embroidery.  Such an element will give the headdress more proximity to the eastern style. </p><h2>  Original headband pattern </h2><p>  If the main function of the dressing is decorative - that is, to hold the hair so that it does not fit into the face - then it is advisable to use cotton thread for the manufacture.  Next, you can choose an interesting pattern.  For example, use patterns for frills and lace. </p><p>  We offer a version of how to crochet a beautiful headband with further decoration with a satin ribbon: </p><ol><li>  First, prepare a chain of air loops in accordance with the girth of the head. </li><li>  The second row is a single crochet. </li><li>  At the beginning of the third - to form 3 air loops.  Tie a double crochet in each third loop of the previous row.  Then 2 airs and again a double crochet in the third.  So knit to the end of the row. </li><li>  Then again a number of ordinary columns. </li><li>  5 row: 3 air loops and knit a half-column.  To retreat 2 loops and knit 3 more air loops and a half-column. </li><li>  5 crochet stitches in the first arch, then a single crochet in the next arch.  In this way, alternate the pattern to the end of the row.  Finish work and cut the thread. </li><li>  Form the second (symmetrical) part of the dressing according to the same pattern. </li></ol><div class="photo" data-original="www.etsy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cotton bandage for summer" class="if uuid-3202816" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3202816.jpg"></div><p>  When the product is completely ready, it is worth stretching the satin ribbon through the formed holes in the middle of the strip.  A textile part can serve as a volume regulator if you tie it to a bow with each donning. </p><h2>  Features of making a warm headband </h2><p>  Women whose daughters do not like to wear a hat in winter are interested in the question of how to crochet a warm headband.  The answer is quite simple.  For the manufacture of this version of the product, you can choose any thread.  It is advisable to use natural: wool, wool mixture, mohair. </p><p>  Next, a pattern is selected.  To make the product as dense as possible and not let the cold pass, you should choose a standard single crochet column that will alternate with some openwork version. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="warm fleece lining" class="if uuid-3202819" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/74484/3202819.jpg"></div><p>  So that the yarn does not prick, does not irritate the scalp, it is worth sewing on the wrong side a strip of fleece.  This will insulate the bandage and additionally make the base more comfortable and cozy.  You can decorate the canvas with a brooch, embroidery, applique from fabric. </p>
