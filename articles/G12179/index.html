A true oasis of greenery with flowering vegetation, beautiful ponds, trees and palm trees.  It is not surprising that this place is loved by different birds, which have become almost tame here. </p><p>  Many are happy to talk about the local beach.  He's gorgeous here.  But without deckchairs, because the zone is reserved, because turtles lay their eggs here.  But there is straw bedding, this is no worse.  Even here, in the midst of the season, ‚Äúinfluxes‚Äù of burning jellyfish and plankton often occur.  This resort guests are warned by putting a red flag on the beach.  If someone decides to swim, then you can get burned.  This is not fatal, plus everything on the beach has lifeguards with special medications that relieve pain 15 minutes after application.  But it‚Äôs better not to risk it. </p><p>  The atmosphere in the hotel is excellent, the staff is the same.  Quality cleaning, daily, as well as the replacement of towels.  Regularly replenish stocks of shampoos, gels, conditioners, lotions and other cosmetics.  Anyway, the guests here are treated with respect, because if you need something, you just need to contact the reception.  By the way, some workers here know a little Russian language - this is what the guests who were here on vacation assure. </p><p>  In general, if you want to enjoy an unforgettable vacation, then you should go to Centara Grand West Sands Resort Villas Phuket 5 * (Thailand, Phuket Island).  A sea of ‚Äã‚Äãimpressions and emotions is guaranteed. </p>
