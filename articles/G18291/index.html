This proposal appeared in Russia recently.  But now plastic is causing considerable interest among the population.  Therefore, you need to understand what kind of credit card it is.  What are the pros and cons of it?  How to order "Conscience"?  What is the catch of using plastic? </p><h2>  Short description </h2><p>  First, let's figure out what we will deal with.  Reviews on the "Conscience" installment card indicate that this plastic is used as a regular credit card.  But it does not provide for the collection of interest on purchases. </p>

    <p>  An interest-free loan is what the Conscience card offers its customers.  Buying on loan without overpayments?  Now it is possible!  But is everything as good as it seems? </p><h2>  About clearance </h2><p>  Reviews about the interest-free installment plan "Conscience" leave different consumers.  Among them are both positive and negative. </p><p>  Previously, people emphasized that plastic can only be used in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  But since the spring of 2017, Conscience began to be issued throughout the country.  And this cannot but rejoice. </p><p>  It is proposed to issue plastic: </p><ul><li>  on the internet; </li><li>  personally at special points (for example, in the Svyaznoy store). </li></ul><p>  Everything is extremely simple and clear.  Even a student will be able to cope with the design of the "Conscience" installment card.  Reviews often emphasize that filing an application is the simplest thing.  Further, the situation may radically change. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Steps to use </h2><p>  The thing is that in order to use the Conscience card you will have to follow certain instructions.  You will need to activate the plastic.  Without this, they are forbidden to pay.  The transaction simply will not work. </p><p>  In general, the process of obtaining a Conscience card looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Application for issuing plastic. </li><li>  Confirmation of an order. </li><li>  Getting a card. </li><li>  Document activation. </li><li>  Making the first purchase using a card. </li></ol><p>  Only after that, all the possibilities of the Qiwi "Conscience" installment card will be revealed to the client.  Reviews emphasize that activation often causes problems.  That is, they bring plastic, but they can‚Äôt use it.  And such complaints are not so rare. </p><h2>  Online order </h2><p>  Now a few words about how to order the studied plastic.  Without this operation, using Conscience is not possible.  Therefore, you have to spend a little time. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="conscience interest-free installment card reviews" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/26435/2059569.jpg"></div>

    <div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Reviews on the "Conscience" installment card emphasize that it is most convenient to order it online.  Kiwi offers a free courier service that attracts people.  Without leaving your home, you will get a credit card without interest rates! </p><p>  The ordering guide looks like this: </p><ol><li>  Go to the site "Conscience.ru".  The installment card reviews refer to the fact that you can open the sovest.com page in your browser.  The user will automatically be redirected to the site with the appropriate offer. </li><li>  Click on the "Issue / Get Card" button. </li><li>  Fill out an application.  It will require you to write your income, personal data and telephone for communication. </li><li>  Click on Continue or Send Request. </li><li>  Wait for the operator to call.  With it you can discuss the features of delivery. </li></ol><p>  That's all.  Now it remains only to wait until the courier brings plastic.  It will be packed in a special envelope.  On average, delivery takes several days.  Reviews on the "Conscience" installment card are therefore not the best.  Many say that the delivery of plastic is too long. </p><h2>  Independently </h2><p>  It is preferable to order the card on your own at Qiwi dealerships.  Today, such services are provided by the Svyaznoy and Geobank networks. </p>

    <p>  To order Conscience plastic, you need: </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><ol><li>  Prepare documents - passport, statement, income statement. </li><li>  Contact any office of Svyaznoy or Geobank. </li><li>  Inform employees about their intentions. </li><li>  Give a statement. </li><li>  Get a bank card on hand. </li></ol><p>  If you believe the numerous reviews, then the plastic will be issued instantly.  And only occasionally have to wait a few days.  Everything is much simpler than it sounds! </p><h2>  About activation </h2><p>  Reviews on the "Conscience" installment card often emphasize problems with activating the plastic.  The process itself is simple to madness - you need to send 16 digits engraved on the received credit card in an SMS message.  The letter is sent to 5152. In response, the PIN arrives, using which you can make your first purchase. </p><p>  Unfortunately, activation is an offer vulnerability.  Often the operation is denied.  This happens for various reasons.  No one is safe from failures.  Most often, such situations are the result of systemic failures or bad credit history, the presence of debts. </p><p>  Can they refuse to activate plastic just like that?  Easily.  Qiwi has the right to refuse service of cards without explanation of its behavior.  Fortunately, this is a huge rarity. </p><h2>  Customer Inquiries </h2><p>  We figured out how to get a Conscience installment credit card.  Terms of use will be presented later.  First, find out what criteria a client should meet.  Or is plastic given out to everyone? </p><p>  Nearly.  The main thing is for a citizen to meet the following criteria: </p><ul><li>  citizenship of the Russian Federation; </li><li>  age not less than 18 years; </li><li>  availability of stable income (official); </li><li>  good credit history; </li><li>  no outstanding loans or delinquencies. </li></ul><p>  A conscientious and responsible person will not have problems with the design and activation of plastic.  The exception is cases in which the applicant is a foreigner.  Today in Russia, Conscience cards are issued only to Russian citizens.  But do not exclude that very soon this plastic will be available to everyone. </p>

    <p>  What other reviews are there about the approval of Conscience installment cards?  With a bad credit history, it will be issued to the client, but they will not be allowed to activate.  Therefore, anyone can order a card, but they can only use it if the above conditions are met. </p><h2>  Card Offers </h2><p>  What opportunities does the Conscience installment card offer?  Reviews of this plastic emphasize that the terms of use of the offer at first glance seem attractive. </p><p>  Service Features: </p><ul><li>  free courier delivery in the city; </li><li>  free registration of plastic; </li><li>  free SMS informant; </li><li>  card validity period - 5 years; </li><li>  early repayment of debt - possibly without fines; </li><li>  installment period - variable, maximum 12 months; </li><li>  limits - 5-300 thousand rubles; </li><li>  lending interest rate - 0%; </li><li>  late payment penalty - 10% per annum and 290 rubles for each month of non-payment; </li><li>  1st year of service - 290 rubles; </li><li>  subsequent years of the content of the card - 590 rubles; </li><li>  balance replenishment - no commission. </li></ul><p>  It would seem that all this makes an ideal plastic out of an interest-free installment plan "Conscience".  But actually it is not.  What is the main catch of the offer? </p><h2>  About the tricks </h2><p>  Reviews on the "Conscience" installment card refer to the fact that you can not use plastic everywhere.  It is offered to pay with its help exclusively in Qiwi partner stores.  The card will not work in other retail outlets. </p>

    <p>  In addition, a credit card will not work to withdraw money.  "Conscience" provides only cashless payments.  And cash at ATMs through it is not withdrawn under any circumstances. </p><h2>  Where to use </h2><p>  Reviews on the "Conscience" installment card in St. Petersburg and in other regions of Russia emphasize that purchases can only be made in specific stores.  Every month, Qiwi partners working with credit cards are becoming more and more. </p><p>  Among these companies distinguish: </p><ul><li>  Aeroflot; </li><li>  LitRes; </li><li>  "Daughters and sons"; </li><li>  Lego </li><li>  "Ile de Beaute"; </li><li>  "El Dorado"; </li><li>  Kari </li><li>  YulMart; </li><li>  "M Video"; </li><li>  LaModa; </li><li>  "Burger King"; </li><li>  "Platypus". </li></ul><p>  In total, Kiwi has more than 40 partners.  A complete list of them for a particular region can be seen on sovest.ru in the "Where to Buy" section.  All stores that accept Conscience without any problems are listed here. </p><h2>  conclusions </h2><p>  We figured out what constitutes the studied plastic.  He receives different reviews - both good and not very.  Someone is delighted with Conscience service.  Such people usually say that plastic really helps to buy and not overpay.  The main thing is that the loan does not have delinquencies. </p>

    <p>  There are those who are disappointed.  Among these clients, people with a bad credit history are usually distinguished.  They, as already mentioned, will be given plastic, but they will not activate it.  In addition, some people leave reviews about the ‚ÄúConscience‚Äù installment card of a negative type for rudeness of couriers and for the fact that this is not universal plastic. </p><p>  It is recommended to purchase it for people with high income.  After all, if you believe the reviews, then the limit on Conscience cards is offered depending on the level of salary.  Many issued cards allowing them to spend only 10-15 thousand rubles.  This is very small.  I had to re-release plastic several times. </p><p>  In any case, Conscience is not a scam.  Given all the nuances listed above, there will be no problems using plastic. </p>
