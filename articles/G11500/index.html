    <h2>  Oukitel C4 </h2><p>  Oukitel C4 offers you ‚ÄúAndroid 6‚Äù with a 5-inch HD display and runs on a 1.3 GHz MTK6737 QuadCore processor.

To capture any interesting moment in your life, the phone has a 5.0 MP rear camera + 2.0 MP front camera.  The device also has several useful sensors - a G-sensor, proximity and light. </p><h2>  Blackview BV2000 </h2><p>  The rating of smartphones up to 5,000 rubles will be incomplete without a review of Blackview devices.  This brand is recognized as one of the most famous phone manufacturers in China.  Blackview BV2000 is a budget device from this brand.  The phone is available in several colors (such as Standard Gray, Pearl Pink, Sky blue, Apple Green and Pear White).  In addition to the variety of appearance, the device has pretty good characteristics: Android 6.0, MTK6735 64-bit QuadCore 1.0GHz, HD-screen, 1 GB RAM and 8 GB ROM.  The internal memory can also be expanded up to 64 GB using a micro SD card. </p><p>  The Blackview BV2000 also offers you a 2.0 MP front camera and a 5.0 MP rear camera, equipped with a G-sensor and ambient light and proximity sensors. </p><h2>  DOOGEE X5 Pro </h2><p>  DOOGEE manufacturer has some great mobile phones sold worldwide.  However, this brand also offers inexpensive smartphones from 4g to 5,000 rubles, such as the DOOGEE X5 Pro.  This device has a nice design and good configuration.  The phone runs on Android 5.1 simultaneously with a 64-bit MTK6735 processor (quad-core) and has 16 GB of internal memory.  This smartphone offers you a 5-inch IPS HD screen for viewing photos and videos that you can shoot with a 5.0 MP rear-facing camera and a 2.0 MP front-facing camera. </p><p>  In addition to the above, the X5 Pro configuration also offers you long battery life, capable of providing you 680 minutes of talk time and 72 hours of standby time.  Thus, this is a smartphone with a good battery up to 5000 rubles. </p><h2>  BLU R1 HD </h2><p>  If your budget is very limited, you can purchase the BLU R1 HD.  This phone has many nice options, and at the same time it has a solid case, nice design and good build quality.  According to user reviews, it also has decent performance and a useful software package. </p><p>  The device has a 5.0-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1280x720 and a density of 294ppi.  It is also equipped with a 1.3GHz <span>MediaTek MT6735 processor</span> (quad) with 1 GB of RAM (there is a modification with 2 GB).  The size of the internal memory is 8 or 16 GB, it can be expanded via micro-SD up to 64 GB.  The device has two cameras (8 megapixel rear, 5 megapixel front).  The battery of the device is non-removable, its capacity is 2500 mAh.  BLU R1 HD runs on Android 6. </p><p>  If you want to buy something even cheaper than R1 HD, this manufacturer can offer you such an option.  A BLU Advance 5.0 HD smartphone costs less and at the same time offers Dual-SIM (the ability to use two SIM cards), as well as a good set of specifications (taking into account the price).  It also has an attractive design and size that allows the device to fit in one hand. </p><h2>  ZTE ZMAX Pro </h2><p>  Owning an affordable phone no longer means that you get a simple ‚Äúdialer‚Äù.  ZTE ZMAX Pro gives you a new chance.  You get a device with the dimensions of a tablet, which includes options previously considered the functions of a premium smartphone.  For example, it has a fingerprint scanner.  Thanks to such characteristics, this device leads the top smartphones up to 5,000 rubles. </p><p>  Among the disadvantages of the device, one can note only a not too bright image on the screen and overly pronounced effects of shooting cameras. Again, these details can be ignored due to the price category of the device.  In the end, this is a decent phone if you have a limited budget, because its specifications are quite powerful.  So, the phone has a Snapdragon 617 processor with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal (which can be expanded to 128 GB).  The smartphone is equipped with a 6.0-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 and a density of 367ppi, and works on Android 6.0.  The device has two cameras (13 MP rear, and also 5 MP front).  There is a rather powerful, but non-removable battery with a capacity of 3,500 mAh. </p><h2>  Moto G4 Play </h2><p>  The Moto G series is heavily trending towards affordable, but powerful smartphones.  In the 4th generation, the model range was divided into several categories, and the cost of some devices now starts at 9,000 rubles. </p><p>  The cheapest smartphone on this line is the G4 Play.  Despite the fact that its cost is slightly more than 5000 rubles, you get a multifunctional device, which in its characteristics is not inferior to more expensive devices, but in some ways overtakes them. </p><p>  The phone runs on a <span>Snapdragon 410 processor</span> with 2 GB of RAM.  Other key features of the device include a 5-inch HD display, an 8-megapixel rear camera and a removable 2800 mAh battery. </p><p>  The smartphone has a pre-installed Android 6.0.1Marshmallow platform, and the amount of memory for storing data in it is 8 or 16 GB of memory, which can be expanded using microSD up to 256 GB. </p><h2>  Final word </h2><p>  All smartphones that were mentioned in this article (with the exception of the last one) are the latest devices with modern functionality, the cost of which is less than 5,000 rubles.  This is not surprising, since phones are becoming more ordinary and everyday, which could not but lead to a sharp drop in prices.  Of course, the device, which costs so little, still has some drawbacks or does not have some useful features, but the availability of a smartphone today may surprise. </p><p>  In addition, you can always buy a used smartphone in excellent condition, but with a significantly lower price. </p><p>  It is worth remembering that often gadgets are cheaper if they are purchased on foreign trading floors.  Moreover, this is true not only for Chinese online stores, but also for the American services "Ibei" and "Amazon." </p>
