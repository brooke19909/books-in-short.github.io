    <p>  People who really want to have a good time, do not interfere with the cold season and snowy weather in the Crimea.  In winter, you can also have fun and have a great rest. </p><p>  On the peninsula for many centuries people of different nationalities, religions and mentalities have coexisted.  The indigenous inhabitants of this territory were Taurus.  The Greeks had a significant impact on the culture of this region.  The ruins of ancient architecture are still preserved here.  For some time the Romans, Bulgarians, Armenians and Slavic neighbors lived here. </p><p>  In 1475, the Turks conquered the land, and Ottoman rule was established on the peninsula.  Since the middle of the 18th century, during the war, the territory passed to Russia. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Imperial period </h2><p>  The development of the coast as a health resort began in the 19th century.  It was during this period that transport links were established between different regions of the country.  The railway contributed to the flow of people wishing to heal by the sea.  So the resort direction began to develop.  Then practically no one visited Crimea in the winter.  Here only in the summer season could offer entertainment. </p>

Summer estates were built for nobles, some of which remained to our time.  Today, these structures are the historical face of the peninsula.  They are open to tourists in the winter.

    <p>  In the tsarist period, resorts were made from the territory on which the forests grew, they exist there now.  Crimea was beautiful in winter, but the rich visited the peninsula only in the warm season. </p><p>  Due to the reforms of the new government, the local Tatars were forced to leave the land.  The peninsula received a new influx of tourists after the construction of the royal residence of the Livadia Palace here. </p><h2>  Transition from decline to prosperity </h2><p>  A new stage began under the Soviet regime.  Tourism immediately developed in several directions.  People organized hiking in the mountains, medical institutions and children's camps began to work.  There are a lot of hotels with different prices for rooms. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  After the strengthening of Soviet power, the Crimea became the main health resort of the Union.  In winter, resorts were closed, but in summer people from all republics gathered here.  Scientists estimate that in 1988, more than 8 million tourists rested on the Black Sea coast. </p>

    <p>  After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the number of vacationers who could afford a ticket to the peninsula fell sharply.  If before 20% of travelers came to the resort for free (the state paid for accommodation), then after 1991 a spontaneous flow of people increased.  But it was during this period that other places began to expand that the Soviet government ignored.  They were discovered by the "savages." </p><p>  It should also be noted that <span>holidays in the Crimea</span> in winter became popular. </p><h2>  Secret of relief </h2><p>  For true lovers of outdoor activities, the peninsula is open year-round.  Contribute to the flow of tourists weather conditions. </p><p>  The land area is more than 26,000 km¬≤.  On such a small territory, scientists distinguish 3 large and about 20 small climatic regions.  The researchers explain this diversity by the fact that the land is washed by two seas: Black and Azov.  The coastline extends over 2500 km.  The relief also plays a role in weather conditions.  Almost 70% of the territory is in the plains, 20% is on the mountain surface, the rest is in water bodies.  Weather in the Crimea in winter, of course, is associated with all these factors. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div>

    <p>  If the air temperature and precipitation in summer are the same for the entire peninsula, then in the colder months the forecast for different climatic regions varies enormously.  For example, in July, the temperature difference between south and north can be 1 ¬∞ C, while in January these indicators differ by 11 degrees. </p><h2>  Cool weather </h2><p>  A ridge plays a large role in this process, which becomes a kind of shield that protects the island from continental cold and dry winds.  What is the winter in Crimea?  The south is more like a Mediterranean country. </p><p>  The cold season is mild.  The lowest temperature is recorded, of course, on the tops of the mountains.  There the indicator sometimes reaches -5 ...- 6 ¬∞ C.  In turn, in the steppe zone it does not fall below -3 ¬∞ C. </p><p>  The warmest part of the peninsula was recognized as the Miskhor zone.  This territory is surrounded on the one hand by the Black Sea, and on the other - Mount Ai-Petri.  Here, even in the first month of the year, the average indicator reaches +5 ¬∞ C.  Every time severe colds cause significant damage to this territory.  Unique plants that are the pride of many gardens freeze over. </p><h2>  Spring instead of frost </h2><p>  The average winter temperature in Crimea (in its southern part) is +2 ... + 4 ¬∞ C.  In the steppe zone, the indicator is lower by 3-4 divisions.  The most severe colds that can catch you in this area are -6-8 ¬∞ C.  But such frosts rage only at night, and in the daytime, indicators increase.  Usually, even in winter, the peninsula has a plus temperature (+10 ... + 15 ¬∞ C).  The scientists registered an absolute minimum in the village of Klepinino, in the steppe zone.  There, the thermometer mark once dropped to -30 ¬∞ C. </p>

    <p>  Winter holidays are celebrated here - Christmas, New Year.  In Crimea, they spend their holidays cheerfully and profitably. </p><p>  Tourists who rested on the peninsula in winter know another advantage.  When the season ends, many inexpensive, but good travel agencies continue to work.  If it‚Äôs not easy to use the services of professionals in the summer months, then in the cold season they have a lot of free time, and the prices are much lower. </p><h2>  Winter is time for thought </h2><p>  At the height of the holiday season, the crowd heads to the beaches.  But in the winter Crimea also has a positive effect on the body.  Healing fresh air will not only improve your health, but also set your mind in a positive mood.  At this time of year, as noted by travelers, here you can relax from the noise of the city and concentrate on creative work.

All of them leave good feedback about winter sports.  Guests note that the amount for the equipment is low, and the inventory is almost new. </p><h2>  Minor cons </h2><p>  Along with positive reviews, there is criticism.  Parents note that kindergartens do not work at hotels and bases, where the crumbs could have fun while adults agree on tours.

Therefore, you have to look for entertainment on your own. </p><p>  For people who love a relaxing holiday, they offer walking tours to the Crimean caves.  What could be better than walking through a snowy forest?  Groups are usually small, so the guide manages to answer everyone's questions.
