Researchers have found that it was erected around the second century AD in the southern part of the bay.  Apparently, at that time it served as a lighthouse or served as a reliable bulwark for defense. </p><h2>  Description </h2><p>  Hydyrlyk tower looks like a massive and huge drum, which is located on a square base.  Most likely, this building was built in the Hellenistic period.  The total height of the building itself is about thirteen and a half meters. </p><p>  When describing the Hydyrlyk tower, it should be noted that the entrance is located in the eastern facade, where there is a special door.  From there, from the small hall you can get to the upper floor through a narrow staircase.  If you believe the descriptions that have come down to our time, earlier the tower had a gabled roof.  Presumably, it was demolished during the existence of the Byzantine Empire. </p><p>  Currently, a huge stone square block is located inside the tower of Khidirlyk.  In this regard, some historians suggest that in previous centuries this place could be used as a tomb. </p><h2>  Location </h2><p>  The Hydyrlyk tower is located in the southeastern part of the Kaleichi quarter.  This is one of the districts of the port and resort city of Antalya in the very south of Turkey, spread on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  The construction stands right on the border of Karaalioglu Park. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="36.8812398" data-lng="30.703581799999938" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/1/1/6/9/11169.png"></div><p>  This is one of the most famous attractions in the region, annually it is visited by about three hundred thousand tourists.  Her exact address is: Kƒ±lƒ±n√ßarslan Mh.  07100 Antalya, Turkey.  Now we‚Äôll tell you how to get to the Hydyrlyk tower. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  There are several options for seeing this attraction in the historic Kaleici district.  You can take a bus from the airport or train station.  Route 600 or 600a is required.  Get off at the Sarampol Caddesi stop, and from there you should go one block in the direction of Kaleici.  The fare in public transport will be 1.7 Turkish lira (20 rubles). </p><p>  If you are already in the oldest quarter of Antalya, then follow Hesap√ßi sokak.  You should go towards the sea for about ten minutes.  The tower will be at the very end of the street, on the waterfront. </p><p>  Being in Antalya itself, you can get to the sights by taking a tram or bus to Karaalioglu Park.  As an alternative - dolmysh (local public transport, which will most correctly be compared with our fixed-route taxis).  The fare on it will be from one to one and a half Turkish liras (11-17 rubles). </p><p>  Finally, the most comfortable option is to order a taxi.  By the way, do not forget that it is customary to bargain with everyone here, including taxi drivers.  During the trip, if you do it skillfully, you can significantly reduce the price. </p><h2>  Appearance story </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaleicioldtown.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Date of foundation of the Hydyrlyk tower" class="if uuid-2942978" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2942978.jpg"></div><p>  The founding date of the Hydyrlyk tower dates back to the second century AD, when the Romans dominated in these parts.  However, until now, archaeologists and historians have not been able to establish the exact purpose of the building.  We already told the main versions, now we will dwell on them in more detail. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Some researchers believe that the Hydyrlyk tower in Antalya is a lighthouse.  Ships that entered the bay were guided by its light.  In support of this version, the fact is that the tower is clearly visible from the sea, so in reality it can serve as a good landmark. </p><p>  According to other historians, it was a defensive structure.  This conclusion is due to the very type of structure, as well as the impressive thickness of its walls.  It is believed that it could be a fortress or a real bastion that protected the ancient city from attacks from the sea.  In those centuries, raids on neighboring settlements and even states were very common. </p><h2>  Ancient tomb </h2><div class="photo" data-original="turkisharchaeonews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Description of the Hydyrlyk tower" class="if uuid-2942975" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2942975.jpg"></div><p>  According to another version, which appeared relatively recently, it was a tomb or a certain tomb.  The researchers came to this conclusion by studying the architecture of the structure.  The Romans erected structures of this kind for mausoleums and tombs (outwardly, it strongly resembles the Roman basilica in shape).  For example, it could be a tomb for some major Roman official or his entire family. </p><p>  In particular, scientists came to this conclusion after they discovered on the territory of the tower itself an impressive block that has a square shape and is located inside the hall.  Presumably, it can weigh several tons. </p><p>  All this makes us once again amazed at the stubbornness and skill of the ancient builders who managed to implement such projects without modern technology.  At the same time, it is worth recognizing that the latest version has not yet received a single confirmation, since during excavations until now not a single burial site was found. </p><p>  It is believed that the tower could perform religious functions.  A large number of frescoes have been preserved on the walls inside Khidirlyk.  Today, several hundred tourists a day climb to its top to explore the surroundings from a kind of viewing platform. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.flickr.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hydyrlyk Tower in Antalya" class="if uuid-2942974" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2942974.jpg"></div><p>  If you are finding out what to see in Antalya, be sure to include this attraction in your list.  We‚Äôll clarify that the tower is located in the historical quarter of the city at the intersection of Khesapchi and Khidirlyk streets. </p><p>  In appearance and style, the structure is somewhat different from the rest of the architecture of Antalya, which seems more airy and neat.  At the same time, the attraction remains its striking feature, an example of ancient architecture, of which there are not so many on the planet.  The structure is made of huge stone blocks and large bricks of brown-reddish color. </p><h2>  Architecture features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.kaleicioldtown.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="History of the Hydyrlyk tower" class="if uuid-2942976" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2942976.jpg"></div><p>  The height of the building is about thirteen and a half meters.  The tower itself stands on a square base, while having a cylindrical shape.  Interestingly, the base was built much earlier than the tower itself.  In separate documentary sources and ancient manuscripts it was possible to find references to the fact that in previous centuries the tower was crowned with a pointed dome, but it has not survived to our time.  Presumably, it was deliberately destroyed during the existence of the Byzantine Empire. </p><p>  In the upper part of the tower today you can encounter restoration work that was carried out during the time of the Seljuks.  Passing through the door inside the stairs, you can climb to the top, where today the Turkish state flag flutters.  Here you can take a walk along the ramparts if you wish. </p><h2>  Modern features </h2><div class="photo" data-original="tr.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="How to get to the Hydyrlyk tower" class="if uuid-2942973" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2942973.jpg"></div><p>  It is interesting that in our time the tower is used not only as a tourist attraction, attracting a large number of tourists.  There is a chamber theater in which historical performances are staged. </p><p>  In the evenings, on the walls of the fortress include a backlight, which allows you to imagine what picture in ancient times was opened from here to the gaze of sailors who entered their bay on their ships. </p><h2>  Useful Tips </h2><div class="photo" data-original="turkisharchaeonews.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hydyrlyk tower architecture" class="if uuid-2942977" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2942977.jpg"></div><p>  When visiting this attraction, you should be especially careful on the stairs to the second floor.  It is very narrow with high steep steps.  So for security, you should stay closer to the wall and not rush. </p><p>  If you use a taxi, remember that Turkey has a nightly rate: from midnight to six in the morning, the cost of the trip doubles. </p><p>  Photographing the inhabitants of Turkey, especially women, is possible only with their permission.  If the representative of the fair sex wears a black cloak, it is strictly forbidden to remove it. </p>
