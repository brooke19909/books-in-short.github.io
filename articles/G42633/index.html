In this period, the Russians participated in two wars at once, in the same year Russia returned the previously conquered lands of Azov and its environs and was forced to sign an agreement that was not entirely beneficial for the country from a political and economic point of view. </p><p>  Many historians consider the Prut campaign a strategic mistake of Peter I. The forces were incorrectly calculated, and the campaign itself brought losses to the Russian land.  But to unambiguously interpret this historical fact is rather difficult.  Some believe that Peter simply had no choice after the ultimatum of the Ottoman Empire. </p><p>  What really happened in 1711? </p><div class="photo" data-original="vignette.wikia.nocookie.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prut agreement: failure or right decision" class="if uuid-2453735" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80901/2453735.jpg"></div><h2>  The Northern War and the Battle of Poltava </h2><p>  The Northern War is a twenty-year war between Sweden and the states of northern Europe for the possession of Baltic lands.  The war was fought from 1700 to 1721 and ended in the defeat of Sweden. </p><p>  Russia also participated in this war.  The outcome of the war was of great importance for the <span>territorial expansion of Russia</span> and the acquisition of Empire status. </p><p>  At the time the war began, Russia had only one access to the sea - the Arkhangelsk port.  And with the end of the war, she got access to the sea from the Neva Bay.  This made it possible in the future to set up trade and economic ties with Europe, to establish shipping transport lines. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Of decisive importance for the outcome of the war was the Battle of Poltava in 1709 near Poltava, which ended in the defeat of the Swedish army and led to the escape of Charles XII to the Ottoman Empire. </p><div class="photo" data-original="vignette.wikia.nocookie.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="portrait of Charles XII" class="if uuid-2453741" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80901/2453741.jpg"></div><h2>  The background of the Prut campaign </h2><p>  After <span>the Battle of Poltava,</span> Charles XII hid in the Ottoman Empire.  At the same time, Peter I concluded an agreement with the empire on the expulsion of Charles from Turkey.  But Ahmed III - the then ruler of the Ottoman Empire, violated the agreement, allowing Karl not only to stay, but also create a threat to Russia from the South.  It was important for Turkey to bring back Azov and its environs after the <span>Azov campaign of Peter I</span> and the conquest of Azov by Russia in 1965. </p><p>  At the threat of Peter the <span>war, Turkey</span> itself declared war on Russia. </p><div class="photo" data-original="images.interactives.dk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="North War" class="if uuid-2453728" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80901/2453728.jpg"></div><p>  In 1711 in the history of Russia there were two wars at once - with Sweden and with Turkey.  Turkey posed a threat to Russia from the southern borders by raids of the Crimean Tatars on the borders of Ukraine.  That is why Peter went on a campaign against Turkey to the Danube with the aim of raising uprisings of peoples subject to Turkey. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Prut campaign and its results </h2><p>  Peter I personally took part in the campaign, leaving the Senate he created to replace him.  The conditions were very unfavorable for the soldiers: unbearable heat, thirst, unsanitary conditions ... But the campaign continued. </p><p>  Peter preferred to act energetically and assertively in his usual manner.  The Russians crossed the Dniester and reached the Proust River.  The Turkish army came there and the Tatar troops allied to them pulled themselves together.  The Turkish side had a large quantitative advantage.  They completely surrounded the 38 thousandth Russian army. </p><p>  Despite this, the Russian army fought to the last, no one wanted to lose ground. </p><p>  Soldiers on both sides were exhausted by the harsh conditions of the campaign.  But both sides did not know about each other's similar situation. </p><p>  As a result of the confrontation, the Russians and Turks signed a peace treaty.  The Prut Treaty was signed on July 12, 1711.  In the history of Russia, this was important. </p><div class="photo" data-original="4.bp.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Prut battle" class="if uuid-2453726" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/80901/2453726.jpg"></div><h2>  Contents of the Prut Treaty </h2><p>  The terms of the Prut Agreement with Turkey consisted of the following clauses: </p><ul><li>  The Ottoman Empire received Azov back. </li><li>  Russia pledged to destroy the fortress in Taganrog and the fortress on the Dnieper. </li><li>  Russia pledged not to interfere in Poland’s policies and not to send troops there. </li><li>  Russia pledged not to support the Cossacks of Zaporozhye. </li></ul><p>  Both sides agreed that it is better for Russia to make peace with Sweden. </p><p>  At the same time, Russia was quite pleased with the terms of the agreement, despite the fact that it had lost its land and advantages that had previously been won through hard efforts. </p><p>  Thus, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Turkey in 1711 in the history of Russia made sense as a way to shift attention and efforts to Sweden.  As a result, peace with Sweden did not work out, and Russia took a more advantageous strategic position than before the war. </p>
