Hundreds of thousands of tourists from all over the world come here every year.  The length of the golden sandy beaches is about 15 km.  They are conditionally divided into 10 districts, which are divided into hundreds of private and municipal zones.  All of them are well maintained and are impeccably clean.  The resort has a well-developed tourist infrastructure.  There are many hotels of various categories, restaurants and cafes, dance floors, boutiques and shopping centers.  By the way, Rimini is also considered one of the major centers of shopping tourism, not only in Italy, but throughout South-Western Europe.  In addition, the city is famous for its historical heritage, and lovers of excursion programs here will find many interesting sights. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sole mio 3" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/611262.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Marebello Beach </h2><p>  As noted above, the coastline of Rimini is divided into 10 districts.  The most popular of these is Marebello.  In the resort area there are many comfortable hotels both deluxe and more modest and budget hotels, such as, for example, Sole Mio Marebello 3 *.  Many of the hotels are located along the beach line and overlook the sea.  As in all of <span>Rimini, the beaches of</span> Marebello are in excellent condition.  Some of them are municipal, and admission is free, but beach equipment (sun loungers, umbrellas, etc.) is provided for a fee.  However, such beaches are much less private, which mainly belong to a particular hotel.  And here the category of the hotel is absolutely not important.  So, for example, the Sole Mio 3 * hotel, despite its modest three stars, has its own beach, where only its guests can enter and use the amenities for free.  Everyone else has to pay for entry and everything else.  Marebello beach is also known for all kinds of holidays and festivals, competitions, dances and sports in futsal and beach volleyball, various master classes and <span>wine tastings of</span> local production.  And in the evenings, almost every day fireworks of extraordinary beauty are arranged here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  How to get </h2><p>  Not far from Rimini is the airport.  Federico Fellini, which receives international flights from many <span>cities in Italy</span> and other countries of the world.  From Moscow and other megacities of Russia to Rimini exclusively charter flights are carried out.  If you booked a room or purchased a tour to the Sole Mio 3 * hotel, then you can get there from the airport either by train, which leaves for the city every 30 minutes, or by bus.  The train fare is from 1-2 euros, but a bus ticket costs much more - about 13 euros.  We would advise you to use the bus, as the train station is located at a fairly large distance from this hotel. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="sole mio 3 rimini" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14155/611266.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Features of rest in Rimini </h2><p>  As already noted, Rimini is interesting for tourists both as a beach resort and as a shopping center.  In addition, lovers of educational tours are attracted here, since the city is rich in historical and architectural monuments.  However, Rimini, like most Italian cities, is interesting to gourmets.  <span>Gastronomic tours are</span> organized here <span>.</span>  The region of Emilia-Romagna, in which this resort town is located, is considered the birthplace of Parmesan cheese, as well as <span>Parma ham,</span> Mortadella sausage and balsamic vinegar.  And in the region, the production of the famous <span>Barilla pasta has been launched.</span>  Therefore, if you stayed at the Sole Mio 3 * hotel (Rimini), be sure to take the time to taste these products and dishes prepared from them.  By the way, in the city, in addition to traditional Italian restaurants, there are also many others where you can taste dishes of cuisines of other nations, for example, Russian, Indian, Japanese, etc. Lo Squero, Marinelli, Da Guido and others are considered the best restaurants in Rimini. In them, no matter what you ordered, they will serve you (for free) Piadina cakes.  Most of the hotels in this resort operate according to the “BB” or “HB” system, and rarely which - on an all-inclusive basis.  And this is only for tourists.  After all, with such a variety of catering points, it’s a sin not to take this opportunity and not to eat every day in different restaurants.  Of course, you can order dinner at the Sole Mio 3 * Hotel (Rimini) (breakfast is included in the price), however, guest reviews indicate that you will not wait for any special dishes here.  Therefore, try to spend the evenings somewhere in the city. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Hotel Sole Mio 3 *: general description </h2><p>  This small hotel was built at the end of the last century, but in 2010 it was thoroughly restored and glossed.
