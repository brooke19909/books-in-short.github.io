An experienced fisherman can always reliably combine different types of fishing line, <span>tie a hook</span> or other tackle. </p><p>  Very useful knowledge of the various sites for those who go fishing in the sea.  You need to know how to tie a knot so that it does not untie at the wrong time.  The ‚Äúbayonet‚Äù nodes allow you to create a non-retractable loop, they are very simple in execution, but strong and reliable enough. </p><h2>  Useful About Nodes </h2><p>  A knot is an old way of connecting one or more ropes.  This is due to weaving and tying the ‚Äúroot‚Äù and ‚Äúrunning‚Äù ends of the rope, fishing line or rope. </p><p>  The root end is that part of the cable that is fixed in a stationary state.  It is an unsecured part of the rope, with the help of which we get a certain knot. </p><p>  All nodes are usually divided into certain groups according to their purpose.  The bayonet assemblies are non-tightened.  Most often they are used in fishing and marine affairs. </p><h2>  Varieties </h2><p>  <em>Simple half-bayonet</em> </p><p>  Of the nodes that are not tightened, it is the <em>half-bayonet that</em> is the most simple to perform.  They do it this way: they wrap the running end around the support, then they braid it around the root end of the rope, as a result, the running end must be passed into the loop that has just been formed.  They complete the work with a safety unit, which is knitted with a running end. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bayonet nodes" class="if" height="252" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1646728.jpg" width="388"></div>

He can move to a support, but never drags on. </p><p>  <em>Simple bayonet</em> </p><p>  This node is obtained by combining two half-bayonets.  In this embodiment, the number of half-bayons should not exceed 3 - this will be enough, moreover, from a larger number of them, the knot strength will not become higher. </p><p>  In this case, the use of a safety harness is mandatory.  Bayonet assemblies are considered very reliable.  They are used when the rope needs to be fixed on a support for strong traction (towing a car or hovering). </p><p>  <em>Bayonet</em> </p><p>  The main difference between this unit and the previous one is the presence of a second barrier around the support.  The presence of a second gate will make the unit more reliable.  In this option, the use of a safety node is also necessary. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="knot bayonet how to knit" class="if" height="215" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1646752.jpg" width="568"></div>

    <p>  <em>Anchor knot (fishing bayonet)</em> </p><p>  It is this knot that sailors call the most reliable when fastening anchors to a rope.  This option is similar to the ‚Äúbayonet with a gate‚Äù assembly, but there is one significant difference.  The rope in the "fishing bayonet" is also pulled through a second additional hose that wraps around the support.  Even with strong traction, the sea knot ‚Äúfishing bayonet‚Äù does not tighten and holds very tightly. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  <em>Tourist bayonet</em> </p><p>  This name received the wrong (inverted) "bayonet".  Often it is tourists who use it. </p><h2>  Bayonet knot: how to knit </h2><p>  A ‚Äúsimple bayonet‚Äù is one of the simplest nodes that do not tighten.  To perform it correctly, it is necessary, starting from the back, to wrap the running end of the rope around the object.  Next, you need to wrap it around the root end once and pass it into the resulting loop.  The working end must again be carried over the main one, wrapped and brought out through the second loop formed. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="bayonet knot" class="if" height="202" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1646727.jpg" width="382"></div>

    <p>  Even if the root end of the rope is loaded, the bayonet assemblies will still not be tightened.  They can always be untied without removing the load from the root end. </p><h2>  How to tie a double bayonet </h2><p>  <span>The anchor knot</span> (also called the "double bayonet") is a vivid example of non-tightening knots, which has been popular with sailors since ancient times, and all thanks to reliability. </p><p>  Correctly, it can be done in this way: </p><ul><li>  the running end is pulled into the rear anchor ring; </li><li>  through this ring in the same direction the running end of the rope is pulled again; </li><li>  then this end is let out behind the root and is pulled through two newly formed loops; </li><li>  then the running end is pulled out behind the main one, and then - in front of it, and directed into the loop - in this way a half-bayonet is obtained; </li><li>  as a result, the knot is tightened, and the two ends of the rope are pulled together and secured with twine. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="double bayonet knot" class="if" height="264" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44175/1646726.jpg" width="414"></div></li></ul><h2>  Advice </h2><ol><li>  A ‚Äúsimple bayonet‚Äù is not recommended for use when tying a hook to a synthetic fishing line.  If the thrust is very large, the assembly will slip. </li><li>  A node called a ‚Äúbayonet with a gate‚Äù has a great advantage - it is quite simple to untie it.  Although it is not considered reliable, sailors and fishermen use it quite often. </li><li>  A double bayonet is a unit that is most often used for strong and reliable fastening of a cable with an anchor. </li><li>  It must be remembered that a properly knotted knot will never fail.  The advantage of all types of bayonet assembly is that they will never untie themselves when tensioned.  Moreover, if they were tied correctly, they are very easy to untie. </li></ol><p>  The bayonet knot and all its varieties are reliable and strong enough when the rope is tightly stretched.  If the load on the rope is variable, the knot may come loose.  Therefore, using one of the varieties of the ‚Äúbayonet‚Äù assembly, it is necessary to knit an additional safety assembly or fix the running end of the rope with twine or a thin cord. </p>
