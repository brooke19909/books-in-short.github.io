    <h2>  Why do banks make concessions </h2><p>  A few years ago, in order to get a credit card or a loan, you had to go through a complex process.  It included the collection and preparation of documents that confirm income, the search for guarantors and long lines.  Now everything is completely different. </p><p>  When the question arises of where you can get a credit card without inquiries, you just need to go online.  Applications are now being submitted online, so you can do this with a cup of hot coffee. </p><p>  Why has the procedure been simplified?  Perhaps this was prompted by growing competition among various financial institutions.  In order to attract new customers and retain old banks, they are doing everything possible to ensure that their services are the most profitable and convenient. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Service benefits </h2>

    <p>  It is hard to believe that there were representative offices of banks where you can quickly get a credit card without providing a huge amount of documents.  Consider the advantages of this service: </p><ol><li>  It is not required to collect additional income statements and other documents. </li><li>  No need to stand in line.  An application for a card can be issued online. </li><li>  Low interest rates. </li><li>  24/7 customer service. </li><li>  The ability to withdraw money anywhere in the world. </li><li>  The minimum age at which you can use the service is 18 years. </li></ol><p>  If you are looking for where to quickly get a credit card, then study the offers of several banks and choose the most beneficial for yourself. </p><h2>  but on the other hand </h2><p>  It is known that there are no ideal goods and services.  You can find your pitfalls in any field, banks are no exception.  It would seem that everything sounds so sweet, everywhere you can find tips on where to get a credit card quickly without inquiries.  Moreover, they give her away from the age of 18, no guarantors are needed.  Where is the catch? </p><p>  The risks of the bank are great, because the employees do not know if the client earns enough to repay the loan.  The disadvantage of the card issuance service without intermediaries and certificates can be found only one, but significant.  The level of trust in the client is low - this means that the bank will not be able to provide a large amount of money.  Only small loans for certain needs, if there is an urgent need.  In the event that a person repays a loan on time, a credit history begins to emerge from him.  Over time, trust grows as well, a person will be able to submit an application on his own so that the possible limit on loans is increased. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  If you are looking for a place to quickly issue a credit card, because a large sum of money is urgently needed, this service is not suitable for you. </p><h2>  How to get a credit card </h2>
