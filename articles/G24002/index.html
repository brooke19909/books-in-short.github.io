This is a ski resort that took its name from the nearby Levi Mountains.  Despite the popularity of the winter route, the resort is far from Helsinki, and it takes time to get to it. </p><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="67.78328720000002" data-lng="24.86782859999994" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="14"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/1/7/8/6/9/17869.png"></div><h2>  Short story </h2><p>  Few people know exactly where the Levi ski resort in Finland is located.  Many mistakenly consider the resort new.  As a tourist destination, the resort appeared in 1953 near the village of Sirkka and immediately gained popularity among the population not only of Finland, who considered a trip to Levi as their religion, but also to nearby and distant countries.  Active winter vacations and sports races became more and more popular.  And when the governing bodies of the nearby town of Kittila bought the land on the hillsides, there was simply a boom in popularity.  Already in the early seventies, active development of land began with equipped skiing areas and residential tourist complexes.  Levi ski resort has been awarded the prize more than once as the best winter resort in Finland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="girlvsglobe.com" data-author=": Sabina, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Levi slopes" class="if uuid-3235419" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235419.jpg"></div><h2>  Trails and infrastructure </h2><p>  The technical equipment of Levy is arranged at the highest level.  There are about 50 ski slopes alone, 15 of them can be skated even at night, as they are beautifully lit.  Twenty-seven lifts operate to facilitate lifting. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  All tracks can be used not only by professional athletes, but also by beginners, people who are just mastering this difficult sport - skiing.  For superprofessionals there are four routes of the most difficult level.  The maximum length of a professional track is 2500 meters, so if you are not confident in your abilities, do not risk your health and strengthen your sports skills on simpler tracks. </p><p>  The territory of the tourist complex has everything for a complete holiday.  In addition to the main ski runs on the territory there are several saunas in which you can warm up your muscles after an active holiday in the cold, you can rent a dog team and go on a short expedition to the surroundings.  Golf enthusiasts will find an upscale course that was built in 2009 at the foot of the mountain.  You can also ride on snow scooters, walk on snowshoes to the foot of the mountain.  After an active holiday, you can regain your strength in restaurants or cafes located throughout the Levi ski resort in Finland.  A peculiar attraction is the opportunity to marry in a snowy village. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.discoveringfinland.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="ski Track" class="if uuid-3235417" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235417.jpg"></div><h2>  Vacation with children </h2><p>  If you think that there is absolutely nothing for children to do in snowy Finland, you are completely behind the times.  Because the Levi ski resort in Finland is designed specifically for families with children. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  It‚Äôs worth starting with children's ski runs.  There are ten of them.  On each track instructors work, who carefully monitor how children observe safety rules, teach them to ski properly and brake.  Beginners are given skiing and snowboarding lessons.  Parents should not worry about the health and safety of children when they are under the supervision of instructors. </p><p>  Levi ski resort is famous throughout the country for one of the largest water parks.  It is located in one of the resort hotels under the name "Levitunturi".  There is where to take a walk, because not only children, but also adults - seventeen pools equipped with all kinds of water slides and carousels. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.co-operativeski.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="snowy village Levi" class="if uuid-3235423" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235423.jpg"></div><h2>  Hotels and cottages </h2><p>  The ski resort in Finland is also famous for its tourist residential complexes.  In addition to the usual hotels, you can choose apartments for living, an individual cottage near the mountainside.  There is also a budget housing.  There are several hostels and budget hotels on the territory that provide the necessary services several times cheaper than the premium segment.  This type of settlement is especially popular among students and youth companies who come to the resort to have fun.  The most popular hotels for tourists in a ski resort in Finland are the Levi Hotel Spa with a wide range of services, the Break Sokos Hotel Levi hotel, as well as the Lapland Hotel. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  When checking into a hotel or a detached cottage, be sure to notify the staff about things that you may need in the room and which are not in the standard list of household services.  For example, baby walkers or a changing table.  Thus, your vacation in Levi will be even more comfortable and memorable. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.snow-forecast.com" data-author=": Hank Barten, "><img itemprop="image" alt="Entertainment Levy" class="if uuid-3235424" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235424.jpg"></div><h2>  How to get there by plane </h2><p>  To get to the Levi ski resort, you can use one of the most convenient routes for you.  The easiest way, of course, is to buy a plane ticket.  From Moscow and St. Petersburg charter flights are made to the city of Kittil√§.  And having arrived in Kittil√§, it remains a stone's throw to Levy, because it is only fifteen kilometers from the airport.  You can also buy a plane ticket from Helsinki.  From the capital to Kittil - about a thousand kilometers, between Kittil and Moscow - about the same.  Therefore, it makes sense to save time on the road to spend it at the resort.  Unless, of course, you want to walk along Helsinki along the way. </p><h2>  Train ride </h2><p>  From Moscow to Finland can also be reached by rail, as flights are made regularly.  Unfortunately, there is no direct connection with Kittil√§ or Levy, so in Helsinki you need to change trains to the Finnish train that goes to the town of Kolari in Lapland. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.theglobetrottingteacher.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Helsinki-Levy train" class="if uuid-3235455" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235455.jpg"></div><p>  You will have to spend about twenty-five hours on the road.  Arriving in Kolari, you must take advantage of a pre-ordered transfer or the services of private carriers.  The distance from Kolari to Levi is approximately one hundred kilometers.  In two hours you will be in the province of Lappi. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.skiline.co.uk" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="climb the mountain" class="if uuid-3235426" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235426.jpg"></div><h2>  Bus from St. Petersburg </h2><p>  The most popular and inexpensive way to get to Finland is by bus.  For many, the word "bus" is associated with uncomfortable seats and an unpleasant smell of gasoline, so this option does not immediately find well-wishers.  However, tourist bus services are particularly comfortable and soft.  They are sent from St. Petersburg. </p><p>  A bus to Finland from St. Petersburg has a lot of advantages.  In addition to comfortable armchairs and multimedia accompaniment, there is a toilet in the cabin and, in some cases, a refrigerator in which you can store drinks or perishable foods on the go.  Tourists are accompanied by an experienced guide who will tell you about the sights encountered on the way. </p><p>  It is impossible to get directly to the Levi ski resort directly by bus.  A distance of approximately 1,200 kilometers is difficult to overcome in a short time.  Therefore, the main bus stop to Finland from St. Petersburg will be the capital - Helsinki.  From there, a charter flight delivers tourists to Kittil√§ in an hour.  By lunchtime, staff are already checking in at the hotel.  The cost of a bus trip varies from $ 400 to $ 800 round trip. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.ruka.fi" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="bus to Levi" class="if uuid-3235449" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/111133/3235449.jpg"></div><h2>  Tourists reviews </h2><p>  Guests who have already tried their hand in the snowy Finnish region, say that this is one of the few places where you can really relax with children.  For children there are not only entertaining playgrounds, slides and pools, but also real ski slopes with experienced instructors. </p><p>  Tourists pay special attention to the purity of nature and the ecology of the area.  In the modern world it is already quite difficult to find a place without smoking plants, but the Finnish side is surprising.  Silence, comfort, developed infrastructure and peace - that is what attracts people who want to disconnect from the bustling world. </p><p>  Some celebrate excellent cuisine based on Finnish traditions.  Of course, restaurants serve classic European or Asian dishes, but there is only one main gourmet tip - try the local cuisine. </p><p>  There are practically no shortcomings, except that before you get to the resort, you must overcome a long distance.  If you or your loved ones get sick on the road, be sure to bring along special pills or a patch. </p>
