    <h2>  General information </h2><p>  This charming city is located among the Czech-Moravian mountains and the Drahany Upland.  The first mention of the city dates back to the 9th century.  The settlement began to be built around the Spielberg fortress, which was erected to protect against attacks from the south.  Since 1243 it is considered a city.  For a long time, the city of Brno was the capital of the Duchy of Moravia, as well as an important commercial and cultural center. </p><h2>  Spielberg Castle </h2><p>  This ancient building, perhaps, can be called the most important attraction of the city.  It was erected on a high bank of the river, covering with itself a landscape extending further.  The fortress was built in the 13th century by the Czech king Przemysl Otakar II.  The castle was first mentioned in 1277, while it served as the residence of the famous Luxembourg family.  Blanca Valois (wife of Karel IV) lived here for a short time. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  However, the main purpose of the castle was strategic.  He defended the locals during the <span>Hussite wars,</span> as well as during the discord between the Hungarians and the Czech king Jiri.  Since the 15th century, interest in the castle has been declining.  Some time later, Spielberg came under the authority of Brno (Czech Republic).  True, after the rebellion of 1621, this defensive structure was confiscated and appointed an imperial fortress. </p><p>  The castle became famous in 1645 when it withstood a 4-month siege at the very end of the Thirty Years War.  The fortress was later restored.  In the 17-19 centuries, Spielberg was a prison, where many political prisoners, as well as especially cruel and dangerous criminals, were kept.  Those sentenced to life imprisonment were chained, feeding was very poor - they gave only 750 g of bread and a little water.  In such inhuman conditions, the prisoners died very quickly.  At present, there is a museum with an exposition of furniture, paintings and various antique pieces of furniture.  In the summer, various cultural events are often held in Spielberg: concerts, festivals, tournaments.  The fortress offers an excellent panoramic view of the city. </p>

    <h2>  Historical quarter </h2><p>  We continue our journey through the city of Brno, Czech Republic.  The sights of this settlement can also be explored in the historical quarter.  Of particular interest is the Central Square, where it is always noisy and crowded.  Here is a plague pillar, erected in 1689, with a statue of the Virgin Mary. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Further down Masarukova Street, if you turn into the small street Zametsnitska, you can see the Dominican church.  In this area there is also an ancient monastery (1230) and the Church of St. Michael (1659-1672). </p><h2>  Town Hall </h2><p>  To fully enjoy the amazing city of Brno (Czech Republic), you should visit the old town hall.  It was erected in the 13th century.  On the arch of the building you can see the "dragon".  As early as the beginning of the 16th century, one foreigner presented a scarecrow with a crocodile, which greatly affected the inhabitants of the city.  In this regard, the legend was born about the terrible "Brno" dragon, who lived in these places and ate the local merchants.  To kill the monster, people decided to build an unusual trap: quicklime was sewn into calfskin and left the bait on the shore.  The dragon, having swallowed its prey, began to feel very thirsty and went to a watering place.  As a result, the process of extinction began in his womb, from which the monster tore from the inside.  As a sign of victory over the dragon, the locals took his skin and hung it on the wall of the town hall. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof brno czech republic" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/395146.jpg?1399976363805" width="400"></div>

    <h2>  Zielni Square and other facilities </h2><p>  The city of Brno (Czech Republic) is a truly unique settlement with its own special flavor.  Near the town hall is a beautiful fountain that illustrates the battle of Cerberus with Heracles, as well as the plague pillar of the Holy Trinity.  Then you can admire the Cathedral of St. Paul and Peter.  It began to cost back in the 11th century, for many centuries it was rebuilt more than once, and received a modern appearance only in the 19th century.  Its main highlight is the statue of Our Lady (15th century). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Capuchin Monastery </h2><p>  Brno (Czech Republic) is also famous for the ancient Capuchin monastery.  In the center of the city is located at first glance the unremarkable Capuchin Square.  From here you can see part of the monastery - the Church of the Holy Cross, erected in the Baroque style.  The church itself is hidden from the eyes of the inhabitants.  <span>The Capuchin monks</span> led a rather modest, even ascetic, way of life.  And they settled in Brno in the 17th century. </p><p>  During the war, the monastery was destroyed by the Swedes, but soon a church was erected at this place: very modest on the outside and luxurious inside.  The monastery was later revived.  Thanks to the climate, all the people buried here turned into mummies.  The most daring tourists can go down to the underground labyrinths of the monastery and look at the remains of nobles and monks who have been in the church since the 18th century. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="city ‚Äã‚Äãof brno" class="if" height="300" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/15532/395139.jpg?1400017552136" width="400"></div>
