    <h2>  Price range </h2><p>  In short, it is worth telling about how much a week will cost in a studio apartment.  Prices depend on several factors: from the tour operator, season, as well as advance booking.  If you book a room long before the trip or a couple of days before check-in (if there will be free apartments, of course), then there is an option to get a discount. </p><p>  So, the most expensive studio will cost a single traveler.  A week with the all-inclusive service costs about 110,000 rubles.  For two guests rest will not cost much more - 115 thousand rubles.  It turns out ~ 57 thousand rubles.  per person.  But the most economical is the decision to rent an apartment for three.  A week in this case will cost 130,000 rubles.  This is about 43,000 per person.  However, you can pay less.  For three people, the same option will cost 77,000 rubles if they only book apartments, without breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Many do so, because the rooms have everything for cooking, and nearby - a lot of shops and convenience stores with groceries. </p><h2>  Larger apartments </h2><p>  Hotel Callisto Holiday Village 4 * (Ayia Napa, <span>Cyprus)</span> receives mostly positive <span>reviews</span> .  Largely due to its comfortable and cozy rooms.  The second option, which can be booked here, is an apartment with a separate bedroom and a living room.  In these rooms they are not divided into zones, as is the case with the studio, but exist separately.  These apartments are more spacious.  Their living area is 45 square meters.  m </p><p>  Maximum occupancy is 4 people.  The bedroom has two single beds, and in the living room there are as many folding sofas.  There is a balcony overlooking the garden, a bathroom, two TVs (one for each room), and everything else that is available to guests staying in the studio.  However, from the above photos you can see everything. </p>

    <h2>  Cost of apartments </h2><p>  The left reviews about the Callisto Holiday Village 4 * hotel (Ayia Napa) often mention that this hotel, in principle, offers fairly modest prices.  Given, of course, her stardom.  Well, how much does the mentioned apartment cost?  For example, again, you can take a weekly stay. </p><p>  One guest for 7 nights in such a spacious apartment will have to pay 120,000 rubles (again, with the all-inclusive service).  As in the previous case, it is more profitable to rent a room for two.  Because the price will be the same, but the ‚Äúcheck‚Äù will be divided into 2 guests.  For three guests, the price will be approximately 138,000 rubles.  And for four - 155,000 rubles.  This is approximately 38,000 per person per week.  In general, the more people, the better.  In terms of savings. </p><h2>  About booking </h2><p>  A few words are worth mentioning about the nuances of booking an apartment at the Callisto Holiday Village 4 * hotel in Ayia Napa.  When drawing up the application, you will need to provide your credit card details.  The hotel accepts three of their types: ‚ÄúVisa‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaster Card‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaestro‚Äù.  A certain amount of money in the account can be blocked - but only until the moment the guests arrive on vacation.  The fact is that many potential guests decide to reserve an apartment just in case.  And then the reservation is canceled, and shortly before the expected arrival.  In general, the administration needs guarantees. </p><p>  The Callisto Holiday Village Hotel (4 stars Callisto) can accommodate children of all ages.  Moreover, if the baby is not two years old, a cradle will be installed in the room specially for him.  And you won‚Äôt have to pay for it.  It is only advisable to warn the administration about the need to install such a crib in advance so that everyone can prepare. </p>

    <h2>  Guest Comments </h2><p>  In the end, I would like to talk about the reviews that people who have visited Callisto Holiday Village 4 * leave.  Callisto Holiday Village, according to guest comments, is a great option.  Especially for those who want bright and unforgettable impressions from their vacation.  Everyone comes here - young couples in love, groups of friends, elderly people, parents with young children. </p><p>  The hotel corresponds to the declared star rating.  A solid "four" - so say people who can compare this hotel with others.  If you look closely at the other complexes that are available here, you can understand that Callisto is in a very good location.  Immediate proximity to the sea, the cleanest beach with an ideal sunset, numerous recreational facilities - there is everything that a tourist needs.  In addition, the beach has sun loungers with umbrellas, designed for hotel guests.  True, at the height of the season they have to be taken early.  However, you can spread a towel on the sand and sunbathe like that. </p><p>  Guests pay special attention to the level of staff training.  Workers speak Greek, English, Norwegian and Swedish.  Therefore, it is worth taking a phrase book with you if there are problems with the language.  There are a couple of people who understand Russian, but not at the reception.  And if you need something, they always turn to the registration desk.  However, the attitude here towards the guests is in any case good.  It does not depend on the nationality of visitors, or on the services they paid.  The rooms are cleaned well, they are always clean and tidy. </p><p>  Guests are advised to visit local attractions.  Fortunately, the location of the hotel is excellent - you can get to any places quickly and without problems.  The Tallas Museum, for example, is just 1.8 kilometers from the hotel.  And the Agia Napa monastery is even closer.  The water park can be reached in 5 minutes by car. </p><p>  This resort cannot be called quiet, because if you want privacy and tranquility in Ayia Napa, you should come here out of season.  In winter, for example, or at the end of autumn.  It is still quite warm at this time.  And you can swim in the sea - its temperature in December is on average 17-20 degrees. </p><p>  If you conclude, it can be noted that the hotel is ideal for people who are determined to get a lot of impressions from their holidays, as well as plenty of sunbathing on the beach, swimming in the azure clear water and delicious food. </p>
