Interesting facts and tips</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  On the peninsula, which is located in the North-Western part of Europe (Scandinavian Peninsula), there is the Kingdom of Sweden, where 10 million people live on the territory of 447,500 km¬≤. </p><p>  The article talks about the sights of Sweden (photos of which you can see in our article), paying attention to the cities that are most often visited by tourists from around the world. </p><h2>  Swedish history </h2><p>  Before moving on to a description of the sights of Sweden, photos of which you have the opportunity to see in the article, let's talk about the history of this wonderful country. </p><p>  Based on archaeological excavations, it was established that the first inhabitants who settled on the territory of the future state were Getae (representatives of the Thracian people) and ancient Germanic tribes (svei).  It was in the 1st century A.D.  Their possessions were small principalities, constantly at odds with each other. </p><p>  In the XI century, they formed a single state, which became known as the Kingdom of Sweden. </p><p>  Over the following centuries, Sweden waged continuous wars with many states and won victories.  Thanks to this, the Kingdom has become a leading country on the entire Baltic coast. </p><p>  Constant military conflicts led the country to economic decline, and since 1805 Sweden has ceased to participate in all wars.  The development of economics, production, science, and education began. </p><p>  Now Sweden is one of the leading countries in the European continent.  Tourists who have visited this amazing country come to the conclusion that Sweden is a country of contrasts.  This is confirmed by some facts. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Amazing facts </h2><p>  Swedish language is divided into two types: simple and complicated.  In conversation, the Swedes do not use complex phrases and do not even know the meaning of many words. </p><p>  The sophisticated style is applied only at the state level.  But then all Swedes know English, which is unofficially considered the second language of the state. </p><p>  Life expectancy is 80 years.  This is achieved thanks to living conditions and favorable ecology. </p><p>  The world famous "buffet" appeared several centuries ago, when all the treats were exhibited at once.  This type of table setting is called "sandwich". </p><p>  The Swedes did not make cooking meals at home.  Basically, they settle in pizzerias, so there are many fast-food establishments in the country (translated from English - ‚Äúfast food‚Äù). </p><p>  It is not customary here immediately after graduation to enter a university.  At first, graduates work and only after a few years are engaged in entering the chosen institution, so the average age of students is 25-30 years. </p><p>  The most popular hobby is fishing.  The peculiarity of this hobby is that they catch fish for the sake of interest: usually a Swedish amateur fisherman, having caught the fish, releases it back into the pond. </p><p>  Sweden is the first country to completely abandon gasoline, replacing it in favor of ecology with biofuels. </p><p>  There are no heavy industry enterprises in this country, so cities like Stockholm are considered the greenest and most favorable for life. </p><h2>  Stockholm History </h2><p>  In 1197, a fortified fort began to be erected on the site of a fishing settlement - the territory of the future capital of Sweden. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  According to historical documents, the first mention of Stockholm dates back to 1252.  It is believed that the history of the city begins from the time when the founder of the Folkung dynasty, Jarl Birger, built the Stockholm castle in order to protect the state from attacks from the Baltic Sea. </p><p>  The future capital of Sweden began to grow around the fortress, and by the end of the 13th century it had become a fairly developed city for that time. </p><p>  There are two versions of the origin of the name of the city.  One of them says that the name comes from the word stask, which means "bay" in translation. </p><p>  Now Stockholm, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 186 km¬≤, is considered the cultural center of the Kingdom. </p><h2>  Stadsholmen Island </h2><p>  The main city of the country is located on fourteen islands.  The most popular among tourists is the territory of Stadsholmen. </p><p>  In the XIII century, the first defensive structure was built, from which the construction of the city began. </p><p>  Now this part of the city (Old Town) is an architectural monument and is under state protection. </p><p>  The main attraction of Stockholm in Sweden (photo below) is the Royal Palace - one of the largest palace buildings in the world.  Now the palace is the official residence of the head of state: from 1973 to the present time, King <span>Carl Gustav</span> XVI rules.  Here receptions of dignitaries of other states and protocol events at the state level are held. </p><p>  At certain hours, tourists can watch the changing of the royal guard.  The ceremony of changing the guard was approved in 1523 and since then the theatrical tradition has not changed. </p><p>  At a time when there is no royal family in the palace, tourists can visit the royal apartments of the monarchs of Sweden, the Armory, the Throne Room, the History Museum, the Royal Chapel and much more as part of the tour. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="royal palace in stockholm" class="if uuid-2263846" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263846.jpg"></div><h2>  St. Nicholas Cathedral </h2><p>  Not far from the Royal Palace is a unique church building - St. Nicholas Cathedral. </p><p>  The peculiarity of this main church of the island, built during the XIII-XV centuries, is that it was the coronation of the Swedish kings. </p><p>  Now the temple is the main active cathedral, where tourists can visit the liturgy and examine the interior, preserved from 1740 without change. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Church of St. Nicholas" class="if uuid-2263849" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263849.jpg"></div><h2>  Djurgarden Island </h2><p>  In the center of Stockholm is the island of Djurg√•rden (translated ‚Äúanimal land‚Äù), which attracts history buffs. </p><p>  Once the territory of this island was the hunting ground of the Swedish kings.  Now there are museums and entertainment centers.  The main attractions are the Rosendal Palace, built in 1823 (four years) for the first king of the Bernadotte dynasty, and the museum ship Gustav Vasa.  This type of museum is considered the only one in the world.  Built in 1628, a Swedish warship, named after the Vasa Kings Dynasty, was sunk during naval battles. </p><p>  After 333 years, the ship was lifted from the seabed, restored and turned into a museum exhibit. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="rosendaal palace in sweden" class="if uuid-2263864" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263864.jpg"></div><h2>  History of Lund </h2><p>  Lund, which was formed in 990, is 600 km from Stockholm. </p><p>  Until recently, it was believed that the future university city was founded by the <span>King of Denmark,</span> Knud the Great, in 1020 CE. </p><p>  Recent archaeological excavations indicate that the first settlements date back to 990.  In those days, a settlement formed on the territory that belonged to Denmark.  About the sights of Lund (Sweden) read on. </p><h2>  Lund University </h2><p>  Lund University is the pride of the natives of this city and is considered the oldest of all educational institutions in Sweden, which was founded in 1666. </p><p>  Now over forty thousand students are studying in it. </p><p>  The building of the university library, built in 1578, and the former Royal Palace are considered the center of scientific research. </p><p>  An interesting fact: an inkjet printer, a mobile phone, an artificial respiration apparatus, and many other devices that are now used all over the world were invented in this center. </p><p>  The university is one of the 100 best educational institutions in the world: thanks to this rating, Lund is popularly called the university city. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lund University" class="if uuid-2263872" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263872.jpg"></div><h2>  Cathedral </h2><p>  At the beginning of the XII century, the territory of Lund was considered the Christian center of the northern part of Europe.  Therefore, the Cathedral was built in the city in 1103, which later became one of the main attractions of the city. </p><p>  The current main bell was cast 500 years ago and its melodious ringing daily announces the beginning of the service. </p><p>  In the XIV century, an astronomical clock was installed on the central tower, which works without repair until our time and at a certain time a special mechanism drives the puppets, playing a puppet show on a religious theme. </p><p>  In Lund, you can visit the Museum of Antiquity, the Zoological Museum and other museums, the exposition of which amaze tourists. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Cathedral" class="if uuid-2263878" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263878.jpg"></div><h2>  Malmo History </h2><p>  The city of Malmo in Sweden, the sights of which we have to consider, is considered the third largest (over 70 km¬≤) and is located in the southern part of Sweden.  For the first time, the settlement, which was called Malmhauger and belonged to Denmark, is mentioned in documents dating back to 1170. </p><p>  After 105 years, due to the fact that through Malmo at that time there was a transport connection of sea fish dealers, the settlement officially received the status of a city. </p><p>  After the Danish-Swedish war (1675-1679 gg.) An agreement was signed in Roskilde (a city on the Danish island of Zealand), on the basis of which the province of Slope and the city of Malmo became part of Sweden.  Now Malm√∂ is considered a major industrial center of the state, where tourists can explore the historical cultural monuments associated with the history of the city. </p><h2>  Malmehus Fortress </h2><p>  The main attraction is located in the historical part of the city - the Malmehus fortress, built in 1434 at the direction of the Danish King Eric Pomeranian, which plays the role of protecting the Danish state from the Baltic Sea. </p><p>  In 1439, Pomeranian was removed from the throne and left Denmark, and the fortress was destroyed, and on its ruins, under King Christian III, in 1537 the construction of a new castle began, which housed the barracks and living quarters for the royal nobility. </p><p>  Now there is a historical museum, which tourists can visit, passing through the main gate past the sentries from among voluntary history buffs dressed in the form of Danish soldiers of the 15th century. </p><div class="photo" data-original="en.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Malmehus Fortress" class="if uuid-2263890" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263890.jpg"></div><h2>  St. Peter's Church </h2><p>  The oldest building in Malm√∂, preserved to our time, is considered the current church building of St. Peter. </p><p>  The beginning of the construction of the temple dates back to 1319.  Documents indicate that it was erected on the foundation of a small brick church. </p><p>  Tourists are not allowed to enter the church during worship, but after the liturgy, history buffs can visit the main church attraction - the altar of 1611.  A feature of the main part of the Christian temple is that this wooden altar is considered the oldest in northern Europe from all the altars that have survived to this day. </p><div class="photo" data-original="pl.wikipedia.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="St. Peter's Church" class="if uuid-2263901" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/58617/2263901.jpg"></div><p>  The church has preserved tombstones and wooden sculptures of the 17th-19th centuries and an active organ established in the 16th century. </p><p>  Tourists in this modern and at the same time ancient city can see the synagogue, which is considered the largest in Scandinavia, and the mosque, since Malmo is the center of the Muslim religion of this region. </p><p>  The country's leadership pays great attention to guests who, in response to benevolence and hospitality, leave positive feedback on the beauty and grandeur of the sights of Sweden. </p>
