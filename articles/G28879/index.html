Recently, this direction has become very popular.  And one of the most popular resorts is Goa.  This smallest state is located on the Arabian Sea. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Nifa hotel" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1128343.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Resorts of North Goa </h2><p>  Tours in this direction are much cheaper for tourists than in the south.  And the rest here is much more interesting and diverse.  The beaches are named after the villages to which they adjoin.  The most developed resorts are Candolim and Calangute, as well as Bagh, Morjim and Arambol. </p><p>  In the latter, for example, there is no busy traffic.  Its long beach and numerous cozy cafes right on the coast attract those who prefer calm and measured. </p><p>  The best restaurants in Goa are, of course, in Baga, Candolim and Calangute.  There is also a wider range of water activities.  In both Calangute and Bagi, you can find many interesting places, visit Tibetan markets, etc. </p><p>  <span>Morjim (Morjim) is</span> generally considered a "Russian village", and quite deservedly.  Most of our compatriots come here, accounting for about eighty percent of all vacationers.  Even the menus that are offered in restaurants contain Russian-written dishes: dumplings, borscht, pancakes ... In this place there are many options for accommodation, but few hotels work with tour operators.  One of them is Hotel Nifa 2 *.  It is located next to the beach of the same name and is equally suitable for both family and romantic getaways. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nifa 2" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1128345.jpg" width="600"></div>

Those who wish can eat in one of the nearest shakes: they feed there normally and relatively inexpensively.  In addition, the hotel can for a nominal fee - two hundred rupees - order the preparation of seafood purchased independently in the <span>fish market.</span>  The menu in the on-site restaurant is varied.  The pool has a bar that sells drinks, and judging by the reviews, at store prices, without markups. </p><h2>  Beach </h2><p>  Hotel Nifa 2 *, reviews about which Russians leave mostly positive, is only two hundred meters from the sea.  The famous public beach Morjim offers all the amenities for a comfortable stay.  For the use of mattresses and sunbeds need to pay.  Towels can be obtained at the hotel reception, leaving a deposit. </p><p>  The beach is very convenient for young children.  It has a smooth entrance to the water, sand cover.  The road to the beach passes through the territory of a neighboring hotel. </p><h2>  For children </h2><p>  Nifa Hotel is positioned by tour operators as a family.  For small tourists in a small area there is a branch in the pool, a babysitter can be invited upon request.  Upon arrival, you can order diet food for the baby. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="nifa hotel goa" class="if" height="225" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1128344.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  Residents of Nifa Hotel can spend evenings in the shared lounge located on the ground floor of the building, as well as on the terrace or on the barbecue area.  There is no animation at the hotel.  If desired, tourists can swim at another beach called Arambol.  It is a bit livelier, with live music playing in the evenings. </p><p>  For those Russians who prefer to combine leisure and sightseeing, it is more convenient to rent a car or bicycle at the hotel and explore the nearby attractions themselves.  Otherwise, they recommend buying tours with a Russian-speaking guide.  The hotel has an outdoor pool, around which there are sun loungers for free use. </p><p>  And now in more detail about the comments left by people who visited Hotel Nifa. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  Many Russians who come to this hotel say that they knew in advance where they were going, and therefore did not rely on the infrastructure corresponding to the ‚Äúfive stars‚Äù.  Nevertheless, some were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere and atmosphere prevailing at the two-star Nifa Hotel (Goa).  And they did not expect that they would like it here so much.  The three-story hotel building is located by the road.  Settlement is carried out immediately.  The hotel is served by the owner, who is assisted by his son.  Both of them speak Russian fairly well, so there are no communication problems. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel Nifa 2 Morjim" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/409/1128342.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The rooms are comfortable, with balconies and windows that open.  If it is too hot, there is a fan at the guests' service, in addition to it, there is also air conditioning, which is not provided in all the "treshki" of India.  Of course, they need to pay for using it.  And this circumstance was not liked by many Russians, although some believe that it is not needed here at all.  As for nutrition, breakfasts, judging by the reviews, are quite tolerable.  In nearby shops you can buy fruit for nothing. </p><p>  In conclusion, we emphasize once again that this hotel is mainly chosen by those who prefer a relaxing and economical vacation. </p>
