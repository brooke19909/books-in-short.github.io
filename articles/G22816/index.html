    <p>  Mobile Internet is a very practical service that allows you to get the necessary information at any time without being tied to a bulky PC.  That is why MTS has developed the Bit Smart program for its customers, but before judging the merits of the service, you need to familiarize yourself with the connection rules, pricing and other terms of use in more detail. </p><h2>  Internet needed </h2><p>  The list of users of the world wide web is increasing significantly every day.  More and more people use the Internet not only as entertainment, but also as the main means to ensure high-quality remote work.  Considering the needs of its customers, MTS resolved this issue with the help of mobile Internet bonus programs, one of which is Bit Smart.  And if you take into account the fact that this mobile operator has one of the best coverage, then the advantage of mobile Internet is becoming almost undeniable.  However, before making final conclusions, you need to familiarize yourself with the connection conditions, tariff plan and other characteristics of the mentioned program. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Who can become a consumer of a service? </h2><p>  So, you have decided to become a happy user of the mobile Internet and want to activate Bit Smart.  How to activate the service?  A pleasant surprise awaits you: you do not need to order it through various SMS or commands, as it is an integral application of three tariff plans: Red Energy, Super MTS and Your Country.  Automatically after authorizing a SIM card or switching to one of these tariffs for 15 days, you can use the Internet for free.  After the specified period, which, in principle, is a test period to establish the most comfortable tariffication, the <span>system autonomously</span> connects the Bit Smart or Super Bit Smart program.  The choice of traffic depends on the volume used during the test period, and if this indicator does not exceed 150 MB, the MTS Bit Smart service is activated.  In cases of exceeding the border volume specified above, the user becomes a member of the Super Bit Smart program. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="MTS how to disable Smart Bit" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/436354.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Basic conditions </h2><p>  The main condition for using this service is the subscriber’s territorial location in the home region.  Throughout the day, the program provides for the use of 75 megabytes of traffic, the end of the daily limit is indicated by a drop in speed to the limit indicator of 64 kB / s.  Updating and restoring the next volume of “Smart Bit” in time is slightly different from the generally accepted standard and occurs not at midnight, but at 3 a.m.  It is worth noting that the tariffing for used traffic in roaming in the Russian Federation is calculated in accordance with the basic conditions. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart bit 15" class="if" height="393" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/436352.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Cost and terms of payment </h2><p>  How much does Bit Smart service cost?  For 15 days you use traffic for free, and starting from 16 days once a day, 8 rubles is deducted from the subscriber’s account.  Thus, it turns out that the average monthly cost of a fee for quite substantial Internet traffic is very attractive to consumers. </p><h2>  Traffic check </h2><p>  For comfortable use of the provided option, you need to know how to control the remainder of the daily traffic volume.  To do this is quite simple, you only need to dial * 111 * 217 # on the phone.  After calling this menu, the system will provide information about the service and the amount of traffic remaining for the current day. </p><h2>  Service Deactivation </h2><p>  If the connection to the service is fully automatic - when switching to one of the above tariffs - and does not require additional actions, then the disconnection must be done independently.  There are two simple ways to do this: using SMS and a command, as, in principle, in the case of other additional MTS options.  How to disable “Bit Smart”, you can find out by contacting the operator, or study the information on the company's website.  Both methods have identical power, so it all depends on the desire of the subscriber. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart bit how to disable" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/436353.jpg" width="500"></div></h2><h2>  How to contact the MTS operator </h2><p>  If for some reason the additional option “Bit Smart” is not needed, just contact the operator’s company employee by calling the short number 0890. After listening to the main voice menu, you must press 0 on the phone and wait until you are connected to a consultant.  This qualified person, after listening to the wishes of the client, will be able to disable the unnecessary service or provide professional advice on self-disconnection.  It is worth noting that such a phone call is completely free for subscribers in the home region in the Russian Federation, or in the network of a mobile operator in <span>neighboring countries:</span> Uzbekistan, Belarus, Ukraine.  If communication with the operator is necessary in roaming, you need to call for free to the number +7 495-766-0166. </p><h2>  Disabling a service using SMS </h2><p>  In order to deactivate the “Bit Smart” service via SMS, you must send a message to number 111, and the text should consist of code 8649. After sending, the subscriber will receive a response with information about disabling an unnecessary option within a few minutes. </p><h2>  The second way to deactivate Bit Smart </h2><p>  You can refuse cellular Internet using this program by typing directly on the mobile device the special command * 111 * 8649 #.  A confirmation of disconnection will be a message notifying the subscriber that the service is deactivated.  If the SMS response is not received, it is better to try again to send the command a little later.  As a rule, disconnection occurs immediately, but some subscribers from personal experience recommend rechecking the system.  To do this, it is enough to log on to the Internet, and immediately everything will become clear: if the connection is denied, then everything is done correctly. </p><h2><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Smart b bit" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/12301/436351.jpg" width="600"></div></h2><h2>  Service Features </h2><p>  Self-management of subscribers by the tariff plan features is inherent in all mobile operators, and MTS is no exception.  As a rule, many additional services can be turned off and, if necessary, activated again.  But some are provided to the subscriber only once, “Bit Smart” also applies to such.  How to disable this option yourself is already clear, but is it worth it to commit such an act?  After all, reusing cellular Internet on such pleasant terms will no longer work.  Therefore, before you use one of the above methods to deactivate a service, you should think carefully. </p><h2>  Promo from Beat Smart </h2><p>  The operator provides all users of this program with the opportunity to take advantage of the additional Promo options, each of which has its own quite significant advantages.  So, “Bit Smart A-promo” implies 14 free days of using the Internet with a limit of 10 Mb of traffic.  After this period, 2 rubles per day are withdrawn from the user's account.  To disable the option, you can use the command * 111 * 362 #. </p>

    <p>  The next offer of the operator, which subscribers can use, is called “Smart B-Promo Bit”.  According to the terms of this service, the client receives 20 Mb per day with a <span>subscription fee of</span> 60 rubles / month, which is withdrawn from the 15th day of using the program.  The first two weeks are completely free, but each subsequent day after this period, 2 rubles will be withdrawn from the client’s account.  It should be noted that for the comfort of the subscriber on the last free day of the option, the system informs about the cost of the service for the subsequent period of use.  Thus, if this option is not needed, you can disable it and avoid wasting money by typing * 111 * 372 #.  Those who are suitable for conditions should know that the use of “Bit Smart V-promo” excludes the work of all other similar programs, except “Mini-Bit”. </p><p>  It completes the list of Bit Smart S promotional programs, which assumes 30 Mb of unlimited speed for 3 rubles per day. </p><p>  The operator informs the subscriber via SMS about the possibility of connecting any of the promotional services.  Well, take advantage of the offer or refuse - everyone decides for himself. </p>
