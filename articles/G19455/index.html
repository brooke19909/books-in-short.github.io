    <p>  The territory of Kabardino-Balkaria was inhabited since ancient times, and in the middle of the 16th century it became part of Russia.  At this time, Ivan the Terrible married the daughter of the Kabardian prince, further strengthening Russia's relations with the Caucasian republic.  In the 19th century, many foreign guests were interested in the nature of Kabardino-Balkaria.  It was at this time that the first conquest of the highest mountain of the North Caucasus, Elbrus, took place, on the slopes of which the republic stretches.  From this moment, mountaineering began to actively develop in the Elbrus region, and by the middle of the 20th century there were no end of tourists from tourists.  The second half of the 20th century was marked by the construction of roads in the Baksan Gorge, hotels, recreation centers and <span>cable cars.</span>  Here, in Kabardino-Balkaria, the first cableway in Russia with a length of more than 1,500 meters was built. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  What can I see in the Elbrus region? </h2>

An ancient beautiful legend is associated with its origin.  Once upon a time, a tribe of sledges lived on the Caucasian plains.  Their leader was the great warrior Elbrus, and he had a son - a brave and brave handsome Beshtau.  The life of the leader’s son carelessly proceeded - in fun with friends, hunting, fishing, communicating with nature.  He had an unusual gift - to understand the language of animals.  Once I met Beshtau, a girl from a neighboring tribe - the beautiful Masha, and fell in love with her.  Without thinking twice, the young man came to his father and announced an imminent wedding.  But Elbrus was not at all happy, because he himself was captivated by the beauty of young Mashuki.  He then conceived to get rid of his rival son and sent him to fight with a neighboring tribe in the hope that Beshtau would not return alive. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The young warrior was absent for a long time, and Elbrus persuaded Masha to marry him.  However, Beshtau survived and returned one night to his native village.  His friends - animal lion, bull, snake and camel talked about the treachery of his father.  Beshtau abducted his beloved and decided to hide, but Elbrus caught up with them.  Father and son went to battle against each other.  Beshtau raised his sword and cut his father's head.  However, Elbrus did not immediately die, gathered his last strength and cut his son into five parts.  Mashuka could not bear such grief, grabbed a dagger and killed herself.  Everything around was numb from this terrible and monstrous battle.  And since then the <span>mountains of Elbrus,</span> Mashuk and Beshtau have stood on this site. </p><p>  Today, millions of people from all over the world come together to enjoy the beauty of these natural giants.  We invite you to organize your holidays in the Elbrus region in the summer.  Prices at local hotels and cafes will pleasantly surprise you.

    <p>  The name of the valley speaks for itself - about 20 sources of mineral water are being hit here from under the ground.  The passage to the Valley of Narzans is very picturesque.  The place is closed on all sides by high mountains, due to this an unusual atmosphere of solitude is created.  Here, next to natural mineral springs, there are small cafes stylized as houses of different nations.  Here tourists will be offered to try the cuisines of different nations.  If you visit the Elbrus region in the summer, your vacation should definitely begin with a visit to the Valley of Narzans. </p><h2>  Baksan Gorge </h2><p>  Baksan Gorge is an incredibly beautiful and popular place.  An <span>asphalt road</span> passes through the entire gorge <span>,</span> which rises to the foot of Mount Elbrus for 2000 meters.  The mountain river of the same name flows here.  They say that once the water in the river was so clean that it could be drunk.  It is currently too polluted.  The gorge is especially beautiful in the warm season, when everything is green around, and the mountain river rushes down with a loud rumble.  We advise you to come to Elbrus in the summer.  Rest (hotels here are presented in the widest assortment) will be full of pleasant memories.  The most popular hotels among tourists are Balkaria, Scheherazade, Azau. </p><h2>  Conquerors of Elbrus: Monuments </h2>

    <p>  Have you decided to spend your holidays in the Elbrus region in the summer?  Rest begins with acquaintance with the monuments to the first conquerors of <span>the highest mountains in Russia,</span> which are installed right at its foot.  In 1829, residents of Kabardino-Balkaria, Hilar Khachirov and Akhiya Sottaev, made their first ascent to the top of the mountain.  The expedition, which included them, consisted of 20 people.  At an altitude of 4270 meters, it was decided to stop the ascent due to the fact that most members of the expedition began to have severe headaches.  Hilar Khachirov refused to return and continued climbing alone.  He managed to get to the top, and as a proof left a flag and his hat there. </p><h2>  Tyrnyauz city </h2>

    <p>  The road to the foot of Elbrus leads through the “dying city” of Tyrnyauz.  Before the collapse of the USSR, people who worked at a local mining plant lived there.  After the closure of the plant, the population declined markedly.  Currently, almost no one lives in the city.  It is located in a very unusual, picturesque place.  Along the road are abandoned multi-storey buildings, and right behind them are mountains. </p><h2>  Reviews </h2><p>  This region is popular among tourists not only in winter but also in summer.  Among the main summer activities, reviews include hiking accompanied by experienced guides, horseback riding, quad biking and much more.  Not a single tourist will be impressed by the Elbrus region in the summer.  Holidays, reviews of which the most positive tourists know, will be interesting and full of impressions.  Tourists say this is the best place on earth! </p>
