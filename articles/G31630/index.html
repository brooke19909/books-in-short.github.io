  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aya Lake Mountain Altai</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  In the south of Western Siberia is a mountainous country - Altai.  This region is famous for its unique natural features and rich cultural heritage.  Here is the <span>highest mountain of</span> Siberia - Belukha.  The mountain is considered sacred, according to legend, it is here that the "navel of the Earth" is located, giving life energy to all living things and giving new knowledge, and also here, in the bowels of Belukha, is the entrance to the fantastic country of Shambhala - the abode of gods and saints. </p><p>  Gorny Altai is located on the territory of the Republic of Altai, which this year celebrated a double anniversary: ‚Äã‚Äãtwo hundred and fifty-five years from the date of entry into Russia and twenty years from the date of formation.  Tourism is actively developing in the Republic, including extreme tourism.  For example, you can go rafting, climbing, diving, horseback riding or walking excursions to natural and <span>archaeological sites,</span> visit the ancient observatory, Denisov caves, Roerich‚Äôs estate ... Lake Aya Gorny Altai is interesting for relaxation and not without reason is famous for its water resources.  In a word, all places where to relax in the Altai Mountains, simply can not be listed. </p><p>  The most important natural wealth of this region is water resources.  There are numerous rivers, the main of which is Katun, lakes, among which the famous Teletskoye Lake, which is a symbol of the republic.  Manzherok Lake is very popular and Lake Aya Gorny Altai has about seven thousand lakes, most of which are in the mountains.  Almost all of them are cold. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  A favorite vacation spot for locals is Lake Aya. Gorny Altai borders on the Altai Territory, whose inhabitants also like to relax here, especially since it can be easily reached both by personal transport and by bus.  On a hot summer day, you can hardly find free space here.  Perhaps the construction of a luxurious tourist complex with an artificial lake near Souzgi will allow a little unloading of Ayskoye Lake ... Aya Lake is the warmest lake in the Republic.  Despite the fact that cold springs feeding the <span>lake</span> beat from the bottom <span>, the upper</span> layer of water warms up to +24 degrees on hot days. </p><p>  In the vicinity of Lake Aya, many camp sites were built - they literally dotted the shores of Katun and Ai Lake.  They all differ in terms of service and, of course, in price.  There is also a clear separation by the age of vacationers and their preferences. Among the camp sites, Altan stands out especially. Altai Mountains attracts more and more tourists every year, so camp sites grow like mushrooms after rain, but Altan is especially popular.  There are deluxe and junior suites located in comfortable buildings.  There are also ten insulated houses with a veranda and fifty bungalows with amenities at the base.  The base can accommodate 188 people. </p><p>  If someone from young married couples or youth groups wants to spend a vacation with benefit and without going into excessive spending, then Altan would be the most suitable option.  Well-groomed territory, an extensive excursion program, and the presence of extreme entertainment make the camp site well suited specifically for young people.  For young families with children, there are also all conditions. </p><p>  Due to improved living conditions, level of service and affordable prices, Altan is especially popular among those who came to rest on Lake Aya. Altai Mountains is rich in legends.  The word ‚Äúai‚Äù from Altai is translated as the moon.  According to one legend, the moon, saving people from the cannibal Delbengen, came down from heaven.  In the place where the moon touched the earth and formed a lake called Aisky.  It is located 17 kilometers from the village of Maima at an altitude of 280 meters above sea level, its length is 409 meters and its width is 190 meters. </p><p>  The maximum depth reaches more than twenty meters, and the area is about nine hectares.  Ai Lake has a crescent shape, in the very center of it is a picturesque island, on which you can see a beautiful gazebo. <br>  There are equipped beaches with showers and sun loungers on the shore. </p><p>  You can ride a <span>water slide</span> or rent a pedalo.  In <span>summer cafes</span> you can buy soft drinks and ice cream. </p>
