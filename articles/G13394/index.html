    <p>  The smartphone was announced in 2012 at an exhibition in Barcelona.  It was presented as the most affordable among other devices of the Lumia line.  He gained interest in himself due to the low cost and convenient Windows Phone operating system.  When such a combination leaves the wings of such a large company as Nokia, success is guaranteed. </p><p>  The Nokia 610 phone appeared on sale both in Ukraine and in Russia, which is good news.  Its cost is slightly higher than in other European countries, but this does not make it less popular. </p>

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  Externally, the smartphone looks soft and delicate, thanks to its beveled edges and a smooth body.  The latter exists in several versions, which differ not only in colors (white, black, red, blue), but also in material.  For example, in white and blue devices, the case is made of glossy plastic, in red and black - in matte.  An interesting fact is that it is this difference that affects the strength of the surface. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  According to user reviews, it is safe to say that it is better to purchase a phone with a white case.  It is surprisingly the least susceptible to mechanical stress.  In addition, this solution creates the effect of an expensive product: the white case looks several times more solid, and therefore more expensive. </p><p>  In relation to other external characteristics, the Nokia 610 is not much different from WP7 smartphones.  At the bottom of the phone on the front side there are three standard touch-type buttons (‚Äúreturn‚Äù, ‚Äúhome‚Äù, ‚Äúsearch‚Äù).  When the screen is unlocked, they are highlighted;  working with them is convenient. </p><p>  Mechanical buttons are located on the right side.  Here you can find the volume control, and the camera, and unlock the device.  For most users, unfortunately, the location of the last button seems uncomfortable, if only because its usual location in all smartphones is on the top of the device.  In Nokia 610, there are connectors for a headset and for connecting to a computer on it.  They did not begin to place anything on the lower edge, since it is removed together with the rear panel.  The left side turned out to be "empty". </p><p>  On the body of the smartphone are the camera and flash.  The back panel is removed quite easily: the cover must be moved down with a slight movement.  Under it is the battery, under which is located the connector for the SIM card.  Microsoft policy is known to everyone, therefore, in all smartphones running on Windows Phone 7 (Nokia 610 is no exception), there is no memory card slot. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  People who use this smartphone also liked the fact that the phone is easy to hold in their hands, and the cover (both glossy and matte) does not slip out. </p>

    <h2>  Platform </h2><p>  The phone runs on a single-core processor.  Its frequency is 800 MHz.  This is enough to ensure that the OS installed on the smartphone does not slow down and works fine.  The system also loads fast enough (no more than 20-25 seconds). </p><p>  The Nokia 610 phone, the characteristics of which will be described a little later, is somewhat similar to its ‚Äúbrother‚Äù Lumia 710. Their ‚Äúinsides‚Äù are identical, therefore one can judge the performance of one smartphone by a similar indicator from another.  The device supports SkyDrive, which is quite convenient. </p><p>  For some reason, many are baffled and frightened by the fact that the amount of RAM on the phone does not exceed 256 MB, but for an operating system such as Windows Phone, this is enough.  All applications work fine and load quickly.  But it is worth noting that there are still applications in the official store from the OS (there are about 5% of them) that do not support working with Nokia 610. The phone has 8 GB of internal memory. </p>

    <h2>  OS and design </h2><p>  A feature of the Windows Phone 7 operating system is that it looks the same on all devices, so there are no special differences. </p><p>  In principle, the interfaces of <span>Nokia Lumia</span> 610 and other devices of this model line are similar.  A convenient main menu is directly connected to the desktop.  The following sections can be called standard tiles: ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù, ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù, ‚ÄúJournal‚Äù, ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù and ‚ÄúMail‚Äù.  Absolutely everything that the user wishes is brought to the desktop: a site, a game, any file.  A move function is also available. </p><p>  In order to go to the main menu, you need to "scroll" from right to left or click the corresponding arrow.  The Nokia Lumia 610 (Windows Phone has become the key to its success) has a common menu in which all installed applications are located.  The ability to create a folder in it is missing. </p><p>  You can select any picture or photo as the screen background.  The lock screen shows the number of missed calls, unread messages and alerts from applications. </p>

    <h2>  Camera </h2><p>  The appearance of the camera (5 megapixels) in Nokia Lumia is not much different from the standard ones that are installed by the company on almost all smartphones.  It is equipped with a flash.  There is also autofocus. </p><p>  The viewfinder interface is quite simple.  Photos are obtained with a resolution of either 4: 3 or 16: 9.  Video is shot in VGA quality. </p><p>  In the settings, functions such as choosing the type of lighting, shooting modes, ISO are available, a large number of effects are presented, it is possible to change contrast and saturation. </p><h2>  Sound and music </h2><p>  While talking on the phone, the sound is excellent, the speaker showed itself from a rather good side.  There are no extraneous sounds, the interlocutor‚Äôs speech is clear.  Due to the fact that the smartphone is equipped with digital processing, unnecessary noise is eliminated, the human voice is made louder. </p><p>  The speaker is good enough, so it is recommended to turn it on full only in those places where it is very noisy (discos, parties).  The audibility range is from 0 to 30. The most suitable for a healthy user is to set the volume at around 7-8 points.  There is also a speakerphone function. </p><p>  As a rule, on all phones with Windows Phone, the Zune application is installed for various files and their processing.  Nokia 610 is equipped with a slightly different traditional program - Nokia Music.  It allows you to buy music and listen to it.  There is a Mix Radio application.  It offers the user small playlists, and also allows you to save songs to your phone.  Playback is high quality and loud.  In the "native" headphones, the sound improves significantly. </p>

    <h2>  Connections </h2><p>  The phone is connected to the computer using a regular USB cable that comes with the kit.  With it, you can not only move files from one medium to another, but also charge the device.  In order to connect any headset, you can use Bluetooth 2.1. </p><p>  In addition, the smartphone has a Wi-Fi module.  He is able to distribute the Internet connection to other devices (no more than 5).  Thus, the Nokia 610 turns into an access point.  For fans of listening to the radio online, the creators of the phone in the kit provide headphones that work as an antenna. </p>

    <h2>  Navigator </h2><p>  Nokia smartphones with a navigation function can compete with more expensive models from other companies.  The cheap Nokia Lumia 610 is no exception. In a special program, you can download maps using Wi-Fi and enable voice guidance.  A search function and various instructions are also provided. </p><p>  The Nokia Cards program itself is almost unlike Drive.  In the latter there are no tips for walking or using public transport.  The application, provided to Nokia users, has information on the schedule of buses, trolleybuses and the metro.  For residents of Russia, the map also shows streets with house numbers. </p><p>  Navigators are often needed abroad.  This is where you have to use the service offline.  In order to avoid an incident, you need to download a map before the trip.  Nokia 610, the card programs for which has not yet been fully developed, provides for use abroad as a variation of "Maps" and Nokia Drive.  The first does not yet have offline mode, which is a significant difference between them. </p><p>  Drive will be convenient if a person moves around the country by car, in case of walking on foot the program will not be particularly useful.  Cards would be more useful here. </p><h2>  Applications </h2><p>  The Nokia Lumia 610 smartphone, whose programs are very diverse and easy to use, has a number of interesting applications.  For example, Nokia Reading.  This is a huge bookstore where you can both purchase literature and read it online.  There is absolutely everything here: from the works of Daria Dontsova to the masterpieces of Harry Harrison.  Prices for books are low: mostly no more than 60 rubles.  The newest literature, professional and textbooks are slightly higher (about 300 rubles). </p><p>  Unfortunately, so far, little can be read in online mode.  There are about a hundred English books and about the same Russian.  However, the service is being developed, and very soon it will be possible to borrow books ‚Äúfor rent‚Äù. </p><p>  Calculator and calendar in Nokia 610 - programs from the ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù section.  They are easy to use, without sophisticated features and buttons.  The calendar has the ability to create notes and mark birth dates.  The calculator when you turn the smartphone 90 ¬∞ changes from normal to engineering. </p><p>  Office suite is also called standard.  You can easily print a document in Word, create a spreadsheet and perform complex calculations in Excel, and record important tasks in OneNote.  Like most smartphones, the Nokia 610 can connect to the Xbox. </p>
