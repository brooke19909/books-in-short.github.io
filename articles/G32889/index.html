Some are attracted by service, others are exotic.  Indeed, in Turkey there are many things that you will not find anywhere else in the world.  A vivid example of this is the ascent to the top of Tahtali Mountain.  This tour is not one of the most popular, but the most popular among tourists from Kemer, Antalya, Finike, Tekirova, Goynuk and other resorts located close to the mountain and not very.  The difference for sightseers is only in time for the journey from their hotel and back and in price.  And the impressions of all remain approximately the same.  They can be described with the words ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù, ‚Äúunforgettable‚Äù, ‚Äúexciting‚Äù, ‚Äúindelible‚Äù, ‚Äúfantastically beautiful‚Äù and ‚Äúincomparable‚Äù.  What is Takhtala mountain and why does everyone like it so much? </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tahtali mountains" class="if" height="336" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903036.jpg" width="502"></div>

    <h2>  Geographic data </h2><p>  "Tahtals" in Turkish means "from the boards," or "boardwalk."  The fact is that the rocks of which the body of Mount Takhtaly is composed look like layers or folds pushed one on top of the other.  These are Paleozoic and Tertiary deposits, remotely resembling rows of bars.  Many mountains in the Balkans and in Asia have the same structure, and not just the Taurus mountain system, to which Takhtaly belongs.  They began to rise above sea level in the era of <span>alpine folding,</span> which continues in our time.  Perhaps in the future, Tahtali Mountain, whose height is currently considered 2365 meters, will become even grander.  But even now it dominates the surrounding area so much that it is clearly visible from the boundless distance, for example, from Belek, to which more than 50 km from Kemer. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Kemer Mount Tahtali" class="if" height="280" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903040.jpg" width="544"></div>

The Beidaglari mountain range, of which it is the peak, protects the area from the north winds.  As a result, it creates its own microclimate, pleasing with a greater presence of sunny days than in neighboring resorts.  At the same time, on the top of the mountain you can see snow even in June, although in summer it is not so much, only separate small layers.  Anyway, bring a souvenir in the form of a snowman in the form of a snowman in the heat +35 and above from the original trip.  In the spring, in the region of Kemer, African winds often blow, bringing reddish dust with them.  She paints the snow-white peak of Takhtala in a red color, which looks somewhat unusual.  The vegetation on the mountain is represented mainly by conifers and grassy-floral undergrowth interspersed with evergreen shrubs.  All this is beautiful and colorful closer to the foot, but the higher, the vegetation becomes poorer and completely disappears at the borders of 1800-1900 meters.  Only the bare rocks remain. </p><h2>  Animals and birds </h2><p>  The fauna of Tahtali with an influx of tourists has become very impoverished.  Therefore, the Turkish government creates reserves in order to at least save something for posterity.  Now, on the slopes of Mount Takhtaly, if you are lucky, you can find hedgehogs, land turtles, badgers, mouflons, lizards, and if you are not lucky, you can see vipers and mice.  It is very rare for fallow deer and wild boars to live here, living in places of the Taurus Mountains that are still inaccessible to humans.  There are also meetings with a fox or a jackal (usually in winter).  Predators ‚Äî eagles, falcons ‚Äî nest from the world of birds in the rocks of Takhtala, and there are a lot of singing trifles in the woodlands.  Of course, to see all this, you need to climb to the top not in the cabin of the funicular, but on your own.  A special tourist route has been laid for this.  The local population of the neighborhood and the foothills of Takhtaly uses goats and sheep for grazing (of course, not in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lift). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tahtali mountain photo" class="if" height="417" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903038.jpg" width="316"></div>

The lift appeared here only in 2007.  Until now, climbing was carried out on its own.  And now for everyone, this route has been saved.  It is part of the famous <span>Lycian trail</span> and is suitable only for physically hardy people.  Approximately up to a height of 1811 meters, the road is very interesting.  You can not only breathe the cleanest air, not only admire nature, but also touch it with your hands.  To be honest, near Tahtali Mountain opens quite differently.  The photo is a confirmation of this.  Further, the landscape becomes monotonous and, if not a fan of geology, boring.  All that catches your eye is gray-brown bare rocks, along which you need to stomp up another half a kilometer.  And at the top there is a well-deserved wonderful vacation with a visit to the toilet, shop and cafe (whoever wishes).  Getting on the trail is easy.  You need to get to the village of Beichika (BASIC).  In that place there is a pointer with an arrow.  It is impossible to get lost further, since they trod the path well.  It is better to make such an excursion in the autumn months or in the spring, since in the summer, until you climb up a kilometer and a half, the heat is immense. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tahtali mountain Turkey photo" class="if" height="320" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903035.jpg" width="464"></div>

    <h2>  And on the lift </h2><p>  For all those who cannot or do not want to climb the mountain on their own, in 2007 a lift was launched.  <span>The cable car,</span> called Olympos Teleferik, was built by the Swiss company Doppelmayr Seilbahnen GmbH, which has proven itself in creating such structures in Austria, Singapore, and America.  Everywhere their lifts work perfectly, they do not break off the cables.  These lines seem inappropriate until you sit in a booth and start climbing to the coveted peak of Takhtaly Mountain.  About a third of the way, when the earth is already 500-600 meters away, the cabin at the next junction can significantly jerk or even freeze.  At such moments, passengers unanimously exclaim: ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù  and they start to look anxiously at each other.  Then, knowledge of how reliable the company that built this road really helps everyone with weak nerves.  The climb itself takes from 10 to 15 minutes. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tahtali mountain how to get to the ski lift" class="if" height="349" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903037.jpg" width="519"></div>

    <h2>  Tahtali Mountain: how to get to the ski lift </h2><p>  Takhtaly from Kemer is located 7 km, not far from the villages of Camyuva and Tekirova.  <span>The cable car</span> starts not from the foot, but from the lower station, located on the slope of the mountain at around 726 meters.  Here you can also take a walk, take beautiful photos, admire the pond with fish and ducks.  All excursion buses are brought here along the serpentine.  You can get to this place on your own in a personal car or taxi and already here you can pay for a place in the booth.  So it turns out 15-20 dollars cheaper.  In addition, you can buy only one lift.  Down then either on foot or on a paraglider.  The flight takes about 40 minutes and ends on the Tekirova beach.  Those who are afraid to fly in the clouds themselves can go down with an instructor.  The lift cabins are more than roomy.  They can simultaneously contain 80 people, but in reality this happens infrequently.  The walls of the cabin are transparent, so you can start taking pictures on the way. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="top of Tahtali mountain" class="if" height="318" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903034.jpg" width="474"></div>

    <h2>  Vertex </h2><p>  An observation platform is equipped here (there is a cable fence), from which unrealistic fantastic landscapes and views open.  But this is only in sunny and clear weather.  On other days, you will either have to contemplate the foggy haze, or even be in the clouds themselves, which shelter the top of Takhtaly quite often.  On such days, it is especially damp and unfriendly, so warm things must be taken with you, even if the thermometer rolls over at the foot.  But on clear days, the blouse will not hurt.  For the convenience of tourists, a three-story building with toilets, a souvenir shop and edible little things and a cafe were built at the top, there are even a number of deck chairs.  Prices here are as high as the peak of Tahtalƒ±. </p><h2>  Legends of Tahtali </h2><p>  Residents in the vicinity of Kemer have a sincere legend about the visiting card of their city - Mount Takhtaly.  By the way, the Greeks who arrived here called her Olympos.  They also christened the city built at its foot, from which picturesque ruins have been preserved.  The legend about the appearance of Takhtala Mountain is this: once upon a time there lived the mortal beauty of Takhtala, in whom the immortal god Taurus fell in love.  It so happened that the girl died from a snake bite.  The unfortunate lover tried in every possible way to kill himself in order to also end his life, but nothing came of it.  You can‚Äôt argue with immortality.  Then he asked for the service of Zeus.  He took pity on the feelings of poor Taurus, forever connecting him with his beloved.  He turned one into a mountain range, the other into a beautiful peak. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Tahtali mountain height" class="if" height="376" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/6866/903039.jpg" width="402"></div>

    <h2>  Useful Tips </h2><p>  Extremely attractive mountain Tahtali (Turkey).  Photos from its top turn out beauty unprecedented and not written.  There are also people who, risking their heads, climb onto cliffs and cornices inaccessible to a mere mortal and take pictures from them.  Their pictures are from 5 to 10 at.  e., but the views on them are really unique.  In order not to make a mistake, you need to go to Takhtali, as mentioned above, on a clear day.  At the top there are telescopes for the price of 1 lira.  A trifle can be changed on the mountain, but it is better to take with you.  Better yet, have your own binoculars.  The third tip is about warm things.  Do not hesitate, there is no heat on the mountain, but winds, coolness and dampness piercing to the bones "pamper" constantly.  The fourth tip concerns lights breaking out of the stones.  For this spectacle you need to go not to Takhtaly, but to Chimera (Yanartash), located near the village of Chyraly.  The fifth and final advice - being in Turkey, be sure to take the time and climb Tahtali.  You will not regret. </p>
