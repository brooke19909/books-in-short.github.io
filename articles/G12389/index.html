These are popular hares that Russian craftswomen fell in love with, fairies, Santa Claus, animals, snails, cats, bathers, Easter dolls.  In all models, the author’s idea slips, which we will explain in detail below, we also offer a <span>simple pattern of a</span> hare-tilde. </p><h2>  Features of tild toys </h2><ul><li>  All coffee color models.  The body, arms, legs, face of the same shade of tanned skin.  To achieve this, many craftswomen dye the white fabric with tea leaves, onion infusion. </li><li>  The clothes are bright, with different patterns, but not acidic colors.  Such patches can be found in patchwork kits. </li><li>  Toys can be of any size, but always voluminous.  Most often, the limbs, shoulders, head, neck are narrow, and the hips are wide. </li><li>  Patterns for hare-tilda, dolls, snails, cats, lambs, deer are very simple, even sketchy.  More often given patterns of hands, feet, ears, torso with the head, as well as male, female, children's clothing. </li><li>  The faces of all types are sketchy: embroidered eyes with dots, a small nose with a triangle or embossed, blush created by blushes, paints.  Sometimes the mouth is embroidered with a dash, an arc. </li><li>  Tilda is not just a toy and decoration element, but a whole “encyclopedia”.  Each model carries its own thematic idea, has a complete, concise image.  Wedding dolls are equipped with all the necessary attributes, couples - with children, home, furniture, Christmas toys - with festive elements ... </li></ul><h2>  <span>How to make a</span> tilde hare <span>pattern</span> ? </h2><p>  On the fabric folded in half, transfer the patterns of paws, ears, torso with the head.  A maximum of 3-4 centimeters should be left from the drawing line on all sides for allowances (if the material is not loose, then a couple of millimeters from the seam will be enough). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda hare pattern" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442237.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Many craftswomen pin the fabric with pins, and outlined lines are sewn with a machine stitch.  Then the details are cut with scissors, taking into account the allowances.  Next, the seam is ironed so that it does not puff, all parts of the body are turned “face”. </p><p>  Stuffed with syntepon, holofiber, red-hot buckwheat.  Paws when connected to the body with a filler are not completely filled to be carefully sewn with a hidden seam.  In order for the hare to stand, one thick wire is inserted into the legs, bent by an arc.  Paws (wire arc) insert into the body, secure with pins, process with a hidden stitch. </p><p>  The face is created after the whole rabbit is sewn in order to maintain harmony of the whole image.  That is, first they make all the details of the toy, then make patterns of dresses for tilda hares, dress them up, then embroider their face and sew on their ears. </p><h2>  What to dress hares with? </h2><p>  Create clothes from pastel, but bright materials.  For a girl and a boy, the pattern should be in harmony.  For example, a girl has striped underpants, a sarafan bodice, a hat hem, the inside of the ears, then a boy has ears, a cap, jumpsuit straps, and pants hem have the same pattern.  Usually dolls are small (no more than 20 centimeters), so pieces of fabric are suitable. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="clothes for tilde hare patterns" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442232.jpg" width="600"></div>

Summer clothes for a tilde hare are easily sewn.  <span>Overalls patterns</span> consist of trousers, a front and straps.  Make a pattern of trousers of free cut.  Measure the volume of the tummy, the distance from the navel to the end of the body.  Determine the length of the paws.  Pants for toys of this brand are always higher than the ankles (about a third). </p><p>  The boy will have trousers with a lapel from another fabric, so keep this in mind when translating the pattern.  Make two parts of the leg from checkered material, and a lapel from burgundy rectangles.  Connect all the details. </p><p>  Next, from the striped fabric, make the top of the overalls, sew the resulting rectangle to the legs in the middle.  Attach <span>web</span> buttons with buttons to the striped pocket. </p><h2>  Final details of the hare boy </h2><p>  Please note that the jumpsuit is “customized” on the toy.  If the hare performs a decorative role, then the outfit can be swept to the body with several stitches.  This is necessary if you want to emphasize the direction of clothing, cover the seams.  It remains to sew a cap to get a whole set.  Clothes for tilde hare are created without difficulty. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="do-it-yourself hare tilda patterns" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442234.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  <span>The cap</span> patterns resemble a mushroom cap, and at the inside of the curve the top is cut off.  The cap is made of two types of fabric: plain burgundy and striped.  As soon as you sew the “mushroom” and “trimmed” parts, then sew them together.  The “cut off” part will be the inside of the cap.  Create a boat shape. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Now attach ears to the hare, put on a cap.  Experiment with a different tilt of the headgear, the position of the ears.  Then fix each part with pins. </p><p>  Next, with a pencil, outline the closely set dots, eyes, nose-triangle, mouth.  Symmetry is created due to the seam of the body.  Mouline thread, iris embroider parts of the face.  Paint, blush, apply a slight blush.  In the last step, sew the ears, cap to the head.  That's all, we examined the pattern of the tilde hare in full. </p><h2>  Pattern clothes for girls </h2><p>  Feature patterns of clothing is simplicity and versatility.  That is, one pattern can be used for different models.  In our example, women's underpants are sewn according to the pattern of men's overalls, the hat is sewn according to the pattern of the cap, and the straps, bodice of the sarafan are sewn along the top of the jumpsuit. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="patterns for hare tilda" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442235.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  The underpants are sewn from striped fabric in full length in the same way as men's trousers, but without lapels.  Sew inside seams, put on a hare girl.  Bring down the bottom of the trousers, pull it along the paw, and also process the top of the underpants with tucks. </p><p>  Next, make patterns for dresses for tilda hares: </p><ul><li>  Cut two rectangles of burgundy, checkered. </li><li>  Connect the two parts. </li><li>  From striped, checkered material, cut out the hearts that will decorate the bottom of the sundress. </li><li>  Sew evenly hearts onto burgundy fabric. </li><li>  Cut the rectangular bodice out of striped fabric and the straps out of checkered material. </li><li>  Process them, sew to a sundress. </li></ul><p>  Now put the outfit on the hare, sew the straps, tucks on the dress according to the figure.  The hat is sewn in the same way as the cap, but is worn differently, like a women's hat. </p><h2>  How to make a hare-tilda with your own hands: patterns of a winter outfit </h2><p>  In autumn and winter, dolls can sew warm patterns.  The girl will be dressed in underpants, a skirt, a sweater, a hat, boots.  The skirt will begin not at the waist, but immediately under the paws.  From a checkered fabric, cut a wide rectangle, from one edge of which sew decorative braid, sew along the width.  Put the skirt on the hare, pinch the folds with pins, and process it with a <span>blind seam.</span> </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="hare tilda dress pattern" class="if" height="410" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442236.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Next, go to the sweater in which the hare-tilda will be dressed.  <span>The pattern of clothes</span> for the boy and girl will be the same.  On paper, draw a regular sweater to the size of your toy with a long collar, which you then fit.  Cut two pieces of clothing, sew the edges.  Embroider three snowflakes in front, put on a hare, bending the collar. </p><p>  Now sew a hat from soft fabric.  Just cut off the rectangle, connect the opposite edges.  String on one edge, sew on the pompom, and on the other hand, turn the cap.  Embroider a flower on the side.  Sew boots on a pattern of paws of a hare, adding 2-3 centimeters, in addition to allowance.  Men's winter set of sweaters, hats, boots do the same. </p><h2>  Rattle hare-tilda </h2><p>  Making a tilde-hare pattern in the form of a rattle is even easier.  Transfer 3 details to velvet, velveteen or other soft material: ears in the form of a propeller, a head with a short neck, and a ringlet.  Each item needs to be done in double quantity.  Use cotton / linen for the inside of the ears.  You will also need bells, satin ribbons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="tilda hare dress pattern" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442242.jpg" width="376"></div>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <p></p>
    <p>  First, grind all the details together.  Fill your head and ring with a padding polyester.  Put one or two bells in each ear, close the seam.  Sew your head to the ring.  Over the neck, tie a bow of satin ribbon, fasten with threads. </p><p>  Next, sew the ears to the head.  Pencil out eyes, nose, mouth.  Now floss, iris embroider all parts of the face.  The tilde rattle is ready.  Pay attention to the following points: </p><ul><li>  Do not make eyes out of beads, buttons, as a child can swallow them. </li><li>  If you use decorative bows, hats, then sew with a “dead” seam. </li><li>  Choose the size of the toy so that it is convenient for the child to pick up with his hands. </li><li>  Do not paint cheeks with paints, blush. </li></ul><h2>  Fat Tilda Rabbit </h2><p>  The thick fat hare looks like a pyramid.  He will need 15 parts: </p><ul><li>  4 parts for paws, ears; </li><li>  2 parts for a ponytail, a head with a neck, lateral parts of the body; </li><li>  1 before. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="dress patterns for hares tilda" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/17484/442230.jpg" width="346"></div></li></ul><p>  From these details we get a hare-tilde.  The pattern of clothes is represented by 4 elements: </p><ul><li>  one back; </li><li>  two halves of the front; </li><li>  one collar; </li><li>  two sleeves. </li></ul><p>  Start with a hare.  Sew at the seams three parts of the body.  Fill it with a synthetic winterizer, you get a volumetric triangle.  Next, connect the parts of the tail, fill with holofiber, sew to the body.  Also do with the front legs.  If you want them to bend, sew a line near the elbow and insert the wire there. </p><p>  Now connect the parts of the head, stuff with a padding polyester, stitch it to the body.  From above, attach straight ears in which the wire frame stands.  Next, go to the sewing of the jacket-vest.  First, stitch the shoulder folds and sleeves along the armhole, then the collar goes, you finish to grind the side seams.  Put on a hare, decorate buttons.  With the last step, embroider your face and apply blush. </p><h2>  Summarizing </h2><p>  Tildomania is still thriving in the world!  Textile toys are popular for their simplicity, safety and originality.  Designer dolls can be sewn for yourself and your children or for sale.  Now many needlewomen add their ideas to the creation of tildes, so the originals can only be found in the books of Tony Finnanger. </p><p>  Each author’s book is devoted to one model of toys (angels, birds, tilda-hare).  <span>Pattern dresses</span> for girls, trousers for boys and even houses, vegetables, all kinds of attributes - all this is available in the designer’s publications.  Choose models, sew original textile toys! </p>
