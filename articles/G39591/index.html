    <p>  The history of the park is directly related to the development of the Novosibirsk region of the same name.  In 1925, a specially created commission prepared a preliminary redevelopment project for Novonikolaevsk (present-day Novosibirsk), where special attention was paid to the landscaping and conservation of the Zaeltsovskaya forest park zone of the city. </p><p>  According to the architects' plans, the city should have been decorated with squares and boulevards.  For the rest of the townspeople, the Zaeltsovsky Park was organized, where it was planned to build cottages, sports grounds and rest houses.  An interesting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthose years was the construction of a zoo or ethnic park. </p><p>  The opening of the park took place in June 1932.  Over time, paths were equipped here and rides, summer variety platforms and a children's town were established.  They also put in order the coastal territory of the park, where the Ob River became a continuation of the recreation area.  Only decades later, a zoo was built, and a little later a children's railway appeared. </p><h2>  Park reviews </h2>
