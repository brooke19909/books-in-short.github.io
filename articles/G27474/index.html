It is believed that it was installed on the grave of brother Rurik, who in the 9th century was called to reign in Russia.  According to surviving chronicles, Truvor lived precisely in Izborsk, where he died.  Most modern historians and scholars are skeptical of this statement, stating that the cross was erected much later.  But the legend lives on annually attracting a large number of tourists. </p><h2>  Ancient settlement </h2><div class="photo" data-original="feography.livejournal.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Settlement in Izborsk" class="if uuid-2732564" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2732564.jpg"></div><p>  The old Izborsk fortification, in which Truvorov cross is located, is located near the ancient city of Izborsk.  It belongs to the VII-XVIII centuries.  In fact, it is a pointed cape of a triangular shape, located on a raised plateau at an altitude of about 48 meters.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthis settlement is about one hectare.  It is reliably protected on one side by a 6-meter shaft, and on the other, by a 3-meter deep moat. </p><p>  Izborsk itself is an old Russian city, the first mention of which occurs in 862.  Now it is located in the Pechora district of the Pskov region.  An initial chronicler writes about him, noting that this was the center of the Krivichi population along with Polotsk and Smolensk. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Now it is a village with less than 800 inhabitants.  Now it is part of the urban settlement "Pechory", previously it was the administrative center of a rural settlement called "Izborsk volost". </p><p>  Old Izborsk or Truvorovo hillforts are the main attraction of this village. </p><h2>  Cross </h2><div class="photo" data-original="anashina.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Truvorov cross in Izborsk" class="if uuid-2732565" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2732565.jpg"></div><p>  Truvorov cross in Izborsk stands at the very entrance to the fort.  It is made of stone, the height is two meters 36 centimeters, and the distance between the horizontal edges is one meter 42 centimeters.  Cut down from a single limestone slab. </p><p>  Truvorov's cross has a very unusual and peculiar form.  The upper and two lateral ends expand slightly to the edges from the center.  At the same time, the lower part has no extensions, its sides are almost completely parallel. </p><p>  On the Truvor Cross there is an inscription that says "CHRIST'S SLA IS IS XH NIKA."  This means "King of Glory Jesus Christ Nick."  It is characteristic and even typical of stone crosses, which can be found in the northwestern regions of Russia.  In the middle of the Truvorov cross, a cross is carved at the foot with eight ends. </p><h2>  Legend </h2><div class="photo" data-original="www.zapoved.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Museum-Reserve Izborsk" class="if uuid-2732569" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2732569.jpg"></div><p>  Most likely, its impressive size and became the basis for stories that it was installed for a reason.  According to legend, Truvorov cross is located on the grave of Truvor, who arrived to rule Russia along with his brothers Sineus and Rurik.  According to the chronicles of that time, he reigned in Izborsk for two years, and then died.  This happened in 864. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  The description of Truvorov's cross is impressive.  But, based on the paleographic features, the researchers claim that it was installed only in the XIV or XV centuries.  From this it should be concluded that in reality he can have nothing to do with Truvor, although the legend of Izborsk asserts the opposite.  Truvorov's cross, most likely, was erected by the Izborians at the entrance to the old settlement, when it became already abandoned.  Presumably, this was done to remind locals and everyone around about where the ancient Russian city was originally located. </p><h2>  Slabs </h2><p>  Many explorers and travelers are attracted by the plates located next to the cross.  Some geometric shapes are scratched on them. </p><p>  Of most interest is a square of regular shape with two squares, smaller in size, which seem to fit into it.  In this case, the sides of the square are interconnected by dashes. </p><p>  Presumably, this plate was the original board for the Russian folk game of the "mill", which was widespread and extremely popular in the Middle Ages. </p><p>  On another significant Izborsk plate you can see figures carved in the form of a small triangle and stairs.  The meaning of these figures cannot be clarified to date.  There are various assumptions, but none of them is so far true. </p><h2>  Mention in literature </h2><div class="photo" data-original="900igr.net" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Grave of Bunin" class="if uuid-2732568" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2732568.jpg"></div><p>  The majestic and mysterious image of this cross attracts not only historians and researchers, but also poets.  And even modern ones.  For example, poems about Izborsk, Truvorov cross can be found at Eva Gushchina. </p><blockquote><p>  Boulders, boulders in vast fields, </p><p>  In the vast expanses of my Motherland. </p><p>  And maybe all this is ‚Äúbirthmarks,‚Äù </p><p>  To remember: where, what kind of blood are we from? </p><p>  These colors are discreet, these summers are dim </p><p>  A dove spilled from lakes and skies </p><p>  Clouds domes, rainbows light arches, - </p><p>  Here an unprecedented cross Truvorov was born. </p><p>  The cross is a tombstone, eternity, and the cross commemoration, </p><p>  Memory of Truvor, glorious Varyazhsky princes. </p><p>  At the grave of Bunin through the distance </p><p>  He is like a messenger from distant Izborsk fields! </p></blockquote><p>  The mention of Ivan Alekseevich Bunin in this text is by no means accidental.  The famous Russian poet, the first Russian writer who became a Nobel Prize in Literature, was so impressed with this cross at the time that he asked to install a copy on his grave.  The will of Bunin was fulfilled: today, in the suburb of Paris, at the cemetery where the writer is buried, there is an almost identical "twin" of Truvorov's cross, symbolizing the Russian strength and power of the domestic spirit. </p><h2>  History of the hillfort </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pskovvizit.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Truvorovo hillfort" class="if uuid-2732563" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2732563.jpg"></div><p>  Separately, it is worth telling about the ancient settlement, on the territory of which this cross is now installed.  The settlement on this site was founded in the late VII - early VIII centuries.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe settlement in those days was approximately seven thousand square meters. </p><p>  In addition to the Slavic terrestrial log cabins, in which there were clay stoves and wooden floors, in one of the corners of the settlement there were buildings in which the non-Slavic population lived.  They were with adobe foci and floors.  About one tenth of Izborsk ceramics belongs to the Baltic-Finnish Ryugian type. </p><p>  In this settlement, as in many other places in the north-west of Russia at that time, in the 8th and 9th centuries, foundry molds became very widespread.  Exactly the same can be found in Kamno, Pskov, Ladoga, Ryuge.  They are made of limestone, and were the result of a revival of fashion for such jewelry, which first appeared in Prague culture in the late VI - early VII centuries. </p><h2>  Fire in Izborsk </h2><div class="photo" data-original="pechori.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="City Izborsk" class="if uuid-2732567" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/43131/2732567.jpg"></div><p>  At the beginning of the 10th century, a strong fire occurred in Izborsk, as a result of which the settlement turned from a tribal center into an early medieval city with a so-called two-part structure.  At the same time, the cape of the settlement turned into a princely retinue, which was surrounded by a powerful wall of oak logs around the perimeter.  A gate was installed between them.  It was in this kid that household items, jewelry and weapons were discovered. </p><p>  But the artisans lived separately.  They were located in a roundabout city, which was called Posad.  It was protected by an arcuate rampart consisting of a stone wall, clay and a moat. </p><p>  Near the settlement there is an ancient cemetery on which crosses dating from the 15th century are preserved.  One of them is the famous Truvor Cross. </p><p>  Interestingly, the Russian Empress Catherine II believed in the legend of Truvor‚Äôs grave.  She even ordered a medal to be made in his honor.  On the front side was a fictional portrait of Rurik (since reliable images of the prince were not preserved).  Truvorov Kurgan was carved on the reverse side, there was an inscription: "Truvor died in Izborsk in 864." </p><p>  In 1972, large-scale archaeological excavations were carried out in these places.  On the territory of the settlement was discovered a stone dated to the XIV century.  A Cyrillic inscription was carved on it. </p><h2>  Prince Truvor </h2><p>  Of the three brothers who were called to reign in Russia, Truvor and Sineus were remembered less than the rest.  Both died just two years after they arrived on Russian lands. </p><p>  If Truvor ruled in Izborsk, then Sineus settled in Beloozero.  After their death, Rurik, who ruled in Novgorod, became the sole ruler. </p>
