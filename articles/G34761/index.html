  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cost of living: laugh or cry?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The question of what should be the cost of living and how it is generally calculated worries all those who have a rather acute shortage of money in their lives.  Indeed, when you read summaries and tables on the subsistence level, it seems that a person who, due to his large salary, was not used to counting money at all, was calculating these amounts.  After all, the amounts are so ridiculous, as if <span>this is a summary</span> of the content of slaves. </p><p>  It would seem, what difference does it make there?  A lonely person who simply lives on an ordinary salary, or a businessman, really does not care about what a living wage he has been measured: as a rule, it is not at all difficult to earn an amount exceeding it yourself.  But the situation is completely different if you are a senior citizen, disabled, if you have many children and a small salary, if you receive benefits and you need benefits ... </p><p>  Here it is almost impossible to achieve at least some justice.  Suppose a person does not earn in his work the amount that would be equal to the cost of living or exceed it.  This is a frequent case in "deaf" settlements, where 10 people have 1 job.  This situation also develops in families where there are children - because then one person earns not only for himself, but also for others.  In such cases, privileges are laid, which are very difficult to achieve.  In addition, the state will not even be able to offer a job with which it would be possible to get so much.  This situation is particularly relevant in rural areas, where there are not many jobs and the average <span>wage</span> leaves much to be desired.  In order not to be unfounded, we will write in more detail. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  An incomplete family lives in the <span>countryside</span> - a mother and two children of <span>primary school age.</span>  Dad is somewhere far away, and perhaps he is an alcoholic and lives on the next street.  It‚Äôs sad, but true: there are a lot of families broken up for this reason.  But we will not leave the topic. </p><p>  In general, the family has three people.  As you know, the cost of living in each region is different, but it is approximately the same: about 6,000 per child and about 6,700 per adult.  A family should receive almost 19,000 at all.  Is this a lot?  To be objective, of course not.  Such a family needs about 8 thousand for ordinary food.  There is also <span>payment for utilities.</span>  As well as buying clothes, especially for children who are known to grow from these clothes every year.  Not to mention the school, where every year they began to demand the purchase of new textbooks in all subjects. </p><p>  And it‚Äôs only monthly expenses!  What to say about buying furniture, household appliances, repair?  It will be possible to put off quite a bit, and life at a living wage will turn out, indeed, measured and very modest.  But it‚Äôs advisable to teach children after school somewhere, at least in college, and this is also money.  Will it be possible to postpone something? </p><p>  Evil languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill support such a topic with joy.  Like, the mother is a failure, she is to blame, and so on.  But this is not the point, we all sometimes make mistakes and sometimes find ourselves in unpleasant situations.  In addition, why talk about the past, because we live in the present. </p><p>  The bottom line is that even this minimum earn in the village is very difficult, because  This is the average city salary.  Allocated benefits usually save no more than a thousand rubles.  As a result, the mother travels to the city and spends daily on travel.  Usually this costs from a thousand a month, plus someone needs to look after the children, because those who work in the city usually return home late. </p><p>  Of course, the authorities do not take this into account.  Moreover: if such a dedicated mother will earn 15,000 rubles + pension contributions and go to ask for benefits, she will be refused.  Because with deductions it will turn out just the norm for three.  The fact that no one except the bank saw this money does not concern the authorities.  Such a sad situation. </p><p>  The cost of living in Moscow is about 9,500 rubles, but for the capital this is not a serious amount.  What is the fare, because in Moscow it is one and a half times more expensive than throughout Russia.  In addition, the children here tend to look better, respectively, more expensive to dress. </p><p>  Also, the <span>cost of living in the Moscow</span> region.  A lot of people living there work in the capital.  And this is gasoline, travel, and late return home, therefore, children should be under someone's supervision, and it is good if someone is ready to come to them for free. </p><p>  It would seem that everything is bad, but this should also teach us something.  First of all, the fact that you should not rely on the state.  It‚Äôs better to save money whenever possible, invest, and open your own business.  And everything will be much more positive, although not immediately. </p>
