Cards of this type are currently offered by a sufficiently large number of banks, and each one puts forward its own terms of cooperation.  It is for this reason that many people begin to think about how to choose the right cards and use them in the future. </p><h2>  What is it? </h2>

    <p>  Profitable cards are accounts on which the bank will constantly accrue interest, depending on how much money is left in the account.  It is worth noting that such a card itself is a credit or debit card, but at the same time, interest on the balance is accrued exclusively in the case of a credit account. </p><h2>  Which to choose? </h2><p>  Today, income cards offer a wide variety of interest calculation schemes.  Consider them below. </p><h2>  Monthly bonus </h2>

Thus, for example, in accordance with the terms of Promsvyazbank, this minimum is 15,000 rubles, for which the client will be given a bonus of 4.5%, while Binbank provides the opportunity to keep up to 10,000 in your account, and while making a fixed rate of 5%.  With this example, you can very clearly understand how revenue cards vary depending on the institution in which you prefer to issue them. </p><h2>  Daily bonus </h2>

    <p>  Promsvyazbank offers its customers an all-inclusive card, but they don‚Äôt really know what conditions are offered in this option and whether they correspond to their name. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  Profitable credit cards by themselves from this bank are not provided, and in accordance with this proposal, the card can be a settlement or debit.  At the same time, the card uses contactless payment technology and an additional chip designed to provide increased security.  It is worth noting the fact that despite the fact that this card does not provide a credit limit, there is the possibility of obtaining several pleasant bonuses that allow you to get a pleasant income. </p><h2>  What are these bonuses? </h2><p>  First of all, it is worth noting cash back, the size of which is 5%.  Of course, such a return is far from being made for any non-cash purchases, but only for those purchases that are made in a certain category.  If necessary, you can change the category, he such a procedure is carried out no more than once every three months.  The maximum possible amount of remuneration is 1,000 rubles per calendar month. </p><p>  For those who received this card before November 1, it is possible to accrue interest on the balance.  All others can separately open a <span>savings account</span> in this bank, after which they constantly receive 6% for the amount that they placed in rubles. </p><p>  Card service is fully or almost free.  Completely free maintenance is provided if the permanent balance on your card is more than 50,000 rubles or if you make purchases worth more than 30,000 rubles every month.  It is worth noting that the service fee is paid every month or once a year, depending on which option is more acceptable for you.  For example, if a profitable <span>bank card is</span> paid immediately for a year in advance, but at the same time, on average, you had the necessary expenses or the balance, then in this case the next move automatically becomes free for you. </p><p>  Each owner of such a card automatically becomes a member of the PSBonus bonus program.  For every 150 rubles you spend, you are given 10 points equivalent to one additional ruble.  It will be possible to spend the received points after you spend 7000 points, which are used to pay no more than 90% of the total purchase price in one of the companies that are partners of this bank.  Among other things, you can also use bonus money for subsequent payment of a monthly card service. </p><p>  It is possible to issue two cards for relatives absolutely free, and at the same time everyone will be provided with free SMS information. </p><h2>  Rocketbank </h2>

    <p>  The offer from Rocketbank is included in the best revenue cards among all offered to date.  This card is issued by Interkommerts Bank, and it is on this card that all the money that you will credit to the card will be stored.  It is worth noting that it is at this stage that the participation of this bank completely ends, as a result of which a separate specialized team of IT specialists is already working.  A high-quality application for a smartphone initially represented the main advantage that distinguished this bank, but over time several more significant advantages were added for this card.  Despite the fact that it is impossible to get a loan with this card, it represents one of the most optimal offers for choosing. </p><h2>  Cost </h2><p>  No matter how surprising this may sound for other countries, in Russia today they take money to ensure that a person can keep their own funds in the bank, but in this regard, Rocketbank also offers a lot of useful features and bonuses.  At the same time, it should be noted that the service of this card can be absolutely free if the user connects to the ‚ÄúLight‚Äù tariff and monthly conducts operations worth more than 30,000 rubles.  Everyone else pays 75 or 290 rubles a month. </p><p>  Choosing the ‚ÄúLight‚Äù tariff, you are provided with five free withdrawals at ATMs, as well as the possibility of conducting external transfers with a commission of up to 0.5%.  In addition, from all purchases made by bank transfer, the customer is provided with a flash back of 1%. </p><p>  If the ‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù tariff is used, the cost of which is 290 rubles, 10 times the money is withdrawn without commission and sent to other banks without commission, while the reward for purchases reaches 1.5%.  Thus, if you spend more than 58 thousand rubles on a card every month, then an increase in cashback by 0.5% will allow you to completely cover this commission. </p><p>  The same Sberbank income card gives only 3.5% of the balance, but there is no cashback at all. </p><h2>  Balance income </h2><p>  The conditions of this card allow you to receive income on the balance, the amount of which is 9% per annum, but at the same time 30-300 thousand rubles should be present on the account.  Limiting the minimum amount is not so attractive, since most other banks do not have it, but at the same time, in comparison with its direct competitors, Rocket provides slightly more, therefore a mutually beneficial offer is formed. </p><p>  Again, with each purchase you will receive a certain part back if you conduct them by bank transfer.  It is worth noting that this card provides you 1% from any purchases, while other cards allow you to save up to 5%, but only from a certain range of categories or with the compulsory need to purchase in certain companies. </p><p>  Approximately similar in annual rate is the Binbank income card, but again, it does not have such a nice cashback function, which is quite important from the point of view of economy. </p><h2>  Main advantage </h2><p>  Despite the fact that by its terms, this card is quite profitable, as mentioned above, its advantage is the ability to manage their own funds through a standard iPhone. </p><p>  Using a specialized application, it will be possible to group your own expenses into categories, and then without any difficulty to monitor where your budget is used.  At the same time, the user has all the possibilities in order to affix tags that will be most optimal for him.  Among other things, there is also a joint budget function, when several cards are combined into a full network. </p><p>  Also, this bank offers an absolutely unique transfer system, when you simply select a name in the notebook, then drive in the amount and send the funds.  Then the recipient receives an SMS message with which he can decide where the received amount will be credited ‚Äî to a bank account or phone.  If a client pays 290 rubles a month, for him such messages are absolutely free. </p><h2>  Other options </h2>
