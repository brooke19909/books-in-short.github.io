    <h2>  What is gypsum? </h2><p>  Before answering the question of how to properly breed gypsum for crafts, it is worth figuring out what kind of material.  First of all, it is very plastic.  Gypsum can be applied to almost any type of surface.  The material is easy to process and hardens quickly.  Gypsum is used in many industries: as a fertilizer, as one of the components of paper and pulp production, as a component of enamels and paints.  The material is also used for the manufacture of internal decorative elements.  Often, gypsum is used as an astringent component in construction. </p><h2>  Material flaws </h2><p>  Since cultivating gypsum for crafts is a simple process, it is worth considering certain disadvantages of the material.  This will greatly facilitate the work with him.  First of all, gypsum has low hygroscopicity and strength.  Therefore, it is not recommended to use decor elements made of this material in rooms with high humidity.  In such situations, additional processing is required.  For reliability, finished crafts should be covered with a coating layer that protects from moisture. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  Before you start, you should take into account the hygroscopicity of gypsum products.  They absorb any coating well.  Therefore, it is recommended to apply a primer layer on the surface of the product.  Only then can a moisture-proof coating be used. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to breed gypsum for crafts proportions" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1600722.jpg"></div>

    <h2>  How many crafts do they dry? </h2><p>  Now you know how to breed gypsum for crafts.  How much do the products dry?  Gypsum solution is seized and gradually solidifies 4 minutes after its manufacture.  Therefore, work with the finished material should be quick and accurate.  Full hardening of gypsum occurs within half an hour.  To set the solution more slowly, it is worth adding a little water-soluble glue on an animal basis to the solution. </p><h2>  What can replace gypsum </h2><p>  At the moment, many sets for creativity are on sale.  How to breed plaster for Lori crafts, and the material from other sets for creating figurines, as a rule, is always indicated in the instructions.  It should be studied before starting work, as the solution dries quickly.  It should be noted that some sets for creativity use analogues of gypsum.  The most common of them is alabaster. </p><p>  This powder has a grayish tint and has a finely divided structure.  The material is obtained as a result of heat treatment of two-water gypsum.  Thanks to this, the finished solution received completely different characteristics.  It is worth noting that outwardly alabaster and gypsum are very similar. </p><h2>  How is alabaster different from gypsum </h2><p>  Among the main differences of these substances, it is worth highlighting: </p><ol><li>  Alabaster sets very quickly after kneading.  Therefore, you can use the substance only after making a certain number of additives during the preparation of the solution.  They slow down the setting of alabaster. </li><li>  Alabaster is a harder material than gypsum.  Defining this is easy.  It is enough to touch the finished product. </li><li>  Gypsum is a safer substance for humans than alabaster. <div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="how to breed gypsum for crafts" class="if" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1600714.jpg"></div></li></ol><h2>  How much do alabaster crafts </h2><p>  You can determine the solidification time of the material by studying the technical characteristics of the mixture.  In general, the setting of the alabaster solution is observed 6 minutes after the dilution of the substance.  Partial solidification occurs after 30 minutes.  It is worth noting that a stronger and dried solution is able to withstand a load of 5 MPa.  The alabaster dries completely within 1-2 days.  Despite the fact that products made of this material are stronger, it is not recommended to use the solution for children, since it is not completely safe for health.  Gypsum is preferable in this case. </p>
