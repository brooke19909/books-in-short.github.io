Although the airport appeared in the capital of Tatarstan in 1979, only by 1986 was it assigned the category of international.  At the turn of the millennium, it was decided by the authorities to completely reconstruct the premises of such an important transport part of the city.  By 2005, the residents of Kazan had the opportunity to use the largest liners in the world, receive planes of politicians and ministers of other countries, heads of state. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.glavny.tv" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Kazan airport" class="if uuid-2540854" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540854.jpg"></div><p>  Now the work has been resumed, as the country is preparing to receive fans and teams of the world football championship.  They promise to complete the re-reconstruction by the current 2018. </p><h2>  Hotel location near the airport </h2><p>  Hotel Polet in Kazan is located just 270 meters from terminal 1 of the airport.  If you have an early departure, or you arrived late and do not want to get through the whole city to its central part at night, then this hotel is just for you.  Finding it is easy, just walk through the airport building and across the road you will see a multi-story building with ample parking in front of it.  If you leave the city for a few days, you can safely leave your car, but, of course, you will have to thank the guard. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo google-map" data-lat="55.791927566137694" data-lng="49.17642984404142" data-type="roadmap" data-zoom="17"><img itemprop="image" class="image-map" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/m/4/3/6/9/4369.png"></div><p>  The address of the Polet hotel at <span>the Kazan airport is</span> as follows: ul.  Aeroportovskaya, d. 3. According to reviews of transit passengers who spent the night at the hotel, not all of the building is occupied by Flight numbers.  The first 3 floors belong to the hotel, and the rest of the premises is converted into apartments. </p><p>  In the article, we will consider what amenities and services await tired travelers within the walls of the Polet Hotel in Kazan.  It will also be interesting for the reader to learn about the quality of service, the true reviews of vacationers about the facilities of the institution. </p><h2>  Hotel Description </h2><p>  The nine-story building looks very modern and presentable, a large beautiful sign says that the hotel is in front of travelers.  But already at the front door, people understand that the decoration of the Polet Hotel in Kazan is outdated, even reminiscent of Soviet times.  As mentioned earlier, the rooms occupy the first 3 floors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.tripadvisor.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Hotel &quot;Flight&quot;" class="if uuid-2540807" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540807.jpg"></div><p>  Since this institution is located at a short distance from the runways, it is clear that basically only the passengers of aircraft who have just arrived or have an early departure are staying in the hotel rooms.  They are drawn up for a settlement on the ground floor, the administrator is greeted by guests, who, according to numerous reviews of vacationers, are not famous for their culture of behavior.  So be prepared that the meeting in the lobby will be cold. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"><div class="vn-visible-inventory-mark_Format_ContentRoll__0-vn-module__8cl"></div><div class="vn-player" style="box-sizing: border-box; overflow: hidden; width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; z-index: 0; margin: auto;"><div style="position: absolute; top: 0px; right: 0px; bottom: 0px; left: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0; text-align: center;"><iframe height="100%" width="100%" hspace="0" vspace="0" marginleft="0" marginright="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay" sandbox="allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-popups allow-top-navigation" src="about:blank" style="position: relative; z-index: 1; width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: none; overflow: hidden; max-width: initial; max-height: initial;" class="vn-container-iframe"></iframe></div></div></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Many people who are tired on the road know that they have no choice, they don‚Äôt want to go to another hotel, especially go far, so they don‚Äôt pay attention to such trifles as a rude and unfriendly administrator, but rather they want to settle in and get enough sleep. </p><h2>  Interior decoration </h2><p>  In the lobby of the Polet Hotel in Kazan there is an administrator desk, plastic chairs with metal legs, several artificial leather tables and sofas, between which are metal welded racks for indoor plants. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveltipz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="hotel lobby" class="if uuid-2540830" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540830.jpg"></div><p>  The walls are unpretentiously painted in cool blue.  The floor is tiled, also combines blue and neutral light gray shades.  The room is spacious and bright, cleanly cleaned.  There is a security guard near the entrance door, so it is safe to say that no one will disturb the sleeping tourists at night.  Of the minuses, tourists in the reviews about the Polet hotel in Kazan noted the lack of Internet and Wi-Fi, so with all the desire to call or write to relatives, it will not be possible, especially since they do not give outsiders a phone for calls (free of charge). </p><h2>  Hotel rooms </h2><p>  A total of 60 rooms are located on three floors.  There are standard inexpensive rooms that will cost tourists 1,500 rubles per night.  Each room has a shower, toilet, washbasin.  The rooms in this category can accommodate from 2 to 5 people.  Single beds with wooden backs.  The furniture is not very modern, but in fair condition. </p><div class="photo" data-original="traveltipz.ru" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="number of the second category" class="if uuid-2540829" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540829.jpg"></div><p>  For the desire to use a TV, refrigerator or call relatives will have to pay extra.  You also need to fork out separately to sleep on the sheet and hide behind a blanket in a duvet cover.  If you want to take a shower, then get your wallet too.  Some reviews contain photos with broken tiles in the toilet, they write that the repair, apparently, was carried out for a long time, this hotel in Kazan would not hurt to refresh. </p><p>  Other tourists write that the hotel is quite suitable for sleeping one night, the beds are clean, the rooms are spacious, there is no noise in the room, since there is no restaurant or dining room.  If you want to spend the night in more comfortable conditions, then consider the following option of settlement. </p><h2>  Superior rooms </h2><p>  Describing this Kazan hotel, it is worth noting the availability of rooms with a high level of comfort, but their cost will be from 3000 to 4000 rubles. </p><p>  The rooms of the first category are an option for two with a large double bed, beautiful panels on the walls, bright bedspreads.  The bathroom is tiled, has a bath with a shower, a washbasin with a large mirror and a toilet.  There is a small old-style TV suspended on the wall with a control panel. </p><h2>  Studio </h2><p>  The highest price at the Polet Hotel in Kazan will have to be paid for a rather beautiful room.  This is a spacious studio with a plasma TV and a double bed with comfortable orthopedic mattresses.  Near the bed are small bedside tables.  On the windows are beautifully draped curtains. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kazan.aero" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="studio room" class="if uuid-2540822" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540822.jpg"></div><p>  There is a dressing table with a mirror and a desk.  The bathroom, in which a decent repair is made, will also impress guests. The walls are lined with beautiful modern tiles.  Most of the bathroom is a semicircular bath with shower.  All plumbing is new and clean.  It can be seen that the rooms are cleaned carefully, complaints about the lack of cleaning in such rooms have never been in the reviews. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kazan.aero" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Superior rooms" class="if uuid-2540823" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/53302/2540823.jpg"></div><p>  Shower accessories are paid separately, so if you want to wash before the road, you can take everything you need from the administrator.  Some rooms have a shower. </p><h2>  Additional services </h2><p>  There is no restaurant or cafe in the Polet Hotel in Kazan, but, according to tourists, you can eat at the airport.  But hotel staff for an additional fee can make it possible to use the ironing room, because even on a trip you want to look fresh and well-groomed. </p><p>  You can also order a taxi or send a fax.
