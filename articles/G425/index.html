Preserving its originality and unique atmosphere, it attracted creative people from all over the world who found peace and inspiration here.  The many-faced Cadaqu√©s (Spain), which has earned the glory of a paradise, is the birthplace of surrealism: the famous S. Dali and his muse Gala lived nearby. </p><h2>  The charm of a serene life </h2><p>  The calm town in the north of the Costa Brava (stripes of the Mediterranean coast in Catalonia) many centuries ago was a miniature fishing village isolated from the rest of the world, since it was possible to reach it only by sea.  That is why Cadaques, with its attractive power, has retained the charm of a measured and serene life, which so attracts tourists from different countries.  Located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, near the border with France, it has a rich history, which was reflected in the outward appearance of the colorful Cadaqu√©s (Spain). </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Adakes Spain Description" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1862227.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Travelers note that a secluded resort, lost among olive groves, is completely different from the rest of the Costa Brava.  In the 50s of the last century, representatives of the creative elite spent time here, thanks to which this picturesque place became a cult.  Only those who have visited a quiet town and admired the magnificent beauty of these places can understand why famous artists, whose heart was forever conquered by a beautiful corner, sought so much here. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Spanish pearl </h2><p>  Adakes, Spain, the description of which causes an irresistible desire to definitely visit here, is pretty snow-white houses, narrow cobbled streets paved with cobblestones, moored fishing boats, friendly locals, a serene atmosphere.  The majestic Pyrenees descend into the azure waters, and a delightful mountain landscape harmoniously coexists with the clear blue sea open spaces. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="spain cadaqu√©s" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1862174.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  A quiet and elegant town is characterized by an interesting design of houses made in the Gothic style.  The fact is that a century ago, local fishermen went to work and returned quite wealthy.  They built themselves luxurious mansions without saving on interiors.  You can see a villa with a polygonal viewing tower or a house with wrought-iron balconies, unusually looking against the background of other buildings. </p><h2>  Church of Santa Maria </h2><p>  In the attractive Cadaqu√©s (Spain), isolated from the surrounding world by cliffs, is located on the highest place the ancient church of Santa Maria, whose appearance is quite modest and does not cause any interest among guests.  However, it is worth going inside, and a magnificent baroque altar more than 20 meters high will delight even many tourists who have seen it.  A carved gilded masterpiece is a real work of art that you want to admire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="adakes spain reviews" class="if" height="412" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1862216.jpg" width="550"></div>

Dali lived and worked in the neighboring bay of Port Lligat.  Unusually looking building, consisting of several rooms, the artist designed in person.  Seven fishing huts, built in the form of an intricate maze, are a museum house recognized as a national treasure.  Here is the famous Whisper room with finely thought out acoustics, and guests will hear any word spoken at a distance of ten meters.  Any tourist who is interested in the work of a genius can get into the building where the master spent his best years and painted famous paintings in the style of surrealism. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="cadaques spain attractions" class="if" height="332" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/38945/1862203.jpg" width="600"></div>

    <p>  Of course, an acquaintance with an unforgettable city would not be complete without a visit to the Museum of Modern Art, which houses the paintings of one of the most successful artists of the 20th century, and the private museum of Pierre Moore, Secretary of Dali, who exhibited works of European art in the building of the former theater. </p><h2>  Adakes, Spain: reviews </h2><p>  Tourists who visited the ancient village, declare her love.  Indeed, this is a stunning corner with crystal clear water, on the surface of which boats sway, and on the shore of a rocky bay hut pretty snow-white houses, silently telling about the fishing past of the Spanish pearl.  It is no coincidence that walks along the coastline are the most favorite pastime of vacationers.  The fabulously beautiful Cadaqu√©s in Spain is surrounded by rocky landscapes called by Salvador Dali "geological delirium". </p><p>  Everyone who has been here is eager to get here again in order to once again feel the mysterious charm of the Spanish pearl.  A city of paints, over which time has no power, lives its own life, and the feeling of unreality haunts all the guests.  Even in the busy high season, in some surprising way, peace and tranquility reign in the village. </p>
