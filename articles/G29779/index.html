    <h2>  Karpov Sergey Pavlovich: biography </h2><p>  Information about life, except for the work to which he is completely given, is practically absent.  Sergey Karpov was born in the Stavropol Territory on 01/01/1948 in an intelligent family.  The young man graduated from school number 1 of his native city and for excellent success received a gold medal.  He immediately entered Moscow State University.  Lomonosov.  During study, the student was most interested in the history of the Middle Ages.  His success was recognized and encouraged in the form of a personal scholarship.  When Sergey Karpov graduated from the Faculty of History, he was left to study in graduate school.  As a graduate student, he prepared for defense a Ph.D. thesis ‚ÄúThe Trebizond Empire and the States of Europe in the XIII-XV Centuries‚Äù.  This tiny empire was a fragment of the empire of the Great Comnenus, located on the southern shores of the Black Sea and bordered on the Iconic Sultanate and the Nicene Empire. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karpov Sergey Pavlovich historian" class="if" height="397" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1391743.jpg" width="600"></div>  After the arrival of the Mongols, its territory was further reduced.  S. P. Karpov repeatedly returned to this topic, having written the deep works ‚ÄúItalian Maritime Republics and the Southern Black Sea Region in the 13th-15th Centuries: Problems of Trade‚Äù (1990) and ‚ÄúHistory of the Trebizond Empire‚Äù (2007).

This required not only knowledge of the Greek language, which he used while working on the Trebizun Empire, but now also Italian.  He studied the documentation of the Roman Empire, which we used to call the Byzantine Empire, conducted a large scientific work devoted to the Black Sea, and explored relations with Ancient Russia.  The result was a doctoral dissertation. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karpov Sergey Pavlovich biography" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1391745.jpg" width="600"></div>  It highlighted two rival maritime <span>republics: the Genoese</span> and the Venetian.  They are extremely interesting and exciting, although it is unfortunate that they are extremely short, verified, logical, full of new information, and lectures on all these topics, which were delivered by Sergey Karpov as part of the Academy course on the Culture TV channel.  They leave an unforgettable impression of the erudition of the professor and the workshop of the presentation of complex material.

    <h2>  Scientific activity </h2><p>  Karpov Sergey Pavlovich - historian, specialist in the Middle Ages, diplomacy of this time, as well as an archivist who deeply knows the economic history of this period.  The huge work of S.P. Karpov in the archives of Venice and Genoa opened for the first time to the whole world a system of connections of the Black Sea region with the sea city-states of Italy.  He summarized the history of the development of relations that arose between people in the process of production and sale in the Middle Ages.  The professor investigated the colonization of the Black Sea as a phenomenon and revealed the essence of this process.  Since almost no documents were preserved from Ancient Rus and the Roman Empire, everything possible was found by S. P. Karpov in Italy.  Thanks to these studies, the connection between Russia and Byzantium was studied. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  He also objectively and conclusively established what relations existed between the peoples of Byzantium, figured out their beliefs (Orthodoxy), the language spoken by the people and the aristocracy, established what trading settlements of Genoese and Venetian merchants were in Tan and what they traded.  S.P. Karpov published about four hundred <span>scientific papers.</span>  Under his leadership, twelve candidates of science were trained. </p><h2>  Nightmare of 2002 </h2><p>  On March 19, when the dean was brought home by a company car, he rang the intercom and his wife opened the door.  At the entrance, a criminal (and?) Was already waiting for him.  The professor suffered a severe head injury.  The face was completely covered in blood.  The ambulance arrived 10 minutes later, and the police forced themselves to wait half an hour.  By this time, the patient was already taken to the hospital and placed in intensive care.  When it became possible, he was transferred to the Institute.  Burdenko.  His condition was extremely serious, but doctors returned him to normal life and work. </p><h2>  Dean's work </h2><p>  In 2015, after twenty years of managing the Faculty of History, Sergey Karpov wished that this duty be removed from him.  Thanking the staff and students, the academician expressed a desire to complete the work begun, which will shed new light on the development of Byzantium, the Black Sea region and our country. </p><h2>  New book on faleristics (2015) </h2><p>  Faleristics is a science that studies the history of all signs of awards and distinctions.  The book, written by Karpov Sergey Pavlovich, became an exclusive edition. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Karpov Sergey Pavlovich" class="if" height="500" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/31953/1391746.jpg" width="348"></div>  It allows you to track how the award appears, what role it begins to play in society and how the social status of the person who received the award rises.  That is, it contains not just award signs of the world, but also a philosophical component.
