  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern research methods as the basis for proper diagnosis in medicine</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p><br>  Mankind has long been accustomed to all the benefits of our civilization: electricity, modern household appliances, a high standard of living, including a high level of medical care.  Today, people have at their disposal the most modern equipment, which easily detects various disorders in the functioning of organs and indicates all pathologies.  Today, mankind is actively using the discovery of Kondrat X-ray - X-rays, which were later named in his honor "X-rays".  X-ray research methods are widely used worldwide.  X-rays find defects in structures of a very different nature, scan passenger luggage, and most importantly, protect human health.  But a hundred and a few years ago, people could not even imagine that all this is possible. </p><p>  To date, research methods using x-rays are the most popular.  And the list of studies carried out using x-ray diagnostics is quite impressive.  All these research methods allow you to determine a very wide range of diseases and allow you to provide effective treatment in the early stages. </p><p>  Despite the fact that in the modern world new methods of researching human health and diagnostics are rapidly developing, radiological research methods remain at a strong position in various kinds of examinations. <br>  This article discusses the most commonly used radiological research methods: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Radiography is the most famous and popular method.  Used to obtain a finished image of a body part.  It uses x-rays on sensitive material; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fluorography - an X-ray image is photographed from the screen, it is carried out using special devices.  Most often, this method is used when examining the lungs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tomography is an X-ray imaging called layered.  Used in the study of most parts of the body and human organs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ X-ray - receive an x-ray image on the screen, this image allows the doctor to examine the organs in the process of their work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Contrast radiography - using this method, they study the system or individual organs by introducing special substances that are harmless to the body, but which make the target of the study clearly visible for x-ray studies (these are the so-called contrast agents).  This method is used when other, simpler methods do not provide the necessary diagnostic results. <br>  ‚Ä¢ In recent years, interventional radiology has developed rapidly.  It is about performing surgery that does not require a scalpel under <span>x-ray control.</span>  All of these methods make surgery less traumatic, effective, and cost-effective.  These are innovative methods that will be applied in the future in medicine and more and more improved. </p><p>  Radiodiagnosis is also one of the main ones where expert <span>research methods are</span> needed <span>.</span>  And sometimes - this is the only possible method of establishing a diagnosis.  Radiodiagnosis meets the most important requirements of any research: <br>  1. The technique provides high image quality; <br>  2. The equipment is as safe as possible for the patient; <br>  3. High informative reproducibility; <br>  4. Reliability of equipment; <br>  5. Low maintenance requirements. <br>  6. The cost-effectiveness of research. </p><p>  <span>X-ray research methods</span> , subject to dose control, are safe for human health.  The biological effect of small doses of x-rays, attributable to ionizing radiation, does not have any noticeable harmful effect on the body. And with additional shielding, the study becomes even safer.  X-ray studies will be used by mankind in medicine for many years to come. </p>
