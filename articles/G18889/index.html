Probably, the most fierce competition between different manufacturers takes place just the same in the budget segment.  Who is there only!  In a long battle, Russians, Chinese, Koreans, and British came together.  By the way, we‚Äôll talk about the apparatus of the latter today.  So, get acquainted: a smartphone under the name 4415 "Fly"! </p><h2>  Technical indicators </h2>

    <p>  "Fly 4415", the characteristics of which we give below, also applies to the budget segment of the smartphone market.  What can this modest device offer us, sold in mobile phone stores for 4,500 Russian rubles?  Small size, a processor with four cores operating at a clock frequency of 1.3 GHz, a 5-megapixel main camera.  However, the basis of the device lies precisely an interesting design with bright colors.  Here is the distinguishing side of the device.  Did the British manage to play this card?  Let's try to figure it out. </p><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2>

    <p>  The complete set 4415 "Fly" includes the following items.  In the box you can find the smartphone itself, a wired headset of 3.5 mm format, a brief instruction manual, warranty card, MicroUSB standard wire, and also a charger.  As we can see, the scope of delivery is almost minimal.  If there wasn‚Äôt a wired headset here, it would be so.  Although this budget model doesn‚Äôt need any additions, I guess. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  Exterior </h2>

    <p>  The Fly phone has the following sizes.  Its height is 131 millimeters, width and thickness, respectively, 65.9 and 8.3 millimeters.  With such indicators, the mass of the device does not exceed 124 grams.  If we talk about the quality of the assembly, then there are complaints, although not very serious.  Nevertheless, backlash is quite easy to detect when operating.  The issue of structural strength remains open.  The back panel is made of frosted plastic.  It has an average thickness. </p><h2>  Ergonomics </h2>

    <p>  This is exactly what the 4415 Fly can boast of.  Its body has a fairly small thickness (only 8.3 millimeters).  Probably, a similar indicator can still be called a feature rather than ordinary.  By the way, the device is launched on the smartphone market in three color options.  The first is blue, the second is white, and the third is black.  The user may ask: well, where is the promised interesting appearance here?  But the fact is that although there are not so many color combinations, the shades are really pleasing to the eye.  Take the same blue device.  This 4415 Fly phone has a black front in sturdy glossy plastic.  And the back panel is already blue, made of matte plastic, finished in a metallic shade.  It shimmers in sunlight. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  This move of the manufacturer creates interest among users who liked this model.  The rear panel of the device is for the front a kind of incomplete edging.  Therefore, it seems that the rest of the apparatus is recessed into the lid.  Something similar can be found in the design of ‚ÄúLumiy‚Äù.  In terms of design, the phone can safely claim a plus due to its unique design solution. </p><h2>  Front part </h2>

    <p>  Behind there is a peephole of the main camera.  It has a <span>resolution of</span> 5 million pixels.  There is also an LED flash, as well as a sound speaker.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that the camera eye sticks out of the plane of the body.  Just one millimeter, but it‚Äôs worth it to make sure nothing happens to him.  At the top end you can find two entrances at once.  This is a jack for a wired headset standard 3.5 mm and a connector standard MicroUSB.  On the left side is a paired key, designed to change the sound mode or volume.  On the opposite side is a button that allows you to lock the phone ‚ÄúFly‚Äù.  The buttons are strong, the play is minimal.  Here, the British manufacturer can say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Display </h2>

    <p>  He 4415 "Fly" has a diagonal of 4.5 inches.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmade using IPS technology.  Resolution is lame, of course, only 854 by 480 pixels.  Not so much.  The picture is displayed as FWVGA.  However, there are positive aspects.  In addition to IPS, OGS technology was used.  This means that there will be no air gap between the sensor and the display.  Due to this, the thickness of the display was minimized.  Which ultimately affected the responsiveness of the screen.  There is no particularly strong splitting of the picture into individual pixels, so inexperienced users can put up with such a lack of resolution.  But film fans will have much more difficult.  Among other positive qualities, bright and saturated colors can be noted, since the color rendition is at a high enough level.  The transmission angles are also good.  Perhaps this is all that I would like to say about the display of the Fly 4415 telephone, which we will provide reviews at the end of the article. </p><h2>  Operating system and software </h2><p>  It will be very useful here to mention that there is a custom firmware "Fly 4415".  It will help optimize the operation of the device.  We go further.  The smartphone is running an operating system of the Android family, version 4.4.2.  There is no shell from the manufacturer, so the user interface, as they say, is ‚Äúdefault‚Äù, without any frills.  The upper ‚Äúcurtain‚Äù will open quick access to recent actions and basic settings, as well as show the status of the smartphone. </p><p>  The keyboard is also factory, without add-ons.  You can change this using the appropriate applications by finding them in the Play Market service.  By the way, since we are talking about programs, we note the presence of built-in services from Google.  Two browsers are already preinstalled here.  One from Google, the other standard.  The latter, of course, is inferior both in the interface and in the speed of work.  And switching between existing tabs is not very convenient.  Regarding system settings, you won‚Äôt tell much, there are the following sections: ‚ÄúAccounts‚Äù, ‚ÄúWireless Networks‚Äù, ‚ÄúPersonal Data‚Äù, ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù and ‚ÄúDevice‚Äù. </p><h2>  Photographic features </h2><p>  As mentioned earlier, the smartphone is equipped with a rear camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels and a front camera with a resolution of 0.3 MP.  In addition to the main module, an LED flash is attached, an auto focus function on the subject, and digital zoom.  <span>The front camera</span> has a fixed focus.  What pleased us was that the settings were a real spectrum.  You can adjust the mode, focus, size of photos and their quality, work with the face recognition function. </p><p>  The rear camera shoots for its 5 megapixels quite well.  There is a saturation of colors, and brightness.  A surprise was the fact that good shooting was provided not only in the daytime, but also at night.  Things are much worse with photographs taken with the front camera.  It will not provide sufficient quality for selfies.  Its capabilities are only enough to call up the appropriate services via video. </p><h2>  Offline work </h2><p>  Due to the reduced thickness, the manufacturer had to sacrifice the battery capacity.  For its segment, it shows a capacity lower by 20 percent compared with direct competitors.  However, in order to somehow compensate for this drawback, the manufacturer decided to supply a more efficient and energy-independent processor.  So, if you wish, you can squeeze out a whole working day of use from a smartphone.  Here, the picture quality issued through insufficient screen resolution is also very helpful.  If it were higher, I would have to abandon the model because of the fast discharge.  "Fly 4415", whose battery is designed for 1650 milliampere-hours, can not boast of incredible results.  But he is quite coping with his main tasks. </p><h2>  Conclusion and reviews </h2><p>  What do customers of this device say in their reviews?  Firstly, the fact that the covers on the Fly 4415 is quite difficult to find, and this is becoming a problem.  Secondly, the device has a weak battery (offset by low processor consumption).  Thirdly, the speaker is made very strange, there are certain problems with it.  Fourth and fifth, this is a low resolution and a very small amount of RAM (only 512 megabytes).  But this is where the weaknesses end. </p><p>  And now about the benefits.  These include, for example, a thin and lightweight smartphone body.  Color solutions are not multifaceted, but very interesting.  The display has good color reproduction and more than acceptable viewing angles.  There is the possibility of integrating two SIM-cards.  Well, the composition ends with a berry - the price of the device, which is 5,000 rubles. </p>
