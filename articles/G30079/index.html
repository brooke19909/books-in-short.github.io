    <h2>  What is a coalition government </h2><p>  It is formed by several parties to obtain a majority in parliament with a <span>multi-party system of</span> government.  By itself, the word "coalition" is translated as an association that does not impose any obligations on the party, other than those relating to issues related to its direct creation.  After the goal of creation is achieved, it breaks up. </p><p>  The creation of a coalition government is also possible in times of emergency, both economic and foreign.  Often this happens during periods of hostilities, economic and political crises.  Why is it created?  For a broader reflection of public sentiment, an expanded spectrum of public opinions, a different vision of the situation is taken into account. </p><p>  The formation of a coalition government can only be with several parties.  This may include members of at least two of the most representative or all parliamentary parties, in which case they are usually called ‚ÄúGovernments of National Unity‚Äù, or selectively large parties create a ‚ÄúBig Coalition‚Äù. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div>

    <h2>  Positive and negative examples of coalition work </h2><p>  Coalition offices are not always created in difficult times for the country.  An example of this is Germany, where a coalition government has been working successfully for 16 years, drawn up on the basis of an agreement between the CSU-CDU (Christian Socialist Union - Christian Democratic Union) bloc and the Free Democratic Party.  Until today, the CSU-CDU coalition with the Social Democrats, led by A. Merkel, has successfully operated. </p><p>  The very fact of the formation of a coalition government gives rise to a lot of speculation and a certain mistrust, since the deal between the party leaders, after the elections took place, is suspicious in itself.  In addition, such a cabinet is considered unstable and vulnerable, since the refusal to work in the government of one of its members entails the resignation of the cabinet.  In the post-war period, more than fifty government offices were replaced in Italy. </p>

    <h2>  In which countries do such governments exist? </h2><p>  Coalition governments are formed more often in countries where parliament is elected using a proportional election system in which mandates are distributed in proportion to the votes cast for candidate lists.  Thus, small parties also get seats in parliament.  In Russia, such an election system existed from 2007 to 2011. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><p>  Coalition governments are traditionally created in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden and Norway, in the European monarchies: Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg.  In countries such as Germany, Italy, Israel, Ireland, Hungary, coalitions are represented by a small number of parties or the Big Coalition. </p><h2>  UK Coalition Office </h2><p>  In May 2010, for the first time in 70 years, the formation of the UK coalition government began under the leadership of D. Kemeron.  This was done at a time when the country was tired of political, economic and social problems.  Politicians had high hopes for the interaction of conservatives and Labor.  These parties are quite different, but they found a common language and ruled the country for about 7 years. </p><h2>  The Provisional Government of Russia 1917 </h2>

    <p>  At the beginning of March 1917, the Provisional Government (VP) was created in Russia.  It was formed on the basis of the agreement of the Provisional Committee of the Duma with the Socialist Revolutionary-Menshevik leadership of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers 'and Soldiers' Deputies.  Acted under the leadership of Prince Lvov G.E. It included representatives of the Cadet Party, Octobrists, Centrists, Socialist-Revolutionaries and others.  The decisive role in the EaP was played by the party of the bourgeoisie and landlords ‚Äî constitutional democrats (cadets). </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNativeAds-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  EaP recognized by the governments of the USA, Great Britain and France.  But it could not lead and solve the problems of a bustling country.  The only way out of this situation was the creation of a coalition interim government.  It would give a leader able to rally its members.  The dissatisfaction of the citizens of Russia with the work of the EaP led to constant protests, which caused even greater destabilization of society. </p><h2>  First coalition </h2>

    <p>  The constant discontent of workers, soldiers, tired of the war, led to mass protests.  All this triggered a series of crises.  They, in turn, led to the creation of the First Coalition Government in early May.  Foreign Minister P.N. Milyukov and Minister of War A.I. Guchkov were excluded from the previous composition, which were very unpopular among the people and the intelligentsia.  According to the agreement signed by the EaP with the Petrograd Soviet, it included 6 socialist ministers, most of them Mensheviks. </p><p>  Prince Lvov remained the chairman of the government, Social Revolutionary A. Kerensky was appointed Minister of the Army and Navy, and non-partisan M. I. Tereshchenko was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs.  It was a completely bourgeois government.  In this composition, the big bourgeoisie made small concessions, sharing power with the upper layer of the middle class.  Government policy has remained the same - war to a bitter end.  In words, the EaP promised a quick peace, but in fact it began unprepared offensive operations on the South-Western Front.  The country was dominated by devastation, which the ruling circles were not able to fight. </p><h2>  Second coalition </h2><p>  The inability of the first coalition cabinet to solve the country's problems in the context of ongoing military operations, the decomposition of armies, and the economic crisis led to his resignation and the creation of a second coalition government.  It was created in early August 1917.  A. Kerensky became its chairman and Minister of War.  As the Socialist-Revolutionaries proclaimed, it was a "government of salvation", but the country steadily continued to roll into the abyss of revolution. </p>

    <p>  According to the researchers, the goal of creating a second coalition was to establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.  To achieve this, you must first establish a military dictatorship that can restore order in the country.  This requires a strong army, which was not.  The dual policy of the government, which flirted with the proletarians, hiding its true goals, irritated the bourgeoisie, which did not fully trust the interim government.  Discontent was also expressed by the governments of the USA, England and France, requiring decisive actions to restore order in the country. </p><p>  All this led to the fact that the <span>Supreme Commander</span> L. G. Kornilov requested the government to transfer to the military all the factories, factories, the entire railway, all strategic facilities of the country, as well as introduce the death penalty.  Instead, the Minister of the Interior was given exclusive authority to combat the revolutionary movements and their leaders to severely suppress any protest of the people for their rights. </p><p>  But these half measures did not satisfy the reactionary military and the bourgeoisie.  On August 25, 1917, Kornilov raised a military insurrection, which was crushed by detachments of workers led by the Bolsheviks.  All this marked the beginning of a new crisis.  The tension increased every day.  The government was transferred to the Council of Five or the "Directory", it included five ministers under the leadership of Kerensky. </p><h2>  Third Coalition </h2>

    <p>  At the end of September, the <span>crisis situation</span> reached its climax.  The Bolsheviks clearly recognized the importance of the moment.  And from abroad Lenin returns.  A third coalition government is being formed.  It only resembled a coalition in form.  The leading role in it was played by the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Cadets, and industrialists.  The Provisional Council of the Republic was assembled, which was called upon to turn into a bourgeois parliament. </p><p>  The brutal suppression of disgruntled miners in the Donbass, punitive actions against rebellious peasants, measures taken against the Bolsheviks and members of the Councils of People's Deputies plunged the country into a severe crisis.  He made possible the October Revolution of 1917.  The reason for the Bolshevik victory was a close relationship with the people.  The interim government expressed interest in a handful of people, it was very far from the masses of people, one might say, on the other side of the barricades. </p>
